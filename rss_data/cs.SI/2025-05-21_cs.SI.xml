      <title>Pantheon: Personalized Multi-objective Ensemble Sort via Iterative Pareto Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide our milestone ensemble sort work and the first-hand practical experience, Pantheon, which transforms ensemble sorting from a "human-curated art" to a "machine-optimized science". Compared with formulation-based ensemble sort, our Pantheon has the following advantages: (1) Personalized Joint Training: our Pantheon is jointly trained with the real-time ranking model, which could capture ever-changing user personalized interests accurately. (2) Representation inheritance: instead of the highly compressed Pxtrs, our Pantheon utilizes the fine-grained hidden-states as model input, which could benefit from the Ranking model to enhance our model complexity. Meanwhile, to reach a balanced multi-objective ensemble sort, we further devise an \textbf{iterative Pareto policy optimization} (IPPO) strategy to consider the multiple objectives at the same time. To our knowledge, this paper is the first work to replace the entire formulation-based ensemble sort in industry RecSys, which was fully deployed at Kuaishou live-streaming services, serving 400 Million users daily.</description>

      <title>How Influencers and Multipliers Drive Polarization and Issue Alignment on Twitter/X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the polarization of the German Twittersphere by extracting the main issues discussed and the signaled opinions of users towards those issues based on (re)tweets concerning trending topics. The dataset covers daily trending topics from March 2021 to July 2023. At the opinion level, we show that the online public sphere is largely divided into two camps, one consisting mainly of left-leaning, and another of right-leaning accounts. Further we observe that political issues are strongly aligned, contrary to what one may expect from surveys. This alignment is driven by two cores of strongly active users: influencers, who generate ideologically charged content, and multipliers, who facilitate the spread of this content. The latter are specific to social media and play a crucial role as intermediaries on the platform by curating and amplifying very specific types of content that match their ideological position, resulting in the overall observation of a strongly polarized public sphere. These results contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms that shape online public opinion, and have implications for the regulation of platforms.</description>

      <title>UKTwitNewsCor: A Dataset of Online Local News Articles for the Study of Local News Provision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present UKTwitNewsCor, a comprehensive dataset for understanding the content production, dissemination, and audience engagement dynamics of online local media in the UK. It comprises over 2.5 million online news articles published between January 2020 and December 2022 from 360 local outlets. The corpus represents all articles shared on Twitter by the social media accounts of these outlets. We augment the dataset by incorporating social media performance metrics for the articles at the tweet-level. We further augment the dataset by creating metadata about content duplication across domains. Alongside the article dataset, we supply three additional datasets: a directory of local media web domains, one of UK Local Authority Districts, and one of digital local media providers, providing statistics on the coverage scope of UKTwitNewsCor. Our contributions enable comprehensive, longitudinal analysis of UK local media, news trends, and content diversity across multiple platforms and geographic areas. In this paper, we describe the data collection methodology, assess the dataset geographic and media ownership diversity, and outline how researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders can leverage UKTwitNewsCor to advance the study of local media.</description>

      <title>MindVote: How LLMs Predict Human Decision-Making in Social Media Polls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates new benchmarks to assess their ability to predict human decision-making in dynamic social contexts. We introduce MindVote, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs as "virtual respondents" in social media polling. MindVote comprises 276 poll instances with 1,142 data entry points from three platforms (Weibo, Reddit, Fizz), features bilingual content (Chinese/English), and covers five domains. Our evaluation of 18 LLMs demonstrates that top-performing models achieve an overall score of 0.74, an 80% relative improvement over traditional baselines, and then we analyze LLM world model bias with human preferences across societal bias dimensions. MindVote also uncovers significant disparities related to platform, language, and domain. We present strategies to optimize LLM performance and use LLM-as-a-Judge to assess reasoning in societal contexts. Furthermore, we show that temperature controls can reflect a way of human thinking diversity and opinion shifts in polling. In summary, MindVote offers a scalable framework for evaluating LLMs' social intelligence, with implications for understanding behavioral decision-making. Code and data will be available soon.</description>

      <title>Robustness Evaluation of Graph-based News Detection Using Network Structural Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14453v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising potential in fake news detection, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulations within social networks. Existing methods primarily establish connections between malicious accounts and individual target news to investigate the vulnerability of graph-based detectors, while they neglect the structural relationships surrounding targets, limiting their effectiveness in robustness evaluation. In this work, we propose a novel Structural Information principles-guided Adversarial Attack Framework, namely SI2AF, which effectively challenges graph-based detectors and further probes their detection robustness. Specifically, structural entropy is introduced to quantify the dynamic uncertainty in social engagements and identify hierarchical communities that encompass all user accounts and news posts. An influence metric is presented to measure each account's probability of engaging in random interactions, facilitating the design of multiple agents that manage distinct malicious accounts. For each target news, three attack strategies are developed through multi-agent collaboration within the associated subgraph to optimize evasion against black-box detectors. By incorporating the adversarial manipulations generated by SI2AF, we enrich the original network structure and refine graph-based detectors to improve their robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SI2AF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in attack effectiveness with an average improvement of 16.71%, and enhances GNN-based detection robustness by 41.54% on average.</description>

      <title>Counter-Inferential Behavior in Natural and Artificial Cognitive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the emergence of counter-inferential behavior in natural and artificial cognitive systems, that is, patterns in which agents misattribute empirical success or suppress adaptation, leading to epistemic rigidity or maladaptive stability. We analyze archetypal scenarios in which such behavior arises: reinforcement of stability through reward imbalance, meta-cognitive attribution of success to internal superiority, and protective reframing under perceived model fragility. Rather than arising from noise or flawed design, these behaviors emerge through structured interactions between internal information models, empirical feedback, and higher-order evaluation mechanisms. Drawing on evidence from artificial systems, biological cognition, human psychology, and social dynamics, we identify counter-inferential behavior as a general cognitive vulnerability that can manifest even in otherwise well-adapted systems. The findings highlight the importance of preserving minimal adaptive activation under stable conditions and suggest design principles for cognitive architectures that can resist rigidity under informational stress.</description>

      <title>Community Recovery on Noisy Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08251v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of community recovery in geometrically-noised stochastic block models (SBM). This work presents two primary contributions: (1) Motif--Attention Spectral Operator (MASO), an attention-based spectral operator that improves upon traditional spectral methods; and (2) Iterative Geometric Denoising (GeoDe), a configurable denoising algorithm that boosts spectral clustering performance. We demonstrate that the fusion of GeoDe+MASO significantly outperforms existing community detection methods on noisy SBMs. Furthermore, we show that using GeoDe+MASO as a denoising step improves belief propagation's community recovery by 79.7% on the Amazon Metadata dataset.</description>

      <title>Empathy Detection from Text, Audiovisual, Audio or Physiological Signals: A Systematic Review of Task Formulations and Machine Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00721v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empathy indicates an individual's ability to understand others. Over the past few years, empathy has drawn attention from various disciplines, including but not limited to Affective Computing, Cognitive Science, and Psychology. Detecting empathy has potential applications in society, healthcare and education. Despite being a broad and overlapping topic, the avenue of empathy detection leveraging Machine Learning remains underexplored from a systematic literature review perspective. We collected 849 papers from 10 well-known academic databases, systematically screened them and analysed the final 82 papers. Our analyses reveal several prominent task formulations - including empathy on localised utterances or overall expressions, unidirectional or parallel empathy, and emotional contagion - in monadic, dyadic and group interactions. Empathy detection methods are summarised based on four input modalities - text, audiovisual, audio and physiological signals - thereby presenting modality-specific network architecture design protocols. We discuss challenges, research gaps and potential applications in the Affective Computing-based empathy domain, which can facilitate new avenues of exploration. We further enlist the public availability of datasets and codes. This paper, therefore, provides a structured overview of recent advancements and remaining challenges towards developing a robust empathy detection system that could meaningfully contribute to enhancing human well-being.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Scope Experts at Test: Generalizing Deeper Graph Neural Networks with Shallow Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterophilous graphs, where dissimilar nodes tend to connect, pose a challenge for graph neural networks (GNNs). Increasing the GNN depth can expand the scope (i.e., receptive field), potentially finding homophily from the higher-order neighborhoods. However, GNNs suffer from performance degradation as depth increases. Despite having better expressivity, state-of-the-art deeper GNNs achieve only marginal improvements compared to their shallow variants. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we systematically demonstrate a shift in GNN generalization preferences across nodes with different homophily levels as depth increases. This creates a disparity in generalization patterns between GNN models with varying depth. Based on these findings, we propose to improve deeper GNN generalization while maintaining high expressivity by Mixture of scope experts at test (Moscat). Experimental results show that Moscat works flexibly with various GNNs across a wide range of datasets while significantly improving accuracy. Our code is available at (https://github.com/Hydrapse/moscat).</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Internet's Hidden Values: An Empirical Study of Desirable Behavior Using Highly-Upvoted Content on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major task for moderators of online spaces is norm-setting, essentially creating shared norms for user behavior in their communities. Platform design principles emphasize the importance of highlighting norm-adhering examples and explicitly stating community norms. However, norms and values vary between communities and go beyond content-level attributes, making it challenging for platforms and researchers to provide automated ways to identify desirable behavior to be highlighted. Current automated approaches to detect desirability are limited to measures of prosocial behavior, but we do not know whether these measures fully capture the spectrum of what communities value. In this paper, we use upvotes, which express community approval, as a proxy for desirability and examine 16,000 highly-upvoted comments across 80 popular sub-communities on Reddit. Using a large language model, we extract values from these comments across two years (2016 and 2022) and compile 64 and 72 $\textit{macro}$, $\textit{meso}$, and $\textit{micro}$ values for 2016 and 2022 respectively, based on their frequency across communities. Furthermore, we find that existing computational models for measuring prosociality were inadequate to capture on average $82\%$ of the values we extracted. Finally, we show that our approach can not only extract most of the qualitatively-identified values from prior taxonomies, but also uncover new values that are actually encouraged in practice. Our findings highlight the need for nuanced models of desirability that go beyond preexisting prosocial measures. This work has implications for improving moderator understanding of their community values and provides a framework that can supplement qualitative approaches with larger-scale content analyses.</description>

      <title>When Do LLMs Help With Node Classification? A Comprehensive Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Node classification is a fundamental task in graph analysis, with broad applications across various fields. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled LLM-based approaches for this task. Although many studies demonstrate the impressive performance of LLM-based methods, the lack of clear design guidelines may hinder their practical application. In this work, we aim to establish such guidelines through a fair and systematic comparison of these algorithms. As a first step, we developed LLMNodeBed, a comprehensive codebase and testbed for node classification using LLMs. It includes 10 homophilic datasets, 4 heterophilic datasets, 8 LLM-based algorithms, 8 classic baselines, and 3 learning paradigms. Subsequently, we conducted extensive experiments, training and evaluating over 2,700 models, to determine the key settings (e.g., learning paradigms and homophily) and components (e.g., model size and prompt) that affect performance. Our findings uncover 8 insights, e.g., (1) LLM-based methods can significantly outperform traditional methods in a semi-supervised setting, while the advantage is marginal in a supervised setting; (2) Graph Foundation Models can beat open-source LLMs but still fall short of strong LLMs like GPT-4o in a zero-shot setting. We hope that the release of LLMNodeBed, along with our insights, will facilitate reproducible research and inspire future studies in this field. Codes and datasets are released at \href{https://llmnodebed.github.io/}{\texttt{https://llmnodebed.github.io/}}.</description>
