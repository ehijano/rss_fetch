      <title>NuPECC Long Range Plan 2024 for European Nuclear Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nuclear Physics European Collaboration Committee ( NuPECC, http://nupecc.org/ ) hosted by the European Science Foundation represents today a large nuclear physics community from 23 countries, 3 ESFRI (European Strategy Forum for Research Infrastructures) nuclear physics infrastructures and ECT* (European Centre for Theoretical Studies in Nuclear Physics and Related Areas), as well as from 4 associated members and 10 observers.
  As stated in the NuPECC Terms of Reference one of the major objectives of the Committee is: "on a regular basis, the Committee shall organise a consultation of the community leading to the definition and publication of a Long Range Plan (LRP) of European nuclear physics". To this end, NuPECC has in the past produced five LRPs: in November 1991, December 1997, April 2004, December 2010, and November 2017.
  The LRP, being the unique document covering the whole nuclear physics landscape in Europe, identifies opportunities and priorities for nuclear science in Europe and provides national funding agencies, ESFRI, and the European Commission with a framework for coordinated advances in nuclear science. It serves also as a reference document for the strategic plans for nuclear physics in the European countries.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay in the interacting boson model based on the nuclear energy density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculations of neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) are carried out within the interacting boson model (IBM) that is based on the nuclear energy density functional (EDF) theory. The Hamiltonian of the IBM that gives rise to the energies and wave functions of the ground and excited states of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay emitter isotopes and corresponding final nuclei is determined by mapping the self-consistent mean-field deformation energy surface obtained with a given EDF onto the corresponding bosonic energy surface. The transition operators are formulated using the generalized seniority scheme, and the pair structure constants are determined by the inputs provided by the self-consistent calculations. The predicted values of the $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay NMEs with the nonrelativistic and relativistic EDFs are compared to those resulting from different many-body methods. Sensitivities of the predicted NMEs to the model parameters and assumptions, including those arising from the choice of the effective interactions, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Precision cross-sections for advancing cosmic-ray physics and other applications: a comprehensive programme for the next decade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray physics in the GeV-to-TeV energy range has entered a precision era thanks to recent data from space-based experiments. However, the poor knowledge of nuclear reactions, in particular for the production of antimatter and secondary nuclei, limits the information that can be extracted from these data, such as source properties, transport in the Galaxy and indirect searches for particle dark matter. The Cross-Section for Cosmic Rays at CERN workshop series has addressed the challenges encountered in the interpretation of high-precision cosmic-ray data, with the goal of strengthening emergent synergies and taking advantage of the complementarity and know-how in different communities, from theoretical and experimental astroparticle physics to high-energy and nuclear physics. In this paper, we present the outcomes of the third edition of the workshop that took place in 2024. We present the current state of cosmic-ray experiments and their perspectives, and provide a detailed road map to close the most urgent gaps in cross-section data, in order to efficiently progress on many open physics cases, which are motivated in the paper. Finally, with the aim of being as exhaustive as possible, this report touches several other fields -- such as cosmogenic studies, space radiation protection and hadrontherapy -- where overlapping and specific new cross-section measurements, as well as nuclear code improvement and benchmarking efforts, are also needed. We also briefly highlight further synergies between astroparticle and high-energy physics on the question of cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Acceptance dependence of factorial cumulants, long-range correlations, and the antiproton puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze joint factorial cumulants of protons and antiprotons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and point out that they obey the scaling $\hat{C}_{nm}^{p,\bar{p}} \propto \langle N_p\rangle^n \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^m$ as a function of acceptance when only long-range correlations are present in the system, such as global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations. This hypothesis can be directly tested experimentally without the need for corrections for volume fluctuations. We show that if correlations among protons and antiprotons are driven by global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations only, the equality $\hat{C}_{2}^{p} / \langle N_p \rangle^2 = \hat{C}_{2}^{\bar{p}} / \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^2$ holds for large systems created in central collisions. We point out that the experimental data of the STAR Collaboration from phase I of RHIC beam energy scan are approximately consistent with the scaling $\hat{C}_{nm}^{p,\bar{p}} \propto \langle N_p \rangle^n \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^m$, but the normalized antiproton correlations are stronger than that of protons, $-\hat{C}_{2}^{\bar{p}} / \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^2 &gt; -\hat{C}_{2}^{p} / \langle N_p \rangle^2$, indicating that global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations alone cannot explain the data. We also discuss high-order factorial cumulants which can be measured with sufficient precision within phase II of RHIC-BES.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the peak of the sound velocity for isospin imbalanced strongly interacting matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of a system composed of strongly interacting matter with an isospin imbalance, using as an effective description of QCD the two-flavor Linear Sigma Model with quarks. From the one-loop effective potential, including the two light quarks, pions and sigma contributions, and enforcing the restrictions imposed by chiral symmetry, we show that the development of an isospin condensate comes together with the emergence of a Goldstone mode that provides a constraint for the chiral and isospin condensates as a result of a non-trivial mixing between the charged pions and the sigma. We compute the thermodynamical quantities of interest and in particular the sound velocity squared, showing that it presents a maximum for an isospin chemical potential similar to the one reported by lattice QCD results and also with a similar height. Therefore, we attribute the origin of the peak of the sound velocity to the proper treatment of the Goldstone mode and to the non-trivial mixing of the charged pions and sigma in the isospin condensed phase.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for radiative corrections to charged-current processes II: Axial-vector coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the hadronic structure-dependent radiative corrections to the axial-vector coupling that controls single-nucleon weak charged-current processes -- commonly denoted by $g_A$. We match the Standard Model at the GeV scale onto chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order in the one-nucleon sector, in the presence of electromagnetic and weak interactions. As a result, we provide a representation for the corrections to $g_A$ in terms of infrared finite convolutions of simple kernels with the single-nucleon matrix elements of time-ordered products of two and three quark bilinears (vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar). We discuss strategies to determine the required non-perturbative input from data, lattice-QCD (+QED), and possibly hadronic models. This work paves the way for a precise comparison of the values of the ratio $g_A/g_V$ extracted from experiment and from lattice-QCD, which constrain physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>
