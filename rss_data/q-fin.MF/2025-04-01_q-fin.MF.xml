      <title>Robust No-Arbitrage under Projective Determinacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing from set theory, this article contributes to a deeper understanding of the no-arbitrage principle in multiple-priors settings and its application in mathematical finance.
  In the quasi-sure discrete-time frictionless market framework of Bouchard and Nutz, the equivalence between the quasi-sure no-arbitrage condition and the existence of a probability measure for which the local one-prior no-arbitrage condition holds and the affine hull of the support is equal to the quasi-sure support, all of this in a quasi-sure sense, was established by Blanchard and Carassus. We aim to extend this result to the projective setup introduced by Carassus and Ferhoune.
  This setup allows for standardised measurability assumptions, in contrast to the framework of Bouchard and Nutz, where prices are assumed to be Borel measurable, strategies and stochastic kernels universally measurable, and the graphs of one-step priors analytic sets.
  To achieve this, we assume the classical axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, including the axiom of choice (ZFC), supplemented by the Projective Determinacy (PD) axiom. In ZFC+PD the existence of such probability measures was assumed by Carassus and Ferhoune to prove the existence of solutions in a quasi-sure nonconcave utility maximisation problem. The equivalence with the quasi-sure no-arbitrage was only conjectured.</description>

      <title>The effect of latency on optimal order execution policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Market participants regularly send bid and ask quotes to exchange-operated limit order books. This creates an optimization challenge where their potential profit is determined by their quoted price and how often their orders are successfully executed. The expected profit from successful execution at a favorable limit price needs to be balanced against two key risks: (1) the possibility that orders will remain unfilled, which hinders the trading agenda and leads to greater price uncertainty, and (2) the danger that limit orders will be executed as market orders, particularly in the presence of order submission latency, which in turn results in higher transaction costs. In this paper, we consider a stochastic optimal control problem where a risk-averse trader attempts to maximize profit while balancing risk. The market is modeled using Brownian motion to represent the price uncertainty. We analyze the relationship between fill probability, limit price, and order submission latency. We derive closed-form approximations of these quantities that perform well in the practical regime of interest. Then, we utilize a mean-variance method where our total reward function features a risk-tolerance parameter to quantify the combined risk and profit.</description>

      <title>Optimal consumption under loss-averse multiplicative habit-formation preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a loss-averse version of the multiplicative habit formation preference and the corresponding optimal investment and consumption strategies over an infinite horizon. The agent's consumption preference is depicted by a general S-shaped utility function of her consumption-to-habit ratio. By considering the concave envelope of the S-shaped utility and the associated dual value function, we provide a thorough analysis of the HJB equation for the concavified problem via studying a related nonlinear free boundary problem. Based on established properties of the solution to this free boundary problem, we obtain the optimal consumption and investment policies in feedback form. Some new and technical verification arguments are developed to cope with generality of the utility function. The equivalence between the original problem and the concavified problem readily follows from the structure of the feedback controls. We also discuss some quantitative properties of the optimal policies, complemented by illustrative numerical examples and their financial implications.</description>
