      <title>Math behind everyday life: on distribution of "black days" and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our daily lives, we encounter numerous independent events, each occurring with varying probabilities over time. This letter delves into the scientific background behind the inhomogeneous distribution of these events over time, often resulting in what we refer to as ``black days'', where multiple events seem to converge at once. In the first part of the work we have performed an analysis involving $D$ independent periodic and random sequences of events. Employing the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) technique, we observed a clustering of sequences of events on a 2D manifold ${\cal M}$ at some large $D_{cr}$, which we interpret as the manifestation of ``black days'' and which occurs in a narrow interval around $D_{cr}$. We found that increasing the number of sequences within rather wide interval below $D_{cr}$ leads to a plateau in the clustering on ${\cal M}$. In the second part of the work we examined in detail clustering patterns of independently distributed $N$ points within the corners of a $D$-dimensional cube when $1\ll N&lt;D$. Our findings revealed that a transition to a single-component cluster occurs at a critical dimensionality, $D_{cr}$, via a nearly third-order phase transition. Finally, we have addressed the question ``How the infinite-dimensional space could look like?'' Considering the eigenvalue problem for the hyperspherical Laplacian $\nabla^2_D$ in the limit $D\to\infty$, we conjectured about the topology of a target space representing the hyperspherical layer.</description>

      <title>Point process analysis of geographical diffusion of news in Argentina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusion of information plays a crucial role in a society, characterizing the diffusion process is challenging because it is highly non-stationary and varies with the media type. To understand the spreading of newspaper news in Argentina, we collected data from more than 27000 articles published in six main provinces during four months. We classified the articles into 20 thematic axes and obtained a set of 120 time series that capture daily newspaper attention on different topics in different provinces. To analyze the data we use a point process approach. For each topic, $n$, and for all pairs of provinces, $i$ and $j$, we use two measures to quantify the synchronicity of the events, $Q_s(i,j)$, which quantifies the number of events that occur almost simultaneously in $i$ and $j$, and $Q_a(i,j)$, which quantifies the direction of news spreading. We also analyze the dataset using well-known measures to detect correlations and dependencies, computed from the raw time series: undirected measures (linear cross-correlation, $CC$, and nonlinear mutual information, $MI$) and directed measures (linear Granger causality, $GC$, and nonlinear Transfer entropy, $TE$). Our analysis unveils how fast the information diffusion process is, as high values of $Q_{s}$, $CC$, and $MI$ reveal pairs of provinces with very similar and almost simultaneous temporal variations of media attention. On the other hand, $GC$ and $TE$ do not perform well in this context because they often return opposite directions of information transfer. We interpret this as due to three main factors: the characteristics of the data, which is highly non-stationary, the characteristics of the information diffusion process, which is very fast and probably acts at a sub-resolution time scale, and the action of large media companies that act as global, external drivers of information dissemination.</description>

      <title>Unbending strategies shepherd cooperation and suppress extortion in spatial populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary game dynamics on networks typically consider the competition among simple strategies such as cooperation and defection in the Prisoner's Dilemma and summarize the effect of population structure as network reciprocity. However, it remains largely unknown regarding the evolutionary dynamics involving multiple powerful strategies typically considered in repeated games, such as the zero-determinant (ZD) strategies that are able to enforce a linear payoff relationship between them and their co-players. Here, we consider the evolutionary dynamics of always cooperate (AllC), extortionate ZD (extortioners), and unbending players in lattice populations based on the commonly used death-birth updating. Out of the class of unbending strategies, we consider a particular candidate, PSO Gambler, a machine-learning-optimized memory-one strategy, which can foster reciprocal cooperation and fairness among extortionate players. We derive analytical results under weak selection and rare mutations, including pairwise fixation probabilities and long-term frequencies of strategies. In the absence of the third unbending type, extortioners can achieve a half-half split in equilibrium with unconditional cooperators for sufficiently large extortion factors. However, the presence of unbending players fundamentally changes the dynamics and tilts the system to favor unbending cooperation. Most surprisingly, extortioners cannot dominate at all regardless of how large their extortion factor is, and the long-term frequency of unbending players is maintained almost as a constant. Our analytical method is applicable to studying the evolutionary dynamics of multiple strategies in structured populations. Our work provides insights into the interplay between network reciprocity and direct reciprocity, revealing the role of unbending strategies in enforcing fairness and suppressing extortion.</description>

      <title>Traffic Modeling and Forecast based on Stochastic Cell-Automata and Distributed Fiber-Optic Sensing -- A Numerical Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates accurate traffic modeling and forecast using stochastic cell-automata (CA) and distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS). Traffic congestion is a dominant issue in highways. To reduce congestion, real-time traffic control by short-term forecast is necessary. For achieving this, data assimilation using a stochastic CA model and DFOS is promising. Data assimilation with a CA enables us to model real-time traffic flow with simple processes even when rare or sudden events occur, which is challenging for usual machine learning-based methods. DFOS overcomes issues of conventional point sensors that have dead zones of observation. By estimating optimal model parameters that reproduce observed traffic flow in the simulation, future traffic flow is forecasted from the simulation. We propose an optimal model parameter estimation method using mean velocity as an extracted feature and the particle filter. In addition, an estimation methodology for the microscopic traffic situation is developed to set the initial condition of simulation for forecast in accordance with observation. The proposed methods are verified by simulation-based traffic flow. The simulation adopts the stochastic Nishinari-Fukui-Schadschneider model. The optimal model parameters are successfully derived from posterior probability distributions (PPDs) estimated from DFOS data. In contrast, those estimated from point sensors fail. The PPDs of model parameters also indicate that each parameter has different sensitivities to traffic flow. A traffic forecast up to 60 minutes later is carried out. Using optimal model parameters estimated from DFOS, the forecast error of mean velocity is approximately $\pm$10 km/h (percentage error is 18%). The error attains half of it when conventional point sensors are used. We conclude that DFOS is a powerful technique for traffic modeling and short-term forecast.</description>

      <title>Low Cost Carriers induce specific and identifiable delay propagation patterns: an analysis of the EU and US systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07656</link>

Abstract: The impact of air transport delays and their propagation has long been studied, mainly from environmental and mobility viewpoints, using a wide range of data analysis tools and simulations. Less attention has nevertheless been devoted to how delays create meso-scale structures around each airport. In this work we tackle this issue by reconstructing functional networks of delay propagation centred at each airport, and studying their identifiability (i.e. how unique they are) using Deep Learning models. We find that such delay propagation neighbourhoods are highly unique when they correspond to airports with a high share of Low Cost Carriers operations; and demonstrate the robustness of these findings for the EU and US systems, and to different methodological choices. We further discuss some operational implications of this uniqueness.</description>
