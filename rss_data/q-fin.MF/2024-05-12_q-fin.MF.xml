      <title>A Two-layer Stochastic Game Approach to Reinsurance Contracting and Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two-layer stochastic game model to study reinsurance contracting and competition in a market with one insurer and two competing reinsurers.
  The insurer negotiates with both reinsurers simultaneously for proportional reinsurance contracts that are priced using the variance premium principle; the reinsurance contracting between the insurer and each reinsurer is modeled as a Stackelberg game.
  The two reinsurers compete for business from the insurer and optimize the so-called relative performance, instead of their own surplus; the competition game between the two reinsurers is settled by a non-cooperative Nash game. We obtain a sufficient and necessary condition, related to the competition degrees of the two reinsurers, for the existence of an equilibrium. We show that the equilibrium, if exists, is unique, and the equilibrium strategy of each player is constant, fully characterized in semi-closed form.
  Additionally, we obtain interesting sensitivity results for the equilibrium strategies through both an analytical and numerical study.</description>

      <title>Approximating Smiles: A Time Change Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03776v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for analyzing the shape of implied volatility smiles The method is applicable to common semimartingale models, such as jump-diffusion, rough volatility, and infinite activity models. We use a moment-based formula to approximate the at-the-money skew and curvature. Additionally, we explicitly approximate the volatility skew and curvature under a time change framework. We derive characteristics of skewness and curvature and explain their implications for model selection based on the approximation. The accuracy of the short-term approximation results on models is tested via numerical methods and on empirical data. The method is then applied to the calibration problem.</description>
