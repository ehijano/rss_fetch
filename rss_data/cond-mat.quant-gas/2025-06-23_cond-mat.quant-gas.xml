      <title>Anti-Sisyphus driving in a matter-wave swing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates are an exceptionally versatile testbed for the investigation of physics phenomenon especially the well-known classical system. Here we use a degenerate Bose gas of sodium atoms confined in an optical dipole trap to simulate the matter-wave on the swing. Under the driving of Anti-Sisyphus process, the swing was excited successfully. Moreover, the spin echo like behavior and collective-mode excitation appear during the oscillation of matter-wave swing, manifesting the quantum nature of the system beyond its classical counterpart. Our work lays the foundation for matter-wave on the swing and more generally points to a future of practical applications for the motional quantum states linked with quantum information science.</description>

      <title>The many faces of rotating quantum turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum turbulence shares many similarities with classical turbulence in the isotropic and homogeneous case, despite the inviscid and quantized nature of its vortices. However, when quantum fluids are subjected to rotation, their turbulent dynamics depart significantly from the classical expectations. We explore the phenomenology of rotating quantum turbulence, emphasizing how rotation introduces new regimes with no classical analogs. We review recent theoretical, experimental, and numerical developments, and present new numerical results that map out distinct dynamical regimes arising from the interplay of rotation, quantization, non-linearities, and condensed matter regimes. In particular, we show the importance of distinguishing the dynamics of rotating quantum fluids in the slowly rotating, rapidly rotating, and low Landau level regimes. The findings have implications for the dynamics of liquid helium, atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, and neutron stars, and show how rotating quantum fluids can serve as a unique platform bridging turbulence theory and condensed matter physics revealing novel states of out-of-equilibrium quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Compressibility measurement of the thermal MI--BG transition in an optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder can be applied to transform conducting to insulating states by localizing individual quantum particles. The interplay between disorder and interactions in many-particle systems leads to a richer tapestry of quantum phase transitions. Here, we report the measurement in an ultracold lattice gas of a disorder-induced transition from a state with small disorder-independent compressibility to a state for which compressibility increases with disorder. At zero temperature this is the transition from a Mott insulator (MI) to a Bose glass (BG), both of which are insulating states. This transformation is observed using measurements of core compressibility. By determining how double occupancy changes with atom number, we identify the threshold disorder strength required to switch from disorder-independent MI-like to disorder-dependent BG-like compressible behavior.</description>

      <title>Mixed phases in a Fermi--Hubbard model describing altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an extension of the 2D Fermi--Hubbard model, which was recently introduced in [Das et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 263402 (2024)] and shown to describe altermagnetism that can be studied in cold atom systems. Using an updated Hartree--Fock method that can detect instabilities towards phase separation, we show that the model is in a mixed phase in large parts of the parameter regime at half-filling. We argue that the occurrence of a mixed phase is an indication of exotic physics which, in this model, occurs in parameter regimes accessible in cold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Formation of ultracold $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs Feshbach molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the creation of an ultracold gas of bosonic $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs molecules. We first demonstrate a cooling strategy relying on sympathetic cooling of $^{133}$Cs to produce an ultracold mixture. From this mixture, weakly bound molecules are formed using a Feshbach resonance at 361.7 G. The molecular gas contains $7.6(10)\times 10^3$ molecules with a lifetime of about 130 ms, limited by two-body decay. We perform Feshbach spectroscopy to observe several new interspecies resonances and characterize the bound state used for magnetoassociation. Finally, we fit the combined results to obtain improved K-Cs interaction potentials. This provides a good starting point for the creation of ultracold samples of ground-state $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs molecules.</description>

      <title>A Kaleidoscope of Topological Structures in Dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensates with Weyl-Like Spin-Orbit Coupling in Anharmonic Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) possesses characteristics different from the conventional isotropic s-wave interaction in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), the interplay of DDI with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and rotation may induce novel quantum properties. We systematically analyze the effects of the DDI, Weyl-like SOC, rotation and trap anharmonicity in the ground state of two-componen BECs. The interplay of these factors leads to a kaleidoscope of quantum states of quantum defects and quantum droplets in lattice, wheel and ring forms of distributions, with transitions of topology of density and a critical behavior in varying the parameters. We also show a bunch of exotic spin topological structures, including centric vortex surrounded by layers of spin flows, compound topological structure of edge defect, and various coexistence states of skyrmions with different topological charge. In particular, we find quarter skyrmions and other possible fractional skyrmions. Rashba-type SOC and Weyl-like SOC are compared as well. Our study implies that one can manipulate both the density topology and the spin topological structure via these tunable parameters in BECs. The abundant variations of the topological structures and particularly the revealed critical behavior may provide various quantum resources for potential applications in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Double Supersolid Phase in a Bosonic t-J-V Model with Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Rydberg tweezer arrays bring novel opportunities for programmable quantum simulations beyond previous capabilities. In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Single-shot thermometry of simulated Bose--Einstein condensates using artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise determination of thermodynamic parameters in ultracold Bose gases remains challenging due to the destructive nature of conventional measurement techniques and inherent experimental uncertainties. We demonstrate an artificial intelligence approach for rapid, non-destructive estimation of the chemical potential and temperature from single-shot, in situ imaged density profiles of finite-temperature Bose gases. Our convolutional neural network is trained exclusively on quasi-2D `pancake' condensates in harmonic trap configurations. It achieves parameter extraction within fractions of a second. The model also demonstrates zero-shot generalisation across both trap geometry and thermalisation dynamics, successfully estimating thermodynamic parameters for toroidally trapped condensates with errors of only a few nanokelvin despite no prior exposure to such geometries during training, and maintaining predictive accuracy during dynamic thermalisation processes after a relatively brief evolution without explicit training on non-equilibrium states. These results suggest that supervised learning can overcome traditional limitations in ultracold atom thermometry, with extension to broader geometric configurations, temperature ranges, and additional parameters potentially enabling comprehensive real-time analysis of quantum gas experiments. Such capabilities could significantly streamline experimental workflows whilst improving measurement precision across a range of quantum fluid systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum droplets in rapidly rotating two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate that rapidly rotating Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) near the lowest Landau level can self-organize into interaction-driven persistent droplet arrays. Inspired by this discovery, we investigate the formation and dynamics of single droplet and droplet arrays in rapidly rotating BECs. Guided by a rigorous theorem on localized many-body states for 2D interacting systems in a magnetic field, we construct single droplet and droplet arrays states which are shown to be stationary solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the rotating frame. The single droplet is shown to be dynamically stable, which underpins its role as the basic unit in a droplet array. The stability of the droplet arrays is demonstrated by their dynamic formation from a phase engineered initial condensate. Our study sheds light onto the nature of the droplet state in a rapidly rotating BEC and offers a new approach for generating and manipulating quantum droplet arrays through designing the initial condensate phase.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional sub-wavelength topological dark state lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general framework for engineering two-dimensional (2D) sub-wavelength topological optical lattices using spatially dependent atomic dark states in a $\Lambda$-type configuration of the atom-light coupling. By properly designing the spatial profiles of the laser fields inducing coupling between the atomic internal states, we show how to generate sub-wavelength Kronig-Penney-like geometric scalar potential accompanied by narrow and strong patches of the synthetic magnetic field localized in the same areas as the scalar potential. These sharply peaked magnetic fluxes are compensated by a smooth background magnetic field of opposite sign, resulting in zero net flux per unit cell while still enabling topologically nontrivial band structures. Specifically, for sufficiently narrow peaks, their influence is minimum, and the behavior of the system in a remaining smooth background magnetic field resembles the Landau problem, allowing for the formation of nearly flat energy bands with unit Chern numbers. Numerical analysis confirms the existence of ideal Chern bands and the robustness of the topological phases against non-adiabatic effects and losses. This makes the scheme well-suited for simulating quantum Hall systems and fractional Chern insulators in ultracold atomic gases, offering a new platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases with high tunability.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamical signatures of non-Hermitian boundary modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence features an interplay between the non-Hermitian skin effect and anomalous boundary-mode behavior. Whereas the skin effect is known to manifest itself in quantum dynamics in the form of chiral damping, it has remained less clear what impact the boundary modes may have. Here we derive experimentally accessible signatures of the boundary modes. We also establish clear criteria, based on the effective generalized Brillouin zone, that determine when bulk and boundary effects can be dynamically discerned using the Liouvillian separation gap. This leads to telltale signatures in both stable regimes -- where particle number remains finite -- and in the unstable regimes -- where a macroscopic boundary mode population occurs.</description>

      <title>Squeezing Towards the Heisenberg Limit with Locally Interacting Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a robust approach to spin squeezing with local interactions that approaches the Heisenberg limit of phase sensitivity. To generate the requisite entanglement, we generalize the paradigmatic two-axis countertwisting Hamiltonian -- akin to squeezing by parametric amplification -- to systems with power-law interactions, incorporating a Heisenberg coupling that aids in spreading correlations and protects the collective spin coherence. The resulting time to approach the Heisenberg limit scales sublinearly with particle number in 2D dipolar and 3D van der Waals interacting systems. Our protocol is robust to disorder and density fluctuations, and can be implemented in near-term experiments with molecules, Rydberg atoms, and solid-state spins.</description>

      <title>Resonantly enhanced superconductivity mediated by spinor condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving strong interactions in fermionic many-body systems is a major theme of research in condensed matter physics. It is well-known that interactions between fermions can be mediated through a bosonic medium, such as a phonon bath or Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here we show that such induced attraction can be resonantly enhanced when the bosonic medium is a two-component spinor BEC. The strongest interaction is achieved by tuning the boson-boson scattering to the quantum critical spinodal point of the BEC where the sound velocity vanishes. The fermion pairing gap and the superconducting critical temperature can thus be dramatically enhanced. We propose two experimental realizations of this scenario, with exciton-polariton systems in two-dimensional semiconductors and ultracold atomic Bose-Fermi mixtures.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Synthetic Gauge Fields in Ultracold Atoms via Spatially Engineered Vector Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15479v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms, typically manipulated by scalar beams with uniform polarization, have propelled advances in quantum simulation, computation, and metrology. Yet, vector beams (VBs) -- structured light with spatially varying polarization -- remain unexplored in this context, despite their enhanced tunability and broad optical applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme to generate synthetic gauge fields in ultracold atoms via VB-mediated coupling of internal states. This approach enables angular stripe phases across an expanded parameter range, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and facilitating experimental observation. We further present an all-optical method to create topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology governed by VB parameters. Our findings establish VBs as powerful tools for quantum control and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.</description>

      <title>Observing Bethe strings in an attractive Bose gas far from equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bethe strings are bound states of constituent particles in a variety of interacting many-body one-dimensional (1D) integrable quantum models relevant to magnetism, nanophysics, cold atoms and beyond. As emergent fundamental excitations, they are predicted to collectively reshape observable equilibrium and dynamical properties. Small individual Bethe strings have recently been observed in quantum magnets and superconducting qubits. However, creating states featuring intermixtures of many, including large, strings remains an outstanding experimental challenge. Here, using nearly integrable ultracold Bose gases, we realize such intermixtures of Bethe strings out of equilibrium, by dynamically tuning interactions from repulsive to attractive. We measure the average binding energy of the strings, revealing the presence of bound states of more than six particles. We find further evidence for them in the momentum distribution and in Tan's contact, connected to the correlated density. Our data quantitatively agree with predictions from generalized hydrodynamics (GHD). Manipulating intermixtures of Bethe strings opens new avenues for understanding quantum coherence, nonlinear dynamics and thermalization in strongly-interacting 1D systems.</description>

      <title>Multisetting protocol for Bell correlated states detection with spin-$f$ systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a multisetting protocol for the detection of two-body Bell correlations, and apply it to spin-nematic squeezed states realized in $f$ pairs of SU(2) subsystems within spin-$f$ atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Experimental data for $f=1$, alongside with numerical simulations using the truncated Wigner method for $f=1,\,2,\,3$, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol. Our findings extend the reach of multisetting Bell tests in ultracold atomic system, paving the way for extended quantum information processing in high-spin ensemble platforms.</description>

      <title>Effective range expansion with a long-range force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The validity range of the time-honored effective range expansion can be very limited due to the presence of a left-hand cut close to the two-particle threshold. Such a left-hand cut arises in the two-particle interaction involving a light particle exchange with a mass small or slightly heavier than the mass difference of the two particles, identified as a long-range force, a scenario encountered in a broad range of systems. This can hinder a precise extraction of low-energy scattering observables and resonance poles. To address this issue, we propose a new parameterization for the low-energy scattering amplitude that accounts for the left-hand cut. The parameterization is like a Pad\'e approximation but with nonanalytic terms from the left-hand cut and can be regarded as an extension of the effective range expansion. This parameterization is versatile and applicable to a broad range of systems with Yukawa-type interactions -- including particle, hadronic, nuclear, cold atom and quantum gas systems. In particular, it should be invaluable in understanding various near-threshold hadron resonances. As byproducts, we also show that the parameterization can be used to extract the couplings of the exchanged particle to the scattering particles, and derive expressions for amplitude zeros caused by the interplay between the short- and long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Vortex wall phase in fractonic XY-plaquette model on square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The XY-plaquette model is the most straightforward lattice realization of a broad class of fractonic field theories that host quasiparticles with restricted mobility. The plaquette interaction appears naturally as a ring-exchange term in the low-energy description of exciton Bose liquids, cold atomic gases, and quantum dimer models. Using first-principle Monte Carlo simulations, we study the phase diagram and the vortex dynamics in the XY-plaquette model on a square lattice in two spatial dimensions. In its minimal formulation, the model contains a ring-exchange plaquette term in two spatial dimensions and a standard XY-link term in the (imaginary) time direction. We show that the phase diagram of the minimal XY-plaquette model possesses two phases: (i) a disordered vortex-dominated phase in which a single percolating vortex trajectory occupies the whole 3d spacetime; (ii) a partially disordered phase in which the vortices become partially immobile, with their worldlines strictly confined to one or several infinite two-dimensional planes. The spatial positions and spatial orientations (along $x$ or $y$ axis) of these vortex domain walls appear to be spontaneous. Individual vortices form a disordered system within each vortex domain wall, so the fractal spacetime dimension of vortex trajectories approaches $D_f = 2$. We argue that the appearance of the vortex walls could be interpreted as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of a global internal symmetry in the compact XY-plaquette model.</description>

      <title>Conditional Entanglement Amplification via Non-Hermitian Superradiant Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, each experimental realization of a dynamical quantum system may yield a different measurement outcome, especially when the system is coupled to an environment that causes dissipation. Although it is in principle possible that some quantum trajectories lead to exotic highly entangled quantum states, the probability of observing these trajectories is usually extremely low. In this work, we show how to maximize the probability of generating highly entangled states, including maximally entangled cat states, in an ensemble of atoms experiencing superradiant decay. To this end, we analyze an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which governs the dynamics between the quantum jumps associated with photon emission. A key result of our study is that, in order to maximally enhance the probability of cat state generation, the initial state needs to be non-classical. This can be achieved e.g. with one-axis twisting in a cavity-QED system.</description>

      <title>Coherent control over the high-dimensional space of the nuclear spin of alkaline-earth atoms</title>

Abstract: We demonstrate coherent manipulation of the nuclear degrees of freedom of ultracold ground-state strontium 87 atoms, thus providing a toolkit for fully exploiting the corresponding large Hilbert space as a quantum resource and for quantum simulation experiments with SU(N)-symmetric matter. By controlling the resonance conditions of Raman transitions with a tensor light shift, we can perform rotations within a restricted Hilbert space of two isolated spin states among the 2F+1 = 10 possible states. These manipulations correspond to engineering unitary operations deriving from generators of the SU(N) algebra beyond what can be done by simple spin precession. We present Ramsey interferometers involving an isolated pair of Zeeman states with no measurable decoherence after 3 seconds. We also demonstrate that one can harvest the large spin degrees of freedom as a qudit resource by implementing two interferometer schemes over four states. The first scheme senses in parallel multiple external fields acting on the atoms, and the second scheme simultaneously measures multiple observables of a collective atomic state - including non-commuting ones. Engineering unitary transformations of the large spin driven by other generators than the usual spin-F representation of the SU(2) group offers new possibilities from the point of view of quantum metrology and quantum many-body physics, notably for the quantum simulation of large-spin SU(N)-symmetric quantum magnetism with fermionic alkaline-earth atoms.</description>

      <title>Forces on alkali Rydberg atoms due to non-linearly polarized light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trapped Rydberg atoms are highly promising candidates for quantum science experiments. While several approaches have been put forward to exert (trapping) forces on isolated Rydberg atoms, a widely applicable lossless technique is lacking. This paper proposes a robust versatile alternative technique that avoids lifetime compromising losses. Our proposal leverages the vector polarizability, which is induced by non-linearly polarized light and is shown to be several orders of magnitude larger than the usual scalar and tensor polarizabilities for commonly used alkali Rydberg series such as the $nS$, $nP$, and $nD$ series with principal quantum number $n$ as low as 30. The resulting force can be used to trap isolated Rydberg atoms over long times, which constitutes a key advance that is expected to impact quantum simulation applications, as well as to generate large light--Rydberg-atom hybrid states, which possess non-trivial position-dependent forces.</description>
