      <title>Magnetic sub-micron rods for quantitative viscosity imaging using heterodyne holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many processes in microfluidics and biology are driven or affected by viscosity. While several methods are able to measure this parameter globally, very few can provide high resolution viscosity images. Optimizing the locality of viscosity measurements demands smaller probes but also shorter lateral diffusion lengths and measurement times. Here, we propose to use sub-micrometer magnetic rods to perform high resolution viscosity imaging. An external magnetic field forces the oscillation of superparamagnetic iron oxide rods. Under linearly polarized illumination, the rotation of these highly anisotropic optical scatterers induces a blinking which is analyzed by heterodyne holography. The spectral analysis of the rotation dynamics yields a regime transition frequency from which the local viscosity is deduced. Holography provides a 3D optical field reconstruction and 3D superlocalization of the rods, which allows super-resolved viscosity measurements. Relying on the fast Brownian rotation instead of the slower translation component of nanorods therefore allows faster measurements and, crucially, smaller effective voxels for viscosity determination. We thus demonstrate that viscosity imaging is possible with a 0.5 (micron)^3 3D-resolution.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous observation of bright and dark polariton states in subwavelength gratings made from quasi-bulk WS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, layered crystals, dubbed van der Waals (vdW) materials, have attracted tremendous interest due to their unique properties in their single and few layer regimes. Their bulk counterparts, however, have only been recently explored as building blocks for nanophotonics as they offer promising properties such as high refractive indices and adherence to any type of substrates. We present here a variety of 1D grating structures composed of bulk transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) WS$_2$ as a highly tunable and versatile platform for observation of multi-level polaritonic system. The WS$_2$ excitons are simultaneously strongly coupled with the two grating photonic modes including the Bound State in the Continuum (BIC) of the lower energetic mode giving rise to polariton-BICs (pol-BICs). The polaritonic dispersion shapes can be varied in a straightforward fashion by choosing WS$_2$ films of different thicknesses and by changing the period of the grating.</description>

      <title>A topological route to engineering robust and bright supersymmetric laser arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, several proposals that leverage principles from condensed matter and high-energy physics for engineering laser arrays have been put forward. The most important among these concepts are topology, which enables the construction of robust zero-mode laser devices, and supersymmetry (SUSY), which holds the potential for achieving phase locking in laser arrays. In this work, we show that the relation between supersymmetric coupled bosonic and fermionic oscillators on one side, and bipartite networks (and hence chiral symmetry) on another side can be exploited together with non-Hermitian engineering for building one- and two-dimensional laser arrays with in-phase synchronization. To demonstrate our strategy, we present a concrete design starting from the celebrated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model to arrive at a SUSY laser structure that enjoys two key advantages over those reported in previous works. Firstly, the design presented here features a near-uniform geometry for both the laser array and supersymmetric reservoir (i.e. the widths and distances between the cavity arrays are almost the same). Secondly, the uniform field distribution in the presented structure leads to a far-field intensity that scales as N^2 where N is the number of lasing elements. Taken together, these two features can enable the implementation of higher-power laser arrays that are easy to fabricate, and hence provide a roadmap for pushing the frontier of SUSY laser arrays beyond the proof-of-concept phase.</description>

      <title>Degenerate phase-matching for multi-wavelength nonlinear mixing in aperiodic lattice lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographically-designed aperiodic lattices have proven to be an exciting engineering technique for achieving electrically switchable single- or multi-frequency emissions in terahertz (THz) semiconductor lasers. Here, we employ the nonlinear transfer matrix modeling method to investigate multi-wavelength nonlinear (sum- or difference-) frequency generation within an integrated THz (idler) laser cavity that also supports optical (pump and signal) waves. The laser cavity includes an aperiodic lattice, which engineers the idler photon lifetimes and effective refractive indices. The key findings are: (i) the nonlinear conversion efficiency reveals resonant enhancement at those idler frequencies where the photon lifetime is high; (ii) the resonant phase-matching process between the pump and idler waves has a one-to-one link with absence of any other dispersion, the lowest threshold, multi-wavelength defect modes of the aperiodic lattice laser have degenerate phase-matched pump frequencies. This set of results will potentially have a significant impact on the wavelength multiplexing in electronically switchable THz-over-fiber communication systems [1].</description>

      <title>A flexible framework for large-scale FDTD simulations: open-source inverse design for 3D nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient open-source python package for the inverse design of three-dimensional photonic nanostructures using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method. Leveraging a flexible reverse-mode automatic differentiation implementation, our software enables gradient-based optimization over large simulation volumes. Gradient computation is implemented within the JAX framework and based on the property of time reversibility in Maxwell's equations. This approach significantly reduces computational time and memory requirements compared to traditional FDTD methods. Gradient-based optimization facilitates the automatic creation of intricate three-dimensional structures with millions of design parameters, which would be infeasible to design manually. We demonstrate the scalability of the solver from single to multiple GPUs through several inverse design examples, highlighting its robustness and performance in large-scale photonic simulations. In addition, the package features an object-oriented and user-friendly API that simplifies the specification of materials, sources, and constraints. Specifically, it allows for intuitive positioning and sizing of objects in absolute or relative coordinates within the simulation scene. By rapid specification of the desired design properties and rapid optimization within the given user constraints, this open-source framework aims to accelerate innovation in photonic inverse design. It yields a powerful and accessible computational tool for researchers, applicable in a wide range of use cases, including but not limited to photonic waveguides, active devices, and photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>High-performance thin-film lithium niobate Mach-Zehnder modulator on thick silica buffering layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed photonic integrated circuits leveraging the thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform present a promising approach to address the burgeoning global data traffic demands. As a pivotal component, TFLN-based electro-optic (EO) Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs) should exhibit low driving voltage, broad operation bandwidth, high extinction ration, and low insertion loss. However, the pursuit of both maximal EO overlap integral and minimal microwave loss necessitates a fundamental compromise between driving voltage and operational bandwidth. Here, we demonstrate high-performance TFLN EO MZMs constructed on a 12-{\mu}m-thick silica buried layer using periodic capacitively loaded traveling-wave electrodes. In contrast to their counterparts utilizing undercut etched silicon substrates or quartz substrates, our devices exhibit streamlined fabrication processes and enhanced modulation efficiency. Notably, the fabricated MZMs attains a high modulation efficiency of 1.25 Vcm in the telecom C-band, while maintaining a low EO roll-off of 1.3 dB at 67 GHz. Our demonstration offers a pathway to achieving perfect group velocity matching and break the voltage-bandwidth limit in a simplified configuration suitable for volume fabrication, thereby laying foundational groundwork for the advancement of high-performance TFLN MZMs and benefiting the next-generation PICs in optical telecommunication, signal processing and other applications.</description>

      <title>Energy scaling in a compact bulk multi-pass cell enabled by Laguerre-Gaussian single-vortex beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report pulse energy scaling enabled by the use of Laguerre-Gaussian single-vortex ($\text{LG}_{0,l}$) beams for spectral broadening in a sub-40 cm long Herriott-type bulk multi-pass cell. Beams with orders ${l= 1-3}$ are generated by a spatial light modulator, which facilitates rapid and precise reconfiguration of the experimental conditions. 180 fs pulses with 610 uJ pulse energy are post-compressed to 44 fs using an $\text{LG}_{0,3}$ beam, boosting the peak power of an Ytterbium laser system from 2.5 GW to 9.1 GW. The spatial homogeneity of the output $\text{LG}_{0,l}$ beams is quantified and the topological charge is spectrally-resolved and shown to be conserved after compression by employing a custom spatio-temporal coupling measurement setup.</description>

      <title>Photonic Terahertz Phased Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phased arrays are crucial in various technologies, such as radar and wireless communications, due to their ability to precisely control and steer electromagnetic waves. This precise control improves signal processing and enhances imaging performance. However, extending phased arrays to the terahertz (THz) frequency range has proven challenging, especially for high-frequency operation, broadband performance, two-dimensional (2D) phase control with large antenna arrays, and strong phase modulation. Here, we introduce a photonic platform to realize a THz phased array that bypasses the above challenges. Our method employs 2D phase coding with 2-bit across a broad THz frequency range from 0.8 to 1.4 THz. The core of our design is a pixelated nonlinear Pancharatnam-Berry metasurface driven by a spatially modulated femtosecond laser, allowing precise phase control of THz signals. We showcase the effectiveness of our method through four proof-of-concept applications: single beamforming, dual beamforming, imaging and vortex beam generation. The realized photonic platform provides a promising pathway for developing broadband phased arrays in the THz regime.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical detection of the orbital angular momentum of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) have gained significant interest due to their unique properties, enhancing various communication systems and enabling applications such as the characterization of material or molecular chirality. Generating and detecting the OAM of light is thus crucial for numerous applications but poses challenges. This paper proposes a method utilizing stimulated Raman scattering to detect the magnitude of OAM. By exploring the strong Raman coupling between the pump and Stokes beams in higher-order Laguerre-Gauss modes, we demonstrate the discrimination of different optical vortex beams through nonlinear optical measurements. Numerical and experimental results support the feasibility of this approach, potentially advancing optical communication and sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Huygens metasurface supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum for terahertz gas sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a terahertz (THz) gas sensing platform based on all-dielectric metasurfaces that support quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BIC) with both electric and magnetic dipole resonances. The structure is designed to achieve the first Kerker condition, minimizing backscattering and maximizing light-matter interaction, which significantly enhances the sensitivity of the sensor. By optimizing structural parameters, this metasurface selectively resonates at characteristic absorption frequencies of target gases, facilitating detection even at low concentrations. We validate the approach using two gases with strong but distinct THz absorption profiles: hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Furthermore, the free-standing design maximizes gas interaction on both sides of the metasurface, eliminating substrate-induced losses and enabling a reduced physical footprint. Our findings indicate that this metasurface outperforms standard THz sensing approaches in terms of compactness and sensitivity per path length unit, obtaining the same detection threshold as sensing in free space with a path length between 2 and 3 orders of magnitude shorter, underscoring its potential for industrial applications where the available space for sensing can be limited.</description>

      <title>Self-compression of 5-$\mu$m pulses in hollow waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally and numerically investigate self-compression of pulses around 5 $\mu$m wavelength in a noble-gas-filled hollow waveguides. We demonstrate spectral broadening of multi-mJ pulses at 4.9 $\mu$m and associated pulse compression from 85 fs to 47 fs in the solitonic pulse compression regime. The self-compression resulted in sub-three-cycle pulses with 17 GW peak power in the 1-kHz pulse train. A numerical model is established and benchmarked against the experimental results. It allows further insights into the pulse compression process, such as scaling of the compression as a function of gas pressure and waveguide radius, and predicts pulse compression in sub-cycle regime for realistic input parameters.</description>

      <title>Confocal polarization tomography of dielectric nanocavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ polarization tomography to characterize the modal properties of a dielectric nanocavity with sub-wavelength mode confinement. Our analysis of reflection spectra shows that the Fano-lineshape depends strongly on the polarization in a confocal configuration, and that the lineshape can be transformed into a Lorentzian-like peak for a certain polarization. For this polarization setting, the background is almost fully suppressed in a finite range of frequencies. This enables us to identify another resonance that has not yet been experimentally reported for these nanocavities. Lastly, we use symmetry-forbidden polarizations and show that, surprisingly, the modal resonance features of the system remain visible.</description>

      <title>A compact scalable phase modulator with zero static power consumption for visible integrated photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical modulators in the visible regime have far-reaching applications from biophotonics to quantum science. Implementations of such optical phase modulators on a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible platform have been mainly limited to utilization of the thermo-optic effect, liquid crystal technology, as well as piezo-optomechanical effects. Despite excellent performance, the demonstrations using the thermo-optic effect and liquid crystal technology both suffer from limited modulation speed. Moreover, the demonstrations utilizing piezo-optomechanical effects, require very large footprints due to a weak modulation efficiency. Here, we report the demonstration of the first highly scalable compact CMOS-compatible phase modulator in the visible regime based on altering the refractive index of an indium-tin oxide capacitive stack over a Si${_3}$N${_4}$ waveguide through the charge accumulation effect. The implemented modulator achieves a two orders-of-magnitude larger bandwidth compared to thermo-optic and liquid crystal based counterparts and close to 3 orders-of-magnitude higher modulation efficiency with about two orders-of-magnitude smaller footprint compared to piezo-optomechanical modulators. The 50 ${\mu}$m long phase modulator achieves a modulation efficiency, V$_{\pi}$L, of 0.06 V.cm at a zero static power consumption and a 31 MHz bandwidth at 637.9 nm.</description>

      <title>High-power pulsed electrochemiluminescence for optogenetic manipulation of Drosophila larval behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) produces light through electrochemical reactions and has shown promise for various analytic applications in biomedicine. However, the use of ECL devices (ECLDs) as light sources has been limited due to insufficient light output and low operational stability. In this study, we present a high-power pulsed operation strategy for ECLDs to address these limitations and demonstrate their effectiveness in optogenetic manipulation. By applying a biphasic voltage sequence with short opposing phases, we achieve intense and efficient ECL through an exciplex-formation reaction pathway. This approach results in an exceptionally high optical power density, exceeding 100 microW/mm2, for several thousand pulses. Balancing the ion concentration by optimizing the voltage waveform further improves device stability. By incorporating multiple optimized pulses into a burst signal separated by short rest periods, extended light pulses of high brightness and with minimal power loss over time were obtained. These strategies were leveraged to elicit a robust optogenetic response in fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) larvae expressing the optogenetic effector CsChrimson. The semi-transparent nature of ECLDs facilitates simultaneous imaging of larval behaviour from underneath, through the device. These findings highlight the potential of ECLDs as versatile optical tools in biomedical and neurophotonics research.</description>

      <title>Angle-Invariant Scattering in Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are efficient and versatile electromagnetic structures that have already enabled the implementation of a wide range of microwave and photonic wave shaping applications. Despite the extensive research into metasurfaces, a rigorous and comprehensive understanding of their angular dispersion remains vastly under-explored. Here, we use the generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs) to model and analyze the angular dispersive properties of metasurfaces. Based on this theoretical framework, we demonstrate that a metasurface may exhibit either partial or complete co- and cross-polarized transmission and reflection coefficients that are angle-invariant, meaning that their amplitude, phase, or both remain unchanged with varying incidence angles. We show that these angle-independent responses exist only when specific conditions, given in terms of the metasurface effective susceptibilities, are met. Using the GSTCs formalism, we derive several of these conditions and illustrate their scattering properties. Among other findings, this analysis reveals that, contrary to common assumptions, nonlocality (spatial dispersion) does not only increase the angular dispersion of a metasurface, but may also be used to achieve complete angle-invariant scattering. Additionally, this work demonstrates that fully efficient extrinsic chirality is possible with a pseudochiral metasurface in a partially angle-invariant fashion. We expect our work to provide a general strategy for eliminating, or at least reducing, angular-dependent scattering responses of metasurfaces, which may prove instrumental for applications that are highly sensitive to the detrimental effects of angular dispersion.</description>

      <title>A Physical Interpretation of Imaginary Time Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering matrix $S$ linearly relates the vector of incoming waves to outgoing wave excitations, and contains an enormous amount of information about the scattering system and its connections to the scattering channels. Time delay is one way to extract information from $S$, and the transmission time delay $\tau_T$ is a complex (even for Hermitian systems with unitary scattering matrices) measure of how long a wave excitation lingers before being transmitted. The real part of $\tau_T$ is a well-studied quantity, but the imaginary part of $\tau_T$ has not been systematically examined experimentally, and theoretical predictions for its behavior have not been tested. Here we experimentally test the predictions of Asano, et al. [Nat. Comm. 7, 13488 (2016)] for the imaginary part of transmission time delay in a non-unitary scattering system. We utilize Gaussian time-domain pulses scattering from a 2-port microwave graph supporting a series of well-isolated absorptive modes to show that the carrier frequency of the pulses is changed in the scattering process by an amount in agreement with the imaginary part of the independently determined complex transmission time delay, $\text{Im}[\tau_T]$, from frequency-domain measurements of the sub-unitary $S$ matrix. Our results also generalize and extend those of Asano, et al., establishing a means to predict pulse propagation properties of non-Hermitian systems over a broad range of conditions.</description>

      <title>AutoSciLab: A Self-Driving Laboratory For Interpretable Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in robotic control and sensing have propelled the rise of automated scientific laboratories capable of high-throughput experiments. However, automated scientific laboratories are currently limited by human intuition in their ability to efficiently design and interpret experiments in high-dimensional spaces, throttling scientific discovery. We present AutoSciLab, a machine learning framework for driving autonomous scientific experiments, forming a surrogate researcher purposed for scientific discovery in high-dimensional spaces. AutoSciLab autonomously follows the scientific method in four steps: (i) generating high-dimensional experiments (x \in R^D) using a variational autoencoder (ii) selecting optimal experiments by forming hypotheses using active learning (iii) distilling the experimental results to discover relevant low-dimensional latent variables (z \in R^d, with d &lt;&lt; D) with a 'directional autoencoder' and (iv) learning a human interpretable equation connecting the discovered latent variables with a quantity of interest (y = f(z)), using a neural network equation learner. We validate the generalizability of AutoSciLab by rediscovering a) the principles of projectile motion and b) the phase transitions within the spin-states of the Ising model (NP-hard problem). Applying our framework to an open-ended nanophotonics challenge, AutoSciLab uncovers a fundamentally novel method for directing incoherent light emission that surpasses the current state-of-the-art (Iyer et al. 2023b, 2020).</description>

      <title>Ultrafast demagnetization in ferromagnetic materials: Origins and progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of ultrafast demagnetization in Ni thin films in 1996, laser-induced ultrafast spin dynamics have become a prominent research topic in the field of magnetism and spintronics. This development offers new possibilities for the advancement of spintronics and magnetic storage technology. The subject has drawn a substantial number of researchers, leading to a series of research endeavors. Various models have been proposed to elucidate the physical processes underlying laser-induced ultrafast spin dynamics in ferromagnetic materials. However, the potential origins of these processes across different material systems and the true contributions of these different origins remain challenging in the realm of ultrafast spin dynamics. This predicament also hinders the development of spintronic terahertz emitters. In this review, we initially introduce the different experimental methods used in laser-induced ultrafast spin dynamics. We then systematically explore the magnetization precession process and present seven models of ultrafast demagnetization in ferromagnetic materials. Subsequently, we discuss the physical processes and research status of four ultrafast demagnetization origins (including spin-flipping, spin transport, non-thermal electronic distribution, and laser-induced lattice strain). Since attosecond laser technique and antiferromagnetic materials exhibit promising applications in ultrahigh-frequency spintronics, we acknowledge the emerging studies used by attosecond pules and studies on ultrafast spin dynamics in antiferromagnets, noting the significant challenges that need to be addressed in these burgeoning field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) has emerged as a promising tool for real-time traffic monitoring in densely populated areas. In this paper, we present a novel concept that integrates DAS data with co-located visual information. We use YOLO-derived vehicle location and classification from camera inputs as labeled data to train a detection and classification neural network utilizing DAS data only. Our model achieves a performance exceeding 94% for detection and classification, and about 1.2% false alarm rate. We illustrate the model's application in monitoring traffic over a week, yielding statistical insights that could benefit future smart city developments. Our approach highlights the potential of combining fiber-optic sensors with visual information, focusing on practicality and scalability, protecting privacy, and minimizing infrastructure costs. To encourage future research, we share our dataset.</description>

      <title>Emergent Equilibrium in All-Optical Single Quantum-Trajectory Ising Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of multi-mode optical systems driven by two-photon processes and subject to non-local losses, incorporating quantum noise at the Gaussian level. Our findings show that the statistics retrieved from a single Gaussian quantum trajectory exhibits emergent thermal equilibrium governed by an Ising Hamiltonian, encoded in the dissipative coupling between modes. The system's effective temperature is set by the driving strength relative to the oscillation threshold. Given the ultra-short time scales typical of all-optical devices, our study demonstrates that such multi-mode optical systems can operate as ultra-fast Boltzmann samplers, paving the way towards the realization of efficient hardware for combinatorial optimization, with promising applications in machine learning and beyond.</description>

      <title>Microwave-to-Optical Quantum Transduction with Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for new gravity-like interactions at the sub-millimeter scale is a compelling area of research, with important implications for the understanding of classical gravity and its connections with quantum physics. We report improved constraints on Yukawa-type interactions in the $10\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ regime using optically levitated dielectric microspheres as test masses. The search is performed, for the first time, sensing multiple spatial components of the force vector, and with sensitivity improved by a factor of $\sim 100$ with respect to previous measurements using the same technique. The resulting upper limit on the strength of a hypothetical new force is $10^7$ at a Yukawa range $\lambda\simeq 5\;\mu$m and close to $10^6$ for $\lambda \gtrsim 10\;\mu$m. This result also advances our efforts to measure gravitational effects using micrometer-size objects, with important implications for embryonic ideas to investigate the quantum nature of gravity.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a surface lattice resonance (SLR)-based plasmonic nanolaser that leverages bulk production of colloidal nanoparticles and assembly on templates with single particle resolution. SLRs emerge from the hybridization of the plasmonic and photonic modes when nanoparticles are arranged into periodic arrays and this can provide feedback for stimulated emission. It has been shown that perfect arrays are not a strict prerequisite for producing lasing. Here, we propose using high-quality colloids instead. Silver colloidal nanocubes feature excellent plasmonic properties due to their single-crystal nature and low facet roughness. We use capillarity-assisted nanoparticle assembly to produce substrates featuring SLR and comprising single nanocubes. Combined with the laser dye pyrromethene-597, the nanocube array lases at 574 nm with &lt;1.2 nm linewidth, &lt;100 uJ/cm2 lasing threshold, and produces a beam with &lt;1 mrad divergence, despite less-than-perfect arrangement. Such plasmonic nanolasers can be produced on a large-scale and integrated in point-of-care diagnostics, photonic integrated circuits, and optical communications applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the design of an all-mirror wavefront-division interferometer capable of spectroscopic studies across multiple spectral ranges$\unicode{x2013}$from the plasma frequencies of metals to terahertz wavelengths and beyond. The proposed method leverages the properties of laser sources with high spatial coherence. A theoretical framework for the interferometer scheme is presented, along with an analytical solution for determining the far-field interference pattern, which is validated through both optical propagation simulations and experimental results. The practical implementation of the spectrometer, using cost-effective off-the-shelf components (knife-edge prisms for separation and recombination), is demonstrated. The system features ultra-broad optical bandwidth, high throughput, simple architecture, dispersion-free operation, and variable arm split ratio. These unique attributes make our approach a prospective alternative to standard Fourier transform spectrometer schemes, specifically tailored to laser-based scenarios. Further, the employed design inherently enables the measurement of the sample's dispersion. In the experimental section, we demonstrate the feasibility of spectroscopic measurements by coupling the system with a supercontinuum source with more than an octave-spanning range (1.5 $cm^{-1}$ - 4.4 $cm^{-1}$). As a proof-of-concept, an experimental demonstration is provided for various applied spectroscopic studies: transmission measurements of polymers (polypropylene) and gas (methane), as well as reflectance measurements of dried pharmaceuticals (insulin products on a metal surface).</description>

      <title>Transverse optical gradient force in untethered rotating metaspinners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanostructured dielectric metasurfaces offer unprecedented opportunities to control light-matter momentum exchange, and thereby the forces and torques that light can exert on matter. Here we introduce optical metasurfaces as components of ultracompact untethered microscopic metaspinners capable of efficient light-induced rotation in a liquid environment. Illuminated by weakly focused light, a metaspinner generates torque via photon recoil through the metasurfaces ability to bend light towards high angles despite their sub-wavelength thickness, thereby creating orbital angular momentum. We find that a metaspinner is subject to an anomalous transverse lateral optical gradient force that acts in concert with the classical gradient force. Consequently, when two or more metaspinners are trapped together in a laser beam, they collectively orbit the optical axis in the opposite direction to their spinning motion, in stark contrast to rotors coupled through hydrodynamic or mechanical interactions. The metaspinners delineated herein not only serve to illustrate the vast possibilities of utilizing optical metasurfaces for fundamental exploration of optical torques, but they also represent potential building-blocks of artificial active matter systems, light-driven micromachinery, and general-purpose optomechanical devices.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Frequency Fluctuation Super-Resolution Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inherent non-linearity of intensity correlation functions can be used to spatially distinguish identical emitters beyond the diffraction limit, as achieved, for example, in Super-Resolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging (SOFI). Here, we propose a complementary concept based on spectral correlation functions, termed Spectral Fluctuation Super-Resolution (SFSR) imaging. Through theoretical and computational analysis, we show that spatially resolving time-frequency correlation functions in the image plane can improve the imaging resolution by a factor of $\sqrt2$ in most cases and up to twofold for strictly two emitters. This improvement is achieved by quantifying the degree of correlation in spectral fluctuations across the spatial domain. Experimentally, SFSR can be implemented using a combination of interferometry and photon-correlation measurements. The method works for non-blinking emitters and stochastic spectral fluctuations with arbitrary temporal statistics. This suggests its utility in super-resolution microscopy of quantum emitters at low temperatures, where spectral diffusion is often more pronounced than emitter blinking.</description>

      <title>Inorganic electrochromic metasurface in the visible</title>

Abstract: Colour printing based on metallic or dielectric nanostructures has revolutionized colour science due to its unprecedented subwavelength resolution. Evidently, the evolution towards the active control of such structural colours with smart materials is in progress for real applications. Here we experimentally demonstrate a large colour gamut with high intensity and purity, as well as its switching on and off based solely on tungsten trioxide (WO3) cylindrical resonators. The strong resonances in the visible spectral range in these WO3 metasurfaces can be reversibly switched on and off due to its electrochromism by applying alternating voltages of +2.0 V and -0.3 V. Our approach opens up possibilities for the functional diversification of commercial smart windows, as well as the development of new display technologies in the future.</description>

      <title>Microwave-optics entanglement via coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microwave-optics entanglement plays a crucial role in building hybrid quantum networks with quantum nodes working in the microwave and optical frequency bands. However, there are limited efficient ways to produce such entanglement due to the large frequency mismatch between the two regimes. Here, we present a new mechanism to prepare microwave-optics entanglement based on a hybrid system of two coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres, i.e., a YIG sphere and a silica sphere. The YIG sphere holds a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction, while the silica sphere supports an optical whispering-gallery mode and a mechanical mode coupled via an optomechanical interaction. The two mechanical modes are close in frequency and directly coupled via physical contact of the two microspheres. We show that by simultaneously activating the magnomechanical (optomechanical) Stokes (anti-Stokes) scattering, stationary entanglement can be established between the magnon and optical modes via mechanics-mechanics coupling. This leads to stationary microwave-optics entanglement by further coupling the YIG sphere to a microwave cavity and utilizing the magnon-microwave state swapping. Our protocol is within reach of current technology and may become a promising new approach for preparing microwave-optics entanglement, which finds unique applications in hybrid quantum networks and quantum information processing with hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Spatial averaging for light reflection and transmission through cold atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically and computationally investigate the role that the spatial spread of atoms plays in the transmission and reflection of weak light from atom arrays. In particular, we investigate whether coherent wave functions for the atoms' positions leads to different results from a thermal distribution with the same spatial spread. We find that the coherence is not relevant when the light is weak and the electronic states evolve on time scales shorter than the oscillation period of the atoms in their traps. Full numerical calculations and derivations using the sudden approximation show that reflection and transmission agree with the simple averaging over atom positions for these conditions. For parameters outside these restrictions, the simple spatial averaging may lead to inaccurate results.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tunable Interband Collective Excitations in Biased Bilayer and Trilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective excitations of charged particles under the influence of an electromagnetic field give rise to a rich variety of hybrid light-matter quasiparticles with unique properties. In metals, intraband collective response manifested by negative permittivity leads to plasmon-polaritons with extreme field confinement, wavelength "squeezing", and potentially low propagation losses. In contrast, photons in semiconductors commonly couple to interband collective response in the form of exciton-polaritons, which give rise to completely different polaritonic properties, described by a superposition of the photon and exciton and an anti-crossing of the eigenstates. In this work, we identify the existence of plasmon-like collective excitations originating from the interband excitonic response of biased bilayer and trilayer graphene, in the form of graphene-exciton-polaritons (GEPs). We find that GEPs possess electrically tunable polaritonic properties and discover that such excitations follow a universal dispersion law for all surface polaritons in 2D excitonic systems. Accounting for nonlocal corrections to the excitonic response, we find that the GEPs exhibit confinement factors that can exceed those of graphene plasmons, and with moderate losses that would enable their observation in cryo-SNOM experiments. Furthermore, by electrically tuning the excitons energy into the Reststrahlen band of the surrounding hexagonal-boron-nitride, we demonstrate that strong coupling between the excitons and hyperbolic phonon polaritons can be achieved, and well-described by an electromagnetic transmission line model. These predictions of plasmon-like interband collective excitations in biased graphene systems open up new research avenues for tunable plasmonic phenomena based on excitonic systems, and the ability to control and manipulate such phenomena at the atomic scale.</description>
