      <title>Multicellular self-organization in Escherichia coli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Escherichia coli has long been a trusty companion, maintaining health in our guts and advancing biological knowledge in the laboratory. In light of recent findings, we discuss multicellular self-organization in E. coli and develop general ideas for multicellularity, including the necessity for multicellular dynamics and interpretation by dynamic graphs, applicable to both unicellular and multicellular organisms. In this context, we next discuss the documented behaviors of E. coli self-organization (rosette formation, multicellular extension, and attached dormancy) and two potential behaviors (internal communication and mating). Finally, by comparing the dynamic graphs for different communities, we develop principles relevant to the theory of multicellularity.</description>

      <title>Electron spin dynamics guide cell motility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diverse organisms exploit the geomagnetic field (GMF) for migration. Migrating birds employ an intrinsically quantum mechanical mechanism for detecting the geomagnetic field: absorption of a blue photon generates a radical pair whose two electrons precess at different rates in the magnetic field, thereby sensitizing cells to the direction of the GMF. In this work, using an in vitro injury model, we discovered a quantum-based mechanism of cellular migration. Specifically, we show that migrating cells detect the GMF via an optically activated, electron spin-based mechanism. Cell injury provokes acute emission of blue photons, and these photons sensitize muscle progenitor cells to the magnetic field. We show that the magnetosensitivity of muscle progenitor cells is (a) activated by blue light, but not by green or red light, and (b) disrupted by the application of an oscillatory field at the frequency corresponding to the energy of the electron-spin/magnetic field interaction. A comprehensive analysis of protein expression reveals that the ability of blue photons to promote cell motility is mediated by activation of calmodulin calcium sensors. Collectively, these data suggest that cells possess a light-dependent magnetic compass driven by electron spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Controlling tissue size by active fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Groups of cells, including clusters of cancerous cells, multicellular organisms, and developing organs, may both grow and break apart. What physical factors control these fractures? In these processes, what sets the eventual size of clusters? We develop a framework for understanding cell clusters that can fragment due to cell motility using an active particle model. We compute analytically how the break rate of cell-cell junctions depends on cell speed, cell persistence, and cell-cell junction properties. Next, we find the cluster size distributions, which differ depending on whether all cells can divide or only the cells on the edge of the cluster divide. Cluster size distributions depend solely on the ratio of the break rate to the growth rate - allowing us to predict how cluster size and variability depend on cell motility and cell-cell mechanics. Our results suggest that organisms can achieve better size control when cell division is restricted to the cluster boundaries or when fracture can be localized to the cluster center. Our results link the general physics problem of a collective active escape over a barrier to size control, providing a quantitative measure of how motility can regulate organ or organism size.</description>
