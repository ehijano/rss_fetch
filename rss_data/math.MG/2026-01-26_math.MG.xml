      <title>Covering a square by congruent squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to address the following problem: given a positive integer $n$, find the largest value $S(n)$ such that a square of edge length $S(n)$ in the Euclidean plane can be covered by $n$ unit squares. We investigate also the variant in which the goal is to cover only the boundary of a square. We show that these two problems are equivalent for $n \leq 4$, but not for $n=5$. For both problems, we also present the solutions for $n=5$.</description>

      <title>On the transportation cost norm on finite metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite metric graph $X=(V,E,\ell)$, where $V$ is endowed with the shortest path metric, we consider the transportation cost problem associated with the distance $d$ on $V$. Namely, for $f$ a function with total sum 0 on $V$, write $f=\sum_{a,b\in V}P(a,b)(\delta_a-\delta_b)$ where the transportation plan $P$ satisfies $P(a,b)\geq 0$ for $(a,b)\in V\times V$. The cost of $P$ is $W(P):=\sum_{a,b\in V}P(a,b)d(a,b)$ and the transportation norm of $f$ is $\|f\|_{TC}=\min_P W(P)$ where $P$ runs over all transportation plans for $f$.
  In this semi-survey paper, we give short proofs for the following statements:
  1)There always exists an optimal transportation plan supported in $V_+\times V_-$ where $V_+=\{x\in V: f(x)&gt;0\}$ and $V_-=\{x\in V: f(x)&lt;0\}$. If $X$ is a metric tree, we may moreover assume that this plan involves at most $|Supp(f)|-1$ transports.
  2) There always exists an optimal transportation plan supported in the set of edges of $X$.
  3) Better, there always exists an optimal transportation plan supported in some spanning tree of $X$.
  We use this to reprove known formulae for the transportation norm when $X$ is either a tree or a cycle.</description>

      <title>Affine thickness: Patterns and a Gap Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new notion of thickness for subsets of $B[0,1]\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ called affine thickness is defined; this notion of thickness is a generalisation of Falconer-Yavicoli thickness and is adapted to be used in the study of certain sets with affine cut outs. Thick sets are proven to be winning for the matrix potential game introduced in (arXiv:2508.11577) and as an application we can prove that for a thick set, there exists $M\in\mathbb{N}$ depending on the thickness of the set, such that the set contains a homothetic copy of every finite set with at most $M$ elements. Additionally, the author provides a counter-example to the gap lemma in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\geq 2$) for Falconer-Yavicoli thickness, stated in (Math. Z., 2022) proving this result does not hold in the generality stated. We go on to provide a gap lemma for affine thickness in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (for $n\geq 2$) under additional conditions to the classical Newhouse gap lemma.</description>

      <title>Shadow systems, decomposability and isotropic constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study necessary conditions for local maximizers of the isotropic constant that are related to notions of decomposability. Our main result asserts that the polar body of a local maximizer of the isotropic constant can only have few Minkowski summands; more precisely, its dimension of decomposability is at most $\frac12(n^2+3n)$. Using a similar proof strategy, a result by Campi, Colesanti and Gronchi concerning RS-decomposability is extended to a larger class of shadow systems. We discuss the polytopal case, which turns out to have connections to (affine) rigidity theory, and investigate how the bound on the maximal number of irredundant summands can be improved if we restrict our attention to convex bodies with certain symmetries.</description>

      <title>Sard properties for polynomial maps in infinite dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sard's theorem asserts that the set of critical values of a smooth map from one Euclidean space to another one has measure zero. A version of this result for infinite-dimensional Banach manifolds was proven by Smale for maps with Fredholm differential. It is well-known, however, that when the domain is infinite dimensional and the range is finite dimensional, the result is not true -- even under the assumption that the map is ``polynomial'' -- and a general theory is still lacking. Addressing this issue, in this paper, we provide sharp quantitative criteria for the validity of Sard's theorem in this setting. Our motivation comes from sub-Riemannian geometry and, as an application of our results, we prove the sub-Riemannian Sard conjecture for the restriction of the Endpoint map of Carnot groups to the set of piece-wise real-analytic controls with large enough radius of convergence, and the strong Sard conjecture for the restriction to the set of piece-wise entire controls.</description>

      <title>A necessary and sufficient condition for $k$-transversals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve a long-standing open problem posed by Goodman \&amp; Pollack in 1988 by establishing a necessary and sufficient condition for a family of convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to admit a $k$-transversal for any $0 \le k \le d-1$. This result is a common generalization of Helly's theorem ($k=0$) and the Goodman-Pollack-Wenger theorem ($k=d-1$). Additionally, we obtain an analogue in the complex setting by characterizing the existence of a complex $k$-transversal to a family of convex sets in $\mathbb{C}^d$, extending the work of McGinnis ($k=d-1$). Our approach is topological and employs a Borsuk-Ulam-type theorem on Stiefel manifolds. Finally, we demonstrate how our results imply the central transversal theorems of \v{Z}ivaljevi\'c-Vre\'cica and Dol'nikov in the real case and of Sadovek-Sober\'on in the complex case.</description>
