      <title>Optically Switching $\chi^{(2)}$ in Diamond Microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoinduced modification of second-harmonic generation mediated by nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres in a diamond cavity is observed. Excitation of NV centres quenches the device's second-harmonic emission, and is attributed to modification of $\chi^{(2)}$ by photoionisation from the negative (NV$^-$) to neutral (NV$^0$) charge states.</description>

      <title>Onset of wavenumber bandgaps via alternating Willis coupling signs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a methodology for inducing wavenumber bandgaps via alternating signs of Willis coupling. A non-reciprocal wave equation of Willis-type is considered, and the wave dispersion analyses are carried out via the transfer matrix method. Further, reversing Willis-coupling signs is proven to yield reciprocal band structures with wavenumber bandgaps, and their width and limits are analytically quantified. Similarities between materials with reversed-sign Willis coupling and bi-layered phononic crystals are noted, followed by concluding remarks.</description>

      <title>Dual-Axis Beam-Steering OPA with purely Passive Phase Shifters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a multi-layer optical phased array (OPA) designed for dual-axis beam steering on a silicon (Si) platform, utilizing only wavelength tuning. Our design eliminates the need for grating couplers, commonly required for dual-axis beam steering, thereby reducing energy losses due to substrate leakage. It also features the unique capability of achieving a positive or negative phase slope profile. This three-dimensional architecture enhances output efficiency by emitting light from the device edge, providing greater flexibility and improved performance in beam steering. This approach opens up new possibilities for on-chip photonic systems, enabling faster, more accurate, and broader beam steering range.</description>

      <title>Ptychoformer: A Physics-Guided Deep Learning Framework for Ptychographic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ptychographic imaging confronts limitations in applying deep learning (DL) for retrieval from diffraction patterns. Conventional neural architectures are optimized for natural images, overlooking the unique physical characteristics of diffraction data, including radial intensity decay and coherent information distributed in concentric rings. In this paper, we present Ptychoformer, a physics-guided DL framework for ptychographic imaging that aligns attention mechanisms and feature extraction with these diffraction physics properties through introducing a dual-branch architecture which accounts for both local and non-local dependencies from the patterns. It consists of a Polar Coordinate Attention (PCA) mechanism that is inspired by the Ewald construction in X-ray crystallography to enhance high-frequency component fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate Ptychoformer's superior performance across both simulated and real data in preserving fine details and suppressing artifacts. On simulated data, Ptychoformer achieves up to 5.4% higher PSNR and 4.2% higher SSIM for amplitude retrieval compared to existing methods. For real experimental data, it demonstrates up to 12.5% higher PSNR and 31.3% higher SSIM for amplitude retrieval. Notably, Ptychoformer maintains robust performance under limited training data and low overlap ratios, outperforming existing models.</description>

      <title>Optimizing for a Near Single-Mode Type-0 Optical Parametric Amplifier in Nanophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has recently emerged as a promising platform for integrated nonlinear photonics, enabling the use of optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) for applications in quantum information processing, precision metrology, and ultrafast optical signal processing. However, OPA waveguide designs have not yet achieved the phase-matching conditions for type-0 operation in a single spectro-temporal mode, limiting their use. We optimize the waveguide dimensions, poling pattern, pump wavelength, and pump pulse duration for high spectral purity, a metric for single-mode fidelity. We numerically demonstrate a nanophotonic OPA with a spectral purity of 0.982 in a TFLN waveguide. Through semi-classical simulations, we further demonstrate that in the optical parametric regime, where vacuum fluctuations at the input of the OPA can saturate the gain and deplete the pump, the macroscopic output of such a single-mode OPA can be utilized for an ultra-fast quantum random number generator. These results demonstrate a promising direction for integrated OPAs in a wide range of ultrafast quantum nanophotonics applications.</description>

      <title>Optical Levitation of Arrays of Microspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Levitated optomechanical systems are rapidly becoming leading tools for precision sensing of forces and accelerations acting on particles in the femtogram to nanogram mass range. These systems enable a high level of control over the sensor's center-of-mass motion, rotational degrees of freedom, and electric charge state. For many sensing applications, extending these techniques to arrays of sensors enables rejection of correlated noise sources and increases sensitivity to interactions that may be too rare or weak to detect with a single particle. Here we present techniques capable of trapping defect free, two-dimensional arrays of more than 25 microspheres in vacuum. These techniques provide independent control of the optical potential for each sphere. Simultaneous imaging of the motion of all spheres in the array is demonstrated using camera-based imaging, with optimized object tracking algorithms reaching a displacement sensitivity below 1 nm/$\surd$Hz. Such arrays of levitated microspheres may find applications ranging from inertial sensing to searches for weakly interacting particles such as dark matter.</description>

      <title>Theory of multicolor soliton microcombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general theory of multicolor soliton microcombs. These frequency combs require specially engineered dispersion and have an optical spectrum consisting of multiple spectral windows, centered at distinct frequencies. Our theory is based on a multiple-scale approach applied to the Lugiato-Lefever equation, and provides a framework to investigate different pumping configurations. For multi-frequency pumping, we predict a progressively lower pumping threshold as the number of spectral windows increases due to an enhancement of the effective nonlinear parameter. However, multi-frequency pumping is not a prerequisite for the formation of these combs and can emerge even with a single driving field. Our theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Continuous Varifocal Metalens Based on Phase-Change Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces have provided new opportunities for the realization of flat lenses, among which tunable metalenses have garnered considerable attention due to their flexible functionalities. In this paper, we present a continuously tunable metalens based on the phase-change material Sb$_{2}$S$_{3}$, which enables precise and continuous focal length control through the transition of states. Under the excitation of linearly polarized light at 1550 nm, phase compensation is provided by changing the crystallization state of the Sb$_{2}$S$_{3}$ nanopillars, allowing the focal length to continuously shift between 36 $\mu$m and 48 $\mu$m. At the same time, the metalens maintains a high focusing efficiency over 75%. This approach provides greater design flexibility and broader applicability across diverse applications. By reducing the reliance on polarized light sources, it enhances device integration and tunability, paving the way for new opportunities in the practical implementation of metalenses in advanced optical imaging and nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>High-ellipticity resonant below-threshold harmonic generation by a helium atom driven by a moderately intense elliptically polarized laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The below-threshold harmonic generation in the multiphoton ionization regime for a helium atom driven by the elliptically polarized laser field is studied numerically within the framework of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) models. It is shown that, regardless of the specific type of atomic potential and the model dimensionality, there is a set of laser frequencies, at which the harmonic generation efficiency increases dramatically with a simultaneous increase of their ellipticity. In these cases, the harmonic ellipticity can exceed the laser ellipticity by 2 or more times in absolute value. It is shown that the efficiency of harmonic generation in this interaction regime depends weakly or almost does not depend on the laser ellipticity. The pathways leading to resonant emission of intense harmonics with increased ellipticities are identified. The enhancement of the ellipticity of these harmonics is explained in terms of relative probabilities of resonant transitions in an elliptically polarized laser field for different values of the magnetic quantum number.</description>

      <title>Cross-spectral purity as a sign of spatiotemporal separability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the connection between cross-spectral purity and spatiotemporal separability of nonstationary (pulsed) scalar fields. It is found that in the case of complete coherence, there is a two-way relation between global cross-spectral purity and spatiotemporal separability. In other words, a coherent scalar field that satisfies Mandel's purity condition across the whole wavefront is spatiotemporally separable, and vice versa. In the case of partial coherence, the relation is not as clear, and completely breaks down for incoherent fields. We briefly discuss simple linear measurement methods that can reveal cross-spectral purity.</description>

Abstract: A programming library was developed, based on Stratton-Chu diffraction integrals for calculating reflected optical fields. Dipole-type focusing schemes with tunable number of beams and mirror placements were studied, considering the influence of phase distortion and aberrations. The intensity above $3\times 10^{26}$ W/cm$^2$ was found theoretically attainable in a system of 12 beams of 50 PW each with about 90 % of that value realistically achievable.</description>

      <title>Realization of joint weak measurement in classical optics using optical beam shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum weak measurements became extremely popular in classical optics to amplify small optical signals for fundamental interests and potential applications. Later, a more general extension, joint weak measurement has been proposed to extract weak value from a joint quantum measurement. However, the detection of joint weak value in the realm of classical optics remains less explored. Here, using the polarization-dependent longitudinal and transverse optical beam shift as a platform, we experimentally realize the quantum joint weak measurement in a classical optical setting. Polarization states are cleverly pre and post-selected, and different single and joint canonical position-momentum observables of the beam are experimentally extracted and subsequently analyzed for successful detection of complex joint weak value. We envision that this work will find usefulness for gaining fundamental insights on quantum measurements and to tackle analogous problems in optics.</description>

      <title>Watching lanthanide nanoparticles one at a time: characterization of their photoluminescence dynamics at the single nanoparticle level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lanthanide nanoparticles (LnNPs) feature sharp emission lines together with millisecond emission lifetimes which makes them promising luminescent probes for biosensing and bioimaging. Although LnNPs are gathering a large interest, their photoluminescence properties at the single nanoparticle level remain largely unexplored. Here, we employ fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and photoluminescence burst analysis to investigate the photodynamics of Sm and Eu-based LnNPs with single nanoparticle sensitivity and microsecond resolution. By recording the photoluminescence intensity and the number of contributing LnNPs, we compute the photoluminescence brightness per individual nanoparticle, and estimate the actual number of emitting centers per nanoparticle. Our approach overcomes the challenges associated with ensemble-averaged techniques and provides insights into LnNP photodynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate our microscope capability to detect and analyze LnNPs at the single nanoparticle level, monitoring both photoluminescence brightness and burst duration. These findings expand our understanding of LnNPs and pave the way for their advanced biosensing applications at the single nanoparticle level.</description>

      <title>Low-power 7-bit hybrid volatile/ nonvolatile tuning of ring resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable photonic integrated circuits are expected to play an increasingly important role to enable high-bandwidth optical interconnects, and large-scale in-memory computing as needed to support the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning technology. To that end, chalcogenide-based non-volatile phase-change materials (PCMs) present a promising solution due to zero static power. However, high switching voltage and small number of operating levels present serious roadblocks to widespread adoption of PCM-programmble units. Here, we demonstrate electrically programmable wide bandgap Sb2S3-clad silicon ring resonator using silicon microheater at CMOS compatible voltage of &lt; 3V. Our device shows low switching energy of 35.33 nJ (0.48 mJ) for amorphization (crystallization) and reversible phase transitions with high endurance (&gt; 2000 switching events) near 1550 nm. Combining volatile thermo-optic effect with non-volatile PCMs, we demonstrate 7-bit (127 levels) operation with excellent repeatability and reduced power consumption. Our demonstration of low-voltage and low-energy operation, combined with the hybrid volatilenonvolatile approach, marks a significant step towards integrating PCM-based programmable units in large-scale optical interconnects.</description>

      <title>Cogwheel phase cycling in population-detected optical coherent multidimensional spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integral procedure in every coherent multidimensional spectroscopy experiment is to suppress undesired background signals. For that purpose, one can employ a particular phase-matching geometry or phase cycling, a procedure that was adapted from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In optical multidimensional spectroscopy, phase cycling has been usually carried out in a "nested" fashion, where pulse phases are incremented sequentially with linearly spaced increments. Another phase-cycling approach which was developed for NMR spectroscopy is "cogwheel phase cycling," where all pulse phases are varied simultaneously in increments defined by so-called "winding numbers". Here we explore the concept of cogwheel phase cycling in the context of population-based coherent multidimensional spectroscopy. We derive selection rules for resolving and extracting fourth-order and higher-order nonlinear signals by cogwheel phase cycling and describe how to perform a numerical search for the winding numbers for various population-detected 2D spectroscopy experiments. We also provide an expression for a numerical search for nested phase-cycling schemes and predict the most economical schemes of both approaches for a wide range of nonlinear signals. The signal selectivity of the technique is demonstrated experimentally by acquiring rephasing and nonrephasing fourth-order signals of a laser dye by both phase-cycling approaches. We find that individual nonlinear signal contributions are, in most cases, captured with fewer steps by cogwheel phase cycling compared to nested phase cycling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a thin film thickness gauge based on the interferometric principle of Y-shaped optical fiber is proposed to achieve accurate measurement of film thickness. In this paper, the optical fiber, the interferometric principle and the film thickness calculation principle are introduced, and the interferometric thickness measurement system based on Y-shaped optical fiber is constructed. The system uses the special structure of Y-shaped optical fiber to transmit the optical signal generated by the light source to the surface of the thin film, and obtains coherent optical signals of different wavelengths through reflection and interference. The spectrometer is used to receive and interpret these interference signals, and the thickness of the film is calculated according to the wavelength difference of the peak positions of the adjacent stages, combined with the refractive index of the film. In the specific design, the paper elaborates on the design of each part of the instrument, including the selection and parameter setting of the light source, Y-fiber and spectrometer. Among them, the Y-shaped optical fiber, as the core component of the instrument, has the function of transmitting optical signals and detecting optical signals on the surface of thin films. At the same time, the paper also introduces the housing packaging and internal assembly process of the instrument to ensure the portability and stability of the instrument. The results show that the thickness gauge has high measurement accuracy and stability, which can meet the needs of practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on grating diffraction principle, optical fiber transmission principle and optical interference principle, a multi-functional portable optical measuring instrument is constructed in this paper. The optical measurement visualization spectrometer based on CCD photoelectric image sensor is designed and assembled. The "Y" optical signal transmission fiber optical path suitable for multi-function measurement is improved and designed. The multi-function optical measurement system is built by combining with remote controlled multi-color LED lights. The spectral analysis, solution concentration monitoring and film thickness measurement are realized. The experimental results show that the observable wavelength range of the spectrometer is about 340-1050nm and the resolution is 1nm. The solution concentration can be obtained by measuring absorbance with optical fiber spectrometer. The film thickness measuring instrument can accurately measure the thickness of the micron film, and the measurement accuracy can reach 1.25 {\mu}m. It is proved that the instrument integrates multiple functions, has high measurement accuracy and wide range, and realizes non-contact measurement.</description>

      <title>Classification of Single Photons in Higher-Order Spatial Modes via Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial modes are a promising candidate for encoding information for classical and quantum optical communication due to their potential high information capacity. Unfortunately, compensation of the wavefront upon propagation through the atmosphere is necessary to benefit from advantages spatial modes offer. In this work, we leverage the success of convolutional networks in denoising and classifying images to improve information transfer of spatial modes. Hermite-Gauss, Laguerre-Gauss, and Ince-Gauss modes are experimentally generated using single photons and imaged. A denoising autoencoder corrects for turbulence effects on the wavefront, followed by a convolutional neural network to classify mode orders. The model achieves a 99.2% classification accuracy across all modes, and Hermite-Gauss modes exhibited the highest individual mode accuracy. As the convolutional networks rely solely on intensity, they offer an efficient and cost-effective tool for optical communication systems in the single photon limit.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature exciton-polariton-driven self-phase modulation in planar perovskite waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical nonlinearities are crucial for advanced photonic technologies since they allow photons to be managed by photons. Exciton-polaritons resulting from strong light-matter coupling are hybrid in nature: they combine small mass and high coherence of photons with strong nonlinearity enabled by excitons, making them ideal for ultrafast all-optical manipulations. Among the most prospective polaritonic materials are halide perovskites since they require neither cryogenic temperatures nor expensive fabrication techniques. Here we study strikingly nonlinear self-action of ultrashort polaritonic pulses propagating in planar MAPbBr$_3$ perovskite slab waveguides. Tuning input pulse energy and central frequency, we experimentally observe various scenarios of its nonlinear evolution in the spectral domain, which include peak shifts, narrowing, or splitting driven by self-phase modulation, group velocity dispersion, and self-steepening. The theoretical model provides complementary temporal traces of pulse propagation and reveals the transition from the birth of a doublet of optical solitons to the formation of a shock wave, both supported by the system. Our results represent an important step in ultrafast nonlinear on-chip polaritonics in perovskite-based systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical resonators have shown outstanding abilities to tailor chemical landscapes through enhanced light-matter interaction between confined optical modes and molecule vibrations. We propose a theoretical model to study cooperative vibrational strong coupling in an open quantum system. The non-equilibrium stochastic molecular dynamics in an optical cavity with an auxiliary ensemble is investigated. It shows that coupling with a cavity mode introduces an additional colored noise and a negative feedback, both of which enable control over thermalization rates (i.e. the lifetime of excitation) of reactive molecules. Our work offers a pathway to steer stability of chemical bonds for chemical reactivity under cooperative vibrational strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Terabit-class coherent communications enabled by an integrated photonics erbium doped amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent technologies have revolutionized optical communications, driving the capacity per fiber to multi-terabit per second (Tb/s) in combination with wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). With an ever-increasing deployment density of coherent systems, the demand for highly integrated WDM coherent transceivers has been rising. While tremendous progress has been made on silicon photonics compatible high-speed modulation and photodetection on chip, a solution for monolithically integrable amplifier with high gain and output power remains a challenge. Recently, an erbium doped waveguide amplifier based on ultra-low loss silicon nitride waveguides has demonstrated gain and output power levels potentially suitable for Terabit class coherent communications. Here, we demonstrate a WDM coherent system enabled by this integrated photonic amplification solution. The system uses the waveguide amplifier as a booster amplifier of 16 WDM signals each carrying a net data rate of 1.6 Tb/s, achieving 25.6-Tb/s net capacity over 81-km fiber transmission. Our results highlight a fully integrated solution for highly parallel coherent transceivers including amplification, that has the potential to transform future optical communications.</description>

      <title>All-optical polarization control and routing by nonlinear interferometry at the nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces are rapidly establishing as key-enabling platforms for nanophotonics applications. Along with the ability of taming light in subwavelength thicknesses, they can feature multiple functionalities in one device. The generation and control of light polarization by metasurfaces already provided a route towards ultracompact polarimetry devices in the linear regime. If translated to the nonlinear optical regime it may become a key-enabling tool in nonlinear imaging, optical holography and sensing. Here, we report the experimental ultrafast all-optical polarization modulation of upconverted light by all-dielectric metasurfaces via nonlinear interferometry. By controlling the relative phase between a pump beam at $\omega$ and its frequency-double replica at 2$\omega$, we can set the phase relation between two frequency-degenerate upconverted processes at 3$\omega$ $-$ Sum-Frequency Generation (SFG) and Third-Harmonic Generation (THG) $-$ stemming from an AlGaAs metasurface. By exploiting the opposite parity of the two nonlinear process and tuning their relative powers, we can achieve modulation of the polarization states of the light emitted at 3$\omega$ between linear and circular states with a degree of circular polarization (DOCP) up to 83$\%$. In particular, circularly polarized light features opposite handedness symmetrically located in the Fourier space, at coincidence with the first diffraction orders of the metasurface. Moreover, by toggling the phase delay by $\pi$, the handedness can be fully switched between the diffraction. Our work adds an additional layer of modulation in polarization beyond intensity to all-optical routing with precise phase control. The capability to route circular polarization states in the k-space holds significant potential for chiral sensing and advanced imaging techniques.</description>

Abstract: Characterizing anomalous diffusion is crucial in order to understand the evolution of complex stochastic systems, from molecular interactions to cellular dynamics. In this work, we characterize the performances regarding such a task of Bi-Mamba, a novel state-space deep-learning architecture articulated with a bidirectional scan mechanism. Our implementation is tested on the AnDi-2 challenge datasets among others. Designed for regression tasks, the Bi-Mamba architecture infers efficiently the effective diffusion coefficient and anomalous exponent from single, short trajectories. As such, our results indicate the potential practical use of the Bi-Mamba architecture for anomalousdiffusion characterization.</description>

      <title>Atomic-optical interferometry in fractured loops: a general solution for Rydberg radio frequency receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of novel radio frequency atomic receivers brings attention to the theoretical description of atom-light interactions in sophisticated, multilevel schemes. Of special interest, are the schemes where several interaction paths interfere with each other, bringing about the phase-sensitive measurement of detected radio fields. In the theoretical modeling of those cases, the common assumptions are often insufficient to determine the boundary detection parameters, such as receiving bandwidth or saturation point, critical for practical considerations of atomic sensing technology. This evokes the resurfacing of a long-standing problem on how to describe an atom-light interaction in a fractured loop. In such a case, the quantum steady state is not achieved even with constant, continuous interactions. Here we propose a method for modeling of such a system, basing our approach on the Fourier expansion of a non-equilibrium steady state. The proposed solution is both numerically effective and able to predict edge cases, such as saturation. Furthermore, as an example, we employ this method to provide a complete description of a Rydberg superheterodyne receiver, obtaining the boundary parameters describing the operation of this atomic detector.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal imaging of nonlinear optics in van der Waals waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) semiconductors have emerged as promising platforms for efficient nonlinear optical conversion, including harmonic and entangled photon generation. Although major efforts are devoted to integrating vdW materials in nanoscale waveguides for miniaturization, the realization of efficient, phase-matched conversion in these platforms remains challenging. To address this challenge, we develop a far-field ultrafast imaging method to track the propagation of both fundamental and harmonic waves within vdW waveguides with extreme spatiotemporal resolution. Our approach allows systematic optimization of nonlinear conversion by determining the phase-matching angles, mode profiles, and losses in waveguides without a priori knowledge of material properties. We focus on light propagation in slab waveguides of rhombohedral-stacked MoS2, an emerging vdW semiconductor with giant nonlinear susceptibility. Our results reveal that these waveguides support birefringent phase-matching, demonstrating the material's potential for efficient on-chip nonlinear optics. This work establishes spatiotemporal imaging of light propagation in waveguides as an incisive and general method to identify new materials and architectures for efficient nonlinear nanophotonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically study the filamentation of femtosecond vector beams with spatially varying polarization profiles in air. The vector beams include azimuthal, radial, and spiral cylindrical vector beams (CVBs), as well as low-order Full Poincar\'e beams (FPBs) with star and lemon polarization topologies. Comparing the filamentation of CVBs to that of a circularly polarized Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam, we found that CVBs undergo filamentation more easily due to their more effective nonlinear focusing, in contrast to the LG beam. In the case of low-order FPBs, we examined the role of the constituent orthogonally polarized spatial modes in their filamentation process. Our findings revealed that the Gaussian mode within these beams primarily contributes to their filamentation. Additionally, when compared to a linearly polarized Gaussian beam, star and lemon FPBs displayed greater resistance to filamentation. Furthermore, we investigated the evolution of polarization profiles of the beams during filamentation. We observed that the polarization profiles of CVBs remained largely unchanged. In contrast, the polarization profiles of the FPBs underwent significant non-uniform changes due to differences in accumulated nonlinear phase and Gouy phase among the constituent modes.</description>

      <title>Polarization Purity and Dispersion Characteristics of Nested Antiresonant Nodeless Hollow-Core Optical Fiber at Near- and Short-wave-IR Wavelengths for Quantum Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in quantum communication and sensing require improved optical transmission that ensures excellent state purity and reduced losses. While free-space optical communication is often preferred, its use becomes challenging over long distances due to beam divergence, atmospheric absorption, scattering, and turbulence, among other factors. In the case of polarization encoding, traditional silica-core optical fibers, though commonly used, struggle with maintaining state purity due to stress-induced birefringence. Hollow core fibers, and in particular nested antiresonant nodeless fibers (NANF), have recently been shown to possess unparalleled polarization purity with minimal birefringence in the telecom wavelength range using continuous-wave (CW) laser light. Here, we investigate a 1-km NANF designed for wavelengths up to the 2-$\mu$m waveband. Our results show a polarization extinction ratio between ~-30 dB and ~-70 dB across the 1520 to 1620 nm range in CW operation, peaking at ~-60 dB at the 2-$\mu$m design wavelength. Our study also includes the pulsed regime, providing insights beyond previous CW studies, e.g., on the propagation of broadband quantum states of light in NANF at 2 $\mu$m, and corresponding extinction-ratio-limited quantum bit error rates (QBER) for prepare-measure and entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Our findings highlight the potential of these fibers in emerging applications such as QKD, pointing towards a new standard in optical quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A negative index metamaterial driven by phonons on a ZnO platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Negative index metamaterials (NIMs) can be achieved with uniaxial hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) featuring $\epsilon_{parallel}&gt;0$ and $\epsilon_{perpendicular}&lt;0$. This type of approach has been traditionally realized using stacked doped/undoped semiconductor layers. Only recently surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) have emerged as a promising low-loss alternative to surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). Despite this advantage, the SPhP-based approach has been underexplored due to the challenges associated with ensuring high crystal quality in the heterostructure when using alloys with different phonon frequencies. In this work, we design a phononic-driven NIM using a ZnO/(Zn,Mg)O heterostructure, demonstrating control over its hyperbolic behavior through the precise selection of the Mg content and the relative layer thicknesses. Our study shows that increasing the Mg content in the ternary layers enhances the type I behavior, and that the optimal layer thickness varies depending on the Mg content. After analyzing the conditions for achieving type I hyperbolic dispersion, we experimentally demonstrate this concept with a sample featuring equal layer thicknesses and a 32% Mg concentration. We characterize the structure by means of polarized reflectance spectroscopy and use attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy to report the presence of a SPhP mode located within the type I hyperbolic region. By employing the transfer matrix method, we demonstrate that this mode exhibits negative frequency dispersion, a hallmark of type I hyperbolic modes, and isofrequency curve calculations further confirm this behavior. Controlling the design of a phononic hyperbolic type I metamaterial lays the groundwork for exploring its potential applications in attaining low-loss, sub-diffraction-limited optical modes using SPhP excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibility of exciting stationary solitons due to the Brewster effect is investigated. The analysis is performed by computing the transmission coefficient of an electromagnetic monochromatic wave obliquely incident on the optical system and linearly polarized with the transverse-electric polarization. The optical system is supposed to be surrounded by a vacuum. Two different optical systems are studied. First, the system under consideration is assumed to be composed of the junction of a single dispersive layer with a linear electromagnetic response and a single nonlinear layer exhibiting Kerr nonlinearity. The obtained results suggest the excitation of stationary solitons in the nonlinear layer induced by the occurrence of the Brewster phenomenon in the linear medium. The second system is considered as a single Kerr nonlinear layer. The Brewster effect is observed for both self-focusing and self-defocusing nonlinearities, which leads to the excitation of soliton states within the nonlinear layer. The Brewster-angle dependence of the intensity of the incident electromagnetic wave is also shown. Finally, the excitation of omnidirectional solitons in the case of single nonlinear layers is discussed. It is shown that matching the magnetic permeability of the surrounding medium and the nonlinear layer leads to maximum transmission states, independent of the incidence angle, for the input-intensity value that causes the homogenization of the electric permittivity.</description>

Abstract: Polarisation imaging is used to distinguish objects and surface characteristics that are otherwise not visible with black-and-white or colour imaging. Full-Stokes polarisation imaging allows complex image processing like water glint filtering, which is particularly useful for remote Earth observations. The relatively low cost of small-satellites makes their use in remote sensing more accessible. However, their size and weight limitations cannot accommodate the bulky conventional optics needed for full-Stokes polarisation imaging. We present the modelling of an ultra-thin topology-optimised diffractive metasurface that encodes polarisation states in five different diffraction orders. Positioning the metasurface in a telescope's pupil plane allows the diffraction orders to be imaged onto a single detector, resulting in the capability to perform single-shot full-Stokes polarisation imaging of the Earth's surface. The five rectangular image swaths are designed to use the full width of the camera, and then each successive frame can be stitched together as the satellite moves over the Earth's surface, restoring the full field of view achievable with any chosen camera without comprising the on-ground resolution. Each set of four out of the five orders enables the reconstruction of the full polarisation state, and their simultaneous reconstructions allow for error monitoring. The lightweight design and compact footprint of the polarisation imaging optical system achievable with a metasurface is a novel approach to increase the functionality of small satellites while working within their weight and volume constraints.</description>

      <title>Coupled-mode theory for astrophotonics</title>

Abstract: Coupled-mode theory (CMT) is a powerful tool for simulating near-harmonic systems. In telecommunications, variations of the theory have been used extensively to study waveguides, both analytically and through numerical modelling. Analogous mathematical techniques to the CMT are also widely used in quantum mechanics. The purpose of this work is to collect different formulations of the CMT and their underlying connections to quantum mechanical techniques, and to showcase their utility in modelling slowly varying waveguides including directional couplers and photonic lanterns. My choice of example waveguides is motivated by the astronomical applications of such devices in starlight nulling, wavefront sensing, and high-resolution spectroscopy. I first provide a brief review of the standard form of the CMT, applicable for waveguides with fixed eigenmodes. Next, I show that the CMT also applies for slowly varying waveguides, and demonstrate the close relation between the CMT and several well-known approximation methods from quantum mechanics, as well as concepts like geometric phase. Finally, I present a verification of my analysis, in the form of the numerical package cbeam.</description>

      <title>Light-induced magnetic trapping for cold alkali atoms using a combined optical tweezers and nanofibre platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a magnetic trapping method for cold $^{87}$Rb atoms, utilising the light-induced magnetic fields from the evanescent field of an optical nanofibre (ONF) in conjunction with an optical tweezers. We calculate and plot the trapping potentials for both Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian modes of the optical tweezers, and quasi-linear polarisation of the ONF-guided field. Based on the optical powers in the tweezers beam and the ONF-guided mode, we analyse the trap depths and the distances of the trap minima from the surface of the nanofibre. We show that, by controlling the powers in both of the optical fields, one can vary the trap position over a few hundreds of nanometres, while also influencing the trap depth and trap frequencies. Such control over atom position is essential both for studying distance-dependent effects on atoms trapped near dielectric surfaces, and minimising these effects for quantum technology applications.</description>
