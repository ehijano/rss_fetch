      <title>The Effect of Magnetization on Electron Heating in Low-Density Ultracold Neutral Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold neutral plasmas provide a useful system for studying extreme parameter regimes plasma physics in an accessible laboratory setting. The parameter space of plasma physics can be characterized in part by coupling strength and degree of magnetization. The range of achievable strong coupling is determined in part by the lowest possible temperatures that can be achieved. This work examines the early-lifetime electron heating of moderately coupled, strongly magnetized plasmas. This heating is dominated by disorder-induced heating and heating due to Rydberg atom formation. By using experimentally informed simulations, it is found that disorder-induced heating has a large influence in electron temperature well into the plasma lifetime. Additionally, the dependence of the minimum achievable electron temperature on magnetization and initial electron energy is examined. In this work, we find electron temperatures as low as $0.52^{+.10}_{-.05}\ \mathrm{K}$ (for electron density, $n_{e}$, of $6.1 \times 10^{12}\ \mathrm{m^{-3}}$), which determines the maximum coupling strength for the measured experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear entropy transfer via zonal flows in gyrokinetic plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear entropy transfer processes in toroidal ion temperature gradient (ITG) and electron temperature gradient (ETG) driven turbulence are investigated based on the gyrokinetic entropy balance relations for zonal and non-zonal modes, which are coupled through the entropy transfer function regarded as a kinetic extension of the zonal-flow production due to the Reynolds stress. Spectral analyses of the "triad" entropy transfer function introduced in this study reveal not only the nonlinear interactions among the zonal and non-zonal modes, but also their effects on the turbulent transport level. Different types of the entropy transfer processes between the ITG and ETG turbulence are found: The entropy transfer from non-zonal to zonal modes is substantial in the saturation phase of the ITG instability, while, once the strong zonal flow is generated, the entropy transfer to the zonal modes becomes quite weak in the steady turbulence state. Instead, the zonal flows mediate the entropy transfer from non-zonal modes with low radial-wavenumbers (with contribution to the heat flux) to the other non-zonal modes with higher radial-wavenumbers (but with less contribution to the heat flux) through the triad interaction. The successive entropy transfer processes to the higher radial-wavenumber modes are associated with transport regulation in the steady turbulence state. In contrast, in both the instability-saturation and steady phases of the ETG turbulence, the entropy transfer processes among low-wavenumber non-zonal modes are dominant rather than the transfer via zonal modes.</description>

      <title>Isotope Effects on TEM-driven Turbulence and Zonal Flows in Helical and Tokamak Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impacts of isotope ion mass on trapped electron mode (TEM) driven turbulence and zonal flows in magnetically confined fusion plasmas are investigated. Gyrokinetic simulations of TEM-driven turbulence in three-dimensional magnetic configuration of LHD plasmas with hydrogen isotope ions and real-mass kinetic electrons are realized for the first time, and the linear and the nonlinear nature of the isotope and collisional effects on the turbulent transport and zonal-flow generation is clarified. It is newly found that combined effects of the collisional TEM stabilization by the isotope ions and the associated increase in the impacts of the steady zonal flows at the near-marginal linear stability lead to the significant transport reduction with the opposite ion mass dependence in comparison to the conventional gyro-Bohm scaling. The universal nature of the isotope effects on the TEM-driven turbulence and zonal flows is verified for a wide variety of toroidal plasmas, e.g., axisymmetric tokamak and non-axisymmetric helical/stellarator systems.</description>

      <title>Gyrokinetic turbulent transport simulations on steady burning condition in D-T-He plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion temperature gradient(ITG) and trapped electron modes(TEM) driven turbulent transport in an ITER-like plasma is investigated by means of multi-species gyrokinetic Vlasov simulations with D, T, He, and real-mass kinetic electrons including their inter-species collisions. Beyond the conventional zero-dimensional power balance analysis presuming the global energy and particle confinement times, gyrokinetic-simulation-based evaluation of a steady burning condition with He-ash exhaust and D-T fuel inward pinch is demonstrated. It is clarified that a significant imbalance appears in the turbulent particle flux for the fuel ions of D and T, depending on the D-T density ratio and the He-ash accumulation. Then several profile regimes to satisfy Reiter's steady burning condition are, for the first time, identified by the gyrokinetic simulation. Also, the impacts of zonal flows and nonthermal He-ash on the optimal profile regimes are examined.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Beam-Driven Wakefield Acceleration in Laser-Plasma Filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-guided femtosecond laser pulses propagating in low-pressure gas can generate plasma filaments, establishing a new framework for plasma wakefield acceleration. Unlike conventional schemes relying on mechanically confined or preformed plasma channels, this method exploits the intrinsic non-linear light-matter interaction, greatly reducing the energy required to generate plasma. This, in turn, allows to realise tunable stages, potentially operating above kHz repetition rate and with meter-scale interaction lengths and transverse sizes down to a few tens of micrometres. Moreover, the laser-plasma filament reproducibility is intrinsically higher than state-of-the-art discharge-plasmas, where the breakdown process is initiated in a stochastic and uncontrolled manner. As a result, laser-based plasma formation offers improved reliability and control over plasma parameters. Here we report a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of beam-driven wakefield acceleration of electron bunches with an accelerating field exceeding 250 MV/m in a laser-generated plasma filament. The results are cross-checked with numerical simulation, showing an excellent agreement and providing a complete picture of the physical process. Beyond particle acceleration, the concept bridges laser filamentation physics, advanced plasma photonics and compact accelerator technologies, offering a promising route towards sustainable, high-repetition-rate plasma-based facilities.</description>

      <title>Merging of zonal flows in gyrofluid resistive drift-wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-linear dynamics of zonal flows is investigated in the context of the gyrofluid modified Hasegawa-Wakatani model. Merging of zonal flows and the chaotic developement of the initial zonal flow pattern is explored. Conservation equations for zonal flow momentum and energy with consistent finite Larmor radius (FLR) effects are derived and used for a quantitative analysis of zonal flow mergers in numerical simulations. The nonlinear local Reynolds stress transfer as opposed to (hyper)viscous dissipation is found to be the main cause of merging. The applicability of the concept of a phase transition in the strict thermodynamical sense is discussed in context of zonal flow transition hysteresis.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating polytropic processes, turbulence, and heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the thermodynamics of fluctuating polytropic processes and their connection to turbulence. It is shown that random fluctuations of polytropic processes produce a nonzero overall heating of a particle system, e.g., solar wind plasma flowing out through the heliosphere; while any nonturbulent heating can be thermodynamically described by typical nonfluctuating polytropic processes, turbulent heating can be thermodynamically described through fluctuating polytropic processes. First, we derive the expression of the overall process and find that polytropic fluctuations lead to heat entering the system even if the respective nonfluctuating process is adiabatic. The temperature of the solar wind plasma protons decreases with heliospheric distance less than the adiabatic cooling, again, similar to when heating enters the system; this subadiabatic cooling is proportional to the variance of the fluctuations. We derive the heliospheric radial profiles of the thermodynamic expressions of the polytropic index, temperature, and heating rates. Then, we show that the analytical profiles of heating of fluctuating polytropic processes and of turbulent heating are identical, suggesting that turbulence heats plasma particle populations by fluctuating their polytropic processes. We apply the thermodynamics of fluctuating polytropic processes to the energy transfer from pickup ions (PUIs) to solar wind plasma protons, and derive the analytical expressions of PUI turbulent and nonturbulent heating rates, which are well fitted to the respective observations. Finally, we apply the thermodynamic model to the radial profile of PUI energy transfer to the solar wind plasma protons, where we derive the portion of PUI turbulent vs. nonturbulent heating rates.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Doppler laser cooling protocols for quantum sensing with 3D ion crystals in a Penning trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large, 3D trapped ion crystals offer improved sensitivity in quantum sensing protocols, and are expected to be implemented as platforms in near-future experiments. However, numerical techniques used to study the laser cooling of such crystals are inefficient as the number of ions, $N$, in the crystal increases. Here we develop a powerful numerical framework to simulate laser cooling of up to $10^5$ ions stored in a Penning trap. We apply this framework to characterize and optimize the cooling of ellipsoidal 3D crystals. We document new pathways to enhanced cooling based on the addition of an axial component to the potential energy-dominated $\boldsymbol{E}\times\boldsymbol{B}$ modes. Furthermore, we observe greatly enhanced cooling of the perpendicular kinetic energy to below 1 mK in prolate ion crystals, enabling a simplified cooling beam setup for such crystals. We propose specific values of trap and laser beam parameters which lead to optimal cooling in a variety of examples. This work illustrates the feasibility of preparing large 3D crystals for high-sensitivity quantum science protocols, motivating their use in future experiments.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Diagnostic Observational Framework for Magnetosonic Solitary Waves During Geomagnetic Storms in Solar Cycles 24 and 25 using Cluster II Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solitary structures, commonly known as solitons, are a class of nonlinear plasma waves that are abundantly found in near-Earth plasmas and planetary magnetospheres. They are nonlinear, localized plasma waves that maintain their shape and velocity over time and distance. While their occurrence in various space plasma environments has been extensively reported, their observation during geomagnetic storms, large-scale disturbances driven by interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere, remains limited. In this study, we present a comparative investigation of magnetosonic soliton signatures during geomagnetic storms associated with Solar Cycles 24 and 25. Using high-resolution in-situ magnetic field measurements from the Cluster II mission, we systematically examine the plasma conditions favorable for soliton generation and their evolution during storm-time dynamics. A comprehensive multi-diagnostic observational framework, incorporating several state-of-the-art analytical techniques, is developed to reliably detect and characterize magnetosonic solitons. The results demonstrate that solitary structures in both storms predominantly occur during the early storm intervals, prior to the main phase, suggesting that they may serve as potential precursor signatures of enhanced geomagnetic activity.</description>

      <title>Growth-controlled photochromism in yttrium oxyhydride thin films deposited by HiPIMS and pulsed-DC magnetron sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study investigates photochromic oxygen-containing yttrium hydride (YHO) thin films deposited by reactive high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) and compares their photochromic, optical, and structural properties with those of films synthesized by reactive pulsed direct current magnetron sputtering (pulsed-DCMS). Optical emission spectroscopy reveals that, unlike pulsed-DCMS where Ar$^{+}$ ions dominate, HiPIMS discharges are characterised by strong Y$^{+}$ emission, evidencing high yttrium ionisation and substantial self-sputter recycling. The critical working pressure (P$_c$) required to obtain transparent and photochromic films is higher for HiPIMS (Pc $\approx$ 1.0 Pa) than for pulsed-DCMS (Pc $\approx$ 0.5 Pa). Although films deposited near Pc exhibit similar solar transmittance (~72 %) and lattice parameters (5.38--5.39 \r{A}), the pulsed-DCMS film shows a substantially higher relative photochromic contrast (34 %) and a lower optical band gap (2.70 eV) compared with the HiPIMS film (9 % contrast and 2.94 eV). This difference is partly attributed to a lower oxygen-to-hydrogen atomic ratio in the pulsed-DCMS film. Structurally, HiPIMS films are largely polycrystalline with random out-of-plane crystallographic orientation, whereas pulsed-DCMS films exhibit a pronounced &lt;100&gt; out-of-plane preferred orientation. These results demonstrate that, beyond composition, thin-film growth conditions and microstructure play a crucial role in governing the photochromic performance of YHO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a Lorentz-covariant spectral universality for stationary stochastic fields in Minkowski spacetime. We show that no covariant local mapping can relate temporal and spatial power spectra in more than one spatial dimension. For Lorentz homogeneous spectra, the temporal index is symmetry protected, observer invariant, and offset from the spatial index by a universal geometric factor set by effective momentum space dimensionality. We show how spectral universality breaks down for anisotropic scaling and dispersion dominated spectra, establishing the necessity of a Lorentz-covariant formulation of relativistic spectral inference.</description>

      <title>Imprints of primordial magnetic fields on the late-time Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) generated in the early Universe may leave observable imprints in the present-day large-scale structure. However, it remains unclear on which spatial scales primordial signatures can survive the nonlinear processes accompanying structure formation. The aim of this study is to investigate the evolution of PMFs during gravitational collapse and to determine the spatial scales on which primordial signatures can persist. We perform a suite of high-resolution direct numerical simulations of self-gravitating, magnetized halos. By varying the viscosity, we probe different Reynolds-number regimes and follow the coupled evolution of gravitational collapse and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. At sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, turbulence generated during collapse triggers the onset of a small-scale dynamo, which amplifies magnetic energy below the Jeans scale and modifies the magnetic energy spectrum significantly. Whether dynamo amplification dominates the magnetic field evolution is determined by the competition between the dynamo growth time and the free-fall time. Our results highlight the importance of resolving the Jeans scale and the associated turbulent inertial range in cosmological MHD simulations to accurately capture the interplay between gravitational compression and dynamo amplification and to assess which structures retain memory of primordial fields.</description>

      <title>Detecting Shearless Phase-Space Transport Barriers in Global Gyrokinetic Turbulence Simulations with Test Particle Map Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In magnetically confined fusion plasmas, the role played by zonal E$\times$B flow shear layers in the suppression of turbulent transport is relatively well-understood. However, less is understood about the role played by the weak shear regions that arise in the non-monotonic radial electric field profiles often associated with these shear layers. In electrostatic simulations from the global total-f gyrokinetic particle-in-cell code XGC, we demonstrate how shearless regions with non-zero flow curvature form zonal "jets" that, in conjunction with neighboring regions of shear, can act as robust barriers to particle transport and turbulence spreading. By isolating quasi-coherent fluctuations radially localized to the zonal jets, we construct a map model for the Lagrangian dynamics of gyrokinetic test particles in the presence of drift waves. We identify the presence of shearless invariant tori in this model and verify that these tori act as partial phase-space transport barriers in the simulations. We also demonstrate how avalanches impinging on these shearless tori cause reconnection events that form "cold/warm core ring" structures analogous to those found in oceanic jets, facilitating transport across the barriers without destroying them completely. We discuss how shearless tori may generically arise from tertiary instabilities or other types of discrete eigenmodes, suggesting their potential relevance to broader classes of turbulent fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: The efficiency of recombination is of crucial importance for the existence of ultracold plasmas (UCP), particularly, the ones formed in the magneto-optical traps. Unfortunately, the equilibrium thermodynamic treatment of the ionization-recombination processes is inappropriate for the evolving UCP clouds, while the straightforward kinetic simulation encounters the problem of huge difference in the spatial and temporal scales for free and bound motion of the electrons. As a result, only the "virtual" electron-ion pairs are usually reproduced in such modeling, and it is necessary to employ some heuristic criteria to identify them with the recombined atoms. It is the aim of this paper to present the first successful "ab initio" simulation of the non-equilibrium recombination in the evolving UCP plasmas. We employed a special algorithm, which is based on using the "scalable" reference frame, co-moving with the expanding substance. Then, the recombination events are identified by a series of sharp equidistant peaks in the kinetic and/or potential energies, which are caused by the captured electrons passing near the pericenters of their orbits; and this is confirmed by a detailed inspection of their trajectories. Thereby, we were able to trace the real - rather than "virtual" - electron-ion pairs, and the total efficiency of their formation was found to be about 20%, which is in agreement with the laboratory measurements.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Wave Activation at Relativistic Magnetized Shocks</title>

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely energetic radio transients, some are generated in magnetar magnetospheres and winds. Despite a growing number of observations, their emission mechanisms remain elusive. It has recently been proposed that Alfv\'enic perturbations can convert into superluminal O-modes at magnetized shocks and propagate downstream as a radio signal. We validate this superluminal wave activation mechanism using pair-plasma theory and particle-in-cell simulations. Theory predicts two different downstream modes: nonpropagating Alfv\'enic perturbations and propagating superluminal O-modes. Superluminal wave activation occurs if the frequency of upstream perturbations in the shock frame exceeds the downstream plasma frequency. 1D particle-in-cell simulations confirm wavenumber and frequency jumps across the shock for upstream perturbations with frequencies well above the plasma frequency. Our simulations model both monochromatic upstream waves and broadband spectra with the downstream plasma frequency acting like a high-pass filter for superluminal O-modes. We discuss implications for FRB generation in relativistic magnetized winds.</description>

      <title>TokEye: Fast Signal Extraction for Fluctuating Time Series via Offline Self-Supervised Learning From Fusion Diagnostics to Bioacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation fusion facilities like ITER face a "data deluge," generating petabytes of multi-diagnostic signals daily that challenge manual analysis. We present a "signals-first" self-supervised framework for the automated extraction of coherent and transient modes from high-noise time-frequency data across a variety of sensors. We also develop a general-purpose method and tool for extracting coherent, quasi-coherent, and transient modes for fluctuation measurements in tokamaks by employing non-linear optimal techniques in multichannel signal processing with a fast neural network surrogate on fast magnetics, electron cyclotron emission, CO2 interferometers, and beam emission spectroscopy measurements from DIII-D. Results are tested on data from DIII-D, TJ-II, and non-fusion spectrograms. With an inference latency of 0.5 seconds, this framework enables real-time mode identification and large-scale automated database generation for advanced plasma control.
