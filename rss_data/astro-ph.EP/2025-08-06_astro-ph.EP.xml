      <title>Spectral Characteristics of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS from SOAR Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs) provide unique insights into the building blocks and conditions of extrasolar planetary systems. The newly discovered object, 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1), represents the third known ISO after 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. We present initial spectroscopic characterizations of 3I using observations from the Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph on the 4.1 m SOAR Telescope in Chile during the night of July 3rd. The reflectance spectrum of 3I, covering 3700-7000\,\AA\, reveals a red continuum, comparable to extreme trans-Neptunian objects, with a weak UV-optical turnover indicative of complex carbonaceous and irradiated organics. At the time of observation, when 3I was at a heliocentric distance of 4.4 AU, we detected no discernible gas emission from canonical cometary species (CN, C$_3$, C$_2$, CO$^+$, [O{\sc i}]). This is in agreement with expectations from our thermal-evolution model, which indicates sublimation-driven activity should commence once 3I/ATLAS approaches smaller heliocentric distances. Nonetheless, the paradoxical situation of early onset coma without evidence of sublimation tracers calls for other dust-liberating mechanisms that ancient ISOs may be subjected to at large heliocentric distances.</description>

      <title>Validation of TESS Planet Candidates with Multi-Color Transit Photometry and TRICERATOPS+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an upgraded version of TRICERATOPS, a software package designed to calculate false positive probabilities for planet candidates identified by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). This enhanced framework now incorporates ground-based light curves in separate bandpasses, which are routinely obtained as part of the candidate vetting process. We apply this upgraded framework to explore the planetary nature of 14 TESS planet candidates, combining primarily J band light curves acquired with the 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory with complementary archival observations from the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT), the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO), and the Teide Observatory, along with existing TESS data and contrast curves from high-resolution imaging. As a result of this analysis we statistically validate (False Positive Probability &lt; 1.5% and Nearby False Positive Probability &lt; 0.1%) six new planets in five systems: TOI-1346 b, TOI-1346 c, TOI-2719 b, TOI-4155 b, TOI-6000 b, and TOI-6324 b. For these systems, we provide updated estimates of their stellar and planetary properties derived from the TESS and ground-based observations. These new systems contain planets with radii between 0.9-6 Re and orbital periods between 0.3-5.5 days. Finally, we use our upgraded version of TRICERATOPS to quantify the relative importance of multi-wavelength transit photometry and high-resolution imaging for exoplanet candidate validation, and discuss which kinds of candidates typically benefit the most from ground-based multi-color transit observations.</description>

      <title>Surface Response of Mercury's Sulfides under Solar Wind Ion Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MESSENGER mission revealed unexpectedly high sulfur content within Mercury's surface, deviating from the Lunar regolith, which was, until recently, considered a good Mercury analogue. Mercury's exposure to energetic space weathering processes such as meteoritic impact and solar-wind sputtering suggests this high sulfur concentration should be reflected in the suprathermal sulfur population of the Hermean exosphere. UV spectroscopy has not yet detected exospheric sulfur, a result attributed primarily to its low glow-factor. Future detection by BepiColombo's Mass Spectrum Analyzer depends on sulfur abundance in the exosphere. Radiation-induced segregation has been observed in the common sulfide troilite (FeS), a constituent mineral in returned Lunar samples, meteorites, and asteroids, where the resulting metal cap is expected to reduce sulfur ejection to Mercury's exosphere. In this work, we investigate the irradiation response of Mercury-relevant sulfides. Niningerite (MgS) and oldhamite (CaS) were irradiated with solar-wind speed 2 keV H$_2^+$ or 4 keV He$^+$, and in-situ compositional and chemical bond analysis as a function of fluence was performed using an XPS microprobe. Neither MgS nor CaS expressed detectable damage-induced segregation and instead reached metal-to-sulfur ratios close to bulk with irradiation. Based on this finding, structural information, and literature analyses, we infer that an S-S anionic spacing exceeding $\sim$3.2 \AA{} inhibits radiation-induced sulfur depletion and promotes stoichiometric sputtering. We therefore predict no cation (metal) surface segregation in Hermean sulfides and no reduction in suprathermal sulfur emission caused by metal cladding formation in TiS, CrS, and Ca-Mg sulfides. This radiation-hardness for Mercury-relevant sulfides is novel and unexpected, and should facilitate detection in Mercury's exosphere by the BepiColombo mission.</description>

      <title>Hubble Space Telescope Observations of the Interstellar Interloper 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high angular resolution observations of the third known interstellar interloper, 3I/ATLAS, from the Hubble Space Telescope. The object is clearly active at 3.8 au pre-perihelion, showing dust emitted from the hot Sun-facing side of the nucleus and a weak, radiation pressure swept tail away from the Sun. We apply a simple model to estimate the mass loss rate in dust as dM/dt = 6 a kg/s, where a is the mean particle size in microns. With 1 &lt; a &lt; 100, we infer dM/dt = 6 to 60 kg/s. A fit to the surface brightness distribution of the inner coma limits the effective radius of the nucleus to be r &lt; 2.8 km, assuming red geometric albedo 0.04. Conversely, the nucleus cannot be smaller than 0.16 km in radius if its coma is supplied by sublimation of carbon monoxide, and must be larger if a less volatile molecule drives the mass loss.</description>

      <title>Photochemical Haze Formation on Titan and Uranus: A Comparative Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and evolution of haze layers in planetary atmospheres play a critical role in shaping their chemical composition, radiative balance, and optical properties. In the outer solar system, the atmospheres of Titan and the giant planets exhibit a wide range of compositional and seasonal variability, creating environments favorable for the production of complex organic molecules under low-temperature conditions. Among them, Uranus -- the smallest of the ice giants -- has, since Voyager 2, emerged as a compelling target for future exploration due to unanswered questions regarding the composition and structure of its atmosphere, as well as its ring system and diverse icy moon population (which includes four possible ocean worlds). Titan, as the only moon to harbor a dense atmosphere, presents some of the most complex and unique organics found in the solar system. Central to the production of these organics are chemical processes driven by low-energy photons and electrons (&lt;50 eV), which initiate reaction pathways leading to the formation of organic species and gas phase precursors to high-molecular-weight compounds, including aerosols. These aerosols, in turn, remain susceptible to further processing by low-energy UV radiation as they are transported from the upper atmosphere to the lower stratosphere and troposphere where condensation occurs. In this review, I aim to summarize the current understanding of low-energy (&lt;50 eV) photon- and electron-induced chemistry, drawing on decades of insights from studies of Titan, with the objective of evaluating the relevance and extent of these processes on Uranus in anticipation of future observational and in situ exploration.</description>

      <title>On ore-bearing asteroid remnants in lunar craters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We modify the probabilistic formalism developed by Elvis (2014) to estimate the number of lunar craters that contain ore-bearing asteroid remnants. When we consider craters at or above a threshold diameter of 1 km, we estimate an upper limit of ${\sim}6,500$ craters with asteroid remnants containing significant amounts of platinum group metals and an upper limit of ${\sim}3,400$ craters with asteroid remnants that contain significant amounts of water in the form of hydrated minerals. For a more conservative threshold of 5 km, we estimate $\lesssim400$ craters with asteroid remnants that contain significant amounts of platinum group metals. These values are one to two orders of magnitude larger than the number of ore-bearing near-Earth asteroids estimated by Elvis (2014), implying that it may be more advantageous, and hence more profitable, to mine asteroids that have impacted the Moon rather than the ones that are in orbit.</description>

      <title>The possibility of a giant impact on Venus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant impacts were common in the early evolution of the Solar System, and it is possible that Venus also experienced an impact. A giant impact on Venus could have affected its rotation rate and possibly its thermal evolution. In this work, we explore a range of possible impacts using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We consider the final major collision, assuming that differentiation already occurred and that Venus consists of an iron core (30% of Venus' mass) and a forsterite mantle (70% of Venus' mass). We use differentiated impactors with masses ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 Earth masses, impact velocities between 10 and 15 km/s, various impact geometries (head-on and oblique), different primordial thermal profiles, and a range of pre-impact rotation rates of Venus. We analyse the post-impact rotation periods and debris disc masses to identify scenarios that can reproduce Venus' present-day characteristics. Our findings show that a wide range of impact scenarios are consistent with Venus' current rotation. These include head-on collisions on a non-rotating Venus and oblique, hit-and-run impacts by Mars-sized bodies on a rotating Venus. Importantly, collisions that match Venus' present-day rotation rate typically produce minimal debris discs residing within Venus' synchronous orbit. This suggests that the material would likely reaccrete onto the planet, preventing the formation of long-lasting satellites - consistent with Venus' lack of a moon. We conclude that a giant impact can be consistent with both Venus' unusual rotation and lack of a moon, potentially setting the stage for its subsequent thermal evolution.</description>

      <title>A Genetic Algorithm Framework for Optimizing Three-Impulse Orbital Transfers with Poliastro Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital maneuver planning is a critical aspect of mission design, aimed at minimizing propellant consumption, which is directly correlated with the total velocity change ($\Delta V$). While analytical solutions like the Hohmann and Bi-elliptic transfers offer optimal strategies for specific cases, they lack the flexibility for more general optimization problems. This paper presents a computational framework that couples a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the Poliastro orbital mechanics library to autonomously discover fuel-optimal, three-impulse transfer trajectories between coplanar circular orbits. We validate this framework across two distinct scenarios: a low-energy transfer from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to a Geostationary Orbit (GEO), and a high-energy transfer to a distant orbit with a radius 20 times that of LEO. Our results demonstrate the framework's remarkable adaptability. For the LEO-to-GEO transfer, the GA precisely converges to the classical Hohmann transfer, achieving an identical $\Delta V$ of 3853.96 m/s and validating the method's accuracy. Conversely, for the high-energy transfer, the GA identifies a superior Bi-elliptic trajectory that yields a significant $\Delta V$ saving of 213.47 m/s compared to the Hohmann transfer. This fuel efficiency, however, necessitates a trade-off, extending the mission duration from approximately 1 day to over 140 years. This work demonstrates an accessible and powerful toolchain for the rapid prototyping of optimal trajectories, showcasing how combining evolutionary algorithms with open-source libraries provides a robust method for solving complex astrodynamics problems and quantifying their critical design trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Local three-dimensional simulations of the convective overstability in protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At certain radii protoplanetary discs may sustain a form of oscillatory convection (`convective overstability'; COS) due to localised adverse entropy gradients. The resulting hydrodynamical activity can produce coherent structures, such as zonal flows and vortices, that may concentrate solid material and aid their further coagulation. In this paper we extend previous axisymmetric runs by performing local three-dimensional simulations of the COS, using the code SNOOPY. As parameters are varied, we characterise how the various axisymmetric COS saturated states are transformed in 3D, while also tracking their interrelationship with the subcritical baroclinic instability. In particular, at low Reynolds number (Re) our 3D simulations exhibit similar weakly nonlinear and wave turbulent states to our earlier axisymmetic runs. At higher Re, but low Peclet number (Pe), we obtain bursty cycles involving the creation of zonal flows, the subsequent development of planar vortices, and their destruction by elliptical instability. For larger Pe, however, zonal flows can persist, alongside weaker more elongated vortices. These results further reveal the diversity of the COS's behaviour, and show that solid accumulation via COS-induced vortices may not be straightforward.</description>

      <title>On the spatiotemporal coincidence of meteorites in recent fall search campaigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The meteoritical community widely assumes that the probability of finding two meteorites from different falls laying in close proximity is negligible. However, recent studies have suggested that spatiotemporal coincidences may be critical when associating a meteorite with a witnessed fall. In this work, we estimate the number of accumulated meteorites--those resulting from past falls--that are present in landing regions of new falls, while accounting for the effects of terrestrial weathering. We present a simple, fast-computing model to estimate such probability, validated with a Monte Carlo approach based on dark flight computations from real meteorite-dropping fireball data. Considering meteorite masses higher than 10 g, our results indicate that in regions with minimal weathering, like Antarctica, the probability of encountering a previous meteorite within a new fall strewn field may be as high as 75%. In environments with higher weathering rates, like countryside or urban regions, this probability decreases to &lt;1%. When considering the 30 g Lake Frome 006 meteorite coincidence case, the probability of recovering a non-related meteorite with an age of 3.2 kyr from a 0.7 km^2 search area is 6.9%. In the case of the 1 kg Ischgl meteorite, the probability of coincidence with another fresh meteorite of similar mass is 0.06% assuming a large strewn field of 210 km^2. Applied to the Almahata Sitta case, our model predicts a 11.3% of coincidence with a previous meteorite fall. Our results strongly suggest that isotopic dating is essential before associating any meteorite with a witnessed fall.</description>

      <title>Radiative Nonideal MHD Simulations of Inner Protoplanetary Disks: Temperature Structures, Asymmetric Winds, and Episodic Surface Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform two-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations including the full nonideal MHD effects (Ohmic diffusion, Hall effect, and ambipolar diffusion) and approximate radiation transport to understand the dynamics and thermal structure of the inner protoplanetary disks (PPDs). We have developed a simple radiative transfer model for PPDs that reasonably treats stellar non-thermal (XUV), stellar thermal (optical/infrared), and re-emitted radiations, reproducing the temperature structures from Monte Carlo radiative transfer. Our simulations show fast one-sided surface accretion ($\sim 10\%$ of Keplerian velocity) and asymmetric disk winds when the vertical magnetic field is aligned with the disk angular momentum. The asymmetry is due to the failure of the wind on the side with the accretion layer. On the accreting surface, clumps are repeatedly generated and accrete, driven by radiative feedback. For the anti-aligned fields, surface accretion becomes more moderate and time-variable, while the winds remain largely symmetric. For the thermal structure, accretion heating does not affect the disk temperature in any of our runs. This is because (1) the accretion energy dissipates via Joule heating at 2--3 gas scale heights, where low optical depth enables efficient radiative cooling, and (2) the winds remove $\gtrsim 10\%$ of the accretion energy. In contrast, the winds enhance radiative heating by elevating the irradiation front. These results highlight the importance of coupling between gas dynamics and radiation transport in PPDs, and provide observable magnetic activities such as fast episodic accretion, wind asymmetry, and molecular survival in XUV-irradiated winds.</description>

      <title>Prospects of a New $L_5$ Trojan Flyby Target for the Lucy Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA's Lucy spacecraft is en route to conduct the first close encounter with Jupiter's Trojans. While most scheduled flybys lie in the $L_4$ cloud, the only $L_5$ target is the Patroclus-Menoetius binary. Since each flyby offers unique insights into target and population properties unattainable from Earth, we examine the feasibility of including an additional, yet unknown, $L_5$ target while minimizing the impact on Lucy's primary mission. We use the background $L_5$ Trojans brighter than the completeness limit to model their absolute magnitude, spatial, and orbital distributions. A semi-analytical approach estimates the number of Trojans accessible to Lucy for a given $\Delta v$ budget in both pre- and post-Patroclus scenarios. Our results indicate that, while it is unlikely that any suitable Trojan lies on Lucy's nominal path, a moderate $\Delta v$ investment ($35-50\,\mathrm{m/s}$) could enable a sub-kilometer ($500-700\,\mathrm{m}$) flyby prior to the Patroclus encounter. Post-Patroclus, the likelihood of a similar flyby is $\sim60\%$ for $\Delta v\sim$ 50 m/s. Simulations with synthetic Trojans reveal that potential targets cluster near the node opposite to the encounter window, producing an optimal search period in late 2026 for both scenarios. Surveying the densest $10\%$ of this region would require under 5 nights with Subaru/HSC or under 2 nights with Rubin, using shift-and-stack techniques. A successful sub-kilometric flyby would expand Lucy's Trojan target size range and provide new constraints on collisional evolution and the long-standing asymmetry in the $L_4/L_5$ clouds. This nodal-clustering strategy could guide target searches in future Lucy extensions or other planetary flyby missions.</description>

      <title>21st-Century Astrobiology Missions Should Seek These High-Confidence Biosignatures in Mid-Latitude Martian Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This white paper was submitted to NASA's Search For Life Science Analysis Group (SFL-SAG): To ensure that the first mission designed to seek signs of extant life since 1976 is able to produce an unambiguous biological interpretation, the SFL-SAG is tasked with identifying the most high-confidence, agnostic biosignatures which are targetable, detectable, and measurable in Martian subsurface mid-latitude ice. To aid in this effort, this white paper highlights three examples of target materials or phenomena, along with associated instrument concepts, which the SFL-SAG shall prioritize in its efforts to define the appropriate astrobiological strategy. These include 1) polyelectrolyte informational biopolymers, 2) macromolecular biological homochirality, and 3) chiral-specific metabolic reactions. The Agnostic Life Finding Association (ALFA) and University of Florida (UF) support the development of instrumentation that seeks these high-confidence biosignatures.</description>

      <title>Investigating a Characteristic Time Lag in the Ionospheric F-region's Response to Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray and EUV solar flare emission cause increases in the Earth's dayside ionospheric electron density. While the response of the lower ionosphere to X-rays is well studied, the delay between EUV flare emission and the response of the ionospheric F-region has not been investigated. Here, we calculate the delays between incident He II 304 Angstrom emission, and the TEC response for 10 powerful solar flares, all of which exhibit delays under 1 minute. We assess these delays in relation to multiple solar and geophysical factors, and find a strong negative correlation (-0.85) between delay and He II flux change and a moderate negative correlation (-0.55) with rate of increase in He II flux. Additionally, flare magnitude and the X-ray-to-He II flux ratio at peak He II emission show strong negative correlations (-0.80 and -0.75, respectively). We also identify longer delays for flares occurring closer to the summer solstice. These results may have applications in upper-ionospheric recombination rate calculations, atmospheric modelling, and other solar-terrestrial studies. We highlight the importance of incident EUV and X-ray flux parameters on the response time of the ionospheric electron content, and these findings may also have implications for mitigating disruptions in communication and navigation systems.</description>

      <title>Tidal dissipation and synchronization of the temperate exo-Earth LP 791-18d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The creep tide theory is used to explore several aspects of the tidal evolution of the planetary system of the M-star LP 791-18 . We discuss the early synchronization of the exo-Earth LP 791-18d and show that the trapping of its rotation in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance would only have been possible if its eccentricity were approximately 0.04 or larger. The planet is likely in synchronous rotation. The perturbations of the other planets in the system do not allow the complete damping of the orbital eccentricity, and the resulting mechanical energy balance indicates that the tidal energy dissipated inside the planet may flow through the planetary surface at approximately 1 watt per square meter.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) -- Spectroscopic search, classification and analysis of ultracool dwarfs in the Deep Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer onboard the Euclid space mission has obtained near-infrared (NIR) slitless spectra of millions of objects, including hundreds of ultracool dwarfs. Euclid observations retrieve images and spectra simultaneously. This observing mode marks a new era in the discovery of new objects, such as L- and T-type dwarfs, which can be found from direct identification through the H2O and CH4 absorption bands. NISP spectral resolution (R~450) is enough to classify the objects by the spectral type using known standard templates. Q1 provided more than 4 million NIR spectra in one visit to the Euclid Deep Fields. The large amount of spectra released in these fields allowed us to: a) confirm the ultracool dwarf nature of almost half of the photometric candidates compiled by Zhang et al. (2024); b) discover at least 11 new late L- and T-type dwarfs by a specific spectral index search in Q1 data; and c) spectroscopically confirm one hundred more candidates from a new photometric selection conducted by Zerjal et al. (in prep.). We present a preliminary list of Euclid ultracool dwarf templates built by the combination of the best spectra from all these searches. We include the first spectral analysis of confirmed ultracool dwarfs from Q1 data; spectral classifications; determination of effective temperatures; H2O, CH4 and NH3 spectral indices; and measurements of the KI absorption doublet. This paper is a first step in the study of Euclid ultracool dwarfs and will be improved with each subsequent data release.</description>
