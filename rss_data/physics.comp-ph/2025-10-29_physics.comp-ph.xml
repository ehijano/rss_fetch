      <title>Discovery of Hyperelastic Constitutive Laws from Experimental Data with EUCLID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the performance of EUCLID, Efficient Unsupervised Constitutive Law Identification and Discovery, a recently proposed framework for automated discovery of constitutive laws, on experimental data. Mechanical tests are performed on natural rubber specimens spanning simple to complex geometries, from which we collect both global, force elongation, and local, full-field displacement, measurements. Using these data, we obtain constitutive laws via two routes, the conventional identification of unknown parameters in a priori selected material models, and EUCLID, which automates model selection and parameter identification within a unified model-discovery pipeline. We compare the two methodologies using global versus local data, analyze predictive accuracy, and examine generalization to unseen geometries. Moreover, we quantify the experimental noise, investigate the coverage of the material state space achieved by each approach and discuss the relative performance of different datasets and different a priori chosen models versus EUCLID.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Timescale Barrier: Generative Discovery of Conformational Free-Energy Landscapes and Transition Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular transitions -- such as protein folding, allostery, and membrane transport -- are central to biology yet remain notoriously difficult to simulate. Their intrinsic rarity pushes them beyond reach of standard molecular dynamics, while enhanced-sampling methods are costly and often depend on arbitrary variables that bias outcomes. We introduce Gen-COMPAS, a generative committor-guided path sampling framework that reconstructs transition pathways without predefined variables and at a fraction of the cost. Gen-COMPAS couples a generative diffusion model, which produces physically realistic intermediates, with committor-based filtering to pinpoint transition states. Short unbiased simulations from these intermediates rapidly yield full transition-path ensembles that converge within nanoseconds, where conventional methods require orders of magnitude more sampling. Applied to systems from a miniprotein to a ribose-binding protein to a mitochondrial carrier, Gen-COMPAS retrieves committors, transition states, and free-energy landscapes efficiently, uniting machine learning and molecular dynamics for broad mechanistic and practical insight.</description>

      <title>Six-Dimensional Movable Antenna Enabled Wideband THz Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA)-enabled wideband terahertz (THz) communication system with sub-connected hybrid beamforming architecture at the base station (BS). In particular, the three-dimensional (3D) position and 3D rotation of each 6DMA surface can be flexibly reconfigured to mitigate the beam squint effects instead of introducing costly true-time-delay devices. We first analyze the normalized array gain in the 6DMA-enabled wideband THz systems based on the beam squint effects. Then, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem via jointly optimizing 3D positions, 3D rotations, and hybrid analog/digital beamforming. To solve the non-convex problem, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed that decomposes the original problem into three subproblems, which are solved alternately. Specifically, given the positions and rotations of 6DMA surfaces, we first reformulate the objective function and design a semidefinite relaxation-based alternating minimization scheme to obtain the hybrid analog/digital beamforming. Then, the positions and rotations of the 6DMA surfaces are further optimized through a feasible gradient descent procedure. The final solutions are obtained by repeating the above procedure until convergence. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme compared with conventional fixed-position antenna architectures.</description>

      <title>Bayesian MINFLUX localization microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MINFLUX microscopy allows for localization of fluorophores with nanometer precision using targeted scanning with an illumination profile with a minimum. However, current scanning patterns and the overall procedure are based on heuristics, and may therefore be suboptimal. Here we present a rigorous Bayesian that offers maximal resolutions from either minimal detected photons or minimal exposures. We estimate using simulated localization runs that this approach should reduce the number of photons required for 1 nm resolution by a factor of about four.</description>

      <title>Optical excitations in nanographenes from the Bethe-Salpeter equation and time-dependent density functional theory: absorption spectra and spatial descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) formalism is a well-established approach for calculating excitation energies and optical spectra of molecules, nanostructures, and crystalline materials. We implement GW-BSE in the CP2K code and validate the implementation for a standard organic molecular test set, obtaining excellent agreement with reference data, with a mean absolute error in excitation energies below 3 meV. We then study optical spectra of nanographenes of increasing length, showing excellent agreement with experiment. We further compute the size of the excitation of the lowest optically active excitation which converges to about 7.6 $\r{A}$ with increasing length. Comparison with time-dependent density functional theory using functionals of varying exact-exchange fraction shows that none reproduce both the size of the excitation and optical spectra of GW-BSE, underscoring the need for many-body methods for accurate description of electronic excitations in nanostructures.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Lagrangian Adaptive Rank (SLAR) Method for High-Dimensional Vlasov Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend our previous work on a semi-Lagrangian adaptive rank (SLAR) integrator, in the finite difference framework for nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson systems, to the general high-order tensor setting. The proposed scheme retains the high-order accuracy of semi-Lagrangian methods, ensuring stability for large time steps and avoiding dimensional splitting errors. The primary contribution of this paper is the novel extension of the algorithm from the matrix to the high-dimensional tensor setting, which enables the simulation of Vlasov models in up to six dimensions. The key technical components include (1) a third-order high-dimensional polynomial reconstruction that scales as $O(d^2)$, providing a point-wise approximation of the solution at the foot of characteristics in a semi-Lagrangian scheme; (2) a recursive hierarchical adaptive cross approximation of high-order tensors in a hierarchical Tucker format, characterized by a tensor tree; (3) a low-complexity Poisson solver in the hierarchical Tucker format that leverages the FFT for efficiency. The computed adaptive rank kinetic solutions exhibit low-rank structures within branches of the tensor tree resulting in substantial computational savings in both storage and time. The resulting algorithm achieves a computational complexity of $O(d^4 N r^{3+\lceil\log_2d\rceil})$, where $N$ is the number of grid points per dimension, $d$ is the problem dimension, and $r$ is the maximum rank in the tensor tree, overcoming the curse of dimensionality. Through extensive numerical tests, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and highlight its ability to capture complex solution structures while maintaining a computational complexity that scales linearly with $N$.</description>

      <title>Classically Prepared, Quantumly Evolved: Hybrid Algorithm for Molecular Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to compute dynamical correlation functions and excitation spectra in many-body quantum systems, with a focus on molecular systems. The method combines classical preparation of a perturbed ground state with short-time quantum evolution of product states sampled from it. The resulting quantum samples define an effective subspace of the Hilbert space, onto which the Hamiltonian is projected to enable efficient classical simulation of long-time dynamics. This subspace-based approach achieves high-resolution spectral reconstruction using shallow circuits and few samples. Benchmarks on molecular systems show excellent agreement with exact diagonalization and demonstrate access to dynamical timescales beyond the reach of purely classical methods, highlighting its suitability for near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Pipe Flow Stability: Insights from a Meshless Global Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive experimental evidence of turbulence in Hagen Poiseuille flow, linear stability analysis has not yet confirmed its instability. One challenge is the singularity introduced by the term 1/r in the center of the pipe, which complicates traditional stability approaches. In this study, we explore a global stability analysis using a meshless framework. Although this approach did not recover the expected unstable modes, it revealed a new set of modes with distinct characteristics from those observed in local stability analysis. We analyze these modes and their impact on transient energy growth, demonstrating the effectiveness of the global approach in capturing localized instabilities without requiring multiple simulations.</description>

      <title>Simulating Turbulent Wakes without the Upstream Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simplified framework for simulating three-dimensional turbulent wakes without the upstream body that generates them. Instead of resolving the geometry, the incompressible Navier Stokes equations are solved in a rectangular domain on which the inflow boundary condition is prescribed as either phase-averaged or time-averaged velocity profiles obtained from experimental measurements and direct numerical simulations. Remarkably, prescribing the inflow at a single downstream location is sufficient to reconstruct the entire wake, including coherent vortex shedding, Reynolds-stress distributions, and spectral content, for the two Reynolds numbers we investigate here: Re=500 and 5,000. Comparisons with corresponding full-body DNS and experiments show good agreement in mean velocity fields and turbulence statistics. Our results demonstrate that the essential dynamics of bluff-body wakes are induced by the instability of the near-wake profile, and do not require the explicit presence of the bluff body. This body-free simulation paradigm enables physically interpretable wake reconstruction from mean profiles that can be easily obtained from measurements or simple 2D simulations. Our approach reduces the computational cost of DNS by an order of magnitude, hence offering a new route for reduced-complexity modeling and control of turbulent separated flows.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning the Entropy to Estimate Free Energy Differences without Sampling Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic phase transitions, a central concept in physics and chemistry, are typically controlled by an interplay of enthalpic and entropic contributions. In most cases, the estimation of the enthalpy in simulations is straightforward but evaluating the entropy is notoriously hard. As a result, it is common to induce transitions between the metastable states and estimate their relative occupancies, from which the free energy difference can be inferred. However, for systems with large free energy barriers, sampling these transitions is a significant computational challenge. Dedicated enhanced sampling algorithms require significant prior knowledge of the slow modes governing the transition, which is typically unavailable. We present an alternative approach, which only uses short simulations of each phase separately. We achieve this by employing a recently developed deep learning model for estimating the entropy and hence the free energy of each metastable state. We benchmark our approach calculating the free energies of crystalline and liquid metals. Our method features state-of-the-art precision in estimating the melting transition temperature in Na and Al without requiring any prior information or simulation of the transition pathway itself.</description>

      <title>Energy-Conserving Contact Dynamics of Nonspherical Rigid-Body Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the contact dynamics of nonspherical particles beyond the microscale is crucial for accurately modeling colloidal and granular systems, where shape anisotropy dictates structural organization and transport properties. In this paper, we introduce an energy-conserving contact dynamics framework for arbitrary convex rigid-body particles, integrating vertex-boundary interactions in 2D with vertex-surface and edge-edge detection in 3D. This formulation enables continuous force evaluation and strictly prevents particle overlap while conserving total energy during translational and rotational motion. Simulations of polygonal and polyhedral particles confirm the framework's stability and demonstrate its capability to capture packing behavior, anisotropic diffusion, and equations of state. The framework establishes a robust and extensible foundation for investigating the nonequilibrium dynamics of complex nonspherical particle systems, with potential applications in colloidal self-assembly, granular flow, and hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Stabilisation of hBN/SiC Heterostructures with Vacancies and Transition-Metal Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When two-dimensional atomic layers of different materials are brought into close proximity to form van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, interactions between adjacent layers significantly influence their physicochemical properties. These effects seem particularly pronounced when the interface exhibits local order and near-perfect structural alignment, leading to the emergence of Moir\'e patterns. Using quantum mechanical density functional theory calculations, we propose a prototypical bilayer heterostructure composed of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and silicon carbide (SiC), characterized by a lattice mismatch of 18.77\% between their primitive unit cells. We find that the removal of boron atoms from specific lattice sites can convert the interlayer interaction from weak vdW coupling to robust localized silicon-nitrogen covalent bonding. Motivated by this, we study the binding of transition-metal adatoms and formulate design guidelines to enhance surface reactivity, thereby enabling the controlled isolation of single-metal atoms. Our machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations confirm both dynamical stability and metal anchoring feasibility at finite temperatures. Our results suggest the hBN/SiC heterostructure as a versatile platform for atomically precise transition-metal functionalization, having potential for next-generation catalytic energy-conversion technologies.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Hydrogen and Helium: From Planetary Embryos to Earth- and Neptune-like Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen, helium, silicates, and iron are key building blocks of rocky and gas-rich planets, yet their chemical interactions remain poorly constrained. Using first-principles molecular dynamics and thermodynamic integration, we quantify hydrogen and helium partitioning between molten silicate mantles and metallic cores for Earth-to-Neptune-mass planets. Hydrogen becomes strongly siderophilic above $\sim$25 GPa but weakens beyond $\sim$200 GPa, whereas helium remains lithophilic yet increasingly soluble in metal with pressure. Incorporating these trends into coupled structure-chemistry models suggests that majority of hydrogen and helium reside in planetary interiors, not atmospheres, with abundances strongly depending on planet mass. Such volatile exchange may influence the redox states of secondary atmospheres, longevity of primordial envelopes, predicted CHNOPS abundances, and emergence of helium-enriched atmospheres, while He 1083 nm and H Lyman-$\alpha$ lines provide potential probes of atmosphere-interior exchange. These findings link atomic-scale interactions to planetary-scale observables, providing new constraints on the origins of Earth-to-Neptune-sized worlds.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum computing for quantum simulation: principles, implementations, and challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive overview of variational quantum computing and their key role in advancing quantum simulation. This work explores the simulation of quantum systems and sets itself apart from approaches centered on classical data processing, by focusing on the critical role of quantum data in Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) and Quantum Machine Learning (QML). We systematically delineate the foundational principles of variational quantum computing, establish their motivational and challenges context within the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, and critically examine their application across a range of prototypical quantum simulation problems. Operating within a hybrid quantum-classical framework, these algorithms represent a promising yet problem-dependent pathway whose practicality remains contingent on trainability and scalability under noise and barren-plateau constraints.This review serves to complement and extend existing literature by synthesizing the most recent advancements in the field and providing a focused perspective on the persistent challenges and emerging opportunities that define the current landscape of variational quantum computing for quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Critical Collapse of a Yang-Mills Field With Null Infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solutions to the Einstein equations near the threshold of black hole formation exhibit remarkable behavior known as critical phenomena gravitational collapse. In this work we perform characteristic evolution in compactified Bondi coordinates in order to study the critical collapse of a Yang-Mills field, allowing for the extraction of global quantities such as the Bondi mass and news function. Our numerical approach is fourth-order accurate. First, we demonstrate that the collapsing field exhibits local DSS behavior, characterized by an echoing period of~$\Delta \simeq 0.7388$, agreeing with previous works up to the second decimal place. We find that global quantities such as the Bondi mass and news function display the same DSS behavior. We furthermore show that the mass of the black holes formed during near-threshold evolutions scales as a function of the distance to the critical parameter, with a critical exponent of approximately~$\gamma=0.1977\pm0.0009$. Finally, our findings indicate that these results are universal, irrespective of the initial data.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal control of laser intensity using differentiable programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical techniques for spatiotemporal control can produce laser pulses with custom amplitude, phase, or polarization structure. In nonlinear optics and plasma physics, the use of structured pulses typically follows a forward design approach, in which the efficacy of a known structure is analyzed for a particular application. Inverse approaches, in contrast, enable the discovery of new structures with the potential for superior performance. Here, an implementation of the unidirectional pulse propagation equation that supports automatic differentiation is combined with gradient-based optimization to design structured pulses with features that are advantageous for a range of nonlinear optical and plasma-based applications: (1) a longitudinally uniform intensity over an extended region, (2) a superluminal intensity peak that travels many Rayleigh ranges with constant duration, spot size, and amplitude, and (3) a laser pulse that ionizes a gas to form a uniform column of plasma. In the final case, optimizing the full spatiotemporal structure improves the performance by a factor of 15 compared to optimizing only spatial or only temporal structure, highlighting the advantage of spatiotemporal control.</description>

      <title>Graph Network-based Structural Simulator: Graph Neural Networks for Structural Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate modeling of dynamic structural problems.
  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss, which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.
  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful predictions.
  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated structural simulations.</description>

      <title>LieSolver: A PDE-constrained solver for IBVPs using Lie symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method for efficiently solving initial-boundary value problems (IBVPs) that uses Lie symmetries to enforce the associated partial differential equation (PDE) exactly by construction. By leveraging symmetry transformations, the model inherently incorporates the physical laws and learns solutions from initial and boundary data. As a result, the loss directly measures the model's accuracy, leading to improved convergence. Moreover, for well-posed IBVPs, our method enables rigorous error estimation. The approach yields compact models, facilitating an efficient optimization. We implement LieSolver and demonstrate its application to linear homogeneous PDEs with a range of initial conditions, showing that it is faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Overall, our method improves both computational efficiency and the reliability of predictions for PDE-constrained problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving inverse and optimization problems over solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex spatial domains is a long-standing challenge. Here we introduce a method that parameterizes the solution using spectral bases on arbitrary spatiotemporal domains, whereby the basis is defined on a hyperrectangle containing the true domain. We find the coefficients of the basis expansion by solving an optimization problem whereby both the equations, the boundary conditions and any optimization targets are enforced by a loss function, building on a key idea from Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Since the representation of the function natively has exponential convergence, so does the solution of the optimization problem, as long as it can be solved efficiently. We find empirically that the optimization protocols developed for machine learning find solutions with exponential convergence on a wide range of equations. The method naturally allows for the incorporation of data assimilation by including additional terms in the loss function, and for the efficient solution of optimization problems over the PDE solutions.</description>

      <title>Exploring End-to-end Differentiable Neural Charged Particle Tracking -- A Loss Landscape Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement and analysis of high energetic particles for scientific, medical or industrial applications is a complex procedure, requiring the design of sophisticated detector and data processing systems. The development of adaptive and differentiable software pipelines using a combination of conventional and machine learning algorithms is therefore getting ever more important to optimize and operate the system efficiently while maintaining end-to-end (E2E) differentiability. We propose for the application of charged particle tracking an E2E differentiable decision-focused learning scheme using graph neural networks with combinatorial components solving a linear assignment problem for each detector layer. We demonstrate empirically that including differentiable variations of discrete assignment operations allows for efficient network optimization, working better or on par with approaches that lack E2E differentiability. In additional studies, we dive deeper into the optimization process and provide further insights from a loss landscape perspective. We demonstrate that while both methods converge into similar performing, globally well-connected regions, they suffer under substantial predictive instability across initialization and optimization methods, which can have unpredictable consequences on the performance of downstream tasks such as image reconstruction. We also point out a dependency between the interpolation factor of the gradient estimator and the prediction stability of the model, suggesting the choice of sufficiently small values. Given the strong global connectivity of learned solutions and the excellent training performance, we argue that E2E differentiability provides, besides the general availability of gradient information, an important tool for robust particle tracking to mitigate prediction instabilities by favoring solutions that perform well on downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Krylov methods for linear response in plane-wave electronic structure calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm based on inexact GMRES methods for linear response calculations in density functional theory. Such calculations require iteratively solving a nested linear problem $\mathcal{E} \delta\rho = b$ to obtain the variation of the electron density $\delta \rho$. Notably each application of the dielectric operator $\mathcal{E}$ in turn requires the iterative solution of multiple linear systems, the Sternheimer equations. We develop computable bounds to estimate the accuracy of the density variation given the tolerances to which the Sternheimer equations have been solved. Based on this result we suggest reliable strategies for adaptively selecting the convergence tolerances of the Sternheimer equations, such that each application of $\mathcal{E}$ is no more accurate than needed. Experiments on challenging materials systems of practical relevance demonstrate our strategies to achieve superlinear convergence as well as a reduction of computational time by about 40% while preserving the accuracy of the returned response solution. Our algorithm seamlessly combines with standard preconditioning approaches known from the context of self-consistent field problems making it a promising framework for efficient response solvers based on Krylov subspace techniques.</description>

      <title>Tensor Decomposition Networks for Fast Machine Learning Interatomic Potential Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariant networks are the dominant models for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). The key operation of such networks is the Clebsch-Gordan (CG) tensor product, which is computationally expensive. To accelerate the computation, we develop tensor decomposition networks (TDNs) as a class of approximately equivariant networks in which CG tensor products are replaced by low-rank tensor decompositions, such as the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition. With the CP decomposition, we prove (i) a uniform bound on the induced error of $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariance, and (ii) the universality of approximating any equivariant bilinear map. To further reduce the number of parameters, we propose path-weight sharing that ties all multiplicity-space weights across the $\mathcal{O}(L^3)$ CG paths into a single path without compromising equivariance, where $L$ is the maximum angular degree. The resulting layer acts as a plug-and-play replacement for tensor products in existing networks, and the computational complexity of tensor products is reduced from $\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L^4)$. We evaluate TDNs on PubChemQCR, a newly curated molecular relaxation dataset containing 105 million DFT-calculated snapshots. We also use existing datasets, including OC20, and OC22. Results show that TDNs achieve competitive performance with dramatic speedup in computations. Our code is publicly available as part of the AIRS library (\href{https://github.com/divelab/AIRS/tree/main/OpenMol/TDN}{https://github.com/divelab/AIRS/}).</description>

      <title>An accurate DFT-1/2 approach for shallow defect states: Efficient calculation of donor binding energies in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of shallow-donor electron binding energies is critical for device modeling, dopant activation, and donor-based quantum technologies. Traditional beyond-DFT approaches (e.g., hybrid functionals, GW) are prohibitively expensive for the large supercells needed to capture the extended, hydrogenic wavefunctions, while semi-local DFT underestimates band gaps and suffers from delocalization errors. We present a simple, practical protocol for shallow donors based on the DFT-1/2 approximate quasiparticle correction that maintains the computational cost of standard DFT and enables supercells up to thousands of atoms. This approach provides a straightforward and reproducible workflow that delivers reliable donor binding energies with minimal computational overhead. Applied to group-V donors in Si, Si:X (X= P, As, Sb, Bi), the method yields binding energies in close agreement with experiment. We found that, for Si:Bi, it is essential to include spin-orbit coupling to achieve near-experimental values with a difference of only $\sim$ 4 meV. For arsenic, the method yields excellent agreement with experiment, with a difference of only ~0.3 meV. For antimony, the results match experiment to within ~5 meV, and for phosphorus, the deviation is within ~8 meV. Beyond its high accuracy, DFT-1/2 offers a significant practical advantage, providing a straightforward, reproducible, and transferable workflow that is less demanding than hybrid functional approaches while remaining fully generalizable to other shallow impurities in semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Geometric Features of Higher-Order Networks via the Spectral Triplet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our work is concerned with simplicial complexes that describe higher-order interactions in real complex systems. This description allows to go beyond the pairwise node-to-node representation that simple networks provide and to capture a hierarchy of interactions of different orders. The prime contribution of this work is the introduction of geometric measures for these simplicial complexes. We do so by noting the non-commutativity of the algebra associated with their matrix representations and consequently we bring to bear the spectral triplet formalism of Connes on these structures and then notions of associated dimensions, curvature, and distance can be computed to serve as characterizing features in addition to known topological metrics.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio calculation of magnetic exchange interactions using the spin-spiral method in VASP: Self-consistent versus magnetic force theorem approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an ab initio investigation of magnetic exchange interactions using the spin-spiral method implemented in the VASP code, with a comparative analysis of the self-consistent (SC) and magnetic force theorem (MFT) approaches. Using representative 3d ferromagnets (Fe, Co, Ni) and Mn-based full Heusler compounds, we compute magnon dispersion relations directly from spin-spiral total energies and extract real-space Heisenberg exchange parameters via Fourier transformation. Curie temperatures are subsequently estimated within both the mean-field and random-phase approximations. The SC spin-spiral calculations yield exchange parameters and magnon spectra in excellent agreement with previous theoretical data, confirming their quantitative reliability across different classes of magnetic systems. In contrast, the MFT approach exhibits systematic quantitative deviations: it overestimates spin-spiral energies and exchange couplings in high-moment systems such as bcc Fe and the Mn-based Heuslers, while underestimating them in low-moment fcc Ni. The magnitude of these discrepancies increases strongly with magnetic moment size, exceeding several hundred percent in the high-moment compounds. These findings underscore the decisive role of self-consistency in accurately determining magnetic exchange parameters and provide practical guidance for future first-principles studies of spin interactions and excitations using the spin-spiral technique.</description>
