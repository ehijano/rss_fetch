      <title>Size-restricted magnetotransport in the delafossite metals PdCoO$_2$ and PtCoO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of electronic transport in width-restricted channels of PdCoO$_2$ have recently revealed a novel `directional ballistic' regime, in which ballistic propagation of electrons on an anisotropic Fermi surface breaks the symmetries of bulk transport. Here we introduce a magnetic field to this regime, in channels of PdCoO$_2$ and PtCoO$_2$ along two crystallographically distinct directions and over a wide range of widths. We observe magnetoresistance distinct from that in the bulk, with features strongly dependent on channel orientation and becoming more pronounced the narrower the channel. Comparison to semi-classical theory establishes that magnetoresistance arises from field-induced modification of boundary scattering, and helps connect features in the data with specific electronic trajectories. However, the role of bulk scattering in our measurements is yet to be fully understood. Our results demonstrate that finite-size magnetotransport is sensitive to the anisotropy of Fermi surface properties, motivating future work to fully understand and exploit this sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Chern-Euler Duality Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phase transitions are typically characterized by abrupt changes in a quantized invariant. Here we report a contrasting paradigm in non-Hermitian parity-time symmetric systems, where the topological invariant remains conserved, but its nature transitions between the Chern number, characteristic of chiral transport in complex bands, and the Euler number, which characterizes the number of nodal points in pairs of real bands. The transition features qualitative changes in the non-Abelian geometric phases during spontaneous parity-time symmetry breaking, where different quantized components become mutually convertible. Our findings establish a novel topological duality principle governing transitions across symmetry classes and reveal unique non-unitary features intertwining topology, symmetry, and non-Abelian gauge structure.</description>

      <title>Sub-nm Curvature Unlocks Exceptional Inherent Flexoelectricity in Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity arises from strain-gradient-induced polarization and is pronounced in two-dimensional (2D) materials due to their mechanical flexibility and sensitivity to structural deformations. This phenomenon approaches its limit in highly curved nanostructures, where extreme charge redistribution and electrostatic modulation result in macroscopic manifestations, such as electronic band offsets, that can be measured. Here, we present the first experimental and theoretical demonstration of giant intrinsic flexoelectricity in graphene nanowrinkles. These nanowrinkles feature a consistent radius of curvature of ~5 {\AA} atop a flat MoS_{2} substrate, where strain gradients, mapped by sub-micron Raman spectroscopy, emerge from mismatched elastic properties between graphene and MoS_{2}. Conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) reveals consistent flexoelectric currents over large-area, dense nanowrinkle networks. The observed asymmetric electromechanical behavior, characterized by a threshold potential ({\Phi}_{th}) of ~1 V, suggests an intrinsic energy barrier to activate a flexoelectric current. This threshold likely arises from combined band alignment effects and strain-induced polarization barriers, which modulate carrier transport at the wrinkle apex. Notably, this behavior aligns with our theoretical band offset predictions (~1.2 V), further supporting flexoelectric dipoles in modifying local electrostatic potential. This represents the strongest manifestations of flexoelectricity in nanostructures with intrinsic polarization densities 10^{5}-10^{7} times greater than meso/micro counterparts yielding P_{th} ~ 4 C/m^{2}, P_{exp} ~ 1 C/m^{2}. This work establishes graphene nanowrinkles as a model system for exploring giant nanoscale flexoelectric effects and highlights their potential for strain-engineered nanoscale electronic and electromechanical devices.</description>

      <title>Phase-Coherent Dynamics in Intervalley Coherent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron transport driven by the phase coherence and interference of quantum many-body wavefunctions is a fascinating phenomenon with potential technological significance. Superconductivity, for example, enables dissipationless transport through macroscopic phase twisting. Similarly, in charge-density waves, once the phase degree of freedom-representing the collective position of electrons relative to the lattice-is depinned, it generates characteristic broadband noise and intriguing AC-DC interference patterns. In this work, we point out a phase-coherent transport phenomena in the intervalley coherent (IVC) state, also known as the bond-ordered or Kekule distorted state, frequently reported in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. Under a static magnetic field, the IVC state responds with an oscillating orbital magnetization, inducing an AC Hall effect similar to the AC Josephson effect in superconductors. In this analogy, the magnetic field acts as the DC voltage, while the oscillating magnetization acts as the AC Josephson current. We present detailed microscopic calculations for all the parameters of the phase-number free-energy in rhombohedral trilayer graphene, predicting an oscillation frequency of approximately 12 GHz at 0.1 Tesla. We comment on this phase-coherent transport in twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides, where the IVC state has been theoretically proposed.</description>

      <title>Optically Controlled Topological Phases in the Deformed $\alpha $-$% T_{3}$ Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Haldane's tight-binding model, which describes a Chern insulator in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice, exhibits quantum Hall conductivity without an external magnetic field. Here, we explore an $\alpha -T_{3}$ lattice subjected to circularly polarized off-resonance light. This lattice, composed of two sublattices (A and B) and a central site (C) per unit cell, undergoes deformation by varying the hopping parameter $\gamma _{1}$ while keeping $\gamma _{2}$= $\gamma _{3}$= $\gamma $. Analytical expressions for quasi-energies in the first Brillouin zone reveal significant effects of symmetry breaking. Circularly polarized light lifts the degeneracy of Dirac points, shifting the cones from M. This deformation evolves with $\gamma _{1} $, breaking symmetry at $\gamma _{1}=2\gamma $, as observed in Berry curvature diagrams. In the standard case ($\gamma _{1}=\gamma $), particle-hole and inversion symmetries are preserved for $\alpha =0$ and $% \alpha =1$. The system transitions from a semi-metal to a Chern insulator, with band-specific Chern numbers: $C_{2}=1$, $C_{1}=0$, and $C_{0}=-1$ for $% \alpha &lt;1/\sqrt{2},$ shifting to $C_{2}=2$, $C_{1}=0$, and $C_{0}=-2$ when $% \alpha \geqslant 1/\sqrt{2}.$For $\gamma _{1}&gt;2\gamma $, the system enters a trivial insulating phase. These transitions, confirmed via Wannier charge centers, are accompanied by a diminishing Hall conductivity. Our findings highlight tunable topological phases in $\alpha -T_{3}$ lattices, driven by light and structural deformation, with promising implications for quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Low-energy excitations in multiple modulation-doped CdTe/(CdMg)Te quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low energy excitations of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in modulation-doped multiple (ten) quantum wells (QWs) was studied using far-infrared magneto-transmission technique at liquid helium temperatures. A large distance between neighbouring QWs of 54 nm excluded a direct interaction of electron wave functions confined in the wells. In four samples which differed in the spacer width and the level of doping with iodine donors, supplied with a metallic grid coupler, a uniform picture of exitations of the 2DEG was observed. These involved the cyclotron resonance (CR), its second harmonic (2CR) and magnetoplasmon modes (MPMs). MPMs with a small amplitude originated from excitations of the 2DEG in a single QW and these with a high amplitude resulted from a coherent excitation of the 2DEG in all wells. A polaron effect resulting from the interaction of the CR, 2CR and MPMs with an optical phonon was observed and discribed with appropriate models. Both types of MPMs exhibited gaps in the disperion relations at the frequency close to the 2CR, leading to Bernstein modes, which was discribed with an appropriate (non-local) theoretical model.</description>

      <title>Theory of polarization-dependent phonon pumping in ferromagnetic/non-magnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical model for polarization-selective phonon pumping induced by magnon-phonon coupling in a ferromagnetic/non-magnetic acoustic bilayer structure, focusing on the effects arising from a misalignment between the magnetic and crystallographic symmetry axes. Our model considers the coupled equations of motion describing uniform magnetization dynamics (the Kittel mode) and elastic waves in both layers, incorporating phonon pumping and boundary conditions at the interface. We show that even small misalignments lift the degeneracy of transverse shear elastic modes, resulting in phononic birefringence characterized by distinct propagation velocities for linearly polarized modes. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that magnon-phonon hybridization gives magnetic-field-dependent properties to otherwise non-magnetic phonons. We show that the polarization transfer between linearly polarized phonons and the circularly polarized Kittel mode can be tuned with an external magnetic field. Our theoretical results quantitatively reproduce recent experimental findings [1].</description>

      <title>Quantum transport in SnTe nanowire devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a variety of quantum transport experiments in SnTe nanowire devices. Research on these particular nanowire devices is relevant because of their topological properties and their potential to distinguish surface states owing to their high surface-to-volume ratio that suppresses the bulk contribution to the conductance. We observe a low-resistance and a high-resistance regime. The highly resistive devices display semiconducting and quantum dot behavior caused by microscopic differences in the fabrication, while devices with low resistance show partial superconductivity when in a hybrid superconductor-nanowire configuration or Fabry-P\'erot oscillations. The latter suggests quantum interference in a ballistic transport channel, attributed to the 2D surface states in SnTe. The wide variety of quantum transport phenomena demonstrate SnTe nanowires as a promising platform for diverse follow-up experiments and novel device architectures, including the exploration of topological superconductivity and the development of low-energy spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Magnon-mediated terahertz spin transport in metallic Gd|Pt stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study femtosecond spin transport in a Gd|Pt stack induced by a laser pulse. Remarkably, the dynamics of the spin current from Gd to Pt suggests that its dominant driving force is the ultrafast spin Seebeck effect. As the contribution of a transient spin voltage in the metal Gd is minor, Gd acts akin a magnetic insulator here. This view is supported by time- and spin-resolved photoemission, which indicates that a buildup of spin voltage is suppressed by exchange scattering, leading to similar amplitudes and relaxation rates of hot majority- and minority-spin electron populations.</description>

      <title>Analog Computing with Heat: Matrix-vector Multiplication with Inverse-designed Metastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing computational demand has spurred interest in energy-efficient frameworks such as neuromorphic and analog computing. A core building block of modern applications is matrix-vector multiplication (MVM), which underpins a wide range of algorithms in both signal processing and machine learning. In this work, we propose performing MVM using inverse-designed metastructures, with heat serving as the signal carrier. The proposed approach is based on a generalization of effective thermal conductivity to systems with multiple input and output ports: The input signal is encoded as a set of applied temperatures, while the output is represented by the power collected at designated terminals. The metastructures are designed using density-based topology optimization, enabled by a differentiable thermal transport solver and automatic differentiation. We apply our methodology to optimize structures that approximate MVM for matrices of various dimensions, achieving 95.9\% accuracy for a 3$\times$3 matrix. These results highlight the potential of leveraging heat conduction for analog computing, with applications in scenarios where temperature gradients naturally occur, such as in electronic device hotspots, thermal mapping, and electronic skin.</description>

      <title>Giant Spin Pumping at Polymer/Ferromagnet Interfaces for Hybrid Spintronic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the growing utilization of polymers in flexible electronic devices has sparked significant interest in polymer/metal interfaces, spintronic studies of such interfaces remain limited. Here, we systematically study spin pumping across a polymer/ferromagnet metal interface between hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) oligomer layers ($t_\mathit{HSQ} = 30, 36, 48$ nm) and NiFe ($t_\mathit{NiFe} = 4, 5, 7, 10$ nm) thin films. Using ferromagnetic resonance measurements, we observe strong spin pumping (large linewidth broadening) and a giant spin mixing conductance, reaching 19.8~${\rm nm^{-2}}$ for HSQ = 48 nm, \emph{i.e.}~comparable to that of heavy metals. Our results suggest efficient spin transfer across the HSQ/NiFe interface, possibly originating from a combination of spin and orbital pumping, and provide valuable insights for designing self-powered and flexible spintronic devices utilizing polymers in combination with ferromagnetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar metals, materials that exhibit both electric polarization and high conductivity, can also host topological phases. Because free carriers strongly suppress distortive polar order and change the Fermi level, controlling charge dynamics is crucial for simultaneously tuning ferroelectric and topological phases in the same material. Here, we explore the experimental conditions that enable access to these phases in bismuth-doped Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Te epilayers. For samples in the topological phase at $x = 0.5$, we use terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to evaluate their complex permittivity as a function of temperature. We observe a non-monotonic variation in carrier concentration with bismuth doping, indicating a change in carrier type. By tracking the transverse optical phonon mode, we identify a ferroelectric phase transition when distortive polar order emerges below a critical temperature that depends on carrier concentration. We show that bismuth doping controls the metallicity-dependent order parameters in the softening and hardening phases. Our work demonstrates a tunable platform for engineering exotic states of matter that integrate metallicity, ferroelectricity and topology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using density functional theory simulations, this study introduces Petal-Graphyne (PLG), a novel multi-ring metallic structure composed of 4-, 8-, 10-, and 16-membered rings. Its structural, electronic, and lithium/sodium storage properties were comprehensively investigated. PLG exhibits a high theoretical capacity of 1004 mAh/g for Li, Na, and mixed Li/Na ions, surpassing conventional graphite anodes. The material remains metallic, with multiple band crossings at the Fermi level. The optimal energy barriers for Li (0.28 eV) and Na (0.25 eV) on PLG and favorable diffusion coefficients in both monolayer and multilayer configurations are unveiled. The open circuit voltages are 0.47 V for Li, 0.51 V for Na, and 0.54 V for mixed-ion storage, suggesting stable electrochemical performance. These results highlight PLG as a promising candidate for next-generation lithium and sodium-ion batteries, combining high storage capacity and efficient ion transport.</description>

      <title>Inertia-induced mechanism for giant enhancement of transport generated by active fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active matter is one of the hottest topics in physics nowadays. As a prototype of living systems operating in viscous environments it has usually been modeled in terms of the overdamped dynamics. Recently, active matter in the underdamped regime has gained a place in the spotlight. In this work we unveil another remarkable face of active matter. In doing so we demonstrate and explain an inertia-induced mechanism of giant enhancement of transport driven by active fluctuations which does emerge neither in the overdamped nor in the underdamped limit but occurs exclusively in the strong damping regime. It may be relevant not only for living systems where fluctuations generated by the metabolism are active by default but also for artificial ones, in particular for designing ultrafast micro and nano-robots. Our findings open new avenues of research in a very vibrant field of active matter.</description>

Abstract: Over the past two decades, 2D materials have rapidly evolved into a diverse and expanding family of material platforms. Many members of this materials class have demonstrated their potential to deliver transformative impact on fundamental research and technological applications across different fields. In this roadmap, we provide an overview of the key aspects of 2D material research and development, spanning synthesis, properties and commercial applications. We specifically present roadmaps for high impact 2D materials, including graphene and its derivatives, transition metal dichalcogenides, MXenes as well as their heterostructures and moir\'e systems. The discussions are organized into thematic sections covering emerging research areas (e.g., twisted electronics, moir\'e nano-optoelectronics, polaritronics, quantum photonics, and neuromorphic computing), breakthrough applications in key technologies (e.g., 2D transistors, energy storage, electrocatalysis, filtration and separation, thermal management, flexible electronics, sensing, electromagnetic interference shielding, and composites) and other important topics (computational discovery of novel materials, commercialization and standardization). This roadmap focuses on the current research landscape, future challenges and scientific and technological advances required to address, with the intent to provide useful references for promoting the development of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Nanomolding single-crystalline CoIn3 and RhIn3 nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermetallic compounds containing transition metals and group III-V metals tend to possess strong correlations and high catalytic activities, both of which can be enhanced via reduced dimensionality. Nanostructuring is an effective approach to explore this possibility, yet the synthesis of nanostructured intermetallics is challenging due to vast differences in melting points and vapor pressures of the constituent elements. In this work, we demonstrate that this challenge can be overcome with thermomechanical nanomolding (TMNM), exemplified by the synthesis of intermetallic CoIn3 and RhIn3 nanowires. We show that TMNM successfully extrudes single-crystalline nanowires of these compounds down to the 20 nm diameter range, and the nanowires remain metallic with resistivity values higher than calculated bulk resistivity. We discuss possible effects of surface roughness scattering, vacancy-induced scattering, and surface oxidation, on the measured resistivities of the nanowires. For CoIn3 nanowires, the measured resistivity values are the first reported values for this compound.</description>

      <title>Theory of spin magnetization driven by chiral phonons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a general theory of spin magnetization driven by chiral phonons under an adiabatic process, in which atoms rotate around their equilibrium positions with a low phonon frequency. Here the spin magnetization originates from the modulated electronic states with spin-orbital coupling by atomic rotations. Under the adiabatic approximation, the time-dependent spin magnetization can be calculated by a Berry-phase method. In this paper, we focus on its time average, which is evaluated by assuming that the phonon displacement is small. As a result, the time average of the spin magnetization is concisely formulated in the form of the Berry curvature defined in the phonon-displacement space as an intrinsic property of atomic rotations. Our formula for spin magnetization reflects the chiral nature of phonons, and is convenient for $ab$ $initio$ calculations.</description>

      <title>Roadmap on Nonlocality in Photonic Materials and Metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic technologies continue to drive the quest for new optical materials with unprecedented responses. A major frontier in this field is the exploration of nonlocal (spatially dispersive) materials, going beyond the local, wavevector-independent assumption traditionally made in optical material modeling. On one end, the growing interest in plasmonic, polaritonic and quantum materials has revealed naturally occurring nonlocalities, emphasizing the need for more accurate models to predict and design their optical responses. This has major implications also for topological, nonreciprocal, and time-varying systems based on these material platforms. Beyond natural materials, artificially structured materials--metamaterials and metasurfaces--can provide even stronger and engineered nonlocal effects, emerging from long-range interactions or multipolar effects. This is a rapidly expanding area in the field of photonic metamaterials, with open frontiers yet to be explored. In the case of metasurfaces, in particular, nonlocality engineering has become a powerful tool for designing strongly wavevector-dependent responses, enabling enhanced wavefront control, spatial compression, multifunctional devices, and wave-based computing. Furthermore, nonlocality and related concepts play a critical role in defining the ultimate limits of what is possible in optics, photonics, and wave physics. This Roadmap aims to survey the most exciting developments in nonlocal photonic materials, highlight new opportunities and open challenges, and chart new pathways that will drive this emerging field forward--toward new scientific discoveries and technological advancements.</description>

      <title>Complex Frequency Detection in a Subsystem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we systematically explore the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and its associated complex-frequency detection in the context of a frequency-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian arises from the self-energy correction of the subsystem and can be calculated exactly within our theoretical model, without the need for any approximations. Additionally, complex frequency detection, which encompasses complex frequency excitation, synthesis, and fingerprint, enables us to detect the physical responses induced by the complex driving frequencies. Our calculations reveal that both complex frequency excitation and synthesis are incompatible with the non-Hermitian approximation and are unable to characterize the presence or abscence of the NHSE. In contrast, the complex-frequency fingerprint successfully detects the novel responses induced by the NHSE through the introduction of a double-frequency Green's function. Our work provides a platform for studying non-Hermitian physics and their novel response in quantum systems rigorously without relying on any approximations.</description>

      <title>Stability of Majorana modes in Coulomb-disordered topological insulator nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate theoretically the possibility to realize Majorana zero modes in hybrid devices made from topological-insulator (TI) nanowires proximity-coupled to a superconductor. Such systems have been suggested as building blocks of future topological quantum computers, as they have been predicted to realize Majorana zero modes protected by large gaps. A main obstacle is, however, the presence of a relatively large density of charged impurities, $n_\text{imp}\sim 10^{19}$cm$^{-3}$. Based on extensive numerical simulations, we show that the proximity to the superconductor leads to an efficient screening of the disorder potential. By analyzing the Majorana splitting energy, the size of the Andreev gap and the localization of edge modes, we show that robust Majorana modes can be realized for realistic levels of impurity concentrations and wire radii.</description>

      <title>Entanglement scaling and charge fluctuations in a Fermi liquid of composite fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The composite fermion Fermi liquid (CFL) state at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a Landau level is a paradigmatic non-Fermi liquid borne out purely by Coulomb interactions. But in what ways is this exotic state of matter different from a Fermi liquid? The CFL entanglement entropy was indeed found to exhibit a significant enhancement compared to free electrons [Shao et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 206402 (2015)], which was subsequently ruled out as a finite-size effect by the study of a lattice CFL analog [Mishmash and Motrunich, Phys. Rev. B 94, 081110 (2016)]. Moreover, the enhancement was not observed in a quasi-one-dimensional limit of the Coulomb ground state at $\nu=1/2$ [Geraedts et al., Science 352, 197 (2016)]. Here, we revisit the problem of entanglement scaling in the CFL state realized in a two-dimensional electron gas. Using Monte Carlo evaluation of the second R\'enyi entropy $S_2$ for the CFL variational wave function, we show that the entanglement enhancement is present not only at $\nu=1/2$ but also at $\nu=1/4$, as well as in bosonic CFL states at $\nu=1$ and $\nu=1/3$ fillings. In all cases, we find the scaling of $S_2$ with subsystem size to be enhanced compared to the non-interacting case, and insensitive to the choice of geometry and projection to the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that, for CFL states, the variance of the particle number in a subsystem obeys area-law scaling with a universal subleading corner contribution, in stark contrast with free fermions. Our results establish the enhanced entanglement scaling and suppressed charge fluctuations as fingerprints of non-Fermi-liquid correlations in CFL states.</description>

      <title>Giant increase of diffusion by small rise of friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion coefficient usually decreases when friction increases. We analyze the opposite behavior in the paradigmatic system consisting of an inertial Brownian particle moving in a symmetric spatially periodic potential and driven by an unbiased time periodic force. For tailored parameter set in strong dissipation regime the particle spreading can be giantly amplified: if the friction is twice as large then the diffusion grows up to five orders of magnitude. The mechanism lying behind this effect is related to bifurcation of periodic orbits oscillating around the potential maximum and their symmetric displacement towards the adjacent potential minima when the friction coefficient increases. On the other hand, in the weak dissipation regime, where the increase of diffusion vs friction is also observed, the effect is induced by a non-monotonic change of population of the running orbits. However, in this regime the enhancement of diffusion is much smaller.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the melting phase transitions of $Fe_{n}$ nanoclusters with $10 \leq n \leq 100$ atoms are investigated using classical many-body molecular dynamics simulations. For many cluster sizes, surface melting occurs at much lower temperatures than core melting. Surface and core melting points, and energetic melting points (temperatures of maximum heat capacity, $C_v$) are calculated for all cluster sizes. Melting properties are found to be strong functions of cluster structure. Cluster sizes with closed-shell structures always have first-order-like phase transitions. Almost one-third of cluster sizes in the analyzed range exhibit second-order-like phase transitions due to the presence of multiple structural configurations close in energy. 1-shell clusters with one to a few more atoms than a neighboring closed-shell structure have very low surface melting points and very high energetic melting points compared to their closed-shell counterparts. In clusters above 50 atoms with certain core structures, melting of the surface before the core was observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezers have revolutionized particle manipulation at the micro- and nanoscale, playing a critical role in fields such as plasmonics, biophysics, and nanotechnology. While traditional optical trapping methods primarily rely on optical forces to manipulate and organize particles, recent studies suggest that optothermal traps in surfactant solutions can induce unconventional effects such as enhanced trapping stiffness and increased diffusion. Thus, there is a need for further exploration of this system to gain a deeper understanding of the forces involved. This work investigates the behaviour of gold nanoparticles confined in an optothermal trap around a heated anchor particle in a surfactant (CTAC) solution. We observe unexpected radial confinement and synchronized rotational diffusion of particles at micrometre-scale separations from the anchor particle. These dynamics differ from known optical binding and thermophoretic effects, suggesting unexplored forces facilitated by the surfactant environment. This study expands the understanding of optothermal trapping driven by anchor plasmonic particles and introduces new possibilities for nanoparticle assembly, offering insights with potential applications in nanoscale fabrication and materials science.</description>

      <title>Majorana Flat Bands in the Vortex Line of Superconducting Weyl Semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the emergence of Majorana flat bands (MFBs) in the vortex line of superconducting (SC) time-reversal-symmetry-breaking Weyl semimetals. By considering a Weyl semimetal as a stack of Chern insulators with varying Chern numbers along one ($z$) direction, we decompose the vortex bound states of SC Weyl semimetals into those of $k_{z}$-resolved SC Chern insulators. Through analytical and numerical calculations of the topological phase diagram of the SC Chern insulators, we explain the appearance of MFBs and determine the exact boundaries of them. Notably, the tuning of chemical potential or pairing strength results in the MFBs along the entire $k_{z}$ axis. To characterize the MFBs, we propose a $k_{z}$-resolved $Z_{2}$ Chern-Simons invariant as the topological indicator. Finally, we take an attractive Hubbard interaction into consideration, and the aforementioned SC Weyl semimetal with BCS pairing can be realized under appropriate parameters.</description>

      <title>Inefficiency of orbital Hall effect on the spin torque in transition metal/ferromagnet bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current induced spin torque is essential and crucial in spintronics. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin torque in transition metal(TM)/ferromagnet(FM) bilayers by using first-principles calculations and taking into account the phonon scattering at room temperature. To examine the spin and orbital Hall contribution, the studied transition metals include 5d heavy metals Pt, W, Au as well as 3d light metals Ti, V, Cr, Cu etc. We found that in TM/CoFe bilayers with typical 3d and 5d transition metals, the spin torque on CoFe mainly originates from spin Hall mechanism with the magnitude and sign of damping like torque efficiency consistent with the spin Hall conductivity. In TM/Ni bilayers, the spin torque is contributed by three mechanisms including spin and orbital Hall current in TM, as well as self-torque in Ni. The orbital Hall contribution in TM is accompanied by noteworthy opposite self spin torque in Ni, which leads to inapparent torque efficiency in Ti/Ni and V/Ni bilayers. For TM(5d heavy metal)/Ni bilayers, the spin torque induced by orbital Hall and self-torque in Ni nearly cancel each other, which makes the spin torque on Ni still align with that of the spin Hall effect in TM. Our work reveals much less efficient contribution of orbital Hall than spin Hall effect on the spin torque in transition metal/ferromagnet bilayers.</description>

      <title>Resolving space-time structures of quantum impurities with a numerically-exact algorithm using few-body revealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a numerically exact real-time evolution scheme for quantum impurities in a macroscopically large bath. The algorithm is few-body revealing, namely it identifies the electronic orbitals that can be made inactive (in a trivial product state) by a time-dependent orbital rotation. Following a quench, we show that both the number of active orbitals and their associated matrix product state bond dimensions saturate to small values, leading to an algorithm dramatically more accurate and faster than the state of the art. We are thus able to follow the dynamics for thousands of fermions, up to the long-time stationary regime, and to study subtle aspects of quantum relaxation in the spatio-temporal domain, such as the emergence of entanglement structures in the Kondo screening cloud.</description>
