      <title>Completely Integrable Foliations: Singular Locus, Invariant Curves and Topological Counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study codimension $q \geq 2$ holomorphic foliations defined in a neighborhood of a point $P$ of a complex manifold that are completely integrable, i.e. with $q$ independent meromorphic first integrals. We show that either $P$ is a regular point, a non-isolated singularity or there are infinitely many invariant analytic varieties through $P$ of the same dimension as the foliation, the so called separatrices. Moreover, we see that this phenomenon is of topological nature.
  Indeed, we introduce topological counterparts of completely integrable local holomorphic foliations and tools, specially the concept of total holonomy group, to build holomorphic first integrals if they have isolated separatrices. As a result, we provide a topological characterization of completely integrable non-degenerated elementary isolated singularities of vector fields with an isolated separatrix.</description>

      <title>Classification of polynomial models without 2-jet determination in $\mathbb{C}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An intriguing phenomenon regarding Levi-degenerate hypersurfaces is the existence of nontrivial infinitesimal symmetries with vanishing 2-jets at a point. In this work we consider polynomial models of Levi-degenerate real hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^3$ of finite Catlin multitype. Exploiting the structure of the corresponding Lie algebra, we characterize completely models without 2-jet determination, including an explicit description of their symmetry algebras.</description>

      <title>Uniformizable foliated projective structures along singular foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider holomorphic foliations by curves on compact complex manifolds, for which we investigate the existence of projective structures along the leaves varying holomorphically (foliated projective structures), that satisfy particular uniformizability properties. Our results show that the singularities of the foliation impose severe restrictions for the existence of such structures. A foliated projective structure separates the singularities of a foliation into parabolic and non-parabolic ones. For a strongly uniformizable foliated projective structure on a compact K\"ahler manifold, the existence of a single non-degenerate, non-parabolic singularity implies that the foliation is completely integrable. We establish an index theorem that imposes strong cohomological restrictions on the foliations having only non-degenerate singularities that support foliated projective structures making all of them parabolic. As an application of our results, we prove that, on a projective space of any dimension, a foliation by curves of degree at least two, with only non-degenerate singularities, does not admit a strongly uniformizable foliated projective structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we establish simple and verifiable analytical conditions for a power series f in the class K, and its associated Khinchin family, to be Gaussian. We give several moment criteria for general power series with non-negative coefficients in K and also provide several applications of these criteria.</description>

      <title>Almost holomorphic curves in real analytic hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the theory of exterior differential systems, we study the existence of germ of pseudo-holomorphic disk in a real analytic hypersurface locally defined in a complex manifold equipped with J a real analytic almost complex structure. The integrable case in C n with J the multiplication by i has been intensively studied by several authors [DF], [DA1] and [DA2] for example. The non integrable case is drastically different essentially due to the following fact : in generic case, there is no J-invariant objects of dimension bigger than one. This simple observation leads to the non existence of some equivalents of Segree varieties or ideals of holomorphic functions which play a fundamental role in the complex case. Nevertheless in the almost complex case, we adopt the exterior differential system point of view of E.Cartan developed and clarified in [BCGGG].</description>

      <title>Compact K\"ahler three-folds with nef anti-canonical bundle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that a non-projective compact K\"ahler three-fold with nef anti-canonical bundle is, up to a finite \'etale cover, one of the following: a manifold with vanishing first Chern class; the product of a K3 surface and the projective line; or a projective space bundle over a $2$-dimensional torus. This result extends Cao-H\"oring's structure theorem for projective manifolds to compact K\"ahler manifolds in dimension $3$. For the proof, we investigate the Minimal Model Program for compact K\"ahler three-folds with nef anti-canonical bundles by using the positivity of direct image sheaves, $\mathbb{Q}$-conic bundles, and orbifold vector bundles.</description>

      <title>Meromorphic Projective Structures: Signed Spaces, Grafting and Monodromy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A meromorphic quadratic differential on a compact Riemann surface defines a complex projective structure away from the poles via the Schwarzian equation. In this article we first prove the analogue of Thurston's Grafting Theorem for the space of such structures with signings at regular singularities. This extends previous work of Gupta-Mj which only considered irregular singularities. We also define a framed monodromy map from the signed space extending work of Allegretti-Bridgeland, and we characterize the PSL(2,C)-representations that arise as holonomy, generalizing results of Gupta-Mj and Faraco-Gupta. As an application of our Grafting Theorem, we also show that the monodromy map to the moduli space of framed representations (as introduced by Fock-Goncharov) is a local biholomorphism, proving a conjectured analogue of a result of Hejhal.</description>

      <title>Geometric approach for the identification of Hamiltonian systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some new Hamiltonian systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type are presented and the analogue of Okamoto's space of initial conditions computed. Using the geometric approach that was introduced originally for the identification problem of Painlev\'e equations, comparing the irreducible components of the inaccessible divisors arising in the blow-up process, we find bi-rational coordinate changes between some of these systems that give rise to the same global Hamiltonian structure. This scheme thus gives a method for identifying Hamiltonian systems up to bi-rational maps, which is performed in this article for systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type having singularities that are either square-root type algebraic poles or ordinary poles.</description>
