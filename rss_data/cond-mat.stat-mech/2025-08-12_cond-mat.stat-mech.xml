      <title>Performance of the Extended Ising Machine for the Quadratic Knapsack Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended Ising machine (EIM) enhances conventional Ising models, which handle only binary quadratic forms by allowing constraints through real-valued dependent variables. We address the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP), hard to solve using Ising machines when formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). We demonstrated the EIM's superiority by comparing it with the conventional Ising model-based approach, a commercial exact solver, and a state-of-the-art heuristic solver for QKP.</description>

      <title>A Class of Exclusion Processes Capable of Exhibiting Current Reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A century after Ising introduced the Ising measure to study equilibrium systems, its relevance has expanded well beyond equilibrium contexts, notably appearing in non-equilibrium frameworks such as the Katz--Lebowitz--Spohn (KLS) model. In this work, we investigate a class of generalized asymmetric simple exclusion processes (ASEP) for which the Ising measure serves as the stationary state. We show that the average stationary current in these models can display current reversal and other unconventional behaviors, offering new insights into transport phenomena in non-equilibrium systems. Moreover, although long-range interaction rates often give rise to long-range interactions in the potential function, our model provides a counterexample: even with long-range interactions in the dynamics, the resulting potential remains short-ranged. Finally, our framework encompasses several well-known models as special cases, including ASEP, the KLS model, the facilitated exclusion process, the cooperative exclusion process, and the assisted exchange model.</description>

      <title>Deformation of semi-circle law for the correlated time series and Phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the eigenvalue of the Wigner random matrix, which is created from a time series with temporal correlation. We observe the deformation of the semi-circle law which is similar to the eigenvalue distribution of the Wigner-L\`{e}vy matrix. The distribution has a longer tail and a higher peak than the semi-circle law. In the absence of correlation, the eigenvalue distribution of the Wigner random matrix is known as the semi-circle law in the large $N$ limit. When there is a temporal correlation, the eigenvalue distribution converges to the deformed semi-circle law which has a longer tail and a higher peak than the semi-circle law. When we created the Wigner matrix using financial time series, we test the normal i.i.d. using the Wigner matrix. We observe the difference from the semi-circle law for FX time series. The difference from the semi-circle law is explained by the temporal correlation. Here, we discuss the moments of distribution and convergence to the deformed semi-circle law with a temporal correlation. We discuss the phase transition and compare to the Marchenko-Pastur distribution(MPD) case.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence for strong emergent correlations between particles in a switching trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study a gas of $N = 8$ one-dimensional Brownian particles, each confined in a harmonic trap with identical stiffness. The stiffness switches simultaneously between two values at random Poissonian times. This collective switching drives the system into a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) with strong long-range correlations between the positions of the particles. Remarkably, we find that these switching-induced emergent correlations completely overwhelm the hydrodynamic interactions between the particles mediated via the surrounding fluid. Comparing with exact theoretical predictions for noninteracting particles, we observe excellent agreement between theory and experiments for multiple observables, including the correlations between particles, extreme value and order statistics (maxima, minima and ranked positions) and the full counting statistics (i.e., the distribution of the number of particles in a finite interval $[-L, L]$ around the trap center).</description>

      <title>Probing the limits of effective temperature consistency in actively driven systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of a single inertial probe driven into a nonequilibrium steady-state by random collisions with self-propelled active walkers. The probe and walkers are confined within a gravitational harmonic potential. We evaluate the robustness of the effective temperature concept in this active system by comparing values of distinct, independently motivated definitions: a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation, a kinetic temperature, and a work fluctuation relation. Our experiments reveal that, under specific conditions, these independent measurements yield a remarkably consistent effective temperature over a wide range of system configurations. Furthermore, we also identify regimes where this consistency breaks down, which delineates the fundamental limits of extending equilibrium-like thermodynamic concepts to athermal, actively driven systems.</description>

      <title>Supercritical fluids as a distinct state of matter characterized by sub-short-range structural order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A supercritical fluid (SCF)--the state of matter at temperatures and pressures above the critical point--exhibits properties intermediate between those of a liquid and a gas. However, whether it constitutes a fundamentally distinct phase or merely a continuous extension of the liquid and gas states remains an open question. Here we show that a SCF is defined by sub-short-range (SSR) structural order in the spatial arrangement of particles, setting it apart from the gas (disordered), liquid (short-range ordered), and solid (long-range ordered) states. The SSR structural order can be characterized by a length scale effectively quantified by the number of observable peaks in the radial distribution function. This length grows from a minimum microscopic value, on the order of the inter-particle distance at the gas-SCF boundary, to a diverging value at the SCF-liquid boundary. Based on the emergence of SSR order, we demonstrate that the transport and dynamical properties of the SCF state, including the diffusion coefficient, shear viscosity, and velocity autocorrelation function, also clearly distinguish it from both the liquid and gas states. Theoretical predictions are validated by molecular dynamics simulations of argon and further supported by existing experimental evidence. Our study confirms and assigns physical significance to the refined phase diagram of matter in the supercritical region, consisting of three distinct states (gas, supercritical fluid, and liquid) separated by two crossover boundaries that follow universal scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Singular zero-temperature system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been taken for granted that there is only one type of thermodynamic system near absolute zero temperature: the ordinary one compatible with all statements of the third law, with a fundamental yet tacit assumption that all heat capacities in the system vanish as absolute temperature approaches zero. However, in the strict sense, the statements are not mutually equivalent. Once the tacit assumption is released, the inequivalence must remain, and we may have some systems that are only compatible with one or two statements but not all, defining a singular zero-temperature system which can never be excluded from physical feasibility. We revisit some previously proposed theoretical models and identify that they belong to the singular system.</description>

      <title>Aging in a two-dimensional swarmalator crystal with delayed interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time delay can have a significant impact on the properties of collective organization of active matter. In the previous paper [1], we discussed delay-induced breathing in a system of swarmalators - a model coupling particles' internal phases to spatial interactions. Here we build on that study to investigate the aging phenomenon in this system. It is the aging of a two-dimensional crystal with defects and inhomogeneous lattice constants, and takes place after the breathing transients subside. We show that aging proceeds through the gradual elimination of five-fold and seven-fold coordination number defects, which merge pairwise or migrate to the cluster boundary, incrementally increasing the hexatic order parameter in the bulk. Despite this process, defects usually do not fully disappear; some residual number of defects remain frozen in the interior. However, we found that it is possible to achieve a nearly total elimination of coordination number defects at sufficiently low delay - when the surface of the cluster develops a sufficeintly thick fluidized ``boiling layer''. This mechanism of boundary-mediated annealing reveals a non-equilibrium pathway to achieving high crystalline order in the bulk, and raises a tantalizing possibility for controlling defects in active matter with free boundaries.</description>

      <title>Secondary finite-size effects and multi-barrier free energy landscapes in molecular simulations of hindered ion transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion transport through nanoscale channels and pores is pivotal to numerous natural processes and industrial applications. Experimental investigation of the kinetics and mechanisms of such processes is, however, hampered by the limited spatiotemporal resolution of existing experimental techniques. While molecular simulations have become indispensable for unraveling the underlying principles of nanoscale transport, they also suffer from some important technical limitations. In our previous works, we identified strong polarization-induced finite-size effects in molecular dynamics simulations of hindered ion transport, caused by spurious long-range interactions between the traversing ion and the periodic replicates of other ions. To rectify these artifacts, we introduced the Ideal Conductor/Dielectric Model (\textsc{Icdm}), which treats the system as a combination of conductors and dielectrics, and constructs an analytical correction to the translocation free energy profile. Here, we investigate some limitations of this model. Firstly, we propose a generalized approach based on Markov State models that is capable of estimating translocation timescales in the thermodynamic limit for free energy profiles with multiple comparable barriers. Second, we identify a new category of polarization-induced finite-size effects, which significantly alter the spatial distribution of non-traversing ions in smaller systems. These secondary effects cannot be corrected by the ICDM model and must be avoided by selecting sufficiently large system sizes. Additionally, we demonstrate through multiple case studies that finite-size artifacts can reverse expected trends in ion transport kinetics. Our findings underscore the necessity for careful selection of system sizes and the judicious application of the \textsc{Icdm} model to rectify residual finite-size artifacts.</description>

      <title>Sokoban Random Walk: From Environment Reshaping to Trapping Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a $\textit{Sokoban random walker}$ moving in a disordered medium with obstacle density $\rho$. In contrast to the classic model of de Gennes with static obstacles that exhibits a percolation transition, the Sokoban walker is capable of modifying its environment by pushing a few surrounding obstacles. Surprisingly, even a limited pushing ability leads to a loss of the percolation transition. Through a combination of a rigorous large-deviation calculation and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the Sokoban model belongs to the Balagurov-Vaks-Donsker-Varadhan trapping universality class. The survival probability that the walker has not yet been trapped inside a cage exhibits stretched-exponential relaxation at late times. Furthermore, using the average trap size as a proxy, we identify a new trapping transition that replaces the classical percolation transition. This transition occurs at a threshold density $\rho_* \approx 0.55$ and separates two qualitatively distinct trapping regimes: a self-trapping regime at low density, where the walker becomes dynamically localized within a self-formed trap, and a pre-existing trapping regime at high density, where confinement arises from the initial arrangement of obstacles.</description>

      <title>An effective potential for generative modelling with active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models generate samples from a complex underlying data distribution by time-reversal of a diffusion process and represent the state-of-the-art in many generative AI applications such as artificial image synthesis. Here, I show how a generative diffusion model can be implemented based on an underlying active particle process with finite correlation time. In contrast to previous approaches that use a score function acting on the velocity coordinate of the active particle, time reversal is here achieved by imposing an effective time-dependent potential on the position coordinate only. The effective potential is valid to first order in the persistence time and leads to a force field that is fully determined by the standard score function and its derivatives up to 2nd order. Numerical experiments for artificial data distributions confirm the validity of the effective potential.</description>

      <title>Identifying nonequilibrium degrees of freedom in high-dimensional stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any coarse-grained description of a nonequilibrium system should faithfully represent its latent irreversible degrees of freedom. However, standard dimensionality reduction methods typically prioritize accurate reconstruction over physical relevance. Here, we introduce a model-free approach to identify irreversible degrees of freedom in stochastic systems that are in a nonequilibrium steady state. Our method leverages the insight that a black-box classifier, trained to differentiate between forward and time-reversed trajectories, implicitly estimates the local entropy production rate. By parameterizing this classifier as a quadratic form of learned state representations, we obtain nonlinear embeddings of high-dimensional state-space dynamics, which we term Latent Embeddings of Nonequilibrium Systems (LENS). LENS effectively identifies low-dimensional irreversible flows and provides a scalable, learning-based strategy for estimating entropy production rates directly from high-dimensional time series data.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of topological zero modes on a 41-qubit superconducting processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05341v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of different exotic topological phases of quantum matter on a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processor is attracting growing interest. Here, we develop a one-dimensional 43-qubit superconducting quantum processor, named as Chuang-tzu, to simulate and characterize emergent topological states. By engineering diagonal Aubry-Andr$\acute{\mathrm{e}}$-Harper (AAH) models, we experimentally demonstrate the Hofstadter butterfly energy spectrum. Using Floquet engineering, we verify the existence of the topological zero modes in the commensurate off-diagonal AAH models, which have never been experimentally realized before. Remarkably, the qubit number over 40 in our quantum processor is large enough to capture the substantial topological features of a quantum system from its complex band structure, including Dirac points, the energy gap's closing, the difference between even and odd number of sites, and the distinction between edge and bulk states. Our results establish a versatile hybrid quantum simulation approach to exploring quantum topological systems in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Probing spin hydrodynamics on a superconducting quantum simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06565v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the nature of hydrodynamical transport properties in quantum dynamics provides valuable insights into the fundamental understanding of exotic non-equilibrium phases of matter. Experimentally simulating infinite-temperature transport on large-scale complex quantum systems is of considerable interest. Here, using a controllable and coherent superconducting quantum simulator, we experimentally realize the analog quantum circuit, which can efficiently prepare the Haar-random states, and probe spin transport at infinite temperature. We observe diffusive spin transport during the unitary evolution of the ladder-type quantum simulator with ergodic dynamics. Moreover, we explore the transport properties of the systems subjected to strong disorder or a tilted potential, revealing signatures of anomalous subdiffusion in accompany with the breakdown of thermalization. Our work demonstrates a scalable method of probing infinite-temperature spin transport on analog quantum simulators, which paves the way to study other intriguing out-of-equilibrium phenomena from the perspective of transport.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the role of information in active feedback control of quantum many-body systems using reinforcement learning. Active feedback breaks detailed balance, enabling the engineering of steady states and dynamical phases of matter otherwise inaccessible in equilibrium. We train reinforcement learning agents using partial state information to prevent entanglement spreading in (1+1)-dimensional stabilizer circuits with up to 128 qubits. We find that, above a critical information threshold, learned near-optimal strategies are non-greedy, stochastic, and reduce volume-law entangled steady states to area-law scaling. The agents achieve this by placing a series of bottlenecks that induce pyramidal structures in the long-time spatial entanglement distribution, which effectively split the system and reduce the maximum accessible entanglement. Crucially, learned strategies are inherently out of equilibrium and require real-time active feedback; we find that the learned behavior cannot be replaced by simple human-designed control rules. This work establishes the foundations for classically implemented, information-driven individual control of many interacting quantum degrees of freedom, demonstrating the capabilities of reinforcement learning to stabilize and uncover novel critical properties of many-body nonequilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Local Diffusion Models and Phases of Data Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a class of generative artificial intelligence frameworks inspired by statistical physics, diffusion models have shown extraordinary performance in synthesizing complicated data distributions through a denoising process gradually guided by score functions. Real-life data, like images, is often spatially structured in low-dimensional spaces. However, ordinary diffusion models ignore this local structure and learn spatially global score functions, which are often computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a new perspective on the phases of data distributions, which provides insight into constructing local denoisers with reduced computational costs. We define two distributions as belonging to the same data distribution phase if they can be mutually connected via spatially local operations such as local denoisers. Then, we show that the reverse denoising process consists of an early trivial phase and a late data phase, sandwiching a rapid phase transition where local denoisers must fail. To diagnose such phase transitions, we prove an information-theoretic bound on the fidelity of local denoisers based on conditional mutual information, and conduct numerical experiments in a real-world dataset. This work suggests simpler and more efficient architectures of diffusion models: far from the phase transition point, we can use small local neural networks to compute the score function; global neural networks are only necessary around the narrow time interval of phase transitions. This result also opens up new directions for studying phases of data distributions, the broader science of generative artificial intelligence, and guiding the design of neural networks inspired by physics concepts.</description>

      <title>Limiting risk to reduce inequality: insights from the Yard-Sale model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wealth inequality remains a critical socioeconomic challenge, driven by systemic dynamics and self-reinforcing mechanisms that amplify the economic imbalances. Simplified models from statistical physics provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing wealth distribution. In this study, we extend the Yard-Sale model -- a minimal kinetic exchange framework -- to investigate how limiting risk in economic transactions affects inequality. While previous research demonstrates that such models naturally lead to wealth concentration, we introduce a mechanism that restricts the maximum risk agents can assume during exchanges. Numerical simulations reveal that this modification fosters more equitable wealth distributions and significantly reduces extreme disparities. These findings highlight the importance of individual-level constraints in shaping systemic outcomes, offering new perspectives on promoting economic balance.</description>

      <title>Wealth Inequality in Agent-Based Economies: The Dominant Role of Social Protection over Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent wealth inequality, where a small fraction of the population accumulates most resources while the majority remains economically vulnerable, is a widespread phenomenon. We investigate its underlying mechanisms using an agent-based Yard-Sale model that incorporates two complementary features: transaction rules that favor poorer agents, representing social protection policies, and an economic growth process with explicit wealth redistribution. Our results reveal that social protection plays a dominant role in reducing inequality, while redistribution primarily serves to reintegrate excluded agents. These findings suggest that social protection policies, that is, targeted mechanisms favoring economically vulnerable agents, may have a substantially greater impact on reducing inequality than redistribution driven solely by economic growth. We also find that both the shape of the wealth distributions and the resulting inequality levels are strongly influenced by the underlying distribution of individual risk, highlighting the importance of considering agent heterogeneity when modeling economic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Modeling revolutions in networked societies: learning from the Tunisian spring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Economic competition and deregulation have led to a polarization of societies between a small, increasingly powerful elite and a majority of socially excluded individuals, marginalized and unconnected to political representations. This is the breeding ground for protest movements, relayed by local ties and amplified by social networks. Based on the characteristics revealed by socio-economic research into the Arab revolutions of the 2010s, this article proposes a formalization inspired by the theory of complex systems. We discuss the conditions under which an initial localized event - for example, the suicide of a street vendor condemned to ruin in a small Tunisian town - can trigger an explosion of the number of opponents to the regime, typical of a revolutionary episode. We consider a network model of agents and oppressors where pair interactions are controlled by a fear parameter, or the inclination of the individuals to rebel despite of repression. The model exhibits a phase transition at a critical threshold above which the quiescent state becomes unstable. Furthermore, the ability of individuals to forge triadic relationships accelerates the process of joining a rising rebellion, making the transition more abrupt, in the form of a brutal discontinuity that can be described as revolutionary. The imposition of a counter-revolution by the hardening of repression can be explained by the hysteresis property displayed by the model: when mobilization has extended the initial network and made it partially permanent, repression by the authorities must be tightened to higher levels than before to regain control.</description>

      <title>Response Theory for Static and Dynamic Solvation of Ionic and Dipolar Solutes in Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The response of polar solvents to ions and polar molecules dictates many fundamental molecular processes. To understand such electrostatically-driven solvation processes, one ideally would probe the dielectric response of a solvent to an idealized point test charge or dipole solute, as envisioned in classic continuum treatments of the problem. However, this is difficult in simulations using standard atomically-detailed solvent models with embedded point charges due to possible overlap with the test charge that lead to singular interaction energies. This problem is traditionally avoided for a realistic charged solute by introducing an excluded volume core that shields its embedded point charge or dipole from the charges in the solvent. However, this core introduces additional molecular-scale perturbations of the solvent density that complicate the interpretation of solvent dielectric response. In this work, we avoid these complications through the use of Gaussian-smoothed test charges and dipoles. Gaussian charges and dipoles can be readily inserted anywhere into an atomistic solvent model without encountering infinite energies. If the Gaussian-smoothing is on the scale of molecular correlations in the solvent, both the thermodynamic and dynamic solvation response is linear. Using this observation, we construct accurate predictive theories for solvation free energies and solvation dynamics for insertion of Gaussian charges and dipoles in polar solvents and demonstrate the accuracy of the theories for a widely-used model of water. Our results suggest that Gaussian test charge distributions can be used as an informative probe of dielectric response in molecular models, and our theories can be used to analytically predict the largest component of solvation free energies of charged and polar solutes.</description>

Abstract: We adapt the Edwards-Muthukumar theoretical framework for a single polymer chain to investigate the interplay between proton binding and counterion condensation for poly-acids. We find that changes to pH enable non-monotonic transitions between anti- and conventional polyelectrolyte behaviors. In the former, the net charge and the overall dimensions increase with increasing salt concentration, while the converse is true for conventional polyelectrolytes. The polymeric nature and local solvent polarization drive significant pKa shifts when compared to the values of reference monoacids. These pKa shifts are enhanced in semi-flexible chains.</description>

      <title>A Novel Computational Thermodynamics Framework with Intrinsic Chemical Short-Range Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical short-range order (SRO) provides new opportunities for tuning alloy properties, but conventional computational thermodynamics frameworks such as CALPHAD, based on Bragg-Williams mean-field approximations, cannot properly describe SRO or order-disorder transformations in multicomponent ($\geq$3) alloys. First-principles approaches combined with the cluster variation method (CVM) or cluster expansion method (CEM) can capture SRO but suffer from high computational cost. Here we present a hybrid CVM-CALPHAD framework with a thermodynamic solid solution model named as FYL-CVM, enabled by the Fowler-Yang-Li (FYL) transform to reduce the number of variables required in free-energy minimization. This achieves efficient modeling of SRO in multicomponent systems within the CALPHAD formalism. Benchmark tests on fcc AB binaries show that FYL-CVM reproduces CVM phase diagrams with much higher efficiency, while non-configurational contributions from vibrational, elastic, and electronic terms are also incorporated to capture their physical effects on order-disorder boundaries. Applied to the Cu-Au system, this method produces phase diagrams with experimental data in an efficient parameterization and elucidates the temperature-composition dependence of SRO parameters via the SRO diagram. Its applicability to ternary alloys is also demonstrated for the Cu-Au-Ag system. Overall, this framework strikes a balance between accuracy and efficiency, extends CALPHAD to account for chemical SRO, and enables a comprehensive physics-informed modeling of ordering phenomena.

      <title>How to simulate L\'evy flights in a steep potential: An explicit splitting numerical scheme</title>

Abstract: We propose an effective explicit numerical scheme for simulating solutions of stochastic differential equations with confining superlinear drift terms, driven by multiplicative heavy-tailed L\'evy noise. The scheme is designed to prevent explosion and accurately capture all finite moments of the solutions.
  In the purely Gaussian case, it correctly reproduces moments of sub-Gaussian tails of the solutions.
  This method is particularly well-suited for approximating statistical moments and other probabilistic characteristics of L\'evy flights in steep potential landscapes.</description>

      <title>Conditional splitting probabilities for hidden-state inference in drift-diffusive processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Splitting probabilities quantify the likelihood of particular outcomes out of a set of mutually-exclusive possibilities for stochastic processes and play a central role in first-passage problems. For two-dimensional Markov processes $\{X(t),Y(t)\}_{t\in T}$, a joint analogue of the splitting probabilities can be defined, which captures the likelihood that the variable $X(t)$, having been initialised at $x_0 \in \mathbb{L}$, exits $\mathbb{L}$ for the first time via either of the interval boundaries \emph{and} that the variable $Y(t)$, initialised at $y_0$, is given by $y_{\rm exit}$ at the time of exit. We compute such joint splitting probabilities for two classes of processes: processes where $X(t)$ is Brownian motion and $Y(t)$ is a decoupled internal state, and unidirectionally coupled processes where $X(t)$ is drift-diffusive and depends on $Y(t)$, while $Y(t)$ evolves independently. For the first class we obtain generic expressions in terms of the eigensystem of the Fokker-Planck operator for the $Y$ dynamics, while for the second we carry out explicit derivations for three paradigmatic cases (run-and-tumble motion, diffusion in an intermittent piecewise-linear potential and diffusion with stochastic resetting). Drawing on Bayes' theorem, we subsequently introduce the related notion of conditional splitting probabilities, defined as the posterior likelihoods of the internal state $Y$ \emph{given} that the observable degree of freedom $X$ has undergone a specific exit event. After computing these conditional splitting probabilities, we propose a simple scheme that leverages them to partially infer the assumedly hidden state $Y(t)$ from point-wise detection events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Lindblad dynamics of quantum spin systems on infinite lattices and define a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) and a time-averaged nonequilibrium steady state (TANESS) on the basis of $C^*$-algebraic formalism. Generically, the NESS on an infinite system does not equal the thermodynamic limit of NESSs on finite systems. We give a sufficient condition that they coincide with each other, in terms of both a condition number, which quantifies the normality of a Liouvillian, and some spectral gaps on finite subsystems. To appreciate the importance of the condition number, we provide an example in which the spectral gaps have nonzero lower bounds uniformly for any finite subsystems but a thermodynamic limit and a long-time limit (or a long-time average) do not commute with each other.</description>

      <title>Drag Coefficient in Near-Critical Binary Mixtures: Solving Hydrodynamic Fields with Improved Numerics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the drag coefficient of a spherical particle suspended in a near-critical binary fluid mixture. To capture the scaling behavior associated with critical adsorption in the strong adsorption regime, we employ the framework of local renormalized functional theory. Previous theoretical studies encountered numerical difficulties when attempting to solve the coupled hydrodynamic and chemical potential equations, expressed as integral equations, for systems with large bulk correlation lengths. These difficulties limited direct comparison with experimental results. In this study, we overcome those limitations by reformulating the hydrodynamic equations as a set of ordinary differential equations using a compactified radial coordinate. This approach enables more stable numerical computation and facilitates the implementation of appropriate boundary conditions at large distances from the particle. As a result, we successfully compute the drag coefficient over a broader range of bulk correlation lengths than in previous works and compare our theoretical predictions with available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Enriched Topological Phases and Their Gauging: A String-Net Model Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework for constructing exactly-solvable lattice models of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases based on an enlarged version of the string-net model. We also gauge the global symmetries of our SET models to obtain string-net models of pure topological phases. Without invoking externally imposed onsite symmetry actions, our approach promotes the string-net model of a pure topological order, specified by an input unitary fusion category $\mathscr{F}$, to an SET model, specified by a multifusion category together with a set of isomorphisms. Two complementary construction strategies are developed in the main text: (i) promotion via outer automorphisms of $\mathscr{F}$ and (ii) promotion via the Frobenius algebras of $\mathscr{F}$. The global symmetries derived via these two strategies are intrinsic to topological phases and are thus termed blood symmetries, as opposed to adopted symmetries, which can be arbitrarily imposed on topological phases. We propose the concept of symmetry-gauging family of topological phases, which are related by gauging their blood symmetries. With our approach, we construct the first explicit lattice realization of a nonabelian-symmetry-enriched topological phase -- the $S_3$ symmetry-enriched $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum-double phase. The approach further reveals the role of local excitations in SET phases and establishes their symmetry constraints.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a model in which cells belonging to two species proliferate with volume exclusion on an expanding surface. If the surface expands uniformly, we show that the domains formed by the two species present a critical behavior. We compute the critical exponents characterizing the decay of interfaces and the size distribution of domains using a mean-field theory. These mean-field exponents agree very accurately with those fitted in numerical simulations, suggesting that the theory is exact.</description>

      <title>Complex entanglement entropy for complex conformal field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal field theory underlies critical ground states of quantum many-body systems. While conventional conformal field theory is associated with positive central charges, nonunitary conformal field theory with complex-valued central charges has recently been recognized as physically relevant. Here, we demonstrate that complex-valued entanglement entropy characterizes complex conformal field theory and critical phenomena of open quantum many-body systems. This is based on non-Hermitian reduced density matrices constructed from the combination of right and left ground states. Applying the density matrix renormalization group to non-Hermitian systems, we numerically calculate the complex entanglement entropy of the non-Hermitian five-state Potts model, thereby confirming the scaling behavior predicted by complex conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology-Based Indicator of Orientational Ordering in Two-Dimensional Quasi-Particle Systems applied to Skyrmion Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) quasi-particle systems, such as magnetic skyrmions, exhibit topological phase transitions between unique 2D phases. However, to identify the phases, an easy and computationally low-cost methodology for capturing the configurational properties of lattice ordering and constructing such an appropriate descriptor that can be easily calculated is, though, not obvious. Here, we propose an indicator for topological phase transitions using persistent homology (PH). PH offers novel insights beyond conventional indicators by capturing topological features derived from the configurational properties of the lattice. The proposed persistent-homology-based topological indicator, which selectively counts stable features in a persistence diagram, effectively traces the lattice's topological changes, as confirmed by comparisons with the conventionally used measure of the ordering (the magnitude of the orientational order parameter $\langle|\Psi_6|\rangle$), typically used to identify lattice phases. We demonstrate the applicability of our indicator to experimental data, showing that it yields results consistent with those of simulations. This experimental validation highlights the robustness of the proposed method for real physical systems beyond idealized simulated systems. While our method is demonstrated in the context of skyrmion lattice systems, the approach is general and can be extended to other two-dimensional systems composed of interacting quasi-particles. As a key advantage, our indicator offers lower computational complexity than the conventionally used measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spin-$1$ Blume-Capel model on an infinite strip of the triangular lattice using the transfer-matrix method combined with a sparse-matrix factorization technique. Through finite-size scaling analysis of numerically exact spectra for strip widths up to $L = 19$, we accurately locate the tricritical point improving upon recent Monte Carlo estimates. In the first-order regime, we observe exponential scaling of the spectral gap, reflecting the linear growth of interfacial tension as the temperature decreases below the tricritical point. Finally, we validate our tricritical point estimate through precise agreement with conformal field theory predictions for the tricritical Ising universality class. Our results underscore the continued utility of the transfer-matrix approach for studying phase transitions in complex lattice models.</description>

      <title>Analytical shortcuts to adiabaticity of weakly driven processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analytical expression for shortcuts to adiabaticity for any switching time and any thermally isolated system performing a finite-time and weakly driven process is presented. It is based on the analytical solution of the optimal protocols of weak processes for open systems. The extension to adiabatic processes was made by employing the concept of waiting time. The shortcuts to adiabaticity are proven by showing that the excess power is null in all instants, indicating that no nonequilibrium excitation occurs along the driving. Two examples are solved to verify the validity of such shortcuts: the typical case of oscillatory relaxation function and the transverse-field quantum Ising chain. In this last case, it is shown that non-quenching process outperforms the quenching one by suppressing the non-equilibrium excitations until the critical point is not achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks, parameterized quantum circuits optimized under a specific cost function, provide a paradigm for achieving near-term quantum advantage in quantum information processing. Understanding QNN training dynamics is crucial for optimizing their performance, however, the role of quantum data in training for supervised learning such as classification and regression remains unclear. We reveal a quantum-data-driven dynamical transition where the target values and data determine the convergence of the training. Through analytical classification over the fixed points of the dynamical equation, we reveal a comprehensive `phase diagram' featuring seven distinct dynamics originating from a bifurcation with multiple codimension. Perturbative analyses identify both exponential and polynomial convergence class. We provide a non-perturbative theory to explain the transition via generalized restricted Haar ensemble. The analytical results are confirmed with numerical simulations and experimentation on IBM quantum devices. Our findings provide guidance on constructing the cost function to accelerate convergence in QNN training.</description>

      <title>Stochastic cloaking: concealing a region from diffusive particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce "stochastic cloaking," where a region of space is concealed from an ensemble of diffusing particles whose individual trajectories are governed by a stochastic (Langevin) equation. Our simulations reveal how different interpretations of the Langevin equation affect the cloaking performance of an annular single-layer invisibility cloak of smoothly varying diffusivity in two dimensions. Near-perfect cloaking is achieved under the Ito convention, indicated by the cloak preventing particles from accessing an inner core without disturbing the particle density outside the cloak. The cloak's performance can be further improved by regularising its singular behaviour. We believe our demonstration of stochastic cloaking is a significant milestone, comparable to earlier developments that extended cloaking from optics and acoustics to thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Wiedemann-Franz law violation in Graphene and quark-gluon plasma systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A comparative study of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the ultra-relativistic quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions with the "quasi-relativistic" massless electron-hole plasma in graphene sample has been performed. We observe that the enthalpy per net charge carriers emerges as a useful physical quantity determining the transport variables in hydrodynamic domain. Lorenz ratio is defined as thermal to electrical conductivity ratio, normalized by temperature and Lorenz number $L_{0}=\frac{\pi^{2}}{3}\left(\frac{k_{B}}{e}\right)^{2}$. The validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law can be checked by evaluating the Lorenz ratio, which is expected to be unity. We investigate the validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law by examining whether the Lorenz ratio equals unity or deviates from it. Our findings indicate that, within the fluid-based framework, the Lorenz ratio consistently leads to a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. This is attributed to the proportional relation between Lorenz ratio and enthalpy per net charge carriers in the fluid. Based on the experimental observation, graphene and quark-gluon plasma, both systems at a low net carrier density, violate the Wiedemann-Franz law due to their fluidic nature. However, graphene at a relatively high net carrier density obeys the Wiedemann-Franz law, followed by metals with high Fermi energy or electron density. It indicates a fluid to the non-fluid transition of the graphene system from low to high carrier density. In this regard, the fluid or non-fluid aspect of quark-gluon plasma at high density is yet to be explored by future facilities like Compressed Baryonic Matter and Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility experiments.</description>

      <title>Holographic Fluctuation-Dissipation Relations in Finite Density Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using real-time holography, we investigate fluctuation-dissipation relations in holographic systems at finite density. In the bulk, it corresponds to the study of scattering of a charged scalar field against a charged black hole background, leading to an exterior field theory outside the AdS Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. This theory captures dissipation (from infalling Quasi-normal modes) and fluctuations (from Hawking radiation). Here, we also develop a Witten diagrammatic framework for computing $n$-point functions for interacting charged scalars. From the boundary perspective, it gives real-time correlations of the dual CFT held at finite temperature and finite chemical potential. Our results yield (non)-linear holographic fluctuation-dissipation relations at small but finite density, which are shown to recover the correct behaviour in the zero-density limit.</description>

      <title>Work Statistics via Real-Time Effective Field Theory: Application to Work Extraction from Thermal Bath with Qubit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermal states are known to be passive, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. This paper investigates the potential for work extraction by coupling a thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermionic, or topological type, which acts as a quantum thermal state at different temperatures. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. Although the work statistics of many-body systems are known to be challenging to calculate explicitly, we propose an effective field theory approach to tackle this problem by assuming the externally driven source couples to a specific quasiparticle operator of the thermal state. We show that the work statistics can be expressed succinctly in terms of this quasiparticle's thermal spectral function. We obtain the non-perturbative work distribution function (WDF) for the pure thermal bath without the qubit coupling. With qubit coupling, we get the second-order WDF, from which the physical regime of work extraction can be pinned down precisely to help devise quantum heat engines or refrigerators. Their efficiency or coefficient of performance (COP) can be inferred from the combination of the fluctuation theorem and the first law, and we find that the spin/topological qubit-bath system generally yields a far better heat engine/refrigerator than the other two alternatives due to the underlying quantum statistics.</description>

      <title>Zipping many-body quantum states: a scalable approach to diagonal entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The outcomes of projective measurements on a quantum many-body system in a chosen basis are inherently probabilistic. The Shannon entropy of this probability distribution (the "diagonal entropy") often reveals universal features, such as the existence of a quantum phase transition. A brute-force tomographic approach to estimating this entropy scales exponentially with the system size. Here, we explore using the Lempel-Ziv lossless image compression algorithm as an efficient, scalable alternative, readily implementable in a quantum gas microscope or programmable quantum devices. We test this approach on several examples: one-dimensional quantum Ising model, and two-dimensional states that display conventional symmetry breaking due to quantum fluctuations, or strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking due to local decoherence. We also employ the diagonal mixed state to put constraints on the phase boundaries of our models. In all examples, the compression method accurately recovers the entropy density while requiring at most polynomially many images. We also analyze the singular part of the diagonal entropy density using renormalization group on a replicated action. In the 1+1-D quantum Ising model, we find that it scales as $|t| \log|t|$, where $t$ is the deviation from the critical point, while in a 2+1-D state with amplitudes proportional to the Boltzmann weight of the 2D Ising model, it follows a $t^2 \log|t|$ scaling.</description>

Abstract: The availability of open-source molecular simulation software packages allows scientists and engineers to focus on running and analyzing simulations without having to write, parallelize, and validate their own simulation software. While molecular simulations thus become accessible to a larger audience, the `black box' nature of such software packages and wide array of options and features can make it challenging to use them correctly, particularly for beginners in the topic of MD simulations. LAMMPS is one such versatile molecular simulation code, designed for modeling particle-based systems across a broad range of materials science and computational chemistry applications, including atomistic, coarse-grained, mesoscale, grid-free continuum, and discrete element models. LAMMPS is capable of efficiently running simulations of varying sizes from small desktop computers to large-scale supercomputing environments. Its flexibility and extensibility make it ideal for complex and extensive simulations of atomic and molecular systems, and beyond. This article introduces a suite of tutorials designed to make learning LAMMPS more accessible to new users. The first four tutorials cover the basics of running molecular simulations in LAMMPS with systems of varying complexities. The second four tutorials address more advanced molecular simulation techniques, specifically the use of a reactive force field, grand canonical Monte Carlo, enhanced sampling, and the REACTER protocol. In addition, we introduce LAMMPS-GUI, an enhanced cross-platform graphical text editor specifically designed for use with LAMMPS and able to run LAMMPS directly on the edited input. LAMMPS-GUI is used as the primary tool in the tutorials to edit inputs, run LAMMPS, extract data, and visualize the simulated systems.</description>

      <title>Accurate Gauge-Invariant Tensor Network Simulations for Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory in (2+1)D: ground state and real-time dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel tensor network method to achieve accurate and efficient simulations of Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in (2+1)D for both ground state and real-time dynamics. The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which already simplifies existing algorithms for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining with variational Monte Carlo (VMC), enabling efficient computations for (2+1)D LGTs. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate ground state simulation of pure $Z_2$, $Z_3$ and $Z_4$ gauge theory, odd-$Z_2$ gauge theories, and $Z_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32 \times 32$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it allows for accurate simulations of real-time dynamics up to long-time, exemplified by the dynamics of elementary excitations of the deconfined $Z_2$ gauge field on a $10\times10$ lattice. This is also the first example of using VMC to simulate the real-time dynamics of PEPS, whose impact may extend beyond gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Coupled Entropy: A Goldilocks Generalization for Complex Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupled entropy is proven to correct a flaw in the derivation of the Tsallis entropy and thereby solidify the theoretical foundations for analyzing the uncertainty of complex systems. The Tsallis entropy originated from considering power probabilities $p_i^q$ in which \textit{q} independent, identically-distributed random variables share the same state. The maximum entropy distribution was derived to be a \textit{q}-exponential, which is a member of the shape ($\kappa$), scale ($\sigma$) distributions. Unfortunately, the $q$-exponential parameters were treated as though valid substitutes for the shape and scale. This flaw causes a misinterpretation of the generalized temperature and an imprecise derivation of the generalized entropy. The coupled entropy is derived from the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) and the Student's t distribution, whose shape derives from nonlinear sources and scale derives from linear sources of uncertainty. The Tsallis entropy of the GPD converges to one as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$, which makes it too cold. The normalized Tsallis entropy (NTE) introduces a nonlinear term multiplying the scale and the coupling, making it too hot. The coupled entropy provides perfect balance, ranging from $\ln \sigma$ for $\kappa=0$ to $\sigma$ as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$. One could say, the coupled entropy allows scientists, engineers, and analysts to eat their porridge, confident that its measure of uncertainty reflects the mathematical physics of the scale of non-exponential distributions while minimizing the dependence on the shape or nonlinear coupling. Examples of complex systems design including a coupled variation inference algorithm are reviewed.</description>

Abstract: The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable, physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By disentangling emergence from vague overuse, we emphasize its role as a rigorous tool for understanding complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds for the connective constant of weighted self-avoiding walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01993</link>

Abstract: Building on an earlier work by Alm, we consider a model of weighted self-avoiding walks on a generic lattice and develop a method for computing upper bounds on the corresponding weighted connective constant, which we implement in a publicly available software package. The bounds are obtained as the dominant eigenvalues of certain matrices and provide detailed information about the convergence of the model's multivariate generating function. We discuss potential applications of our results to developing Peierls-type estimates for anisotropic contour models in statistical physics, generalizing a technique recently introduced by Fahrbach--Randall.</description>

      <title>Comparative molecular dynamics simulations of charged solid-liquid interfaces with different water models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aqueous solid-liquid interfaces (SLI) are ubiquitous in nature and technology, often hosting molecular-level processes with macroscopic consequences. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a tool of choice to investigate interfacial phenomena with atomistic precision, but there exists a large number of water models, each optimised for a different purpose. Here we compare the ability of common water models to accurately simulate the interface between a charged silica surface and an aqueous solution containing NaCl. We first compare the bulk dielectric constant of water and its dependence on salt concentration for SPC/Fw, SPC/e, TIPS3p, H2O/DC, TIP3P-Fw, OPC3, TIP3P, TIP3P-FB, TIP3P-ST, FBA/e, and TIPS3p-PPPM, revealing large variations between models. Simulating the interface with silica for the most suitable water models (SPC/Fw, H2O/DC, TIP3-ST and TIPS3p-PPPM) show some intrinsic consistency with continuum predictions (Poisson-Boltzmann) whereby the free energy minima obtained from MD and the analytical model are in agreement, provided the latter includes the MD-determined total charge of ions in the Stern layer and dielectric constant. This consistency stands even for water models with a dielectric constant off by 100%. For salt concentrations higher than 0.21 M NaCl, the formation of random ion-ion pairs limits the reproducibility of the MD results and the applicability of the analytical method. The results highlight the applicability of the analytical model down to the nanoscale, provided a priory knowledge of the Stern layer charge is available. The findings could have significant implications for MD simulations of SLIs, especially at charged or electrified interfaces.</description>

      <title>Odd elasticity in disordered chiral active materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral active materials are abundant in nature, including the cytoskeleton with attached motor proteins, rotary clusters of bacteria flagella, and self-spinning starfish embryos. These materials break both time reversal and mirror-image (parity) symmetries due to injection of torques at the microscale. Recently, it was found that chiral active materials may show a new type of elastic response termed `odd' elasticity. Currently, odd elasticity is understood microscopically only in ordered structures, e.g., lattice designs of metamaterials. It still remains to explore how odd elasticity can emerge in natural or biological systems, which are usually disordered. To address this, we propose a minimal generic model for disordered `odd solids', using micropolar (Cosserat) elasticity in the presence of local active torques. We find that odd elasticity naturally emerges as a nonlinear effect of internal particle rotations. Exploring the viscoelasticity of this solid, when immersed in active self-spinning solvent (`odd fluid'), we discover both dynamically unstable regions and regions in which bulk waves can propagate even in an overdamped solid.</description>
