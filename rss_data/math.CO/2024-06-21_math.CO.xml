      <title>Metered Parking Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of parking functions called $t$-metered $(m,n)$-parking functions, in which one of $m$ cars parks among $n$ spots per hour then leaves after $t$ hours. We characterize and enumerate these sequences for $t=1$, $t=m-2$, and $t=n-1$, and provide data for other cases. We characterize the $1$-metered parking functions by decomposing them into sections based on which cars are unlucky, and enumerate them using a Lucas sequence recursion. Additionally, we establish a new combinatorial interpretation of the numerator of the continued fraction $n-1/(n-1/\cdots)$ ($n$ times) as the number of $1$-metered $(n,n)$-parking functions. We introduce the $(m,n)$-parking function shuffle in order to count $(m-2)$-metered $(m,n)$-parking functions, which also yields an expression for the number of $(m,n)$-parking functions with any given first entry. As a special case, we find that the number of $(m-2)$-metered $(m, m-1)$-parking functions is equal to the sum of the first entries of classical parking function of length $m-1$. We enumerate the $(n-1)$-metered $(m,n)$-parking functions in terms of the number of classical parking functions of length $n$ with certain parking outcomes, which we show are periodic sequences with period $n$. We conclude with an array of open problems.</description>

      <title>The isoperimetric peak of complete trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give exact values and bounds on the isoperimetric peak of complete trees, improving on known results. For the complete $q$-ary tree of depth $d$, if $q\ge 5$, then we find that the isoperimetric peak equals $d$, completing an open problem. In the case that $q$ is 3 or 4, we determine the value up to three values, and in the case $q=2$, up to a logarithmic additive factor. Our proofs use novel compression techniques, including left, down, and aeolian compressions. We apply our results to show that the vertex separation number and the isoperimetric peak of a graph may be arbitrarily far apart as a function of the order of the graph and give new bounds on the pathwidth and pursuit-evasion parameters on complete trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider labelings of a finite regular tree by a finite alphabet subject to restrictions specified by a nonnegative transition matrix, propose an algorithm for determining whether the set of possible configurations on the last row of the tree is independent of the symbol at the root, and prove that the algorithm succeeds in a bounded number of steps, provided that the dimension of the tree is greater than or equal to the maximum row sum of the transition matrix. (The question was motivated by calculation of topological pressure on trees and is an extension of the idea of primitivity for nonnegative matrices.)</description>

      <title>A spectral Erd\H{o}s-Faudree-Rousseau theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known theorem of Mantel states that every $n$-vertex graph with more than $\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor $ edges contains a triangle. An interesting problem in extremal graph theory studies the minimum number of edges contained in triangles among graphs with a prescribed number of vertices and edges. Erd\H{o}s, Faudree and Rousseau (1992) showed that a graph on $n$ vertices with more than $\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor $ edges contains at least $2\lfloor n/2\rfloor +1$ edges in triangles. Such edges are called triangular edges. In this paper, we present a spectral version of the result of Erd\H{o}s, Faudree and Rousseau. Using the supersaturation-stability and the spectral technique, we prove that every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\lambda (G) \ge \sqrt{\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor}$ contains at least $2 \lfloor {n}/{2} \rfloor -1$ triangular edges, unless $G$ is a balanced complete bipartite graph. The method in our paper has some interesting applications. Firstly, the supersaturation-stability can be used to revisit a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s concerning with the booksize of a graph, which was initially proved by Edwards (unpublished), and independently by Khad\v{z}iivanov and Nikiforov (1979). Secondly, our method can improve the bound on the order $n$ of a graph by dropping the condition on $n$ being sufficiently large, which is obtained from the triangle removal lemma. Thirdly, the supersaturation-stability can be applied to deal with the spectral extremal graph problems on counting triangles, which was recently studied by Ning and Zhai (2023).</description>

      <title>On dual-ABAB-free and related hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric motivations warranted the study of hypergraphs on ordered vertices that have no pair of hyperedges that induce an alternation of some given length. Such hypergraphs are called ABA-free, ABAB-free and so on. Since then various coloring and other combinatorial results were proved about these families of hypergraphs. We prove a characterization in terms of their incidence matrices which avoids using the ordering of the vertices. Using this characterization, we prove new results about the dual hypergraphs of ABAB-free hypergraphs. In particular, we show that dual-ABAB-free hypergraphs are not always proper $2$-colorable even if we restrict ourselves to hyperedges that are larger than some parameter $m$.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap percolation on the high-dimensional Hamming graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the random $r$-neighbour bootstrap percolation process on a graph $G$, a set of initially infected vertices is chosen at random by retaining each vertex of $G$ independently with probability $p\in (0,1)$, and "healthy" vertices get infected in subsequent rounds if they have at least $r$ infected neighbours. A graph $G$ \emph{percolates} if every vertex becomes eventually infected. A central problem in this process is to determine the critical probability $p_c(G,r)$, at which the probability that $G$ percolates passes through one half. In this paper, we study random $2$-neighbour bootstrap percolation on the $n$-dimensional Hamming graph $\square_{i=1}^n K_k$, which is the graph obtained by taking the Cartesian product of $n$ copies of the complete graph $K_k$ on $k$ vertices. We extend a result of Balogh and Bollob\'{a}s [Bootstrap percolation on the hypercube, Probab. Theory Related Fields. 134 (2006), no. 4, 624-648. MR2214907] about the asymptotic value of the critical probability $p_c(Q^n,2)$ for random $2$-neighbour bootstrap percolation on the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q^n=\square_{i=1}^n K_2$ to the $n$-dimensional Hamming graph $\square_{i=1}^n K_k$, determining the asymptotic value of $p_c\left(\square_{i=1}^n K_k,2\right)$, up to multiplicative constants (when $n \rightarrow \infty$), for arbitrary $k \in \mathbb N$ satisfying $2 \leq k\leq 2^{\sqrt{n}}$.</description>

      <title>When $t$-intersecting hypergraphs admit bounded $c$-strong colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $c$-strong chromatic number of a hypergraph is the smallest number of colours needed to colour its vertices so that every edge sees at least $c$ colours or is rainbow. We show that every $t$-intersecting hypergraph has bounded $(t + 1)$-strong chromatic number, resolving a problem of Blais, Weinstein and Yoshida. In fact, we characterise when a $t$-intersecting hypergraph has large $c$-strong chromatic number for $c\geq t+2$. Our characterisation also applies to hypergraphs which exclude sunflowers with specified parameters.</description>

      <title>Johnson graphs as slices of a hypercube and an algebra homomorphism from the universal Racah algebra into $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the viewpoint of Johnson graphs as slices of a hypercube, we derive a novel algebra homomorphism $\sharp$ from the universal Racah algebra $\Re$ into $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. We use the Casimir elements of $\Re$ to describe the kernel of $\sharp$. By pulling back via $\sharp$ every $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-module can be viewed as an $\Re$-module. We show that for any finite-dimensional $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-module $V$, the $\Re$-module $V$ is completely reducible and three generators of $\Re$ act on every irreducible $\Re$-submodule of $V$ as a Leonard triple. In particular, Leonard triples can be constructed in terms of the second dual distance operator of the hypercube $H(D,2)$ and a decomposition of the second distance operator of $H(D,2)$ induced by Johnson graphs.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of maps with tight boundaries and the Zhukovsky transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider maps with tight boundaries, i.e. maps whose boundaries have minimal length in their homotopy class, and discuss the properties of their generating functions $T^{(g)}_{\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n}$ for fixed genus $g$ and prescribed boundary lengths $\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n$, with a control on the degrees of inner faces. We find that these series appear as coefficients in the expansion of $\omega^{(g)}_n(z_1,\ldots,z_n)$, a fundamental quantity in the Eynard-Orantin theory of topological recursion, thereby providing a combinatorial interpretation of the Zhukovsky transformation used in this context. This interpretation results from the so-called trumpet decomposition of maps with arbitrary boundaries. In the planar bipartite case, we obtain a fully explicit formula for $T^{(0)}_{2\ell_1,\ldots,2\ell_n}$ from the Collet-Fusy formula. We also find recursion relations satisfied by $T^{(g)}_{\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n}$, which consist in adding an extra tight boundary, keeping the genus $g$ fixed. Building on a result of Norbury and Scott, we show that $T^{(g)}_{\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_n}$ is equal to a parity-dependent quasi-polynomial in $\ell_1^2,\ldots,\ell_n^2$ times a simple power of the basic generating function $R$. In passing, we provide a bijective derivation in the case $(g,n)=(0,3)$, generalizing a recent construction of ours to the non bipartite case.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Perspective on the Noncommutative Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The noncommutative symmetric functions $\textbf{NSym}$ were first defined abstractly by Gelfand et al. in 1995 as the free associative algebra generated by noncommuting indeterminants $\{\boldsymbol{e}_n\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ that were taken as a noncommutative analogue of the elementary symmetric functions. The resulting space was thus a variation on the traditional symmetric functions $\Lambda$. Giving noncommutative analogues of generating function relations for other bases of $\Lambda$ allowed Gelfand et al. to define additional bases of $\textbf{NSym}$ and then determine change-of-basis formulas using quasideterminants. In this paper, we aim for a self-contained exposition that expresses these bases concretely as functions in infinitely many noncommuting variables and avoids quasideterminants. Additionally, we look at the noncommutative analogues of two different interpretations of change-of-basis in $\Lambda$: both as a product of a minimal number of matrices, mimicking Macdonald's exposition of $\Lambda$ in Symmetric Functions and Hall Polynomials, and as statistics on brick tabloids, as in work by E\u{g}ecio\u{g}lu and Remmel, 1990.</description>

      <title>On the maximum $F$-free induced subgraphs in $K_t$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For graphs $F$ and $H$, let $f_{F,H}(n)$ be the minimum possible size of a maximum $F$-free induced subgraph in an $n$-vertex $H$-free graph. This notion generalizes the Ramsey function and the Erd\H{o}s--Rogers function. Establishing a container lemma for the $F$-free subgraphs, we give a general upper bound on $f_{F,H}(n)$, assuming the existence of certain locally dense $H$-free graphs. In particular, we prove that for every graph $F$ with $\mathrm{ex}(m,F) = O(m^{1+\alpha})$, where $\alpha \in [0,1/2)$, we have
  \[
  f_{F, K_3}(n) = O\left(n^{\frac{1}{2-\alpha}}\left(\log n\right)^{\frac{3}{2-
  \alpha}}\right)
  \quad
  \textrm{and}
  \quad
  f_{F, K_4}(n) = O\left(n^{\frac{1}{3-2\alpha}}\left(\log n\right)^{\frac{6}{3-2\alpha}}\right).
  \] For the cases where $F$ is a complete multipartite graph, letting $s = \sum_{i=1}^r s_i$, we prove that
  \[
  f_{K_{s_1,\ldots,s_r}, K_{r+2}}(n) = O \left( n^{\frac{2s -3}{4s -5}} (\log n)^{3} \right).
  \]
  We also make an observation which improves the bounds of $\mathrm{ex}(G(n,p),C_4)$ by a polylogarithmic factor.</description>

      <title>The extended reverse ultra log-concavity of transposed Boros-Moll sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boros-Moll sequences $\{d_\ell(m)\}_{\ell=0}^m$ arise in the study of evaluation of a quartic integral. After the infinite log-concavity conjecture of the sequence $\{d_\ell(m)\}_{\ell=0}^m$ was proposed by Boros and Moll, a lot of interesting inequalities on $d_\ell(m)$ were obtained, although the conjecture is still open. Since $d_\ell(m)$ has two parameters, it is natural to consider the properties for the sequences $\{d_\ell(m)\}_{m\ge \ell}$, which are called the \emph{transposed Boros-Moll sequences} here. In this paper, we mainly prove the extended reverse ultra log-concavity of the transposed Boros-Moll sequences $\{d_\ell(m)\}_{m\ge \ell}$, and hence give an upper bound for the ratio ${d_\ell^2(m)}/{(d_\ell(m-1)d_\ell(m+1))}$. A lower bound for this ratio is also established which implies a result stronger than the log-concavity of the sequences $\{d_\ell(m)\}_{m\ge \ell}$. As a consequence, we also show that the transposed Boros-Moll sequences possess a stronger log-concave property than the Boros-Moll sequences do. At last, we propose some conjectures on the Boros-Moll sequences and their transposes.</description>

      <title>Answers to questions about medial layer graphs of self-dual regular and chiral polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An abstract $n$-polytope $\mathcal{P}$ is a partially-ordered set which captures important properties of a geometric polytope, for any dimension $n$. For even $n \ge 2$, the incidences between elements in the middle two layers of the Hasse diagram of $\mathcal{P}$ give rise to the medial layer graph of $\mathcal{P}$, denoted by $\mathcal{G} = \mathcal{G}(\mathcal{P})$. If $n=4$, and $\mathcal{P}$ is both highly symmetric and self-dual of type $\{p,q,p\}$, then a Cayley graph $\mathcal{C}$ covering $\mathcal{G}$ can be constructed on a group of polarities of $\mathcal{P}$. In this paper we address some open questions about the relationship between $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{C}$ that were raised in a 2008 paper by Monson and Weiss, and describe some interesting examples of these graphs. In particular, we give the first known examples of improperly self-dual chiral polytopes of type $\{3,q,3\}$, which are also among the very few known examples of highly symmetric self-dual finite polytopes that do not admit a polarity. Also we show that if $p=3$ then $\mathcal{C}$ cannot have a higher degree of $s$-arc-transitivity than $\mathcal{G}$, and we present a family of regular $4$-polytopes of type $\{6,q,6\}$ for which the vertex-stabilisers in the automorphism group of $\mathcal{C}$ are larger than those for $\mathcal{G}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of signed combinatorial interpretations for several large families of structure constants. These families include standard bases of symmetric and quasisymmetric polynomials, as well as various bases in Schubert theory. The results are stated in the language of computational complexity, while the proofs are based on the effective M\"obius inversion.</description>

      <title>A note on the threshold numbers of cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G=(V,E)$ is said to be a \textit{$k$-threshold graph} with \textit{thresholds} $\theta_1&lt;\theta_2&lt;...&lt;\theta_k$ if there is a map $r: V \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $uv\in E$ if and only if $\theta_i\le r(u)+r(v)$ holds for an odd number of $i\in [k]$. The \textit{threshold number} of $G$, denoted by $\Theta(G)$, is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $G$ is a $k$-threshold graph. In this paper, we determine the exact threshold numbers of cycles by proving
  \[ \Theta(C_n)=\begin{cases}
  1 &amp; if\ n=3,
  2 &amp; if\ n=4,
  4 &amp; if\ n\ge 5,
  \end{cases}
  \]
  where $C_n$ is the cycle with $n$ vertices.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Decomposition of Knapsack Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on knapsack cones, a specific type of simplicial cones that arise naturally in the context of the knapsack problem $x_1 a_1 + \cdots + x_n a_n = a_0$. We present a novel combinatorial decomposition for these cones, named \texttt{DecDenu}, which aligns with Barvinok's unimodular cone decomposition within the broader framework of Algebraic Combinatorics. Computer experiments support us to conjecture that our \texttt{DecDenu} algorithm is polynomial when the number of variables $n$ is fixed. If true, \texttt{DecDenu} will provide the first alternative polynomial algorithm for Barvinok's unimodular cone decomposition, at least for denumerant cones.
  The \texttt{CTEuclid} algorithm is designed for MacMahon's partition analysis, and is notable for being the first algorithm to solve the counting problem for Magic squares of order 6. We have enhanced the \texttt{CTEuclid} algorithm by incorporating \texttt{DecDenu}, resulting in the \texttt{LLLCTEuclid} algorithm. This enhanced algorithm makes significant use of LLL's algorithm and stands out as an effective elimination-based approach.</description>

      <title>Transversal Hamilton paths and cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a collection $\mathcal{G} =\{G_1,G_2,\dots,G_m\}$ of graphs on the common vertex set $V$ of size $n$, an $m$-edge graph $H$ on the same vertex set $V$ is transversal in $\mathcal{G}$ if there exists a bijection $\varphi :E(H)\rightarrow [m]$ such that $e \in E(G_{\varphi(e)})$ for all $e\in E(H)$. Denote $\delta(\mathcal{G}):=\operatorname*{min}\left\{\delta(G_i): i\in [m]\right\}$. In this paper, we first establish a minimum degree condition for the existence of transversal Hamilton paths in $\mathcal{G}$: if $n=m+1$ and $\delta(\mathcal{G})\geq \frac{n-1}{2}$, then $\mathcal{G}$ contains a transversal Hamilton path. This solves a problem proposed by [Li, Li and Li, J. Graph Theory, 2023]. As a continuation of the transversal version of Dirac's theorem [Joos and Kim, Bull. Lond. Math. Soc., 2020] and the stability result for transversal Hamilton cycles [Cheng and Staden, arXiv:2403.09913v1], our second result characterizes all graph collections with minimum degree at least $\frac{n}{2}-1$ and without transversal Hamilton cycles. We obtain an analogous result for transversal Hamilton paths. The proof is a combination of the stability result for transversal Hamilton paths or cycles, transversal blow-up lemma, along with some structural analysis.</description>

      <title>Average edge order of normal $3$-pseudomanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their work [9], Feng Luo and Richard Stong introduced the concept of the average edge order, denoted as $\mu_0(K)$. They demonstrated that if $\mu_0(K)\leq \frac{9}{2}$ for a closed $3$-manifold $K$, then $K$ must be a sphere. Building upon this foundation, Makoto Tamura extended similar results to $3$-manifolds with non-empty boundaries in [10, 11]. In our present study, we extend these findings to normal $3$-pseudomanifolds. Specifically, we establish that for a normal $3$-pseudomanifold $K$ with singularities, $\mu_0(K)\geq\frac{30}{7}$. Moreover, equality holds if and only if $K$ is a one-vertex suspension of $\mathbb{RP}^2$ with seven vertices. Furthermore, we establish that when $\frac{30}{7}\leq\mu_0(K)\leq\frac{9}{2}$, the $3$-pseudomanifold $K$ can be derived from some boundary complexes of $4$-simplices by a sequence of possible operations, including connected sums, bistellar $1$-moves, edge contractions, edge expansions, vertex folding, and edge folding. In the end, we discuss some normal $3$-pseudomanifolds exhibiting higher average edge orders.</description>

      <title>Tight bounds for rainbow partial $F$-tiling in edge-colored complete hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an $r$-graph $F$ and integers $n,t$ satisfying $t \le n/v(F)$, let $\mathrm{ar}(n,tF)$ denote the minimum integer $N$ such that every edge-coloring of $K_{n}^{r}$ using $N$ colors contains a rainbow copy of $tF$, where $tF$ is the $r$-graphs consisting of $t$ vertex-disjoint copies of $F$. The case $t=1$ is the classical anti-Ramsey problem proposed by Erd\H{o}s--Simonovits--S\'{o}s~\cite{ESS75}. When $F$ is a single edge, this becomes the rainbow matching problem introduced by Schiermeyer~\cite{Sch04} and \"{O}zkahya--Young~\cite{OY13}. We conduct a systematic study of $\mathrm{ar}(n,tF)$ for the case where $t$ is much smaller than $\mathrm{ex}(n,F)/n^{r-1}$. Our first main result provides a reduction of $\mathrm{ar}(n,tF)$ to $\mathrm{ar}(n,2F)$ when $F$ is bounded and smooth, two properties satisfied by most previously studied hypergraphs. Complementing the first result, the second main result, which utilizes gaps between Tur\'{a}n numbers, determines $\mathrm{ar}(n,tF)$ for relatively smaller $t$. Together, these two results determine $\mathrm{ar}(n,tF)$ for a large class of hypergraphs. Additionally, the latter result has the advantage of being applicable to hypergraphs with unknown Tur\'{a}n densities, such as the famous tetrahedron $K_{4}^{3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multidimensional nonnegative matrix is called polystochastic if the sum of entries in each line is equal to $1$. The set of all polystochastic matrices of order $n$ and dimension $d$ is a convex polytope $\Omega_n^d$. In the present paper, we compare known bounds on the number of vertices of the polytope $\Omega_n^d$ and prove that the number of vertices of $\Omega_3^d$ is doubly exponential on $d$.</description>

      <title>Chromatic number of randomly augmented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extension of the Erd\H{o}s-Renyi random graph model $G_{n,p}$ is the model of perturbed graphs introduced by Bohman, Frieze and Martin (Bohman, Frieze, Martin 2003). This is a special case of the model of randomly augmented graphs studied in this paper. An augmented graph denoted by $pert_{H,p}$ is the union of a deterministic host graph and a random graph $G_{n,p}$. Among the first problems in perturbed graphs has been the question how many random edges are needed to ensure Hamiltonicity of the graph. This question was answered in the paper by Bohman, Frieze and Martin. The host graph is often chosen to be a dense graph. In recent years several papers on combinatorial problems in perturbed graphs were published, e.g. on the emergence of powers of Hamiltonian cycles (Dudek, Reiher, Ruci\'nski, Schacht 2020), some positional games played on perturbed graphs (Clemens, Hamann, Mogge, Parczyk, 2020) and the behavior of multiple invariants e.g. fixed clique size (Bohman, Frieze, Krivelevich, Martin, 2004). In this paper we study the chromatic number of randomly augmented graphs. We concentrate on a host graph $H$ with chromatic number $o(n)$, augmented by a $G_{n,p}$ with $n^{-\frac{1}{3} + \delta}\leq p(n) \leq 1-\delta$ for some $\delta \in (0,1)$. Our main result is an upper bound for the chromatic number: we show that asymptotically almost surely $\chi(pert_{H,p}) \leq (1+o(1)) \cdot \frac{n \log(b)}{2 (\log(n) - \log(\chi(H))}$ where $b = (1-p)^{-1}$. This result collapses to the famous theorem of Bollob\'as (1988), when $H$ is the empty host graph, thus our result can be regarded as a generalization of the latter. Our proof is not constructive. Further, we give a constructive coloring algorithm, when the chromatic number of the host graph is at most $\frac{n}{\log(n)^{\alpha}},$ $\alpha&gt;\frac{1}{2}.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we characterize tropical bases as sets of circuits that by orthogonality determine the set of cocircuits of a simple matroid. Furthermore, we show that any circuit, which itself is closed, must be contained in any tropical basis. This yields a characterization of simple matroids which have a unique minimal tropical basis, giving a solution for a problem posted in the Matroid Union Blog.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for closed-trailable in digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A digraph $D$ with a subset $S$ of $V(D)$ is called $\boldsymbol{S}${\bf -strong} if for every pair of distinct vertices $u$ and $v$ of $S$, there is a $(u, v)$-dipath and a $(v, u)$-dipath in $D$. We define a digraph $D$ with a subset $S$ of $V(D)$ to be $\boldsymbol{S}${\bf -strictly strong} if there exist two nonadjacent vertices $u,v\in S$ such that $D$ contains a closed ditrail through the vertices $u$ and $v$; and define a subset $S\subseteq V(D)$ to be {\bf closed-trailable} if $D$ contains a closed ditrail through all the vertices of $S$. In this paper, we prove that for a digraph $D$ with $n$ vertices and a subset $S$ of $V(D)$, if $D$ is $S$-strong and if $d(u) + d(v)\geq 2n -3$ for any two nonadjacent vertices $u,v$ of $S$, then $S$ is closed-trailable. This result generalizes the theorem of Bang-Jensen et al. \cite{BaMa14} on supereulerianity. Moveover, we show that for a digraph $D$ and a subset $S$ of $V(D)$, if $D$ is $S$-strictly strong and if $\delta^0(D\langle S\rangle)\geq\alpha'(D\langle S\rangle)&gt;0$, where $\delta^0(D\langle S\rangle)$ is the minimum semi-degree of $D\langle S\rangle$ and $\alpha'(D\langle S\rangle)$ is the matching number of $D\langle S\rangle$, then $S$ is closed-trailable. This result generalizes the theorem of Algefari et al. \cite{AlLa15} on supereulerianity.</description>

      <title>On $k$-uniform tight cycles: the Ramsey number for $C_{kn}^{(k)}$ and an approximate Lehel's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-uniform tight cycle is a $k$-graph with a cyclic ordering of its vertices such that its edges are precisely the sets of $k$ consecutive vertices in that ordering. We show that, for each $k \geq 3$, the Ramsey number of the $k$-uniform tight cycle on $kn$ vertices is $(1+o(1))(k+1)n$. This is an extension to all uniformities of previous results for $k = 3$ by Haxell, {\L}uczak, Peng, R\"odl, Ruci\'nski, and Skokan and for $k = 4$ by Lo and the author and confirms a special case of a conjecture by the former set of authors.
  Lehel's conjecture, which was proved by Bessy and Thomass\'e, states that every red-blue edge-coloured complete graph contains a red cycle and a blue cycle that are vertex-disjoint and together cover all the vertices. We also prove an approximate version of this for $k$-uniform tight cycles. We show that, for every $k \geq 3$, every red-blue edge-coloured complete $k$-graph on $n$ vertices contains a red tight cycle and a blue tight cycle that are vertex-disjoint and together cover $n - o(n)$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Local symmetries in partially ordered sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially ordered sets (posets) have a universal appearance as an abstract structure in many areas of mathematics. Though, even their explicit enumeration remains unknown in general, and only the counts of all partial orders on sets of up to 16 unlabelled elements have been calculated to date, see sequence A000112 in the OEIS.
  In this work, we study automorphisms of posets in order to formulate a classification by local symmetries. These symmetries give rise to a division operation on the set of all posets and lead us to the construction of symmetry classes that are easier to characterise and enumerate. Additionally to the enumeration of symmetry classes, I derive polynomial expressions that count certain subsets of posets with a large number of layers (a large height). As an application in physics, I investigate local symmetries (or rather their lack of) in causal sets, which are discrete spacetime models used as a candidate framework for quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Randomized Greedy Online Edge Coloring Succeeds for Dense and Randomly-Ordered Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vizing's theorem states that any graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ can be properly edge colored with at most $\Delta+1$ colors. In the online setting, it has been a matter of interest to find an algorithm that can properly edge color any graph on $n$ vertices with maximum degree $\Delta = \omega(\log n)$ using at most $(1+o(1))\Delta$ colors. Here we study the na\"{i}ve random greedy algorithm, which simply chooses a legal color uniformly at random for each edge upon arrival. We show that this algorithm can $(1+\epsilon)\Delta$-color the graph for arbitrary $\epsilon$ in two contexts: first, if the edges arrive in a uniformly random order, and second, if the edges arrive in an adversarial order but the graph is sufficiently dense, i.e., $n = O(\Delta)$. Prior to this work, the random greedy algorithm was only known to succeed in trees.
  Our second result is applicable even when the adversary is adaptive, and therefore implies the existence of a deterministic edge coloring algorithm which $(1+\epsilon)\Delta$ edge colors a dense graph. Prior to this, the best known deterministic algorithm for this problem was the simple greedy algorithm which utilized $2\Delta-1$ colors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite permutation group on $\Omega$. An ordered sequence
  $(\omega_1\ldots,\omega_\ell)$ of elements of $\Omega$ is an irredundant base for $G$ if the pointwise stabilizer is trivial and no point is fixed by the stabilizer of its predecessors. The minimal cardinality of a base is said to be the base size of $G$. If all irredundant bases of $G$ have the same cardinality, $G$ is said to be an IBIS group.
  In this paper, we classify the finite almost simple primitive IBIS groups whose base size is at least $6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an (infinite) relational structure $\mathbb S$, we say that a finite structure $\mathbb C$ is a minimal finite factor of $\mathbb S$ if for every finite structure $\mathbb A$ there is a homomorphism $\mathbb S\to \mathbb A$ if and only if there is a homomorphism $\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{A}$. In this brief note we prove that if CSP($\mathbb S$) is in GMSNP, then $\mathbb S$ has a minimal finite factor $\mathbb C$, and moreover, CSP($\mathbb C$) reduces in polynomial time to CSP($\mathbb S$). We discuss two nice applications of this result. First, we see that if a finite promise constraint satisfaction problem PCSP($\mathbb A,\mathbb B$) has a tractable GMSNP sandwich, then it has a tractable finite sandwich. We also show that if $\mathbb G$ is a non-bipartite (possibly infinite) graph with finite chromatic number, and CSP($\mathbb G$) is in GMSNP, then CSP($\mathbb G$) in NP-complete, partially answering a question recently asked by Bodirsky and Guzm\'an-Pro.</description>

      <title>Chessboard and level sets of continuous functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the following result: Let $f \colon I^n \to \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ be a continuous function. Then, there exist $p \in \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and compact subset $S \subset f^{-1}\left[\left\{p\right\}\right]$ which connects some opposite faces of the $n$-dimensional unit cube $I^n$. We give an example that shows it cannot be generalized to path-connected sets. We also provide a discrete version of this result which is inspired by the $n$-dimensional Steinhaus Chessboard Theorem. Additionally, we show that the latter one and the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem are simple consequences of the main result.</description>

      <title>The Unipotent Tropical Fundamental Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the unipotent tropical fundamental group of a polyhedral complex in $\mathbb{R}^n$ as the Tannakian fundamental group of the category of unipotent tropical vector bundles with integrable connection. We show that it is computable in that it satisfies a Seifert--Van Kampen theorem and has a description for fans in terms of a bar complex. We then review an analogous classical object, the unipotent de Rham fundamental group of a sch\"{o}n subvariety of a toric variety. Our main result is a correspondence theorem between classical and tropical unipotent fundamental groups: there is an isomorphism between the unipotent completion of the fundamental group of a generic fiber of a tropically smooth family over a disc and the tropical unipotent fundamental group of the family's tropicalization. This theorem is established using Kato--Nakayama spaces and a descent argument. It requires a slight enlargement of the relevant categories, making use of enriched structures and partial compactifications.</description>

      <title>Online Matching and Contention Resolution for Edge Arrivals with Vanishing Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the performance of sequential contention resolution and matching algorithms on random graphs with vanishing edge probabilities. When the edges of the graph are processed in an adversarially-chosen order, we derive a new OCRS that is $0.382$-selectable, attaining the "independence benchmark" from the literature under the vanishing edge probabilities assumption. Complementary to this positive result, we show that no OCRS can be more than $0.390$-selectable, significantly improving upon the upper bound of $0.428$ from the literature. We also derive negative results that are specialized to bipartite graphs or subfamilies of OCRS's. Meanwhile, when the edges of the graph are processed in a uniformly random order, we show that the simple greedy contention resolution scheme which accepts all active and feasible edges is $1/2$-selectable. This result is tight due to a known upper bound. Finally, when the algorithm can choose the processing order, we show that a slight tweak to the random order -- give each vertex a random priority and process edges in lexicographic order -- results in a strictly better contention resolution scheme that is $1-\ln(2-1/e)\approx0.510$-selectable. Our positive results also apply to online matching on $1$-uniform random graphs with vanishing (non-identical) edge probabilities, extending and unifying some results from the random graphs literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1906.05757v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the rank of a random matrix over an arbitrary field with prescribed numbers of non-zero entries in each row and column. As an application we obtain a formula for the rate of low-density parity check codes. This formula vindicates a conjecture of Lelarge (2013). The proofs are based on coupling arguments and a novel random perturbation, applicable to any matrix, that diminishes the number of short linear relations.</description>

      <title>Balanced supersaturation and Turan numbers in random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10572v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a ground-breaking paper solving a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s on the number of $n$-vertex graphs not containing a given even cycle, Morris and Saxton \cite{MS} made a broad conjecture on so-called balanced supersaturation property of a bipartite graph $H$. Ferber, McKinley, and Samotij \cite{FMS} established a weaker version of this conjecture and applied it to derive far-reaching results on the enumeration problem of $H$-free graphs.
  In this paper, we show that Morris and Saxton's conjecture holds under a very mild assumption about $H$, which is widely believed to hold whenever $H$ contains a cycle. We then use our theorem to obtain enumeration results and general upper bounds on the Tur\'an number of a bipartite $H$ in the random graph $G(n,p)$, the latter being first of its kind.</description>

      <title>List-avoiding orientations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ with a set $F(v)$ of forbidden values at each $v \in V(G)$, an $F$-avoiding orientation of $G$ is an orientation in which $deg^+(v) \not \in F(v)$ for each vertex $v$. Akbari, Dalirrooyfard, Ehsani, Ozeki, and Sherkati conjectured that if $|F(v)| &lt; \frac{1}{2} deg(v)$ for each $v \in V(G)$, then $G$ has an $F$-avoiding orientation, and they showed that this statement is true when $\frac{1}{2}$ is replaced by $\frac{1}{4}$. In this paper, we take a step toward this conjecture by proving that if $|F(v)| &lt; \lfloor \frac{1}{3} deg(v) \rfloor$ for each vertex $v$, then $G$ has an $F$-avoiding orientation. Furthermore, we show that if the maximum degree of $G$ is subexponential in terms of the minimum degree, then this coefficient of $\frac{1}{3}$ can be increased to $\sqrt{2} - 1 - o(1) \approx 0.414$. Our main tool is a new sufficient condition for the existence of an $F$-avoiding orientation based on the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz of Alon and Tarsi.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13186v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counting the number of linear extensions of a partial order was considered by Stanley about 50 years ago. For the partial order on the vertices and edges of a graph given by inclusion, we call a linear extension a {\it construction sequence} for the graph as each edge follows the vertices where it is attached. The number of these c-sequences is counted for various graph families. We also consider the set of all length-$n$ c-sequences produced by the graphs with $n$ elements, simplified to their structural skeleton: vertex or edge, and further allow the generating graph to be structurally constrained. Efficiency is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Exact values and improved bounds on the clique number of cyclotomic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13213v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $q$ be an odd power of a prime $p$, and $S \subset \mathbb{F}_q^*$ such that $S=-S$ and $S/S \neq \mathbb{F}_q^*$. We show that the clique number of the Cayley graph $\operatorname{Cay}(\mathbb{F}_q^+,S)$ is at most $\sqrt{|S/S|}+\sqrt{q/p}$, improving the best-known $\sqrt{q}$ upper bound for many families of such graphs substantially. Such a new bound is strongest for cyclotomic graphs and in particular, it implies the first nontrivial upper bound on the clique number of all generalized Paley graphs of non-square order, extending the work of Hanson and Pertidis. Moreover, our new bound is asymptotically sharp for an infinite family of generalized Paley graphs, and we further discover the first nontrivial family among them for which the clique number can be exactly determined. We also obtain a new lower bound on the number of directions determined by a large Cartesian product in the affine Galois plane $AG(2,q)$, which is sharp for infinite families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make a systematic study of matroidal mixed Eulerian numbers which are certain intersection numbers in the matroid Chow ring generalizing the mixed Eulerian numbers introduced by Postnikov. These numbers are shown to be valuative and obey a log-concavity relation. We establish recursion formulas and use them to relate matroidal mixed Eulerian numbers to the characteristic and Tutte polynomials, reproving results of Huh-Katz and Berget-Spink-Tseng. Generalizing Postnikov, we show that these numbers are equal to certain weighted counts of binary trees. Lastly, we study these numbers for perfect matroid designs, proving that they generalize the remixed Eulerian numbers of Nadeau-Tewari.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraph density. III. Cycles and subdivisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06379v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for every two cycles $C,D$, there exists $c&gt;0$ such that if $G$ is both $C$-free and $\overline{D}$-free then $G$ has a clique or stable set of size at least $|G|^c$. ("$H$-free" means with no induced subgraph isomorphic to $H$, and $\overline{D}$ denotes the complement graph of $D$.) Since the five-vertex cycle $C_5$ is isomorphic to its complement, this extends the earlier result that $C_5$ satisfies the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture. It also unifies and strengthens several other results.
  The results for cycles are special cases of results for subdivisions, as follows. Let $H,J$ be obtained from smaller graphs by subdividing every edge exactly twice. We will prove that there exists $c&gt;0$ such that if $G$ is both $H$-free and $\overline{J}$-free then $G$ has a clique or stable set of size at least $|G|^c$. And the same holds if $H$ and/or $J$ is obtained from a graph bychoosing a forest $F$ and subdividing every edge not in $F$ at least five times. Our proof uses the framework of iterative sparsification developed in other papers of this series.
  Along the way, we will also give a short and simple proof of a celebrated result of Fox and Sudakov, that says that for all $H$, every $H$-free graph contains either a large stable set or a large complete bipartite subgraph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $r$-uniform hypergraph ($r$-graph) is linear if any two edges intersect at most one vertex. For a graph $F$, a hypergraph $H$ is Berge-$F$ if there is a bijection $\phi:E(F)\rightarrow E(H)$ such that $e\subseteq \phi(e)$ for all $e$ in $E(F)$. In this paper, a kind of stability result for Berge-$K_{3,t}$ linear $r$-graphs is established. Based on this stability result, an upper bound for the linear Tur\'{a}n number of Berge-$K_{3,t}$ is determined. For an $r$-graph $H$, let $\mathcal{A}(H)$ be the adjacency tensor of $H$. The spectral radius of $H$ is the spectral radius of the tensor $\mathcal{A}(H)$. Some bounds for the maximum spectral radius of connected Berge-$K_{3,t}$-free linear $r$-graphs are obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we consider asymptotic products of binomial and multinomial coefficients and determine their asymptotic constants and formulas. Among them, special cases are the central binomial coefficients, the related Catalan numbers, and binomial coefficients in a row of Pascal's triangle. For the latter case, we show that it can also be derived from a limiting case of products of binomial coefficients over the rows. The asymptotic constants are expressed by known constants, for example, the Glaisher-Kinkelin constant. In addition, the constants lie in certain intervals that we determine precisely. Subsequently, we revisit a related result of Hirschhorn and clarify the given numerical constant by showing the exact expression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the literature, lines of the projective space $\mathrm{PG}(3,q)$ are partitioned into classes, each of which is a union of line orbits under the stabilizer group of the twisted cubic. The least studied class is named $\mathcal{O}_6$. This class contains lines external to the twisted cubic which are not its chords or axes and do not lie in any of its osculating planes. For even and odd $q$, we propose a new family of orbits of $\mathcal{O}_6$ and investigate in detail their stabilizer groups and the corresponding submatrices of the point-line and plane-line incidence matrices. To obtain these submatrices, we explored the number of solutions of cubic and quartic equations connected with intersections of lines (including the tangents to the twisted cubic), points, and planes in $\mathrm{PG}(3,q)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address a problem which is a generalization of Tur\'an-type problems recently introduced by Imolay, Karl, Nagy and V\'ali. Let $F$ be a fixed graph and let $G$ be the union of $k$ edge-disjoint copies of $F$, namely $G = \mathbin{\dot{\cup}}_{i=1}^{k} F_i$, where each $F_i$ is isomorphic to a fixed graph $F$ and $E(F_i)\cap E(F_j)=\emptyset$ for all $i \neq j$. We call a subgraph $H\subseteq G$ multicolored if $H$ and $F_i$ share at most one edge for all $i$. Define $\text{ex}_F(H,n)$ to be the maximum value $k$ such that there exists $G = \mathbin{\dot{\cup}}_{i=1}^{k} F_i$ on $n$ vertices without a multicolored copy of $H$. We show that $\text{ex}_{C_5}(C_3,n) \le n^2/25 + 3n/25+o(n)$ and that all extremal graphs are close to a blow-up of the 5-cycle. This bound is tight up to the linear error term.</description>

Abstract: In \cite[Proposition 8.21 Page-169]{F} Using the methods of topological dynamics, H. Furstenberg introduced the notion of central set and proved the famous Central Sets Theorem. Later, in \cite{DHS}, D. De, H. Hindman and D. Struss established a strong Central Sets Theorem, where they introduced the notion of $J$-set. Like $J$-set, in \cite{BG} V. Bergelson and D. Glasscock introduced the notion of combinatorially rich set ( $CR$-set). Let $u,v\in\mathbb{N}$ and $A$ be a $u\times v$ matrix with rational entries. In \cite{HS23}, N. Hindman and D. Strauss established that whenever $B$ is a piecewise syndetic set (resp. $J$-set) in $\mathbb{Z}$, $\left\{ \vec{x}\in\mathbb{Z}^{v}:A\vec{x}\in B^{u}\right\} $ is a piecewise syndetic set ( resp. $J$-set) in $\mathbb{Z}^{v}$. In this article, we prove the same result for $CR$-sets using an equivalent definition of $CR$-set in \cite{HHST} by N. Hindman, H. Hosseini, D. Strauss and M. Tootkaboni.</description>

An R-$q^t$-partially scattered polynomial is a $\mathbb F_q$-linearized polynomial $f$ in $\mathbb F_{q^n}[X]$ that satisfies the condition that for all $x,y\in\mathbb F_{q^n}^*$ such that $x/y\in\mathbb F_{q^t}$, if $f(x)/x=f(y)/y$, then $x/y\in\mathbb F_q$; $f$ is called scattered if this implication holds for all $x,y\in\mathbb F_{q^n}^*$. Two polynomials in $\mathbb F_{q^n}[X]$ are said to be equivalent if their graphs are in the same orbit under the action of the group $\Gamma L(2,q^n)$. For $n&gt;8$ only three families of scattered polynomials in $\mathbb F_{q^n}[X]$ are known: $(i)$~monomials of pseudoregulus type, $(ii)$~binomials of Lunardon-Polverino type, and $(iii)$~a family of quadrinomials defined in [1,10] and extended in [8,13]. In this paper we prove that the polynomial $\varphi_{m,q^J}=X^{q^{J(t-1)}}+X^{q^{J(2t-1)}}+m(X^{q^J}-X^{q^{J(t+1)}})\in\mathbb F_{q^{2t}}[X]$, $q$ odd, $t\ge3$ is R-$q^t$-partially scattered for every value of $m\in\mathbb F_{q^t}^*$ and $J$ coprime with $2t$. Moreover, for every $t&gt;4$ and $q&gt;5$ there exist values of $m$ for which $\varphi_{m,q}$ is scattered and new with respect to the polynomials mentioned in $(i)$, $(ii)$ and $(iii)$ above. The related linear sets are of $\Gamma L$-class at least two.</description>

      <title>Extension of Bressoud's generalization of Borwein's conjecture and some exact results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we conjecture an extension to Bressoud's 1996 generalization of Borwein's famous 1990 conjecture. We then state a few infinite hierarchies of non-negative $q$-series identities which are interesting examples of our proposed conjecture and Bressoud's generalized conjecture. Finally, using certain positivity-preserving transformations for $q$-binomial coefficients, we prove the non-negativity of the infinite families.</description>

      <title>Distance magic labelings of Cartesian products of cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph of order $n$ is distance magic if it admits a bijective labeling of its vertices with integers from $1$ to $n$ such that each vertex has the same sum of the labels of its neighbors. In this paper we classify all distance magic Cartesian products of two cycles, thereby correcting an error in a widely cited paper from 2004. Additionally, we show that each distance magic labeling of a Cartesian product of cycles is determined by a pair or quadruple of suitable sequences, thus obtaining a complete characterization of all distance magic labelings of these graphs. We also determine a lower bound on the number of all distance magic labelings of $C_{m} \square C_{2m}$ with $m \ge 3$ odd.</description>

      <title>Improved Lower Bounds for Property B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If an $n$-uniform hypergraph can be 2-colored, then it is said to have property B. Erd\H{o}s (1963) was the first to give lower and upper bounds for the minimal size $m(n)$ of an $n$-uniform hypergraph without property B. His asymptotic upper bound $O(n^22^n)$ still is the best we know, his lower bound $2^{n-1}$ has seen a number of improvements, with the current best $\Omega$ $(2^n\sqrt{n/\log(n)})$ established by Radhakrishnan and Srinivasan (2000). Cherkashin and Kozik (2014) provided a simplified proof of this result, using Pluh\'ar's (2009) idea of a random greedy coloring. In the present paper, we use a refined version of this argument to obtain improved lower bounds on $m(n)$ for small values of $n$. We also study $m(n,v)$, the size of the smallest $n$-hypergraph without property B having $v$ vertices.</description>

Abstract: We study systems of equations on antichains, together with a way to count the number of solutions. We start with two simple examples, generalise and show more applications. One of the results was used in the recent computation of D(9), the others have potential to speed up existing techniques in the future.</description>

      <title>Solution to a conjecture on resistance distances of block tower graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph. The resistance distance between two vertices $u$ and $v$ of $G$, denoted by $R_{G}[u,v]$, is defined as the net effective resistance between them in the electric network constructed from $G$ by replacing each edge with a unit resistor. The resistance diameter of $G$, denoted by $D_{r}(G)$, is defined as the maximum resistance distance among all pairs of vertices of $G$. Let $P_n=a_1a_2\ldots a_n$ be the $n$-vertex path graph and $C_{4}=b_{1}b_2b_3b_4b_{1}$ be the 4-cycle. Then the $n$-th block tower graph $G_n$ is defined as the the Cartesian product of $P_n$ and $C_4$, that is, $G_n=P_{n}\square C_4$. Clearly, the vertex set of $G_n$ is $\{(a_i,b_j)|i=1,\ldots,n;j=1,\ldots,4\}$. In [Discrete Appl. Math. 320 (2022) 387--407], Evans and Francis proposed the following conjecture on resistance distances of $G_n$ and $G_{n+1}$: \begin{equation*} \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(R_{G_{n+1}}[(a_{1},b_1),(a_{n+1},b_3)]-R_{G_{n}}[(a_{1},b_1),(a_{n},b_3)]\right)=\frac{1}{4}. \end{equation*} In this paper, combining algebraic methods and electrical network approaches, we confirm and further generalize this conjecture. In addition, we determine all the resistance diametrical pairs in $G_n$, which enables us to give an equivalent explanation of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Moduli of hybrid curves I: Variations of canonical measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.07130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is the first in a series devoted to the study of asymptotic geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces.
  We introduce the moduli space of hybrid curves as a new compactification of the moduli space of curves, refining the one obtained by Deligne and Mumford. This is the moduli space for multiscale geometric objects which mix complex and higher rank tropical and non-Archimedean geometries, reflecting both discrete and continuous features.
  We define canonical measures on hybrid curves which combine and generalize Arakelov-Bergman measures on Riemann surfaces and Zhang measures on metric graphs.
  We then show that the universal family of canonically measured hybrid curves over this moduli space varies continuously. This provides a precise link between the non-Archimedean Zhang measure and variations of Arakelov-Bergman measures in families of Riemann surfaces, answering a question which has been open since the pioneering work of Zhang on admissible pairing in the nineties.</description>

Abstract: We compute the Poincar\'e polynomials of the compactified Jacobians for plane curve singularities with Puiseaux exponents $(nd,md,md+1)$, and relate them to the combinatorics of $q,t$-Catalan numbers in the non-coprime case.

      <title>Scaling limits and universality: Critical percolation on weighted graphs converging to an $L^3$ graphon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general universality technique for establishing metric scaling limits of critical random discrete structures exhibiting mean-field behavior that requires four ingredients: (i) from the barely subcritical regime to the critical window, components merge approximately like the multiplicative coalescent, (ii) asymptotics of the susceptibility functions are the same as that of the Erdos-Renyi random graph, (iii) asymptotic negligibility of the maximal component size and the diameter in the barely subcritical regime, and (iv) macroscopic averaging of distances between vertices in the barely subcritical regime.
  As an application of the general universality theorem, we establish, under some regularity conditions, the critical percolation scaling limit of graphs that converge, in a suitable topology, to an $L^3$ graphon. In particular, we define a notion of the critical window in this setting. The $L^3$ assumption ensures that the model is in the Erdos-Renyi universality class and that the scaling limit is Brownian. Our results do not assume any specific functional form for the graphon. As a consequence of our results on graphons, we obtain the metric scaling limit for Aldous-Pittel's RGIV model [9] inside the critical window.
  Our universality principle has applications in a number of other problems including in the study of noise sensitivity of critical random graphs [52]. In [10], we use our universality theorem to establish the metric scaling limit of critical bounded size rules. Our method should yield the critical metric scaling limit of Rucinski and Wormald's random graph process with degree restrictions [56] provided an additional technical condition about the barely subcritical behavior of this model can be proved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group with undecidable domino problem (such as $\mathbb{Z}^2$). We prove the undecidability of all nontrivial dynamical properties for sofic $G$-subshifts, that such a result fails for SFTs, and an undecidability result for dynamical properties of $G$-SFTs similar to the Adian-Rabin theorem. For $G$ amenable we prove that topological entropy is not computable from presentations of SFTs, and a more general result for dynamical invariants taking values in partially ordered sets.</description>

      <title>Manifolds realized as orbit spaces of non-free $\mathbb Z_2^k$-actions on real moment-angle manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider (non-necessarily free) actions of subgroups $H\subset \mathbb Z_2^m$ on the real moment-angle manifold $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P$ corresponding to a simple convex $n$ polytope $P$ with $m$ facets. The criterion when the orbit space $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ is a topological manifold (perhaps with a boundary) can be extracted from results by M.A. Mikhailova and C. Lange. For any dimension $n$ we construct series of manifolds $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ homeomorphic to $S^n$ and series of manifolds $M^n=\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ admitting a hyperelliptic involution $\tau\in\mathbb Z_2^m/H$, that is an involution $\tau$ such that $M^n/\langle\tau\rangle$ is homeomorphic to $S^n$. For any simple $3$-polytope $P$ we classify all subgroups $H\subset\mathbb Z_2^m$ such that $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ is homeomorphic to $S^3$. For any simple $3$-polytope $P$ and any subgroup $H\subset\mathbb Z_2^m$ we classify all hyperelliptic involutions $\tau\in\mathbb Z_2^m/H$ acting on $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$. As a corollary we obtain that a $3$-dimensional small cover has $3$ hyperelliptic involutions in $\mathbb Z_2^3$ if and only if it is a rational homology $3$-sphere and if and only if it correspond to a triple of Hamiltonian cycles such that each edge of the polytope belongs to exactly two of them.</description>

      <title>The Boolean polynomial polytope with multiple choice constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of $0$-$1$ polynomial programming termed multiple choice polynomial programming (MCPP) where the constraint requires exact one component per subset of the partition to be $1$ after all the entries are partitioned. Compared to the unconstrained counterpart, there are few polyhedral studies of MCPP in general form. This paper serves as the first attempt to propose a polytope associated with a hypergraph to study MCPP, which is the convex hull of $0$-$1$ vectors satisfying multiple choice constraints and production constraints. With the help of the decomposability property, we obtain an explicit half-space representation of the MCPP polytope when the underlying hypergraph is $\alpha$-acyclic by induction on the number of hyperedges, which is an analogy of the acyclicity results on the multilinear polytope by Del Pia and Khajavirad (SIAM J Optim 28 (2018) 1049) when the hypergraph is $\gamma$-acyclic. We also present a necessary and sufficient condition for the inequalities lifted from the facet-inducing ones for the multilinear polytope to be still facet-inducing for the MCPP polytope. This result covers the particular cases by B\"armann, Martin and Schneider (SIAM J Optim 33 (2023) 2909).</description>
