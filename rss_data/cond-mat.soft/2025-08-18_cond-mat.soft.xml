      <title>Unconventional Phase Separation and Fractal Interfaces of Colloids in Active Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase separation driven by nonequilibrium fluctuations is a hallmark of both living and synthetic active matter. Unlike equilibrium systems, where ordered states arise from the minimization of free energy, active systems are fueled by a constant injection of energy at the microscopic scale. The emergence of ordered phases in such driven systems challenges our conventional views of domain growth and interfacial structure. In this study, we investigate the coarsening of colloidal clusters in active liquids containing E. coli. Our experiments reveal that uniform dispersions of colloids and swimmers are inherently unstable, resulting in spontaneous phase separation characterized by fractal interfaces and unconventional kinetics. The correlation function of the order parameter displays dynamical scaling, with the size of colloidal domains growing as $t^{1/z}$, where $z \sim 4$, in contrast to the well-known growth laws for thermal systems with a conserved order parameter. Furthermore, the structure factor exhibits non-Porod behavior, indicating domains with fractal interfaces. This non-Porod behavior also manifests itself as a cusp singularity in the correlation function. We elucidate our experimental findings using a scalar field theory in which the nonequilibrium fluctuations arising from swimmer activity are modeled as spatio-temporally correlated noise. This coarse-grained model, which breaks time-reversal symmetry and detailed balance, successfully reproduces key experimental observations. Furthermore, it reveals a fluctuating microphase separation, where the initial domain growth, following $t^{1/4}$ scaling, is eventually arrested, thereby shedding new light on the microscopic origins of unconventional phase separation of colloids in active liquids.</description>

      <title>Solid-Angle Nearest-Neighbor Method for Size-Disperse Systems of Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying nearest neighbors accurately is essential in particle-based simulations, from analyzing local structure to detecting phase transitions. While parameter-free methods such as Voronoi tessellation and the solid-angle nearest-neighbor (SANN) algorithm are effective in monodisperse systems, they become less reliable in mixtures with large size disparities. We introduce SANNR, a generalization of SANN that incorporates particle radii into the solid-angle criterion for robust, size-sensitive neighbor detection. We compare SANNR against Voronoi, Laguerre, and SANN in binary and size-disperse sphere mixtures. Using Wasserstein distance metrics, we show that SANNR closely matches size-aware Laguerre tessellation while preserving the geometric continuity of SANN. Applied to the crystallization of the complex AB$_{13}$ phase, SANNR improves detection of local bond-orientational order and better captures the emergence of global symmetry. SANNR thus offers a smooth, parameter-free, and extensible framework for neighbor detection in polydisperse and multicomponent systems.</description>

      <title>Large-scale dynamics in visual quorum sensing chiral suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motility induced phase separation is an efficient aggregation mechanism of active matter, yet biological systems exhibit richer organization through communication among constituents. We investigate suspensions of active particles that change chirality when neighbor density within their visual cone exceeds a threshold, a communication based non-reciprocal interaction akin to quorum sensing. Tuning the visual cone triggers programmable transitions: from disorder to phase separation to hyper-uniformity. Notably, phase separation triggers large-scale circulation, with robust edge currents persistently flowing around dense clusters, while particle distributions inside become effectively hyper-uniform. These are genuine non-reciprocal effects which occur even in the absence of steric interactions. Remarkably, in active-passive mixtures, only 5% quorum-sensing chiral particles suffice to induce collective circulation. Thus, simple perception-based rules can generate life-like order, offering design principles for programmable active materials and micro-robotic swarms.</description>

      <title>A 3D porous MXene/PNIPAAm hydrogel composite with advanced degradation stability and control of electronic properties in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study reports the fundamental investigation of a novel composite material consisting of MXene (Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$) and a stimulus-responsive hydrogel (Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) - PNIPAAm). In contrast to previously reported integration of MXene and hydrogels, the material described here offers a tunable porous structure for volatile organic compound (VOC) sensing that maintains its stability and responsiveness in any kind of gaseous environment and in a dried state. Furthermore, its synthesis is significantly simpler and more efficient compared to other studies on porous MXene composites. The presented study focuses on a fundamental investigation of the synthesized MXene/PNIPAAm composite's properties. Thereby, the fabrication and comparison of pure MXene and composite samples featuring either a compact or a highly porous three-dimensional microstructure, reveal unique properties with respect to: (i) controllable three-dimensional spatial arrangement of MXene instead of the prevalent stacked-sheet structure, (ii) reduction of oxidation-induced degradation of MXene and substantially enhanced stability over the course of three months, and (iii) tunable electronic states in response to gas interactions. Material characterization is conducted by scanning electron microscopy and rheology to assess the microstructural and mechanical properties, and in a chemiresistive measurement setup for determination of electrical properties and the evaluation of the composite's potential for VOC sensing in a gaseous environment with the test analyte acetone. These investigations reveal fundamentally novel material effects and properties that address some of the key MXene-related challenges. Additionally, the interplay between the MXene and the hydrogel enables unprecedented opportunities for enhancing the sensing potential of stimulus-responsive hydrogels, specifically in gaseous environments.</description>

      <title>pylimer-tools: A Python Package for Generating and Analyzing Bead-Spring Polymer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Python package pylimer-tools is a comprehensive toolkit for computational studies of polymer networks, particularly bead-spring networks. The package provides functionality to generate polymer networks using Monte Carlo (MC) procedures and analyze their structural and mechanical properties. Key features include detection of loops, reduction of the network to its ground state energy both with and without entanglements by the Force Balance procedure, and thereafter computing the soluble and dangling fractions of network strands, as well as the equilibrium shear modulus. The toolkit supports analysis of structures generated both internally and by external simulation software such as LAMMPS. The package implements theoretical frameworks including Miller-Macosko theory and provides a dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulator with slip-spring entanglement modeling. Built with C++ for performance and exposed through Python bindings, pylimer-tools addresses the need for specialized tools in computational polymer science.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically Consistent Coarse-graining: from Interacting Particles to Fields via Second Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically derive an exact coarse-grained description for interacting particles with thermodynamically consistent stochastic dynamics, applicable across different observation scales, the mesoscopic and the macroscopic. We implement the coarse-graining procedure using the Doi-Peliti field theory, which preserves microscopic noise effects on the meso/macro scale. The exact mapping reveals the key role played by Poissonian particle occupancy statistics. We show the implications of the exact coarse-graining method using a prototypical flocking model, namely the active Ising model, which exhibits a mismatch between the microscopic and macroscopic mean-field coarse-grained descriptions. Our analysis shows that the high- and low-density regimes are governed by two different coarse-grained equations. In the low-density regime, noise effects play a prominent role, leading to a first-order phase transition. In contrast, the second-order phase transition occurs in the high-density regime. Due to the exact coarse-graining methods, our framework also opens up applicability to systematically analyze noise-induced phase transitions in other models of reciprocally and non-reciprocally interacting particles.</description>

      <title>Measuring irreversibility by counting: a random coarse-graining framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic irreversibility is a fundamental concept in statistical physics, yet its experimental measurement remains challenging, especially for complex systems. We introduce a novel random coarse-graining framework to identify model-free measures of irreversibility in complex many-body systems. These measures are constructed from the asymmetry of cross-correlation functions between suitably chosen observables, providing rigorous lower bounds on entropy production. For many-particle systems, we propose a particularly practical implementation that divides real space into virtual boxes and monitors particle number densities within them, requiring only simple counting from video microscopy, without single-particle tracking, trajectory reconstruction, or prior knowledge of interactions. Owing to its generality and minimal data requirements, the random coarse-graining framework offers broad applicability across diverse nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Learning the bulk and interfacial physics of liquid-liquid phase separation with neural density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use simulation-based supervised machine learning and classical density functional theory to investigate bulk and interfacial phenomena associated with phase coexistence in binary mixtures. For a prototypical symmetrical Lennard-Jones mixture our trained neural density functional yields accurate liquid-liquid and liquid-vapour binodals together with predictions for the variation of the associated interfacial tensions across the entire fluid phase diagram. From the latter we determine the contact angles at fluid-fluid interfaces along the line of triple-phase coexistence and confirm there can be no wetting transition in this symmetrical mixture.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Small-Angle Scattering of Polydisperse Hard Spheres using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a deep learning approach for analyzing the scattering function of the polydisperse hard spheres system. We use a variational autoencoder-based neural network to learn the bidirectional mapping between the scattering function and the system parameters including the volume fraction and polydispersity. Such that the trained model serves both as a generator that produce scattering function from the system parameters, and an inferrer that extract system parameters from the scattering function. We first generate a scattering dataset by carrying out molecular dynamics simulation of the polydisperse hard spheres modeled by the truncated-shifted Lennard-Jones model, then analyze the scattering function dataset using singular value decomposition to confirm the feasibility of dimensional compression. Then we split the dataset into training and testing set and train our neural network on the training set only. Our generator model produce scattering function with significant higher accuracy comparing to the traditional Percus-Yevick approximation and $\beta$ correction, and the inferrer model can extract the volume fraction and polydispersity with much higher accuracy than traditional model functions.</description>

      <title>Tracer dynamics in an interacting active bath: fluctuations and energy partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a massive tracer particle coupled to an interacting active bath, modeled as a harmonic chain of overdamped active particles analytically, with an aim to understand the impact of bath interactions and activity on the nonequilibrium fluctuations of the tracer. From the microscopic equations, we derive the tracer particle's effective Langevin equation, obtaining the dissipative and stochastic forces from the bath. We analyze the friction kernel, revealing power-law tails in the weak coupling limit and exponential decay in the strong coupling regime. Due to the interplay between bath interactions, probe-bath coupling, and activity, the mean squared displacement, velocity, and stationary velocity correlations exhibit different dynamical regimes, which we characterize analytically. Under harmonic confinement, we find that energy equipartition holds at low activity but breaks down at higher activity, with the kinetic energy exhibiting a non-monotonic dependence on the activity of the bath.</description>

      <title>An Open-Source User-Friendly Interface for Simulating Magnetic Soft Robots using Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft robots, particularly magnetic soft robots, require specialized simulation tools to accurately model their deformation under external magnetic fields. However, existing platforms often lack dedicated support for magnetic materials, making them difficult to use for researchers at different expertise levels. This work introduces an open-source, user-friendly simulation interface using the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), specifically designed to model magnetic soft robots. The tool enables users to define material properties, apply magnetic fields, and observe resulting deformations in real time. By integrating intuitive controls and stress analysis capabilities, it aims to bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and practical design. Four benchmark models -- a beam, three- and four-finger grippers, and a butterfly -- demonstrate its functionality. The software's ease of use makes it accessible to both beginners and advanced researchers. Future improvements will refine accuracy through experimental validation and comparison with industry-standard finite element solvers, ensuring realistic and predictive simulations of magnetic soft robots.</description>
