      <title>Building Neutron Stars with the MUSES Calculation Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the equation of state of dense matter is an essential part of interpreting the observable properties of neutron stars. We present here the first results for dense matter in the zero-temperature limit generated by the MUSES Calculation Engine, a composable workflow management system that orchestrates calculation and data processing stages comprising a collection of software modules designed within the MUSES framework. The modules presented in this work calculate equations of state using algorithms spanning three different theories/models: (1) Crust Density Functional Theory, valid starting at low densities, (2) Chiral Effective Field Theory, valid around saturation density, and (3) the Chiral Mean Field model, valid beyond saturation density. Lepton contributions are added through the Lepton module to each equation of state, ensuring charge neutrality and the possibility of $\beta$-equilibrium. Using the Synthesis module, we match the three equations of state using different thermodynamic variables and different methods. We then couple the complete equation of state to a novel full-general-relativity solver (QLIMR) module that calculates neutron star properties. We find that the matching performed using different thermodynamic variables affects differently the range obtained for neutron star masses and radii (although never beyond a few percent difference). We also investigate the universality of equation of state-independent relations for our matched stars. Finally, for the first time, we use the Flavor Equilibration module to estimate bulk viscosity and flavor relaxation charge fraction and rates (at low temperature) for Chiral Effective Field Theory and the Chiral Mean Field model.</description>

      <title>Inelastic neutrino-nucleus scattering off $^{203/205}$Tl in terms of the nuclear recoil energy using a hybrid nuclear model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear structure calculations in the context of a novel hybrid nuclear model, combining the nuclear shell model and the microscopic quasiparticle-phonon model are presented. The predictivity of the hybrid model is tested by computing inelastic neutral-current neutrino-nucleus scattering cross sections off the stable thallium isotopes. The cross sections are presented in terms of the incoming neutrino energy, taking also into account the effect of nuclear recoil energy. Also reported are the expected event rates assuming neutrinos emerging from pion-decay at rest and the diffuse supernova neutrino background. Regarding solar neutrino rates, new results are presented in the context of the hybrid model and compared with previously reported results based solely on nuclear shell model calculations, demonstrating the improved accuracy of the adopted hybrid model at higher neutrino energies.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking nuclear matrix elements of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay with high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing uncertainties in the nuclear matrix element (NME) remains a critical challenge in designing and interpreting experiments aimed at discovering neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. Here, we identify a class of observables, distinct from those employed in low-energy nuclear structure applications, that are strongly correlated with the NME: momentum correlations among hadrons produced in high-energy nuclear collisions. Focusing on the $^{150}$Nd$\rightarrow$$^{150}$Sm transition, we combine a Bayesian analysis of the structure of $^{150}$Nd with simulations of high-energy $^{150}$Nd+$^{150}$Nd collisions. We reveal prominent correlations between the NME and features of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in these processes, such as spatial gradients and anisotropies, which are accessible via collective flow measurements. Our findings demonstrate collider experiments involving $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay candidates as a platform for benchmarking theoretical predictions of the NME.</description>

      <title>Directly probing existence of $\alpha$-cluster structure in $^{20}$Ne by relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can relativistic heavy-ion collisions only probe the global shape of colliding nuclei, or their detailed internal structure as well? Taking $^{20}$Ne as an example, we attempt to directly probe its internal $\alpha$-cluster structure, by comparing experimentally measured observables in collisions at relativistic energies from density distributions of $^{20}$Ne with and without $\alpha$-cluster structure. Since the two density distributions give the same nucleus size and deformation, they lead to similar mid-rapidity observables. However, the $\alpha$-cluster structure may considerably reduce the free spectator nucleon yield and enhance the spectator light nuclei yield, as a result of more compact initial phase-space distribution of nucleons inside $\alpha$ clusters. We propose to measure the scaled yield ratio of free spectator neutrons to charged particles with mass-to-charge ratio $A/Z = 3$, 3/2, and 2 in ultra-central \nene\ collisions, which is found to be reduced by about $25\%$ at \(\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 7\) TeV and about 20\% at \(\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 200\) GeV with $\alpha$-cluster structure in $^{20}$Ne. This scaled yield ratio thus serves as a robust and direct probe of the existence of $\alpha$-cluster structure in $^{20}$Ne free from the uncertainty of mid-rapidity dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fixing effective range parameters in elastic $\alpha$-$^{12}$C scattering: an impact on resonant $2_4^+$ state of $^{16}$O and $S_{E2}$ factor of $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic $\alpha$-$^{12}$C scattering for $l=2$ and $E2$ transition of radiative $\alpha$ capture on $^{12}$C, $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O, are studied in cluster effective field theory. Due to the problem in fixing the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) of the subthreshold $2_1^+$ state of $^{16}$O, equivalently, the effective range parameters of the $2_1^+$ state, from the elastic scattering data, we introduce the conditions that lead to a large value of the ANC. In addition, $d$-wave phase shift data of the elastic scattering up to the $\alpha$ energy, $E_\alpha=10$~MeV, which contain resonant $2_4^+$ state of $^{16}$O, are also introduced in the study. Applying the conditions, the parameters of the $S$ matrix of the elastic scattering for $l=2$ are fitted to the phase shift data, and the fitted parameters are employed in the calculation of astrophysical $S_{E2}$ factor of $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O; we extrapolate the $S_{E2}$ factor to the Gamow-peak energy, $E_G=0.3$~MeV. We find that the conditions lead to significant effects in the observables of the $2_4^+$ state of $^{16}$O and the estimate of the $S_{E2}$ factor at $E_G$ and confirm that the ANC of the $2_1^+$ of $^{16}$O cannot be determined by the phase shift data for $l=2$.</description>

      <title>Complete set of observables in pseudo-scalar meson photoproduction - Controversy solved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-standing debate over whether the complete set of observables in pseudo-scalar meson photoproduction consists of eight or merely four elements continues to persist. From the perspective of amplitude analysis, it is argued that all eight observables are necessary to completely determine the others. On the other hand, proponents of partial-wave analysis, working with theoretically precise data of infinite accuracy, claim that only four observables are needed. However, this claim is not acceptable from an experimental viewpoint, as all data in the real world contain some uncertainty. This paper illustrates that the controversy is artificial and is due to additional mathematical assumptions used in partial-wave analysis. Our research advances this discussion by moving from exact synthetic numerical data to also synthetic, but more realistic data in partial-wave analysis and shows that the claimed reduction in observables is unjustified. Consequently, the final conclusion is that the complete set of observables in pseudo-scalar meson photoproduction, whether using amplitude analysis or partial-wave analysis with practical data, must consist of eight observables.</description>

      <title>$\phi$ meson in nuclear matter and atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties (masses and decay widths) of the $\phi$ meson are investigated in nuclear matter from the $\phi$ meson self-energy, using the tree-level $\phi K\bar{K}$ Lagrangian, and, incorporating in-medium masses of (anti)kaons calculated within the quark meson coupling (QMC) model. These mass shifts and decay widths are incorporated in the Breit-Wigner spectral function of the $\phi$ meson to calculate the production cross-section of $\phi$ in asymmetric nuclear matter. Considerable modifications to the production cross-section are observed at normal nuclear matter density, driven by the in-medium mass reduction and the increase in the decay width of $\phi$ meson. The potential experienced by $\phi$ meson in nuclear matter is used to study the possibility of formation of the $\phi$ mesic bound state with atomic nuclei. We explore the potential formation of $\phi$-mesic bound states in ${\rm{^{4}He}}$, ${\rm{^{12}C}}$, ${\rm{^{16}O}}$, ${\rm{^{40}Ca}}$, ${\rm{^{90}Zr}}$, ${\rm{^{197}Au}}$ and ${\rm{^{208}Pb}}$ nuclei by investigating their binding energies and absorption widths based on the corresponding $\phi$-nucleus potentials. Our study shows shallow bound states with the light nuclei and deeply bound states in heavy nuclei. Among the investigated nuclei, a particularly distinct signal for a $\phi$-mesic bound state is identified in ${\rm{^{16}O}}$, suggesting its potential experimental observability. The work provides valuable insights into $\phi$ meson interactions in infinite nuclear matter and the potential formation of exotic $\phi$-mesic nuclear states, offering promising probes for strongly interacting matter in the upcoming experiments at J-PARC, JLab, and ${\rm{\bar{P}}ANDA}$@FAIR physics program.</description>

      <title>A variation on "compositeness" (including higher partial waves)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ``spatial interpretation of compositeness'', presented and discussed in [1,2] in the context of non-relativistic potential scattering, is extended to higher partial waves. A particular set of basis states is used to arrive at a slightly different perspective on the derivation and interpretation of ``compositeness'' usually given in the literature.</description>

      <title>Scale Setting and Strong Coupling Determination in the Gradient Flow Scheme for 2+1 Flavor Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a scale determination, scale setting, and determination of the strong coupling in the gradient flow scheme using the $N_f=2+1$ highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) ensembles generated by the HotQCD Collaboration for bare gauge couplings ranging from $\beta = 7.030$ to $8.400$. The gradient flow scales we obtain in this work are $\sqrt{t_0} = 0.14229(98)$~fm and $w_0 = 0.17190(140)$~fm. Using the decay constants of the kaon and $\eta_s$, as well as the bottomonium mass splitting from the literature, we also calculate the potential scale $r_1$, obtaining $r_1 = 0.3072(22)$~fm. We fit the flow scales to an Allton-type ansatz as a function of $\beta$, providing a polynomial expression that allows for the prediction of lattice spacings at new $beta$ values. As a secondary result, we make an attempt to determine $\Lambda_{\overline{\mathrm{MS}}}$ and use it to estimate the strong coupling in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rossby mode (r-mode) perturbation in pulsars as a steady gravitational wave (GW) source has been explored. The effect of a rigid crust on viscous damping and dissipation rate in the boundary layer between fluid core and crust has been studied. The intensity of the emitted GWs in terms of the strain tensor amplitude has been estimated with the approximation of slow rotation using equation of state derived from the APR and Skyrme effective interactions with Brussels-Montreal parameter sets. The core of the neutron star has been considered to be $\beta$-equilibrated nuclear matter containing neutrons, protons, electrons and muons, surrounded by a solid crust. Calculations have been made for critical frequencies, the time evolution and the rate of change of the spin frequencies across a broad spectrum of pulsar masses.</description>

Abstract: The time evolution of the distribution function for a particle-hole excitation in a Fermi system was calculated using the direct numerical solution of a nonlinear diffusion equation in momentum space. A phenomenological expression for calculating the relaxation time of such an excitation to its equilibrium value has been proposed. It is shown that the relaxation time is dependent on both the excitation energy and the mass number.</description>

      <title>Study of electron-positron annihilation into $K\bar{K}\pi$ within resonance chiral theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a coherent study of the $e^+e^-$ annihilation into $K^+K^-\pi^0$, $K^0_SK^0_L\pi^0$ and $K^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp$ is carried out within the framework of resonance chiral theory. The amplitudes are fixed by fitting to the experimental cross-section and invariant mass spectrum. With these amplitudes, one can calculate the hadronic vacuum polarization form factors of these processes. The leading order contributions of $\sigma(e^+e^- \to K\bar{K}\pi)$ to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_\mu$, is obtained as $a_\mu^{\rm HVP,LO}(e^+e^- \to K\bar{K}\pi)=(3.178\pm0.071)\times10^{-10}$ up to $E_{\rm cm}=2.3$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Hard processes in multi-TeV ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the ion-collision program at the Large Hadron Collider, plans for its high-luminosity upgrade, and on-going discussions for multi-TeV future hadron colliders, we systematically investigate hard-scattering, Standard Model processes in many-TeV ion-ion collisions. We focus on the symmetric beam configurations $^{208}$Pb-$^{208}$Pb, $^{131}$Xe-$^{131}$Xe, $^{12}$C-$^{12}$C, and $pp$, and we catalog total and fiducial cross sections for dozens of processes, ranging from associated-Higgs and multiboson production to associated-top pair production, at next-to-leading order in QCD for nucleon-nucleon collision energies from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=1$ to $100$ TeV. We report the residual scale uncertainties at this order as well as the uncertainties originating from fits of nuclear parton densities. We also discuss the propagation of nuclear dynamics (as encoded in nuclear parton densities) into parton luminosities, and ultimately into predictions for cross sections. Finally, we report on the emergence of trends and the reliability of extrapolating cross sections across different nuclei. For Pb-Pb collisions at a hypothetical Future Circular Collider with $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=39$ TeV, $\mathcal{O}(10^{8})$ weak bosons, $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ diboson pairs, $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ $WH$ and $ZH$ pairs, $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ triboson events, $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ high-$p_T$ photons events, and $\mathcal{O}(10^7)$ $t\overline{t}$ pairs can be produced with $\mathcal{L}=33$~nb$^{-1}$ of data. At $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.52$ TeV, one can expect $\mathcal{O}(10-10^6)$ single, multiboson, and top events per $1$ nb$^{-1}$. Decay rates and experimental selection/acceptance rates will impact final event yields, and merits further study; as an illustrative example, we focus on select diboson and triboson channels in lead-lead collisions and discuss their observability at the high-luminosity phase of the LHC and the FCC.</description>

Abstract: In this work, the interior spacetime of stars is built in a Lorentz symmetry breaking model called bumblebee gravity. Firstly, we calculated the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in this context of modified gravity. Then we show that the bumblebee field, responsible for the symmetry breaking, increases the star mass-radius relation when it assumes its vacuum expectation value. When compared to the general relativity mass-radius relation, a Lorentz symmetry breaking context, like the bumblebee gravity, could provide more massive stars, surpassing the $2.5 M_{\odot}$ limit as the interior of the star is described by quark matter with the MIT bag model. Also, we investigate the stability of the solution with the MIT bag equation of state in this context of modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Probing the mass effect of heavy quark jets in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>

Abstract: The production of heavy quark (HQ) jets provides a new arena to address the mass effect of jet quenching in heavy-ion physics. This paper presents a theoretical study of HQ jet yield suppression in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC and focuses on the energy loss of HQ jets produced by different mechanisms. The p+p baseline is carried out by the SHERPA generator, and the jet-medium interactions are described by the SHELL transport model, which considers the elastic and inelastic partonic energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In p+p collisions, our numerical results indicate that the HQ jets from gluon splitting ($g \rightarrow Q$-jet) give the dominant contribution at high $p_T$, and it shows more dispersive structures than the HQ-initiated one ($Q \rightarrow Q$-jet). In nucleus-nucleus collisions, our calculations are consistent with the inclusive and b-jet $R_{AA}$ recently measured by the ATLAS collaboration, which suggests a remarkable manifestation of the mass effect of jet energy loss. As a result of the dispersive substructure, the $g \rightarrow Q$-jet will lose more energy than the $Q \rightarrow Q$-jet in the QGP. Due to the significant contribution of $g \rightarrow c$-jet, the $R_{AA}$ of c-jet will be comparable or even smaller than that of inclusive jet. To experimentally distinguish the $g \rightarrow Q$-jet and $Q \rightarrow Q$-jet, we propose the event selection strategies based on their topological features and test the performances. By isolating the $c \rightarrow c$-jet and $b \rightarrow b$-jet, the jets initiated by heavy quarks, we predict that the order of their $R_{AA}$ are in line with the mass hierarchy of energy loss. Future measurements on the $R_{AA}$ of $Q \rightarrow Q$-jet and $g \rightarrow Q$-jet will provide a unique chance to test the flavor/mass dependence of energy loss at the jet level.</description>

      <title>Exotic phases in finite-density $\mathbb{Z}_3$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice $\mathbb{Z}_3$ theories with complex actions share many key features with finite-density QCD including a sign problem and $CK$ symmetry. Complex $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin and gauge models exhibit a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality mapping them onto chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin and gauge models, which are simulatable with standard lattice methods in large regions of parameter space. The Migdal-Kadanoff real-space renormalization group (RG) preserves this duality, and we use it to compute the approximate phase diagram of both spin and gauge $\mathbb{Z}_3$ models in dimensions one through four. Chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin models are known to exhibit a Devil's Flower phase structure, with inhomogeneous phases which can be thought of as $\mathbb{Z}_3$ analogues of chiral spirals. Out of the large class of models we study, we find that only chiral spin models and their duals have a Devil's Flower structure with an infinite set of inhomogeneous phases, a result we attribute to Elitzur's theorem. We also find that different forms of the Migdal-Kadanoff RG produce different numbers of phases, a violation of the expectation for universal behavior from a real-space RG. We discuss extensions of our work to $\mathbb{Z}_N$ models, SU($N$) models and nonzero temperature.</description>

      <title>Complete dispersive evaluation of the hadronic light-by-light contribution to muon $g-2$</title>

Abstract: Hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) scattering defines one of the critical contributions in the Standard-Model prediction of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. In this Letter, we present a complete evaluation using a dispersive formalism, in which the HLbL tensor is reconstructed from its discontinuities, expressed in terms of simpler hadronic matrix elements that can be extracted from experiment. Profiting from recent developments in the determination of axial-vector transition form factors, short-distance constraints for the HLbL tensor, and the vector-vector-axial-vector correlator, we obtain $a_\mu^\text{HLbL}=101.9(7.9)\times 10^{-11}$, which meets the precision requirements set by the final result of the Fermilab experiment.</description>

      <title>Photon-induced neutron, proton and alpha evaporation from heavy nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Pb nuclei are excited through interactions induced by strong electromagnetic fields. The expected excitation energy could reach hundreds MeV, which leads to the subsequent emission of various particles, including neutrons, protons, and alpha particles. To accurately describe deexcitation of nuclei, we have developed two novel approaches. The first method utilizes the Heavy Ion Phase Space Exploration (HIPSE) model to simulate pre-equilibrium emissions and to estimate the excitation energy of the remaining nucleus. Our second approach introduces a new technique for modeling the excitation energy of the nucleus. This method consists of a two-component function to represent the excitation energy distribution more precisely, accounting for the energy loss due to the interaction between photons and quasi-deuteron. Both of these modeling techniques are integrated with the results produced by the GEMINI++ generator, which implements the Hauser-Feshbach formalism to simulate the statistical decay of excited nuclei. The alternative calculations are done with EMPIRE platform. Using these approaches, we obtained the cross sections for the emission of neutrons, protons, and alpha particles resulting from UPC at the LHC. Our results were compared with the experimental data of the ALICE group on neutron and proton multiplicities.</description>
