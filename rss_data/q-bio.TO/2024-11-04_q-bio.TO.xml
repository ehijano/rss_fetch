      <title>What the %PCSA? Addressing Diversity in Lower-Limb Musculoskeletal Models: Age- and Sex-related Differences in PCSA and Muscle Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Musculoskeletal (MSK) models offer a non-invasive way to understand biomechanical loads on joints and tendons, which are difficult to measure directly. Variations in muscle strength, especially relative differences between muscles, significantly impact model outcomes. Typically, scaled generic MSK models use maximum isometric forces that are not adjusted for different demographics, raising concerns about their accuracy. This review provides an overview on experimentally derived strength parameters, including physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), muscle mass (Mm), and relative muscle mass (%Mm), which is the relative distribution of muscle mass across the leg. We analysed differences by age and sex, and compared open-source lower limb MSK model parameters with experimental data from 57 studies. Our dataset, with records dating back to 1884, shows that uniformly increasing all maximum isometric forces in MSK models does not capture key muscle ratio differences due to age and sex. Males have a higher proportion of muscle mass in the rectus femoris and semimembranosus muscles, while females have a greater relative muscle mass in the pelvic (gluteus maximus and medius) and ankle muscles (tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and extensor digitorum longus). Older adults have a higher relative muscle mass in the gluteus medius, while younger individuals show more in the gastrocnemius. Current MSK models do not accurately represent muscle mass distribution for specific age or sex groups, and none of them accurately reflect female muscle mass distribution. Further research is needed to explore musculotendon age- and sex differences.</description>

      <title>A Novel Acoustic Wearable for Assessment of Tendon Health and Loading Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current methods of assessing tendon health such as clinical examination, imaging techniques, and implanted pressure sensors, are often based on a subjective assessment or are not accurate enough, are extremely expensive, or are limited to relatively large damage such as partial or gross tear of the tendon and cannot accurately assess and monitor smaller damages such as micro tears or strains. This study proposes an acoustic-based wearable capable of estimating tendon load and predicting damage severity in both deep and superficial tendons. Our device consists of an array of acoustic transducers positioned around the targeted body area in the form of a cuff. One of the transducers generates an acoustic wave, which is capable of penetrating deep into the body. As these waves propagate through different tissues, they are influenced by the mechanical and geometrical properties of each tissue. The rest of the transducers are used to measure the propagated waves. The results suggest that the proposed wearable offers a promising alternative to existing superficial tendon monitoring wearable devices by improving the domain of reach. The proposed wearable shows robust performance in estimating the force applied to the tendon. It also can effectively be used to compare the health condition of two tendons and predict the type of damage.</description>

      <title>PathoGen-X: A Cross-Modal Genomic Feature Trans-Align Network for Enhanced Survival Prediction from Histopathology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate survival prediction is essential for personalized cancer treatment. However, genomic data - often a more powerful predictor than pathology data - is costly and inaccessible. We present the cross-modal genomic feature translation and alignment network for enhanced survival prediction from histopathology images (PathoGen-X). It is a deep learning framework that leverages both genomic and imaging data during training, relying solely on imaging data at testing. PathoGen-X employs transformer-based networks to align and translate image features into the genomic feature space, enhancing weaker imaging signals with stronger genomic signals. Unlike other methods, PathoGen-X translates and aligns features without projecting them to a shared latent space and requires fewer paired samples. Evaluated on TCGA-BRCA, TCGA-LUAD, and TCGA-GBM datasets, PathoGen-X demonstrates strong survival prediction performance, emphasizing the potential of enriched imaging models for accessible cancer prognosis.</description>

      <title>VascX Models: Model Ensembles for Retinal Vascular Analysis from Color Fundus Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce VascX models, a comprehensive set of model ensembles for analyzing retinal vasculature from color fundus images (CFIs). Annotated CFIs were aggregated from public datasets . Additional CFIs, mainly from the population-based Rotterdam Study were annotated by graders for arteries and veins at pixel level, resulting in a dataset diverse in patient demographics and imaging conditions. VascX models demonstrated superior segmentation performance across datasets, image quality levels, and anatomic regions when compared to existing, publicly available models, likely due to the increased size and variety of our training set. Important improvements were observed in artery-vein and disc segmentation performance, particularly in segmentations of these structures on CFIs of intermediate quality, common in large cohorts and clinical datasets. Importantly, these improvements translated into significantly more accurate vascular features when we compared features extracted from VascX segmentation masks with features extracted from segmentation masks generated by previous models. With VascX models we provide a robust, ready-to-use set of model ensembles and inference code aimed at simplifying the implementation and enhancing the quality of automated retinal vasculature analyses. The precise vessel parameters generated by the model can serve as starting points for the identification of disease patterns in and outside of the eye.</description>
