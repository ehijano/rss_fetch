      <title>Consumption-Investment with anticipative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classical Merton consumption--investment problem when risky-asset returns are modeled by stochastic differential equations interpreted through a general $\alpha$-integral, interpolating between It\^{o}, Stratonovich, and related conventions. Holding preferences and the investment opportunity set fixed, changing the noise interpretation modifies the effective drift of asset returns in a systematic way.
  For logarithmic utility and constant volatilities, we derive closed-form optimal policies in a market with $n$ risky assets: optimal consumption remains a fixed fraction of wealth, while optimal portfolio weights are shifted according to $\theta_\alpha^\ast = V^{-1}(\mu-r\mathbf{1})+\alpha\,V^{-1}\operatorname{diag}(V)\mathbf{1}$, where $V$ is the return covariance matrix and $\operatorname{diag}(V)$ denotes the diagonal matrix with the same diagonal as $V$. In the single-asset case this reduces to $\theta_\alpha^\ast=(\mu-r)/\sigma^{2}+\alpha$.
  We then show that genuinely state-dependent effects arise when asset volatility is driven by a stochastic factor correlated with returns. In this setting, the $\alpha$-interpretation generates an additional drift correction proportional to the instantaneous covariation between factor and return noise. As a canonical example, we analyze a Heston stochastic volatility model, where the resulting optimal risky exposure depends inversely on the current variance level.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantum Speedups for Repeatedly Nested Expectation Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the estimation of repeatedly nested expectations (RNEs) with a constant horizon (number of nestings) using quantum computing. We propose a quantum algorithm that achieves $\varepsilon$-error with cost $\tilde O(\varepsilon^{-1})$, up to logarithmic factors. Standard lower bounds show this scaling is essentially optimal, yielding an almost quadratic speedup over the best classical algorithm. Our results extend prior quantum speedups for single nested expectations to repeated nesting, and therefore cover a broader range of applications, including optimal stopping. This extension requires a new derandomized variant of the classical randomized Multilevel Monte Carlo (rMLMC) algorithm. Careful de-randomization is key to overcoming a variable-time issue that typically increases quantized versions of classical randomized algorithms.</description>

      <title>Almost sure null bankruptcy of testing-by-betting strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bounded mean betting procedure serves as a crucial interface between the domains of (1) sequential, anytime-valid statistical inference, and (2) online learning and portfolio selection algorithms. While recent work in both domains has established the exponential wealth growth of numerous betting strategies under any alternative distribution, the tightness of the inverted confidence sets, and the pathwise minimax regret bounds, little has been studied regarding the asymptotics of these strategies under the null hypothesis. Under the null, a strategy induces a wealth martingale converging to some random variable that can be zero (bankrupt) or non-zero (non-bankrupt, e.g. when it eventually stops betting). In this paper, we show the conceptually intuitive but technically nontrivial fact that these strategies (universal portfolio, Krichevsky-Trofimov, GRAPA, hedging, etc.) all go bankrupt with probability one, under any non-degenerate null distribution. Part of our analysis is based on the subtle almost sure divergence of various sums of $\sum O_p(n^{-1})$ type, a result of independent interest. We also demonstrate the necessity of null bankruptcy by showing that non-bankrupt strategies are all improvable in some sense. Our results significantly deepen our understanding of these betting strategies as they qualify their behavior on "almost all paths", whereas previous results are usually on "all paths" (e.g. regret bounds) or "most paths" (e.g. concentration inequalities and confidence sets).</description>
