      <title>Generalized Rosenfeld-Tarazona scaling and high-density specific heat of simple liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original Rosenfeld-Tarazona (RT) scaling of the excess energy in simple dense fluids predicts a $\propto T^{3/5}$ thermal correction to the fluid Madelung energy. This implies that the excess isochoric heat capacity scales as $C_{\rm v}^{\rm ex}\propto T^{-2/5}$. Careful examination performed in this paper demonstrates that the exponent $-2/5$ is not always optimal. For instance, in the Lennard-Jones fluid in some vicinity of the triple point, the exponent $-1/3$ turns out to be more appropriate. The analysis of the specific heat data in neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and liquid mercury reveals that no single value of the exponent exists, describing all the data simultaneously. Therefore we propose a generalized RT scaling in the form $C_{\rm v}^{\rm ex}\propto T^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ is a density- and material-dependent adjustable parameter. The question concerning which material properties and parameters affect the exponent $\alpha$ and whether it can be predicted from general physical arguments requires further investigation.</description>

      <title>Geometric Frustration in Twist-Bend Nematic Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid crystals formed of bent-core molecules are exotic materials that exhibit the twist-bend nematic phase. This arises when an energetic preference for nonzero local bend distortion is accommodated via twist in the texture, resulting in properties synonymous with both smectics and cholesterics. Here we describe how the frustration inherent to the twist-bend phase can be exacerbated by confinement and boundary anchoring. Using a combination of numerical simulations, topological and geometric analysis, we catalogue the equilibrium textures that arise in spherical twist-bend droplets with a radial anchoring as the two key parameters -- the molecular cone angle and the ratio between the pitch length and droplet radius -- are varied. This form of confinement is known to produce a wide variety of topologically and geometrically complex metastable states in cholesterics. We find that twist-bend nematic droplets are no different, exhibiting a variety of complex layered states, defect constellations, and Hopfions. However, whilst many of the structures and defect configurations that we observe are equivalent to their cholesteric counterparts, they are geometrically very distinct, in part due to the absence of chirality.</description>

      <title>Clogging-unclogging transition in 2D vertical pipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally and numerically investigate the clogging behavior of granular materials in a two-dimensional vertical pipe. The nonmonotonicity of clogging probability found in cylindrical vertical pipe is also observed in the two-dimensional case. We numerically demonstrate that the clogging probability strongly correlates with the friction coefficient $\mu$, in addition to the pipe-to-particle diameter ratio $D/d$. We thus construct a clogging-unclogging $D/d$-$\mu$ phase diagram within the $2&lt;D/d&lt;3$ range. Finally, by analyzing the geometrical arrangements of particles and using a simple analysis of forces and torques, we are able to predict the clogging-unclogging transition in the $D/d$-$\mu$ phase diagram and explain the mechanism of the observed counterintuitive nonmonotonicity in more detail. From this work, we identify two primary conditions for clogging formation: first, all particles must achieve force and torque equilibrium; second, they must geometrically form an arch. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the clogging-unclogging transition in vertical pipe is a natural example of the shear jamming transition.</description>

      <title>Role of Translational Noise in Motility-Induced Phase Separation of Hard Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles, like motile cells and artificial colloids, can spontaneously form macroscopic clusters. This phenomenon is called motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) and occurs even without attractive forces, provided that the self-propulsion direction fluctuates slowly. In addition to rotational noise, these particles may experience translational noise, not coupled to rotational noise, due to environmental fluctuations. We study the role of translational noise in the clustering of active Brownian hard disks. To tease apart the contribution of translational noise, we model excluded-volume interactions through a Monte-Carlo-like overlap rejection approach. Upon increasing the translational diffusivity, we find that clusters become more rounded (less fractal), eventually transitioning to genuine MIPS. For sufficiently higher translational diffusivity, clusters melt down. We develop a theory for the cluster mass distribution, and employ a hydrodynamic approach with parameters taken from the simulation, that explains the clustering phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Tracking shear mode dynamics across the glass transition in a 2D colloidal system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-wavelength collective shear dynamics are profoundly different in solids and liquids. According to the theoretical framework developed by Maxwell and Frenkel, collective shear waves vanish upon melting by acquiring a characteristic wave-vector gap, known as the $k$-gap. While this prediction has been supported by numerous simulations, experimental validation remains limited. In this work, we track the dispersion relation of collective shear modes in a two-dimensional colloidal system and provide direct experimental evidence for the emergence of a $k$-gap. This gap appears at an effective temperature consistent with the onset of the glass transition and the vanishing of the static shear modulus. Our results not only confirm the predictions of the Maxwell-Frenkel framework but also highlight their relevance across continuous melting processes originating from low-temperature amorphous solid phases.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Effects Determine Nonequilibrium Phase Behaviors in Chemically Driven Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling between chemical fuel consumption and phase separation can lead to condensation at a nonequilibrium steady state, resulting in phase behaviors that are not described by equilibrium thermodynamics. Theoretical models of such "chemically driven fluids" typically invoke near-equilibrium approximations at small length scales. However, because dissipation occurs due to both molecular-scale chemical reactions and mesoscale diffusive transport, it has remained unclear which properties of phase-separated reaction-diffusion systems can be assumed to be at an effective equilibrium. Here we use microscopic simulations to show that mesoscopic fluxes are dependent on nonequilibrium fluctuations at phase-separated interfaces. We further develop a first-principles theory to predict nonequilibrium coexistence curves, localization of mesoscopic fluxes near phase-separated interfaces, and droplet size-scaling relations in good agreement with simulations. Our findings highlight the central role of interfacial properties in governing nonequilibrium condensation and have broad implications for droplet nucleation, coarsening, and size control in chemically driven fluids.</description>

      <title>Sliding Friction of Hard Sliders on Rubber: Theory and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of sliding friction for rigid triangular steel sliders on soft rubber substrates under both lubricated and dry conditions. For rubber surfaces lubricated with a thin film of silicone oil, the measured sliding friction at room temperature agrees well with theoretical predictions obtained from a viscoelastic model originally developed for rolling friction. On the lubricated surface, the sliding friction is primarily due to bulk viscoelastic energy dissipation in the rubber. The model, which includes strain-dependent softening of the rubber modulus, accurately predicts the experimental friction curves. At lower temperatures ($T = -20^\circ {\rm C}$ and $-40^\circ {\rm C}$), the measured friction exceeds the theoretical prediction. We attribute this increase to penetration of the lubricant film by surface asperities, leading to a larger adhesive contribution. For dry surfaces, the adhesive contribution becomes dominant. By subtracting the viscoelastic component inferred from the lubricated case, we estimate the interfacial frictional shear stress. This shear stress increases approximately linearly with the logarithm of the sliding speed, consistent with stress-augmented thermal activation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Effects of symmetry and hydrodynamics on the cohesion of groups of swimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When groups of inertial swimmers move together, hydrodynamic interactions play a key role in shaping their collective dynamics, including the cohesion of the group. To explore how these interactions influence group cohesion, we develop a three-dimensional, inviscid, far-field model of a swimmer. Focusing on symmetric triangular, diamond, and circular group arrangements, we investigate whether passive hydrodynamics alone can promote cohesive behavior, and what role symmetry of the group plays. While small symmetric (and even asymmetric) groups can be cohesive, larger groups typically are not, instead breaking apart into smaller, self-organized subgroups that are cohesive. Notably, we discover circular arrangements of swimmers that chase each other around a circle, resembling the milling behavior of natural fish schools; we call this hydrodynamic milling. Hydrodynamic milling is cohesive in the sense that it is a fixed point of a particular Poincar\'e map, but it is unstable, especially to asymmetric perturbations. Our findings suggest that while passive hydrodynamics alone cannot sustain large-scale cohesion indefinitely, controlling interactions between subgroups, or controlling the behavior of only the periphery of a large group, could potentially enable stable collective behavior with minimal active input.</description>

      <title>Effects of curvature on growing films of microorganisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To provide insight into the basic properties of emerging structures when bacteria or other microorganisms conquer surfaces, it is crucial to analyze their growth behavior during the formation of thin films. In this regard, many theoretical studies focus on the behavior of elongating straight objects. They repel each other through volume exclusion and divide into two halves when reaching a certain threshold length. However, in reality, hardly any object of a certain elongation is perfectly straight. Therefore, we here study the consequences of the curvature of individuals on the growth of colonies and thin active films. This individual curvature, so far hardly considered, turns out to qualitatively affect the overall growth behavior of the colony. Particularly, strings of stacked curved cells emerge that show branched structures, while the size of orientationally ordered domains in the colony is significantly decreased. Furthermore, we identify emergent spatio-orientational coupling that is not observed in colonies of straight cells. Our results are important for a fundamental understanding of the interaction and spreading of microorganisms on surfaces, with implications for medical applications and bioengineering.</description>

      <title>PolyConf: Unlocking Polymer Conformation Generation through Hierarchical Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polymer conformation generation is a critical task that enables atomic-level studies of diverse polymer materials. While significant advances have been made in designing conformation generation methods for small molecules and proteins, these methods struggle to generate polymer conformations due to their unique structural characteristics. Meanwhile, the scarcity of polymer conformation datasets further limits the progress, making this important area largely unexplored. In this work, we propose PolyConf, a pioneering tailored polymer conformation generation method that leverages hierarchical generative models to unlock new possibilities. Specifically, we decompose the polymer conformation into a series of local conformations (i.e., the conformations of its repeating units), generating these local conformations through an autoregressive model, and then generating their orientation transformations via a diffusion model to assemble them into the complete polymer conformation. Moreover, we develop the first benchmark with a high-quality polymer conformation dataset derived from molecular dynamics simulations to boost related research in this area. The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that PolyConf consistently outperforms existing conformation generation methods, thus facilitating advancements in polymer modeling and simulation.</description>

      <title>Crystal to liquid cross-over for active particles with inverse-square power-law interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional system comprising of $N$ run-and-tumble particles confined in a harmonic trap interacting via a repulsive inverse-square power-law interaction. We numerically compute the global density profile in the steady state which shows interesting crossovers between three different regimes: as the activity increases, we observe a change from a density with sharp peaks characteristic of a crystal region to a smooth bell-shaped density profile, passing through the intermediate stage of a smooth Wigner semi-circle characteristic of a liquid phase. We also investigate analytically the crossover between the crystal and the liquid regions by computing the covariance of the positions of these particles in the steady state in the weak noise limit. It is achieved by using the method introduced in Touzo {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 109}, 014136 (2024)] to study the active Dyson Brownian motion. Our analytical results are corroborated by thorough numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle suspensions in confined geometries can become clogged, which can have a catastrophic effect on function in biological and industrial systems. Here, we investigate the macroscopic dynamics of suspensions in constricted geometries. We develop a minimal continuum two-phase model that allows for variation in particle volume fraction. The model comprises a ``wet solid'' phase with material properties dependent on the particle volume fraction, and a seepage Darcy flow of fluid through the particles. We find that spatially varying geometry (or material properties) can induce emergent heterogeneity in the particle fraction and trigger the abrupt transition to a high-particle-fraction ``clogged'' state.</description>
