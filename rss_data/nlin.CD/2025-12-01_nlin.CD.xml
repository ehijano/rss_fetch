      <title>Prediction performance of random reservoirs with different topology for nonlinear dynamical systems with different number of degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is a powerful framework for predicting nonlinear dynamical systems, yet the role of reservoir topology$-$particularly symmetry in connectivity and weights$-$remains not adequately understood. This work investigates how the structure of the network influences the performance of RC in four systems of increasing complexity: the Mackey-Glass system with delayed-feedback, two low-dimensional thermal convection models, and a three-dimensional shear flow model exhibiting transition to turbulence. Using five reservoir topologies in which connectivity patterns and edge weights are controlled independently, we evaluate both direct- and cross-prediction tasks. The results show that symmetric reservoir networks substantially improve prediction accuracy for the convection-based systems, especially when the input dimension is smaller than the number of degrees of freedom. In contrast, the shear-flow model displays almost no sensitivity to topological symmetry due to its strongly chaotic high-dimensional dynamics. These findings reveal how structural properties of reservoir networks affect their ability to learn complex dynamics and provide guidance for designing more effective RC architectures.</description>

      <title>Beta-Dependent Gamma Feedback and Endogenous Volatility Amplification in Option Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework that aims to link micro-level option hedging and stock-specific factor exposure with macro-level market turbulence and explain endogenous volatility amplification during gamma-squeeze events. By explicitly modeling market-maker delta-neutral hedging and incorporating beta-dependent volatility normalization, we derive a stability condition that characterizes the onset of a gamma-squeeze event. The model captures a nonlinear recursive feedback loop between market-maker hedging and price movements and the resulting self-reinforcing dynamics. From a complex-systems perspective, the dynamics represent a bounded nonlinear response in which effective gain depends jointly on beta-normalized shock perception and gamma-scaled sensitivity. Our analysis highlights that low-beta stocks exhibit disproportionately strong feedback even for modest absolute price movements.</description>

      <title>Identifying Stochastic Dynamics from Non-Sequential Data (DyNoSeD)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17690v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inferring stochastic dynamics from data is central across the sciences, yet in many applications only unordered, non-sequential measurements are available-often restricted to limited regions of state space-so standard time-series methods do not apply. We introduce DyNoSeD, a first-principles framework that identifies unknown dynamical parameters from such non-sequential data by minimizing Fokker-Planck residuals. We develop two complementary routes: a local route that handles region-restricted data via locally estimated scores, and a global route that fits dynamics from globally sampled data using a kernel Stein discrepancy without explicit density or score estimation. When the dynamics are affine in the unknown parameters, we prove a necessary-and-sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of the inferred parameters and derive a sensitivity analysis that identifies which parameters are tightly constrained by the data and which remain effectively free under over-parameterization. For general non-affine case, both routes define differentiable losses amenable to gradient-based optimization. As demonstrations, we recover (i) the three parameters of a stochastic Lorenz system from non-sequential data (region-restricted data for the local route and full steady-state data for the global route) and (ii) a 3x7interaction matrix of a nonlinear gene-regulatory network derived from a published B-cell differentiation model, using only unordered steady-state samples and applying the global route. Finally, we show that the same Fokker-Planck residual viewpoint supports a "dynamics-to-density" complement that trains a normalized density estimator directly from known dynamics without any observations. Overall, IDyNSD provides two first-principles routes for system-identification from non-sequential data, grounded in the Fokker-Planck equation, that link data, density, and stochastic dynamics.</description>

      <title>A homoclinic route to chaos in omnivore communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Omnivory, where species feed across multiple trophic levels, is a widespread feature of ecological networks. A key mechanism underlying such complexity is intraguild predation (IGP), in which a top predator consumes both an intermediate predator and a shared resource. Here, we show that Shilnikov homoclinic orbits emerge in a minimal intraguild predation model, triggering a cascade of homoclinic bifurcations near a saddle-focus equilibrium that culminates in chaos. Numerical simulations and Lyapunov spectrum analysis reveal multiple coexistence modes, ranging from regular oscillations to Shilnikov homoclinic orbits and chaos. Our model quantitatively reproduces patterns observed in natural omnivore networks, providing mechanistic insights into complex population fluctuations in ecological systems.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Geodesic Dynamics with Conservative, Dissipative, and GUP Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive generalized geodesic equations in curved spacetime that include conservative forces, dissipative effects, and quantum-gravity-motivated minimal-length corrections. Conservative interactions are incorporated through external vector potentials, while dissipative dynamics arise from an exponential rescaling of the particle Lagrangian. Phenomenological study of Quantum-gravity effects is introduced via Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) deformed Poisson brackets in the Hamiltonian framework. We show that free-particle geodesics remain unaffected at leading order, but external potentials induce velocity-dependent corrections, implying possible violations of the equivalence principle. As an application, we analyze modified trajectories in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes dominated by dust, radiation, stiff matter, and dark energy. Our results establish a unified approach to conservative, dissipative, and GUP-corrected geodesics, providing a framework to probe the interplay between external forces, spacetime curvature, and Planck-scale physics.</description>
