      <title>Iterative structural coarse-graining for contagion dynamics in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contagion dynamics in complex networks drive critical phenomena such as epidemic spread and information diffusion,but their analysis remains computationally prohibitive in large-scale, high-complexity systems. Here, we introduce the Iterative Structural Coarse-Graining (ISCG) framework, a scalable methodology that reduces network complexity while preserving key contagion dynamics with high fidelity. Importantly, we derive theoretical conditions ensuring the precise preservation of both macroscopic outbreak sizes and microscopic node-level infection probabilities during network reduction. Under these conditions, extensive experiments on diverse empirical networks demonstrate that ISCG achieves significant complexity reduction without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Beyond simplification, ISCG reveals multiscale structural patterns that govern contagion processes, enabling practical solutions to longstanding challenges in contagion dynamics. Specifically, ISCG outperforms traditional adaptive centrality-based approaches in identifying influential spreaders, immunizing critical edges, and optimizing sentinel placement for early outbreak detection, offering superior accuracy and computational efficiency. By bridging computational efficiency with dynamical fidelity, ISCG provides a transformative framework for analyzing large-scale contagion processes, with broad applications for epidemiology, information dissemination, and network resilience.</description>

      <title>Diffractive Magic Cube Network with Super-high Capacity Enabled by Mechanical Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiplexing and dynamic reconfigurable metasurfaces have been extensively studied to enhance system capacity in response to the challenges posed by the exponential growth of optical information. Among them, the mechanically reconfigurable strategy offers a cost-effective and low-complexity approach for capacity enhancement. However, the channel numbers achieved in current studies are insufficient for practical applications because of inadequate mechanical transformations and suboptimal optimization methods. In this article, a diffractive magic cube network (DMCN) is proposed to advance the multiplexing capacity of mechanically reconfigurable metasurfaces. We utilized the deep diffractive neural network (D2NN) model to jointly optimize the subset of channels generated by the combination of three mechanical operations, permutation, translation, and rotation. The 144-channel holograms, 108-channel single-focus/multi-focus, and 60-channel orbital angular momentum (OAM) beam/comb generation were numerically achieved and experimentally validated using a spatial light modulator (SLM) and a reflective mirror. Our strategy not only provides a novel paradigm to improve metasurface capacity to super-high level with low crosstalk, but also paves the way for new advancements in optical storage, computing, communication, and photolithography.</description>

      <title>Robust Bayesian inference with gapped LISA data using all-in-one TDI-$\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), an ESA L-class mission, is designed to detect gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band, with operations expected to begin in the next decade. LISA will enable studies of astrophysical phenomena such as massive black hole mergers, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and compact binary systems. A key challenge in analyzing LISA's data is the significant laser frequency noise, which must be suppressed using time-delay interferometry (TDI). Classical TDI mitigates this noise by algebraically combining phase measurements taken at different times and spacecraft. However, data gaps caused by instrumental issues or operational interruptions complicate the process. These gaps affect multiple TDI samples due to the time delays inherent to the algorithm, rendering surrounding measurements unusable for parameter inference. In this paper, we apply the recently proposed variant of TDI known as TDI-$\infty$ to astrophysical parameter inference, focusing on the challenge posed by data gaps. TDI-$\infty$ frames the LISA likelihood numerically in terms of raw measurements, marginalizing over laser phase noises under the assumption of infinite noise variance. Additionally, TDI-$\infty$ is set up to incorporate and cancel other noise sources beyond laser noise, including optical bench motion, clock noise, and modulation noise, establishing it as an all-in-one TDI solution. The method gracefully handles measurement interruptions, removing the need to explicitly address discontinuities during template matching. We integrate TDI-$\infty$ into a Bayesian framework, demonstrating its superior performance in scenarios involving gaps. Compared to classical TDI, the method preserves signal integrity more effectively and is particularly interesting for low-latency applications, where the limited amount of available data makes data gaps particularly disruptive.</description>

      <title>A Point-cloud Clustering &amp; Tracking Algorithm for Radar Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In data mining, density-based clustering, which entails classifying datapoints according to their distributions in some space, is an essential method to extract information from large datasets. With the advent of software-based radio, ionospheric radars are capable of producing unprecedentedly large datasets of plasma turbulence backscatter observations, and new automatic techniques are needed to sift through them. We present an algorithm to automatically identify and track clusters of radar echoes through time, using \texttt{dbscan}, a celebrated density-based clustering method for noisy point-clouds. We demonstrate our algorithm's efficiency by tracking turbulent structures in the E-region ionosphere, the so-called radar aurora. Through conjugate auroral imagery, as well as \emph{in-situ} satellite observations, we demonstrate that the observed turbulent structures generally track the motion of auroras. What is more, the radar aurora bulk motions exhibit key qualities of auroral electric field enhancements that has previously been observed with various instruments. We present preliminary statistical results using our new method, and briefly discuss the method's limitations and potential future adaptations.</description>

      <title>Refinable modeling for unbinned SMEFT analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present techniques for estimating the effects of systematic uncertainties in unbinned data analyses at the LHC. Our primary focus is constraining the Wilson coefficients in the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT), but the methodology applies to broader parametric models of phenomena beyond the standard model (BSM). We elevate the well-established procedures for binned Poisson counting experiments to the unbinned case by utilizing machine-learned surrogates of the likelihood ratio. This approach can be applied to various theoretical, modeling, and experimental uncertainties. By establishing a common statistical framework for BSM and systematic effects, we lay the groundwork for future unbinned analyses at the LHC. Additionally, we introduce a novel tree-boosting algorithm capable of learning highly accurate parameterizations of systematic effects. This algorithm extends the existing toolkit with a versatile and robust alternative. We demonstrate our approach using the example of an SMEFT interpretation of highly energetic top quark pair production in proton-proton collisions.</description>

      <title>Automated Review Generation Method Based on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Literature research, vital for scientific work, faces the challenge of surging information volumes exceeding researchers' processing capabilities. We present an automated review generation method based on large language models (LLMs) to overcome efficiency bottlenecks and reduce cognitive load. Our statistically validated evaluation framework demonstrates that the generated reviews match or exceed manual quality, offering broad applicability across research fields without requiring users' domain knowledge. Applied to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts, our method swiftly analyzed 343 articles, averaging seconds per article per LLM account, producing comprehensive reviews spanning 35 topics, with extended analysis of 1041 articles providing insights into catalysts' properties. Through multi-layered quality control, we effectively mitigated LLMs' hallucinations, with expert verification confirming accuracy and citation integrity while demonstrating hallucination risks reduced to below 0.5\% with 95\% confidence. Released Windows application enables one-click review generation, enhancing research productivity and literature recommendation efficiency while setting the stage for broader scientific explorations.</description>
