      <title>The Silent Majority: The Interacting Post-Common-Envelope Binaries Underlying Cataclysmic Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the orbital period distribution of post-common-envelope white-dwarf-main-sequence (WDMS) binaries by cross-matching the new spectroscopic Gaia DR3 WDMS catalog with TESS light curves, and applying a uniform periodicity search and vetting pipeline. We identify 107 periodic systems, including 74 eclipsing binaries (32 new) and 33 binaries exhibiting only sinusoidal variations. Injection-recovery tests and a forward detectability model yield a completeness-corrected distribution that is well-described by a two-component function: a log-period Gaussian peaking at $P_{\rm orb} \approx 4.1 $ h with $\sigma \approx 1.8$ h, plus a rising component that begins near $P_{\rm orb}\approx12.9$ h. We refer to this extended component as the long-period tail. It consists exclusively of detached non-interacting post-common-envelope binaries (PCEBs) that likely emerged from the common envelope and have not yet initiated mass transfer. In contrast, the short-period Gaussian is dominated by interacting or near-contact systems (including 22 known cataclysmic variables), consistent with high Roche-lobe filling factors. From the completeness-corrected distribution we infer that $29.8\%\pm4.5\%$ of the spatially unresolved WDMSs in our parent catalog are close PCEBs. Binary population synthesis models with high common-envelope efficiencies overproduce long-period systems and fail to reproduce the sharp peak, whereas lower efficiencies ($\alpha\lambda \leq 0.3$) match the peak more closely, yet still underpredict the tail. Our results hint at a large, currently under-classified reservoir of pre-cataclysmic variables and weakly accreting binaries, and provide new constraints on common-envelope physics.</description>

      <title>Attributing the O'Connell effect in contact binaries to a cooling mass-transfer stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contact binaries are very short-period systems that are continuously interacting by transferring mass and energy. Obtaining large, statistical samples of contact binaries from photometric surveys can put valuable constraints on the various processes involved in their evolution. Modeling those systems however present some challenges. In some contact-binary light curves, the O'Connell effect is visible, where the maxima at both quarter phases are unequal. In the literature, this effect is typically attributed to magnetic spots on the surface of the binary. In this work, we model contact-binary surfaces using PHOEBE, and include a parametric prescription for a lateral mass- and energy-transfer stream that travels from the hotter primary to the cooler secondary. We allow this stream to have a variable heat capacity. We fit a system from the Kepler sample with a strong O'Connell effect, and show that a low-heat capacity stream can explain the unequal maxima. This suggests that, in such systems, surface flows can play a significant role in transferring heat between components. Our methods can be used on larger samples of contact binaries from OGLE, Kepler, or TESS to advance our understanding of contact binary structure and evolution.</description>

      <title>Contact-binary evolution with energy transfer and saturated magnetic braking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of low-mass contact binaries is influenced by angular-momentum loss, mass and energy transfer, and the nuclear evolution of the components. They have periods shorter than one day, and we expect their period evolution to be dominated by magnetic braking. Evidence for saturated magnetic braking was presented by studying the period distribution of detached eclipsing binaries. This means the strength of magnetic braking likely does not cause a steep period-shrinking relation derived from the widely used Skumanich law. We find further evidence for saturated magnetic braking by considering evolutionary models of low-mass contact binaries. We also show that energy transfer must play an important role over a wide parameter range in producing the observed low mass ratios of contact binaries.</description>

      <title>Looking for Companionship: Radial Velocity Follow-Up of Lithium-Rich Giants with ESPRESSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-rich red giants have been a long-standing mystery in stellar astrophysics. A leading theory to explain these chemically peculiar and rare objects is interactions with a close companion. To investigate their companion fraction, we collected high-resolution spectra of 33 Li-rich red giants using ESPRESSO, and used The Joker constrain their orbital parameters. We find an overall companion rate of $27\%$ (9/33). Secondary masses reveal one planetary companion ($ M\sin i \approx 7 \; \rm M_{Jup}$), three brown dwarfs ($ M\sin i=30-33 \; \rm M_{Jup}$), and five stellar-mass companions ($M\sin i= 0.2-0.8 \;\rm M_\odot$). Our findings suggest that Li-rich red giants with lower lithium abundance ($\rm A(Li) \approx 1.5 \; dex$) tend to be in binaries as compared to those with higher lithium abundance, and Li-rich red giants with $\log g = 2-3 \rm \; dex$ have a higher companion rate than those outside of this range. We offer two potential formation mechanisms of our Li-rich sample: (i) the progenitor mass of stellar mass companions suggest that these objects were potentially lithium-producing, intermediate-mass AGB stars; (ii) the sub-stellar companions were initially in multi-planet systems, but dynamical instability caused the tidal dissipation of close-in planets thereby enhancing the red giant in lithium. Extended baselines and dedicated follow-up with Gaia DR4 astrometry are required to confirm the orbital parameters of our systems and distinguish between mechanisms.</description>

      <title>4 Second and 169 Second Rotation of Two Isolated, Ultramassive, Strongly Magnetic White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric variability in massive, magnetic white dwarfs (WDs) on the timescales of less than a few hours is oft interpreted as being due to magnetic spots on the surface of a rotating star. Increasingly, numbers of these short period variables are being discovered with the continued growth of time-domain astronomy, testing theories of magnetic white dwarf formation and angular momentum evolution. We present the detection of extremely rapid rotation in the WDs SDSS J1557+0411 and PG 1312+099, with periods of 168.94 s and 83.72 s, respectively. We consider other possible causes of the monoperiodic photometric variability, including binarity (eclipses and ellipsoidal variations) and asteroseismic pulsations. Though these cannot be ruled out with the existing data, these alternative explanations seem unlikely. SDSS J1557+0411 was predicted to be a rapidly rotating oxygen-neon core WD by Camisassa et al. (2022), a prediction borne out at least in part by our observations. PG 1312+099 was previously observed via polarimetry to be rotating with a period of ~5.4 h; we propose that this object may be an unresolved double degenerate system.</description>

      <title>The s process in massive stars, a benchmark for neutron capture reaction rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A clear definition of the contribution from the slow neutron-capture process (s process) to the solar abundances between Fe and the Sr-Zr region is a crucial challenge for nuclear astrophysics. Robust s-process predictions are necessary to disentangle the contribution from other stellar processes producing elements in the same mass region. Nuclear uncertainties are affecting s-process calculations, but most of the needed nuclear input are accessible to present nuclear experiments or they will be in the near future. Neutron-capture rates have a great impact on the s process in massive stars, which is a fundamental source for the solar abundances of the lighter s-process elements heavier than Fe (weak s-process component). In this work we present a new nuclear sensitivity study to explore the impact on the s process in massive stars of 86 neutron-capture rates, including all the reactions between C and Si and between Fe and Zr. We derive the impact of the rates at the end of the He-burning core and at the end of the C-burning shell, where the $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$,n)$^{25}$Mg reaction is is the main neutron source. We confirm the relevance of the light isotopes capturing neutrons in competition with the Fe seeds as a crucial feature of the s process in massive stars. For heavy isotopes we study the propagation of the neutron-capture uncertainties, finding a clear difference of the impact of Fe and Co isotope rates with respect to the rates of heavier stable isotopes. The local uncertainty propagation due to the neutron-capture rates at the s-process branching points is also considered, discussing the example of $^{85}$Kr. The complete results of our study for all the 86 neutron-capture rates are available online. Finally, we present the impact on the weak s process of the neutron-capture rates included in the new ASTRAL library (v0.2).</description>

      <title>Disentangling Thermal and Abundance Characteristics in a Solar Flare Using SDO/AIA, Hinode/XRT, and MinXSS-1 Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal properties of a solar flare by the observations of soft X-ray Telescope (XRT) on board Hinode and the Atmospheric Image Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/AIA). Our analysis reveals a tenuous but hot plasma cloud located above the flare loops. The flare loops and plasma cloud exhibit independent temperature profiles as a function of time, implying different heating mechanisms are present in these structures. We interpret the plasma cloud as an eruptive filament directly heated in the corona via magnetic reconnection that occurs when a rising filament interacts with this eruptive filament. Previous disk-integrated solar soft X-ray spectral measurements of this flare using the Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer CubeSat-1 (MinXSS-1) inferred coronal abundances at the flare peak. However, MinXSS synthetic spectra from AIA observations show that the plasma cloud is too tenuous to be detected in MinXSS-1 and thus the coronal abundances of low FIP elements must be in emission from the flare loops. Furthermore, we demonstrate the non-negligible differences in differential emission measures (DEMs) between coronal and photospheric abundance models. These results highlight the importance of instruments capable of simultaneous spectral and spatial diagnostics during large-scale solar events. Such coordinated measurements would enable more accurate thermal and compositional analyses and deeper insight into the underlying physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Sympathetic Eruption of Two Filaments and Associated Solar Coronal Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining the high-quality observations from the {\it Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO), the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG), and the Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE), we report a solar coronal jet triggered by the sympathetic eruption of two filaments on 2024 January 11. Initially, the western segment of an active region filament erupted. The erupting plasma propagated eastward, approximately along the filament's axis. This eruption perturbed the magnetic field of a second filament situated near its eastern footpoint, the second filament then erupted sympathetically about one hour later. The eruption of the second filament is a failed one, with the majority of the filament material falling back after the initial lifting. Although no GOES flare accompanied these filament eruptions, distinct brightenings were observed following each eruption. The second eruption produced a large coronal jet, which propagated along a bent trajectory with an apparent deflection angle of approximately 90 degrees. No clear evidence of magnetic reconnection was detected at the deflection site, thus we suspect that the jet may have traveled along an S-shaped trans-equatorial loop and shown a curved trajectory. This event exhibits multiple phenomena: partial filament eruption, failed filament eruption, sympathetic filament eruption, jet initiation by filament eruption, and apparently deflected jet propagation. Collectively, these observations highlight the complexity and diversity of solar activity.</description>

      <title>The Growth of the Central Black Holes in Quasi-stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations by JWST have confirmed the presence of supermassive black holes (BHs) at redshifts $z\gtrsim10$, lending support to scenarios in which BHs experience rapid growth through intense gas accretion. Here we investigate the growth of a BH embedded at the center of a quasi-star, a theoretically predicted object formed via direct collapse. In a quasi-star, the central BH accretes at a highly super-Eddington rate, while the excess energy is transported outward by convection and radiated at approximately the Eddington luminosity of the entire star. We employ the open-source stellar evolution code \texttt{MESA} to construct quasi-star models and follow the time-dependent growth of the central BH under different prescriptions for the accretion rate at the inner boundary $R_i$, and further considering the effect of winds. For the case $R_i=NR_{\rm B}$, where $N$ is a constant and $R_{\rm B}$ is the Bondi radius corresponding to the mass of the BH and the gas infalling onto it, our models terminate when the BH mass reaches a critical value $M_{\mathrm{crit}}(N)=c_{s,i}^3/(12\sqrt{N^3G^3\pi\rho_i})$ (where $c_{s,i}$ and $\rho_i$ are the sound speed and density at $R_i$, respectively), a limit we also derive analytically. Models that feature an inner convective region matched to an outer adiabatic envelope exhibit BH growth up to approximately $M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_\star\simeq 0.33$, largely independent of the stellar mass $M_\star$ itself. This ratio is approximately preserved even in the presence of mass loss, as several properties of the model are independent of the quasi-star's total mass.</description>

      <title>On the influence of component orbital motion on the photometric variability of DF Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the analysis of the long-term light curve of the young binary DF Tau spanning approximately 125 years, we infer that its brightness variations are associated with changes in the accretion rate from the circumstellar protoplanetary disk onto the primary. We have also substantially improved the orbital parameters of DF Tau, which enables us to align its secular light curve with the evolution of the binary's component separation. The relationship between the long-term brightness variations and the orbital motion of DF Tau, if present, appears to be inconsistent with theoretical predictions. Notably, similar discrepancies between theory and observations are also seen in other young binary systems. Furthermore, the source of the polarized radiation in the optical range is found to be located at a distance of $\lesssim 0.5^{\prime\prime}$ from the star, with the polarization variability showing no dependence on the orbital phase.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature of HE 0107-5240</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast majority of the most iron-poor stars in the Galaxy exhibit a strong carbon enhancement, with C/H ratios only about two orders of magnitude below solar. This unusual chemical composition likely reflects the properties of the gas cloud from which these stars formed, having been enriched by one, or at most a few, supernovae. A remarkable member of this stellar class, HE 0107-5240 with [Fe/H]=-5.56, has been identified as part of a binary system. To constrain its orbital parameters, radial velocity monitoring has been carried out using the ESPRESSO spectrograph. Radial velocities were derived using cross-correlation with a template, taking advantage of the strong G-band feature. Combining all observations yielded a high signal-to-noise spectrum, which has been used to refine our understanding of the stellar chemical composition. Additionally, a co-added UVES spectrum in the blue was used to complement the wavelength coverage of ESPRESSO. Observations of HE 0107-5240 over a span of more than four years have yielded a revised orbital period of about 29 years. Updated elemental abundances have been determined for Sc, Cr, Co, and, tentatively, Al, along with a new upper limit for Be. The iron abundance has been derived from ionised Fe lines. Significant upper limits have been established for Li, Si, and Sr. The star is confirmed to be a long-period binary. Iron abundances derived from neutral and ionised lines are consistent with local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) assumption, casting doubt on published deviation from LTE corrections for Fe for this star. The heavy elements Sr and Ba remain undetected, confirming the classification of HE 0107-5240 as a carbon enhanced metal-poor and non enhanced in heavy elements (CEMP-no) star and supporting the absence of an n-capture element plateau at the lowest metallicities.</description>

      <title>Multi-band Photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the dwarf novae IU Leo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IU Leo was first identified as a cataclysmic variable star in 2006. Based on an image data and a distance value, we derived that the circumbinary envelope of IU Leo was $\sim$3,745\,AU on the optical band. According the multi-band photometric data, we calculated a $T_{eff}$ of a few hundred Kelvin for the circumbinary envelope of IU Leo. We reviewed the physical parameters of IU Leo and simulated the evolution process using a stellar evolution code MESA with $M_{1}$=0.982\,$M_{\bigodot}$, $M_{2}$=0.835\,$M_{\bigodot}$, and an orbital period of 0.376308\,days. The evolved other parameters are basically consistent with the parameters in the literatures. Based on the quiescence Kepler Mission 2.0 light curve, the quiescence Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite light curve, and 89 Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope medium resolution spectra, we derived an orbital period of 0.376307 $\pm$ 0.000004\,days, 0.3762 $\pm$ 0.0001\,days, and 0.3763\,days for IU Leo respectively. These orbital periods are basically consistent with the results of previous studies. According to light curve of IU Leo from American Association of Variable Star Observers, we reported three new outburst spectra from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope low resolution catalogue with part Balmer emission lines overlap on their absorption lines. Many H, He, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Si, and Ca neutral and ionized lines are identified, which are produced by different mechanisms. In the future, we will conduct more comprehensive and in-depth research on CVs based on multi-band photometric and spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>Improved thermonuclear rate of $^{42}$Ti($p$,$\gamma$)$^{43}$V and its astrophysical implication in rp-process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate $^{42}$Ti($p$,$\gamma$)$^{43}$V reaction rates are crucial for understanding the nucleosynthesis path of the rapid capture process (rp-process) that occurs in X-ray bursts. We aim to improve the thermonuclear rates of $^{42}$Ti($p$,$\gamma$)$^{43}$V based on more complete resonance information and accurate direct component, together with the recently released nuclear masses data. We reevaluated the $^{42}$Ti($p$,$\gamma$)$^{43}$V rate by the sum of the isolated resonance contribution instead of the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model. A Monte Carlo method is used to derive the uncertainties of new rates. The nucleosynthesis simulations are performed via the NuGrid post-processing code ppn. The new rates differ from previous estimations because of using a series of updated resonance parameters and direct S-factor. Compared with the previous results from Hauser-Feshbach statistical model, which assumes compound nucleus $^{43}$V with a sufficiently high-level density in the energy region of astrophysical interest, differences exist over the entire temperature region of rp-process interest, even up to 4 orders of magnitude. Using a trajectory with a peak temperature of 1.95$\times$10$^9$ K, we perform the rp-process nucleosynthesis simulations to investigate the impact of the new rates. Our calculations show that the adoption of the new forward and reverse rates result in abundance variations for Sc and Ca by 128\% and 49\% respectively compared to the case using statistical model rates. On the other hand, the overall abundance pattern is not significantly affected. The results of using new rates also confirm that the rp-process path does not bypass the isotope $^{43}$V. It is found that the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model is inappropriate to the reaction rate evaluation for $^{42}$Ti($p$,$\gamma$)$^{43}$V.</description>

      <title>Nonthermal electron acceleration in turbulent post-flare coronal loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of nonthermal electrons during solar flares plays a critical role in energy transport from the corona to the chromosphere, producing regions of observed intense X-ray emission. Turbulence in post-flare loops, particularly from Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI), has been suggested and investigated as a mechanism for trapping and accelerating electrons in such scenarios. Starting from past results, we aim to characterize the energization process of electrons trapped in a turbulent post-flare looptop, quantifying the contributions of different acceleration mechanisms, and establishing a coherent numerical framework for describing particle energetics. We perform test-particle simulations with the guiding-centre approximation on top of a 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic model of a time-evolving post-flare coronal looptop. We implement an improved formulation of the guiding-centre equations that explicitly conserves energy, enabling a consistent analysis of electron acceleration in the turbulent plasma. We find that, in the plasma turbulence inside the looptop, electrons develop suprathermal energy distributions with tails compatible with hard X-ray emission. The dominant energization channel arises from perpendicular gradient effects in the form of second-order Fermi-like stochastic acceleration, while curvature effects are dominant for particles on long trajectories. Statistical correlations with the measured particle pitch angle confirm that the strongest acceleration occurs for electrons trapped in bouncing motions within turbulent magnetic structures. Our results provide an understanding of how KHI-induced turbulence in coronal looptops produces and sustains populations of trapped nonthermal electrons. We dissect and clarify the relative roles of different magnetic effects and the emergence of stochastic Fermi-like energization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Commission Femmes et Astronomie of the French Astronomical Society, has conducted a statistical study aimed at mapping the current presence of women in French professional astronomy and establishing a baseline for tracking its evolution over time. This study follows an initial survey carried out in 2021, which covered eight astronomy and astrophysics institutes (1,060 employees). This year, the scope was expanded to 11 institutes, bringing together a total of 1,525 employees, including PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, academics, as well as technical and administrative staff, representing about 57% of the whole French community. We examined how the proportion of women varies according to career stage, level of responsibility, job security, and income. The results are compared to the 2021-2022 survey and appear to illustrate the well-known "leaky pipeline", with one of the main bottlenecks being access to permanent positions. The study shows that the proportion of women consistently declines with increasing job security, career seniority, qualification level, and salary.</description>

      <title>Exogeological inferences from white dwarf pollutants: the impact of stellar physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many white dwarfs have accreted material from their own planetary systems. These objects can be used to infer the composition of exoplanetary material and identify evidence for key geological processes. However, the white dwarf atmospheric physics distorts the inferred material composition away from the true composition, mainly through differential atomic diffusion of the accreted metals. Correcting for this effect is essential, but is dependent on various physical assumptions associated with the white dwarf itself. We first focus on the effect of assumptions related to convective overshoot and thermohaline mixing on the atomic diffusion timescales. For white dwarfs with H-dominated atmospheres between 12000 K and 18000 K, we find that including a complete treatment of convective overshoot decreases the inferred Fe and O abundances in accreted material. For these white dwarfs, we also find that including thermohaline mixing decreases Fe and O abundances. For He-dominated systems, the effect of convective overshoot is comparatively minor. We then explore the overall effect of other physical assumptions by comparing publicly available grids of diffusion timescales. We find that the choice of model grid can have a large impact for white dwarfs with He-dominated atmospheres, notably on the inferred core to mantle ratio of accreted material. We identify several systems for which the geological interpretation is robust against these systematics. We also present a `discrepancy metric' which can be used to estimate the potential impact of changing the stellar physics without requiring detailed modelling.</description>

      <title>Piling up in the darkness: Features of the BBH mass distribution from isolated binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the third LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing run, the number of detected binary black hole (BBH) mergers became sufficient to identify statistical features of the population. We explore how different prescriptions for the final fate of massive stars and key binary-evolution processes shape isolated binaries and their remnants. Using \textsc{sevn}, we evolved $10^{7}$ binaries across 15 metallicities, 3 core-collapse supernova models, 4 PPISN models, and 6 common-envelope (CE) prescriptions, for a total of 990 runs ($9.9 \times 10^{9}$ systems). Both single- and binary-star physics shape the BH mass distribution: single-star processes control the high-mass tail ($M_{\rm BH} \geq 45M_{\odot}$), while binary evolution produces pile-ups in specific intervals. In particular, the bump at $\sim 35 M_{\odot}$, often attributed to PPISNe, also emerges from binaries evolving only through stable mass transfer, without CE. Finally, we test a top-heavy IMF, finding it boosts merger numbers and alters the abundance of systems with a given primary BH mass.</description>

      <title>Solar Reflected Dark Matter under the Influence of Dark Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scattering of dark matter particles within the Sun's hot plasma can lead to acceleration of dark matter, producing a high-energy solar-reflected DM flux detectable in ground-based experiments. In the vector portal model, interactions between dark matter and Standard Model particles are mediated by a hidden vector field--referred to as ``dark photon"--which kinetically mixes with the conventional photon through a small mixing angle. Furthermore, the solar plasma generates intense magnetic fields. Due to the photon-dark photon mixing, this simultaneously sources a ``dark magnetic field". For sufficiently low dark photon masses, this dark magnetic field is capable of deflecting dark matter particles traversing the Sun. We found that if the dark magnetic force is sufficiently strong, the dark magnetic field becomes a wall, preventing the dark matter particles from reaching the deep core region, suppressing their reflected flux. This scenario correct the sensitivity of solar-reflected dark matter detection, offering critical insights for ground-based experiments aiming to probe dark matter.</description>

      <title>Close-in faint companions mimicking interferometric hot exozodiacal dust observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Interferometric observations of various nearby main-sequence stars show an unexpected infrared excess, raising the question of its origin. The two dominant interpretations favor hot exozodiacal dust or a faint companion, as both can produce similar signatures. Method: We modeled a system consisting of a star and a faint companion within a field of view of 2au x 2au. We calculated the visibility and closure phases for three VLTI instruments (PIONIER, GRAVITY, and MATISSE) and four telescope configurations. Aim: We aim to investigate the interferometric signatures of faint companions and assess their detectability. We explore limitations of current detection methods and evaluate the challenges in distinguishing between hot exozodiacal dust and a faint companion as the source of the observed excess. Results: We derived an upper limit for the companion-induced visibility deficit and closure phase. Contrary to the common interpretation that near-zero closure phases rule out the presence of a companion, we show that companions can remain undetected in closure phase data, as indicated by significant non-detection probabilities, yet, these companions can still produce measurable visibility deficits. We confirmed our results by reevaluating an L-band observation of kappa Tuc A. We found indications for a faint companion with a flux ratio of 0.7% and an estimated non-detection probability of around 21%, which could explain the variability of the previously observed visibility deficit. Conclusions: Previous companion rejection criteria, such as near-zero closure phases and flux estimates based on Gaussian-distributed dust densities, are not universally valid. This highlights the need for a reevaluation of companion rejections in former studies of the hot exozodiacal dust phenomenon. In addition, we propose a method for distinguishing both sources of visibility deficit.</description>

      <title>Non-linear evolution of the horizontal shear instability in stratified rotating fluids under the complete Coriolis acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the non-linear dynamics of horizontal shear instability in an incompressible, stratified and rotating fluid in the non-traditional $f$-plane, i.e. with the full Coriolis acceleration, using direct numerical simulations. The study is restricted to two-dimensional horizontal perturbations. It is therefore independent of the vertical (traditional) Coriolis parameter. However, the flow has three velocity components due to the horizontal (non-traditional) Coriolis parameter. Three different scenarios of non-linear evolution of the shear instability are identified, depending on the non-dimensional Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency $N$ and the non-dimensional non-traditional Coriolis parameter $\tilde{f}$ (non-dimensionalized by the maximum shear), in the range $\tilde{f}&lt;N$ for fixed Reynolds and Schmidt numbers $Re=2000$, $Sc=1$. When the stratification is strong $N\gg 1$, the shear instability generates stable Kelvin-Helmholtz billows like in the traditional limit $\tilde{f}=0$. Furthermore, when $N\gg1$, the governing equations for any $\tilde{f}$ can be transformed into those for $\tilde{f}=0$. This enables us to directly predict the characteristics of the flow depending on $\tilde{f}$ and $N$. When $N$ is around unity and $\tilde{f}$ is above a threshold, the primary Kelvin-Helmholtz vortex is destabilised by secondary instabilities but it remains coherent. For weaker stratification, $N\leqslant0.5$ and $\tilde{f}$ large enough, secondary instabilities develop vigorously and destroy the primary vortex into small-scales turbulence. Concomitantly, the enstrophy rises to high values by stretching/tilting as in fully three-dimensional flows. A local analysis of the flow prior to the onset of secondary instabilities reveals that the Fjortoft necessary condition for instability is satisfied, suggesting that they correspond to shear instabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have analyzed phase-resolved photometric and spectroscopic observations of the eclipsing polar SDSS J002637.06+242915.6. The light curve has a M-shaped bright phase that was reproduced using a simple model of an accreting magnetic white dwarf. The hydrogen emission lines exhibit a narrow component formed on the irradiated hemispere of the donor. The Doppler tomography revealed differences in the positions of emission regions of hydrogen and HeII $\lambda$4686 lines. The spectra exhibit a Zeeman absorption triplet of the H$\alpha$ line, formed in the cold halo around the accretion spot at a magnetic field strength of $B = 15.1 \pm 1.3$ MG. The spectra of the bright phase have a red cyclotron continuum, whose orbital variability has been interpreted within a simple model of an accretion spot. The modeling of the cyclotron continuum constrains the white dwarf's magnetic field to $B_{cyc} \lesssim 45$ MG. The analysis of the eclipse light curve and the radial velocities of the irradiated hemisphere yielded estimates for the orbital inclination $77.2^\circ \le i \le 80.6^\circ$, the mass ratio $0.23 \le q \le 0.43$, and the white dwarf mass $0.72 \ge M_1/M_\odot \ge 0.42$.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Chemical Analysis of the Red Giant Orbiting the Black Hole $Gaia$ BH3: From Lithium to Thorium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preliminary astrometric data from the fourth data release of the $Gaia$ mission revealed a 33 M$_{\odot}$ dark companion to a metal-poor red giant star, deemed $Gaia$ BH3. This system hosts both the most massive known stellar-origin black hole and the lowest-metallicity star yet discovered in orbit around a black hole. The formation pathway for this peculiar stellar-black hole binary system has yet to be determined, with possible production mechanisms that include isolated binary evolution and dynamical capture. The chemical composition of the stellar companion in $Gaia$ BH3 (hereafter \bhstar) can help constrain the potential formation mechanisms of this system. Here, we conduct the most comprehensive chemical analysis of \bhstar\ to date using high resolution spectra obtained by the Tull Coud\'e Spectrograph on the 2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory to constrain potential formation mechanisms. We derived 29 elemental abundances ranging from lithium to thorium and find that \bhstar\ is an $\alpha$-enriched ([$\alpha$/Fe] = 0.41), r-I neutron-capture star ([Eu/Fe] = 0.57). We conclude that \bhstar\ shows no chemical peculiarities (defined as deviations from the expected chemical pattern of an r-I halo red giant) in any elements, which is in alignment with both the dynamical capture and isolated binary evolution formation scenarios. With an upper limit detection on Th, we use the Th/Eu chronometer to place limits on the cosmochronometric age of this system. These observations lay the groundwork for heavy-element chemical analysis for subsequent black hole and low-metallicity stellar binaries that will likely be found in $Gaia$ DR4.</description>

      <title>Ever Elusive Exospheres: One Probable Detection and Two Non-Detections of H{\alpha} Transits in Young Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaps in the exoplanet population, such as the Neptunian Desert, point to the importance of mass-loss in sculpting the radii of close-in exoplanets. Young planets ($&lt;$500Myr) offer the opportunity to detect such mass-loss while it is still strong, and to test models of the underlying physical processes. We search for evidence of an H$\alpha$ transit in high-resolution spectra of three young planets, HD 63433b (400 Myr), DS TucAb (45 Myr), and HIP 67522b (17 Myr) using HARPS-N, Magellan-PFS, and CHIRON respectively. We validate our method by testing it on several photospheric lines less impacted by stellar variability. We find no evidence of a transit signal for HD 63433b and DS Tuc A b (3$\sigma$ limits of 0.9% and 0.3%, respectively). For HIP 67522b, we detect significant excess absorption (3.44$\pm$0.28%) aligned with the transit time, narrow compared to the stellar line, and blueshifted from the stellar rest frame. In combination, these suggest the signal is from the planet. However, stellar variation in the H$\alpha$ line over the course of the observations is comparable in size to the transit signature and the duration is shorter than the photometric transit, so this detection requires confirmation. Our findings, and other recent results in the literature, suggest that planets younger than 50 Myr are more favorable for the detection of atmospheric escape with H$\alpha$ observations, though older populations might still show escape in other diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Constraining intrinsic S-type AGB masses and third dredge-up using pulsation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lowest mass at which the third dredge-up (TDU) occurs for thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars remains a key uncertainty in detailed stellar models. S-type AGB stars are an important constraint on this uncertainty as they have C/O ratios between 0.5 and 1, meaning they have only experienced up to a few episodes of TDU. AGB stars are also long-period variable stars, pulsating in low order radial pulsation modes. In this paper we estimate the initial masses of a large literature sample of intrinsic S-type AGB stars, by analysing their visual light curves, estimating their luminosities with Gaia DR3 parallax distances and finally comparing to a grid of detailed stellar models combined with linear pulsation models. We find that the initial mass distribution of intrinsic S-type stars peaks at 1.3 to 1.4 \Msun, depending on model assumptions. There also appear to be stars with initial masses down to 1 solar mass, which is in conflict with current detailed stellar models. Additionally, we find that though the mass estimates for semiregular variable stars pulsating in higher order radial modes are precise, the Mira variables pulsating in the fundamental mode present challenges observationally from uncertain parallax distances, and theoretically from the onset of increased mass-loss and the necessity of non-linear pulsation models.</description>

Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec observations of SN~2024ggi, spanning wavelengths of 1.7--5.5 micron at +285.51 and +385.27 days post-explosion. These nebular spectra are dominated by asymmetric emission lines from atomic species including H, Ca, Ar, C, Mg, Ni, Co, and Fe, indicative of an aspherical explosion. The other strong features are molecular CO vibrational bands from the fundamental and first overtone. We introduce a novel, data-driven approach using non-LTE 3D radiative transfer simulations to model the CO emission with high fidelity. This method enables us to constrain the three-dimensional CO distribution and its radial temperature structure. CO formation is found to occur prior to day +285, with subsequent evolution characterized by progressive evaporation. The CO mass decreases from approximately 8.7 to 1.3*E-3 Mo, while the average temperature drops from about 2900 K to 2500 K. Concurrently, the CO distribution transitions from nearly homogeneous to highly clumped (density contrast increasing from fc=1.2 to 2). The minimum velocity of the CO-emitting region remains nearly constant (v1 = 1200 to 1100 km/s), significantly above the receding photosphere velocity (v(ph) = 500 km/s), suggesting the photosphere resides within Si-rich layers. However, the temperature profile indicates that only a narrow zone reaches the conditions necessary for SiO formation. Due to a lack of observational constraints, SiO clumping is not modeled, and thus, synthetic SiO profiles for mass estimates are not highlighted. We discuss the implications of these findings for dust formation processes in SN~2024ggi.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Tidal Heating on the Habitability of Planets Orbiting White Dwarfs</title>

Abstract: In recent years, there have been a growing number of observations indicating the presence of rocky material in short-period orbits around white dwarfs. In this Letter, we revisit the prospects for habitability around these post-main-sequence star systems. In addition to the typically considered radiative input luminosity, potentially habitable planets around white dwarfs are also subjected to significant tidal heating. The combination of these two heating sources can, for a narrow range of planetary properties and orbital parameters, continuously maintain surface temperatures amenable for habitability for planets around white dwarfs over time scales up to 10 Gyr. We show that for a specific locus of orbital parameter space, tidal heating can substantially extend the timescale of continuous habitability for a planet around a white dwarf.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Oceans on First-Generation Planets Orbiting White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several groups have recently suggested that small planets orbiting very closely around white dwarf stars could be promising locations for life to arise, even after stellar death. There are still many uncertainties, however, regarding the existence and habitability of these worlds. Here, we consider the retention of water during post-main-sequence evolution of a Sun-like star, and during the subsequent migration of planets to the white dwarf's habitable zone. This inward migration is driven by dynamical mechanisms such as planet-planet interactions in packed systems, which can excite planets to high eccentricities, setting the initial conditions for tidal migration into short-period orbits. In order for water to persist on the surfaces of planets orbiting white dwarfs, the water must first survive the AGB phase of stellar evolution, then avoid being lost due to photoevaporation due to X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation from the newly-formed white dwarf, and then finally survive the tidal migration of the planet inwards to the habitable zone. We find that while this journey will likely desiccate large swaths of post-main-sequence planetary systems, planets with substantial reservoirs of water may retain some surface water, especially if their migration occurs at later white dwarf cooling ages. Therefore, although stellar evolution may pose a challenge for the retention of water on exoplanet surfaces, it is possible for planets to retain surface oceans even as their host stars die and their orbits evolve.</description>

      <title>Physics motivated models of pulsar X-ray hotspots: off-center dipole configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was proposed that an off-center dipole magnetic configuration, together with a non-trivial temperature profile, may be the best model to explain the X-ray light curve of PSR J0030+0451 observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (\emph{NICER}). Using a theoretical model for the electric current density in a force-free pulsar magnetosphere, we compute from first principles the distribution of electric current over the polar cap associated with an off-center magnetic dipole. We then use a simple prescription to compute the resulting temperature distribution, which allows us to derive the observed X-ray light curve. We investigate the role of the volumetric return current region in the polar cap and find that although it does not make a big difference in an aligned dipole case, the difference can be bigger in the case of an off-center dipole. Finally, we apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting to the X-ray light curves of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0437--4715 with and without the volumetric return current, and find that our model can reasonably recover the observed X-ray light curves.</description>
