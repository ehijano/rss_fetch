      <title>Advancing Geological Carbon Storage Monitoring With 3d Digital Shadow Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geological Carbon Storage (GCS) is a key technology for achieving global climate goals by capturing and storing CO2 in deep geological formations. Its effectiveness and safety rely on accurate monitoring of subsurface CO2 migration using advanced time-lapse seismic imaging. A Digital Shadow framework integrates field data, including seismic and borehole measurements, to track CO2 saturation over time. Machine learning-assisted data assimilation techniques, such as generative AI and nonlinear ensemble Bayesian filtering, update a digital model of the CO2 plume while incorporating uncertainties in reservoir properties. Compared to 2D approaches, 3D monitoring enhances the spatial accuracy of GCS assessments, capturing the full extent of CO2 migration. This study extends the uncertainty-aware 2D Digital Shadow framework by incorporating 3D seismic imaging and reservoir modeling, improving decision-making and risk mitigation in CO2 storage projects.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Robustness Of Digital Shadow For CO2 Storage Monitoring With Augmented Rock Physics Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet climate targets, the IPCC underscores the necessity of technologies capable of removing gigatonnes of CO2 annually, with Geological Carbon Storage (GCS) playing a central role. GCS involves capturing CO2 and injecting it into deep geological formations for long-term storage, requiring precise monitoring to ensure containment and prevent leakage. Time-lapse seismic imaging is essential for tracking CO2 migration but often struggles to capture the complexities of multi-phase subsurface flow. Digital Shadows (DS), leveraging machine learning-driven data assimilation techniques such as nonlinear Bayesian filtering and generative AI, provide a more detailed, uncertainty-aware monitoring approach. By incorporating uncertainties in reservoir properties, DS frameworks improve CO2 migration forecasts, reducing risks in GCS operations. However, data assimilation depends on assumptions regarding reservoir properties, rock physics models, and initial conditions, which, if inaccurate, can compromise prediction reliability. This study demonstrates that augmenting forecast ensembles with diverse rock physics models mitigates the impact of incorrect assumptions and improves predictive accuracy, particularly in differentiating uniform versus patchy saturation models.</description>

      <title>QuantumDNA: A Python Package for Analyzing Quantum Charge Dynamics in DNA and Exploring Its Biological Relevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of DNA charge dynamics is a highly interdisciplinary field that bridges physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine, and plays a critical role in processes such as DNA damage detection, protein-DNA interactions, and DNA-based nanotechnology. However, despite significant advances in each of these areas, knowledge often remains inaccessible to other scientific communities, limiting the broader impact of advances across disciplines. To bridge this gap, we present QuantumDNA, an open-source Python package for simulating DNA charge transfer (CT) and excited states using quantum-physical methods. QuantumDNA combines an efficient Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) approach with tight-binding (TB) models, incorporating open quantum systems techniques to account for environmental effects. This approach allows rapid yet accurate analysis of large DNA ensembles, enabling statistical studies of genetic and epigenetic phenomena. To ensure accessibility, the package features a graphical user interface (GUI), making it suitable for researchers across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Computing Quantum Resources using Tensor Cross Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information quantifiers are indispensable tools for analyzing strongly correlated systems. Consequently, developing efficient and robust numerical methods for their computation is crucial. We propose a general procedure based on the family of Tensor Cross Interpolation (TCI) algorithms to address this challenge in a fully general framework, independent of the system or the quantifier under consideration. To substantiate our approach, we compute the non-stabilizerness R\'{e}nyi entropy (SRE) and Relative Entropy of Coherence (REC) considering the 1D and 2D ferromagnetic Ising models with minimal modifications to the numerical procedure. This method not only demonstrates its versatility, but also provides a generic framework for exploring other quantum information quantifiers in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Berends-Giele recursion for gluons in arbitrary dimensions over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides a proof of concept for the computation of pure gluonic amplitudes in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) on graphics processing units (GPUs). The implementation relies on the Berends-Giele recursion algorithm and, for the first time on a GPU, enables the numerical computation of amplitudes in an arbitrary number of space-time dimensions and over finite fields. This demonstrates the advantages of hardware acceleration, not only for the computation of tree-level amplitudes for real-radiation processes in four dimensions over complex numbers but also for generating loop integrands for virtual corrections in $d$ dimensions over finite fields. The associated computer program is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary dynamical mean-field approach for Anderson-Hubbard model with off-diagonal disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work reports a theoretical framework that combines the auxiliary coherent potential approximation (ACPA-DMFT) with dynamical mean-field theory to study strongly correlated and disordered electronic systems with both diagonal and off-diagonal disorders. In this method, by introducing an auxiliary coupling space with extended local degree of freedom,the diagonal and off-diagonal disorders are treated in a unified and self-consistent framework of coherent potential approximation, within which the dynamical mean-field theory is naturally combined to handle the strongly correlated Anderson-Hubbard model. By using this approach, we compute matsubara Green's functions for a simple cubic lattice at finite temperatures and derive impurity spectral functions through the maximum entropy method. Our results reveal the critical influence of off-diagonal disorder on Mott-type metal-insulator transitions. Specifically, a reentrant phenomenon is identified, where the system transitions between insulating and metallic states under varying interaction strengths. The ACPA-DMFT method provides an efficient and robust computational method for exploring the intricate interplay of disorder and strong correlations.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Secondary and Backscattered Electron Energy Spectra and Yields Analysis: from Theory to Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07521v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, experimental microscopy and spectroscopy have made significant progress in the study of the morphological, optical, electronic and transport properties of materials. These developments include higher spatial resolution, shorter acquisition times, more efficient monochromators and electron analysers, improved contrast imaging and advancements in sample preparation techniques. These advances have driven the need for more accurate theoretical descriptions and predictions of material properties. Computer simulations based on first principles and Monte Carlo methods have emerged as a rapidly growing field for modeling the interaction of charged particles, such as electron, proton and ion beams, with various systems, such as slabs, nanostructures and crystals. This report delves into the theoretical and computational approaches to modeling the physico-chemical mechanisms that occur when charged beams interact with a medium. These mechanisms encompass single and collective electronic excitation, ionization of the target atoms and the generation of a secondary electron cascade that deposits energy into the irradiated material. We show that the combined application of ab initio methods, which are able to model the dynamics of interacting many-fermion systems, and Monte Carlo methods, which capture statistical fluctuations in energy loss mechanisms by random sampling, proves to be an optimal strategy for the accurate description of charge transport in solids. This joint quantitative approach enables the theoretical interpretation of excitation, loss and secondary electron spectra, the analysis of the chemical composition and dielectric properties of solids and contributes to our understanding of irradiation-induced damage in materials, including those of biological significance.</description>

      <title>ADEPT: A Noninvasive Method for Determining Elastic Parameters of Valve Tissue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computer simulation of "virtual interventions" may inform optimal valve repair for a given patient prior to intervention. However, the paucity of noninvasive methods to determine in vivo mechanical parameters of valves limits the accuracy of computer prediction and their clinical application. To address this, we propose ADEPT: A noninvasive method for Determining Elastic Parameters of valve Tissue. In this work, we demonstrated its application to the tricuspid valve of a child. We first tracked valve displacements from open to closed frames within a 3D echocardiogram time sequence using image registration. Physics-informed neural networks were subsequently applied to estimate the nonlinear mechanical properties from first principles and reference displacements. The simulated model using these patient-specific parameters closely aligned with the reference image segmentation, achieving a mean symmetric distance of less than 1 mm. Our approach doubled the accuracy of the simulated model compared to the generic parameters reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Fluid flow inside slit-shaped nanopores: the role of surface morphology at the molecular scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of fluid flow have highlighted the peculiarities of nanoscale flows compared to classical fluid mechanics; in particular, boundary conditions can deviate from the no-slip behavior at macroscopic scales. For fluid flow in slit-shaped nanopores, we demonstrate that surface morphology provides an efficient control on the slip length, which approaches zero when matching the molecular structures of the pore wall and the fluid. Using boundary-driven, energy-conserving NEMD simulations with a pump-like driving mechanism, we examine two types of pore walls--mimicking a crystalline and an amorphous material--that exhibit markedly different surface resistances to flow. The resulting flow velocity profiles are consistent with Poiseuille theory for incompressible, Newtonian fluids when adjusted for surface slip. For the two pores, we observe partial slip and no-slip behavior, respectively. The hydrodynamic permeability corroborates that the simulated flows are in the Darcy regime. However, the confinement of the fluid gives rise to an effective viscosity below its bulk value; wide pores exhibit a crossover between boundary and bulk-like flows. Additionally, the thermal isolation of the flow causes a linear increase in fluid temperature along the flow, which we relate to strong viscous dissipation and heat convection, utilizing conservation laws of fluid mechanics. Noting that the investigated fluid model does not form droplets, our findings challenge the universality of previously reported correlations between slippage, solvophobicity, and a depletion zone. Furthermore, they underscore the need for molecular-scale modeling to accurately capture the fluid dynamics near boundaries and in nanoporous materials, where macroscopic models may not be applicable.</description>

      <title>Density of States Calculation of CeO$_2$ Based on VASP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, the Density of States (DOS) of CeO$_2$ was analyzed in detail using the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method based on VASP software. As an important functional material, CeO$_2$ finds wide applications in catalysis, optics, and electronic devices. Through structural optimization, self-consistent electronic calculations, and non-self-consistent calculations, we thoroughly investigated the crystal structure and electronic energy level distribution of CeO$_2$. The lattice parameter optimization results from the structural calculations indicated a stable crystal structure for CeO$_2$. Self-consistent electronic calculations revealed a bandgap of approximately 2.403 eV, with the valence band maximum primarily contributed by O 2p orbitals and the conduction band minimum mainly originating from Ce 4f orbitals. Non-self-consistent calculations further demonstrated the total DOS and partial DOS of CeO$_2$, confirming the significant roles of Ce 4f and O 2p states in its electronic conduction and optical properties. These results not only provide theoretical support for the applications of CeO$_2$ in catalysis and electronic materials but also deepen our understanding of its fundamental electronic structural characteristics, offering guidance for the design and development of novel CeO$_2$-based materials.</description>

      <title>A projection method for particle resampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13681v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle discretizations of partial differential equations are advantageous for high-dimensional kinetic models in phase space due to their better scalability than continuum approaches with respect to dimension. Complex processes collectively referred to as \textit{particle noise} hamper long-time simulations with particle methods. One approach to address this problem is particle mesh adaptivity or remapping, known as \textit{particle resampling}. This paper introduces a resampling method that projects particles to and from a (finite element) function space. The method is simple; using standard sparse linear algebra and finite element techniques, it can adapt to almost any set of new particle locations and preserves all moments up to the order of polynomial represented exactly by the continuum function space.
  This work is motivated by the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau model of magnetized plasmas with up to six dimensions, $3X$ in physical space and $3V$ in velocity space, and is developed in the context of a $1X$ + $1V$ Vlasov-Poisson model of Landau damping with logically regular particle and continuum phase space grids. The evaluation codes are publicly available, along with the data and reproducibility artifacts, and developed in the PETSc numerical library (petsc.org).</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for the Analysis of Traced Particles in Kinetic Plasma Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray acceleration processes in astrophysical plasmas are often investigated with fully-kinetic or hybrid kinetic numerical simulations, which enable us to describe a detailed microphysics of particle energization mechanisms. Tracing of individual particles in such simulations is especially useful in this regard. However, visually inspecting particle trajectories introduces a significant amount of bias and uncertainty, making it challenging to pinpoint specific acceleration mechanisms. Here, we present a novel approach utilising neural networks to assist in the analysis of individual particle data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using the dataset from our recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of non-relativistic perpendicular shocks that consists of 252,000 electrons, each characterised by their position, momentum and electromagnetic field at particle's position, recorded in a time series of 1200 time steps. These electrons cross a region affected by the electrostatic Buneman instability, and a small percentage of them attain high energies. We perform classification, regression, and anomaly detection algorithms on the dataset by using a convolutional neural network, a multi-layer perceptron, and an autoencoder. Despite the noisy and imbalanced dataset, all methods demonstrate the capability to differentiate between thermal and accelerated electrons with remarkable accuracy. The proposed methodology may considerably simplify particle classification in large-scale PIC and hybrid simulations.</description>
