      <title>A dichotomy for the Hofer growth of area preserving maps on the sphere via symmetrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that autonomous Hamiltonian flows on the two-sphere exhibit the following dichotomy: the Hofer norm either grows linearly or is bounded in time by a universal constant C. Our approach involves a new technique, Hamiltonian symmetrization. Essentially, we prove that every autonomous Hamiltonian diffeomorphism is conjugate to an element C-close in the Hofer metric to one generated by a function of the height.</description>

      <title>On the Algebra of the Infrared with Twisted Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Algebra of the Infrared \cite{Gaiotto:2015aoa} is a framework to construct local observables, interfaces, and categories of supersymmetric boundary conditions of massive $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ theories in two dimensions by using information only about the BPS sector. The resulting framework is known as the ``web-based formalism.'' In this paper we initiate the generalization of the web-based formalism to include a much wider class of $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ quantum field theories than was discussed in \cite{Gaiotto:2015aoa}: theories with non-trivial twisted masses. The essential new ingredient is the presence of BPS particles within a fixed vacuum sector. In this paper we work out the web-based formalism for the simplest class of theories that allow for such BPS particles: theories with a single vacuum and a single twisted mass. We show that even in this simple setting there are interesting new phenomenon including the emergence of Fock spaces of closed solitons and a natural appearance of Koszul dual algebras. Mathematically, studying theories with twisted masses includes studying the Fukaya-Seidel category of A-type boundary conditions for Landau-Ginzburg models defined by a closed holomorphic one-form. This paper sketches a web-based construction for the category of A-type boundary conditions for one-forms with a single Morse zero and a single non-trivial period. We demonstrate our formalism explicitly in a particularly instructive example.</description>
