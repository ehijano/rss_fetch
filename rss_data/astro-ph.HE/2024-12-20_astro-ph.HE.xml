      <title>uGMRT observation of the unidentified PeVatron candidate LHAASO J2108+5157</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) detected Ultra High Energy (UHE) photons in the range 100 TeV to 1.4 PeV from twelve sources including Crab nebula. The detection of these photons demands the presence of at least PeV energy particle in the source. It is important to understand particle acceleration and radiation emission processes in such source. One of those twelve sources, LHAASO J2108+5157 does not show any association or counterparts at any other wavelength. In search of counterpart, we surveyed the region with Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 650 MHz frequency. GMRT observation revel radio emission from an extended source within the PSF of LHAASO which shows disk-jet morphology. Considering the spatial association and extent of the source, it is plausible that particle acceleration to PeV energies originates from this source.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Properties of the low-mass host galaxies of Type Ia supernovae in a volume-limited sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the characteristics of `low-mass' ($\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \leq 8$) and `intermediate-mass' ($8 \lt \log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \leq 10$) host galaxies of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the second data release (DR2) of the Zwicky Transient Facility survey and investigate their correlations with different sub-types of SNe Ia. We use the photospheric velocities measured from the Si II $\lambda$6355 feature, SALT2 light-curve stretch ($x_1$) and host-galaxy properties of SNe Ia to re-investigate the existing relationship between host galaxy mass and Si II $\lambda$6355 velocities. We also investigate sub-type preferences for host populations and show that while the more energetic and brighter 91T-like SNe Ia tends to populate the younger host populations, 91bg-like SNe Ia populate in the older populations. Our findings suggest High Velocity SNe Ia (HV SNe Ia) not only comes from the older populations but they also come from young populations as well. Therefore, while our findings can partially provide support for HV SNe Ia relating to single degenerate progenitor models, they indicate that HV SNe Ia other than being a different population, might be a continued distribution with different explosion mechanisms. We lastly investigate the specific rate of SNe Ia in the volume-limited SN Ia sample of DR2 and compare with other surveys.</description>

      <title>LOFAR non-detections of SN 2023ixf in its first year post-explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used the LOFAR telescope to monitor SN 2023ixf, a core-collapse supernova in M101, between 8 and 368 days post-explosion. We report non-detections down to ~80 {\mu}Jy sensitivity at 144 MHz. Our non-detections are consistent with published radio observations at higher frequencies. At the time, we are not able to constrain the properties of low-frequency absorption due to the progenitor star's circumstellar medium via these LOFAR observations.</description>

      <title>Lightest to Heavy UHECR nuclei in a Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UHECR are evaluated in the frame role of different nuclei composition . Most of the past and present models are considering proton or iron as their main courier. Some attention has been paid to the role of the UHECR light nuclei in recent years. We update here the lightest nuclei UHECR model, able to explain the nearest AGN or Star Burst sources with the few observed Hot Spot clustering in AUGER and TA array data. Any additional components of the heaviest nuclei with the highest energy, more bent and smeared, may also fit recent AUGER and TA homogeneous records at those energy edges.</description>

      <title>The Immediate, eXemplary, and Fleeting echelle spectroscopy of SN 2023ixf: Monitoring acceleration of slow progenitor circumstellar material, driven by shock interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high resolution WIYN/NEID echelle spectroscopy (R $\approx70$,000) of the supernova (SN) 2023ixf in M101, obtained 1.51 to 18.51 days after explosion over nine epochs. Daily monitoring for the first four days after explosion shows narrow emission features ($\leq200$ km s$^{-1}$), exhibiting predominantly blueshifted velocities, that rapidly weaken, broaden, and vanish in a manner consistent with radiative acceleration and the SN shock eventually overrunning or enveloping the full extent of dense circumstellar medium (CSM). The most rapid evolution is in the He I emission, which is visible on day 1.51 but disappears by day 2.62. We measure the maximum pre-SN speed of He I to be 25 $^{+0}_{-5} \pm2$ km s$^{-1}$, where the error is attributable to the uncertainty in how much the He I had already been radiatively accelerated, and to measurement of the emission line profile. The radiative acceleration of material is likely driven by the shock-CSM interaction, and the CSM is accelerated to $\geq200$ km s$^{-1}$ before being completely swept up by the SN shock to $\sim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$. We compare the observed spectra with spherically-symmetric r16wb HERACLES/CMFGEN model spectra and find the line evolution to generally be consistent with radiative acceleration and optical depth effects. The progenitor of SN2023ixf underwent an enhanced mass loss phase $\gtrsim 4$ year prior to core-collapse, creating a dense, asymmetric CSM region extending out to approximately $r_{CSM} = 3.7 \times 10^{14}$ ($v_\textrm{shock}$/9500 km s$^{-1}$) cm.</description>

      <title>A new air shower array in the Southern Hemisphere looking for the origins of Cosmic rays: the ALPACA experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tibet AS$\gamma$ experiment successfully detected sub-PeV $\gamma$-rays from the Crab nebula using a Surface Array and underground muon detector. Considering this, we are building in Bolivia a new experiment to explore the Southern Hemisphere, looking for the origins of cosmic rays in our Galaxy. The name of this project is Andes Large area PArticle detector for Cosmic ray physics and Astronomy (ALPACA). A prototype array called ALPAQUITA, with $1/4$ the total area of the full ALPACA, started observations in September $2022$. In this paper we introduce the status of ALPAQUITA and the plans to extend the array. We also report the results of the observation of the moon shadow in cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Near-Infrared Features of Kilonovae: The Importance of Gadolinium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of the kilonova AT2017gfo and investigations of its light curves and spectra confirmed that neutron star mergers are sites of r-process nucleosynthesis. However, the identification of elements responsible for the spectral features is still challenging, particularly at the near-infrared wavelengths. In this study, we systematically searched for all possible near-infrared transitions of heavy elements using experimentally calibrated energy levels. Our analysis reveals that most candidate elements with strong absorption lines are lanthanides (Z=57-71) and actinides (Z=89-103). This is due to their complex structures leading to many low-lying energy levels, which results in strong transitions in the near-infrared range. Domoto et al. (2022) have shown that La III and Ce III can explain the absorption features at $\lambda\sim$ 12,000 - 15,000 A. While our results confirm that these two elements show strong infrared features, we additionally identify Gd III as the next most promising species. Due to its unique atomic structure involving the half-filled 4f and the outer 5d orbitals, Gd III has one of the lowest-lying energy levels, between which relatively strong transitions occur. We also find absorption lines caused by Gd III in the near-infrared spectrum of a chemically peculiar star HR 465, which supports their emergence in kilonova spectra. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we confirm that Gd III lines affect the feature at $\sim$ 12,000 A previously attributed to La III. Future space-based time-series observations of kilonova spectra will allow the identification of Gd III lines.</description>

      <title>Probing Solar Heavy Neutrinos with Heliospheric Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for an excess of electrons and positrons in the interplanetary space from the decays of heavy neutrinos produced in nuclear reactions in the Sun. Using measurements of the electron spectra in the MeV range from the Ulysses and SOHO satellites, we report the strongest direct upper bound to date on the mixing between heavy neutral leptons with MeV masses and electron neutrinos, reaching $U_e^2\simeq 10^{-6}$ at $M_N=10$ MeV. Our sensitivity is predominantly constrained by the uncertainties in the propagation of electrons and positrons, particularly the diffusion coefficient in the inner Solar System, as well as the uncertainties in the astrophysical background. Enhancing our understanding of either of these factors could lead to a significant improvement in sensitivity.</description>

      <title>New Radio Observations of the Supernova Remnant CTA 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new radio images of the supernova remnant (SNR) CTA 1 at 1420 and 408 MHz, and in the 21 cm line of H I observed with the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory Synthesis Telescope and at 1420 MHz observed with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope. We confirm previously described continuum features and elaborate further on filamentary features identified using the high-resolution (1') maps from these new observations. We investigate the abrupt change in sign of rotation measure (RM) across the SNR, using the linear polarization observations in the four bands around 1420 MHz. Following X. H. Sun et al.'s (2011) investigation, we both confirm that the distribution of signs of the RMs for extragalactic sources in the area appears to match that of the shell, as well as combine the data from the four bands to estimate the relative depolarization and the intrinsic rotation measure of the SNR. We do not conclusively reject X. H. Sun et al.'s (2011) claim of a Faraday screen in the foreground causing the distribution of RMs that we observe; however, we do suggest an alternative explanation of a swept-up stellar wind from the progenitor star with a toroidal magnetic field. Finally, we expand on the analysis of the H I observations by applying the Rolling Hough Transform to isolate filamentary structure and better identify H I emission with the SNR. Further constraining the H I velocity channels associated with CTA 1, we use more recent Galactic rotation curves to calculate an updated kinematic distance of 1.09 +/- 0.2 kpc.</description>

      <title>CORSIKA 8 with Pythia 8: Simulating Vertical Proton Showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of air shower physics, dedicated to understanding the development of cosmic-ray interactions with the Earth's atmosphere, faces a significant challenge regarding the muon content of air showers observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory, and numerous other observatories. Thorough comparisons between extensive air shower (EAS) measurements and simulations are imperative for determining the primary energy and mass of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Current simulations employing state-of-the-art hadronic interaction models reveal a muon deficit compared to experimental measurements, commonly known as the "Muon Puzzle". The primary cause of this deficit lies in the uncertainties surrounding high-energy hadronic interactions. In this contribution, we discuss the integration of a new hadronic interaction model, Pythia 8, into the effort to resolve the Muon Puzzle. While the Pythia 8 model is well-tailored in the context of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments, its application in air shower studies remained limited until now. However, recent advancements, particularly in the Angantyr model of Pythia 8, offer promising enhancements in describing hadron-nucleus interactions, thereby motivating its potential application in air shower simulations. We present results from EAS simulations conducted using CORSIKA 8, wherein Pythia is employed to model hadronic interactions.</description>

      <title>Status of the CORSIKA 8 particle-shower simulation code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over two decades, CORSIKA 7 and its previous versions have been the leading Monte Carlo code for simulating extensive air showers. However, its monolithic Fortran-based software design and hand-optimized code has created challenges for maintenance, adaptation to new computing paradigms, and extensions for more complex simulations. Addressing these limitations, the CORSIKA 8 project represents a comprehensive rewrite of CORSIKA 7, seeing its core functionality re-envisioned in a modern and modular C++ framework. CORSIKA 8 has now reached a "physics-complete" state, offering a robust platform that encourages expert development for specialized applications. It supports high-energy hadronic interactions using models such as Sibyll 2.3d, QGSJet-II.04, EPOS-LHC, and Pythia 8.3, alongside the treatment of electromagnetic cascades with PROPOSAL 7.6.2. Key highlights are the support for multiple interaction media, including cross-media particle showers, and an enhanced calculation of radio emissions from particle showers. This contribution provides an overview of the current functionalities, showcases validation results of its simulations, and discusses future development plans.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Classics: On the Optical Colours of Novae as Standard Crayons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the $BVRI$ colours of novae over the course of their eruptions. Where possible, interstellar reddening was measured using the equivalent widths of Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs). Some novae lack spectra with sufficient resolution and signal-to-noise ratios; therefore, we supplement as necessary with 3D and 2D dust maps. Utilising only novae with DIB- or 3D-map-based $E(B-V)$, we find an average intrinsic $(B-V)_0$ colour of novae at $V$-band light curve peak of 0.18 with a standard deviation of 0.31, based on a sample of 23 novae. When the light curve has declined by 2 magnitudes ($t_2$), we find an average $(B-V)_0 = -0.02$ with a standard deviation of 0.19. These average colours are consistent with previous findings, although the spreads are larger than previously found due to more accurate reddening estimates. We also examined the intrinsic $(R-I)_0$ and $(V-R)_0$ colours across our sample. These colours behave similarly to $(B-V)_0$, except that the $(V-R)_0$ colour gets redder after peak, likely due to the contributions of emission line flux. We searched for correlations between nova colours and $t_2$, peak $V$-band absolute magnitude, and GeV $\gamma$-ray luminosity, but find no statistically significant correlations. Nova colours can therefore be used as standard "crayons" to estimate interstellar reddening from photometry alone, with 0.2--0.3 mag uncertainty. We present a novel Bayesian strategy for estimating distances to Galactic novae based on these $E(B-V)$ measurements, independent of assumptions about luminosity, built using 3D dust maps and a stellar mass model of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Blinded Mock Data Challenge for Gravitational-Wave Cosmology-I: Assessing the Robustness of Methods Using Binary Black Holes Mass Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14244</link>

Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) sources are standard sirens that provide an independent way to map the cosmic expansion history by combining with an independent redshift measurement either from an electromagnetic counterpart for a bright siren or using different statistical techniques for dark sirens. In this analysis, we perform the first Blinded Mock Data Challenge (Blinded-MDC) to test the robustness in inferring the value of Hubble constant $H_0$ for a dark siren technique which depends on astrophysical mass distribution of Binary Black Holes (BBHs). We have considered different analysis setups for the Blinded-MDC to test both statistical and systematic uncertainties and demonstrate the capabilities in inferring $H_0$ with detector sensitivity as per the fourth observation run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that when the astrophysical population of BBHs matches with the underlying assumption of the model, a cosmological pipeline can recover the injected parameters using the observed mass distribution. However, when the mock mass distribution of the astrophysical population depends slightly on redshift and one is ignorant about it in analyzing the data, it can cause a systematic discrepancy in the inferred value of $H_0$ by about $1.5\sigma$, above the statistical fluctuations due to noise and a limited number of events. The discrepancy in $H_0$ is arising due to astrophysical mis-modeling, and in the future, elaborate studies will be required to mitigate systematic uncertainties due to unknown astrophysical populations of BBHs. This MDC framework sets the road map for inspecting the precision and accuracy of standard siren cosmology and provides the first insight into the robustness of the population-dependent cosmology inference in a blinded analysis setup.</description>

      <title>Tidal contributions to the full gravitational waveform to the second-and-a-half post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the different steps to include the adiabatic tidal effects to the gravitational waveform amplitude for quasi-circular non-spinning compact binaries up to the second-and-a-half post-Newtonian (PN) order. The amplitude, that relates the two gravitational wave polarizations, is decomposed onto the basis of spin-weighted spherical harmonics of spin -2, parametrized by the two numbers $(\ell,m)$, where the modes of the waveform correspond to the coefficients of the decomposition. These modes are readily computed from the radiative multipole moments. They can be expressed in a PN-expanded form as well as in a factorized form, suitable to be directly included in effective-one-body models to describe more accurately the waveform of binary neutron stars. We also provide the energy flux and phasing evolution in time and frequency domain. The results presented in this article are collected in an ancillary file.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the gravitational collapse of a homogeneous pressureless ellipsoid. We have shown that the minimal size $r$ that the ellipsoid can reach during collapse depends on its initial eccentricity $e_0$ as $r\propto e_0^\nu$, where $\nu \approx 15/8$, and this dependence is very universal. We have estimated the parameters (in particular, the initial eccentricity) of a homogeneous pressureless ellipsoid, whereat it collapses directly into a black hole.</description>

      <title>Correlations Between the Neutron Star Mass-Radius Relation and the Equation of State of Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytic method of inverting the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) relations to high accuracy. This method is developed from the strong correlations that are shown to exist between the neutron star mass-radius curve and the equation of state (EOS) or pressure-energy density relation. Selecting points that have masses equal to fixed fractions of the maximum mass, we find a semi-universal power-law relation between the central energy densities, pressures, sound speeds, chemical potentials and number densities of those stars, with the maximum mass and the radii of one or more fractional maximum mass points. Root-mean-square fitting accuracies, for EOSs without large first-order phase transitions, are typically 0.5\% for all quantities at all mass points. The method also works well, although less accurately, in reconstructing the EOS of hybrid stars with first-order phase transitions. These results permit, in effect, an analytic method of inverting an arbitrary mass-radius curve to yield its underlying EOS. We discuss applications of this inversion technique to the inference of the dense matter EOS from measurements of neutron star masses and radii as a possible alternative to traditional Bayesian approaches.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background and Neutrino Non-Radiative Decay: a Bayesian Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos being massive could undergo non-radiative decay, a property for which the diffuse supernova neutrino background has a unique sensitivity. We extend previous analyses to explore our ability to disentangle predictions for the diffuse supernova neutrino background in presence or absence of neutrino non-radiative two-body decay. In a three-neutrino framework, we give predictions of the corresponding neutrino fluxes and the expected number of events in the Super-Kamiokande+Gadolinium, the Hyper-Kamiokande, the JUNO and the DUNE experiments. In our analysis, we employ supernova simulations from different groups and include current uncertainties from both the evolving core-collapse supernova rate and the fraction of failed supernovae. We perform the first Bayesian analysis to see our ability to disentangle the cases in presence and absence of neutrino decay. To this aim we combine the expected events in inverse beta-decay and the neutrino-argon detection channels. We also discuss neutrino-electron, neutrino-proton and of neutrino-oxygen scattering. Our investigation covers the different possible decay patterns for normal mass ordering, both strongly-hierarchical and quasi-degenerate as well as the inverted neutrino mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Revision of upper bound on volume-filling intergalactic magnetic fields with LOFAR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields present in the Large Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe change polarization of radio waves arriving from distant extragalactic sources through the effect of Faraday rotation. This effect has been recently used to detect magnetic field in the LSS filaments based on the Rotation Measure data of the LOFAR Two-Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS). We notice that the same data also constrain the strength of the volume-filling magnetic field in the voids of the LSS. We use the LoTSS data to to derive an improved upper bound on the volume-filling field. The new upper bound provides an order of magnitude improvement on the previous Faraday rotation bounds. The new Faraday Rotation bound on the scale-invariant field that may originate from the epoch of inflation is also an order of magnitude lower than the bound on such field derived from the anisotropy analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background.</description>

      <title>Long-term stability of scientific X-ray CMOS detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensors have been demonstrated to have significant potential in X-ray astronomy, where long-term reliability is crucial for space X-ray telescopes. This study examines the long-term stability of a scientific CMOS sensor, focusing on its bias, dark current, readout noise, and X-ray spectral performance. The sensor was initially tested at -30 $^\circ$C for 16 months, followed by accelerated aging at 20 $^\circ$C. After a total aging period of 610 days, the bias map, dark current, readout noise, gain, and energy resolution exhibited no observable degradation. There are less than 50 pixels within the 4 k $\times$ 4 k array which show a decrease of the bias under 50 ms integration time by over 10 digital numbers (DNs). First-order kinetic fitting of the gain evolution predicts a gain degeneration of 0.73% over 3 years and 2.41% over 10 years. These results underscore the long-term reliability of CMOS sensors for application in space missions.</description>

      <title>The source of the 2017 cosmic ray half-year modulation event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2017, as the solar cycle approached solar minimum, an unusually long and large depression was observed in galactic cosmic ray (GCR) protons, detected with the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02), lasting for the second half of that year. The depression, as seen in the Bartel rotation-averaged proton flux, has the form of a Forbush decrease (FD). Despite this resemblance, however, the cause of the observed depression does not have such a simple explanation as FDs, due to coronal mass ejections (CMEs), typically last for a few days at 1 AU rather than half a year. In this work, we seek the cause of the observed depression and investigate two main possibilities. First, we consider a mini-cycle - a temporary change in the solar dynamo that changes the behavior of the global solar magnetic field and, by this, the modulation of GCRs. Secondly, we investigate the behavior of solar activity, both CMEs and co-rotating/stream interactions regions (C/SIRs), during this period. Our findings show that, although there is some evidence for mini-cycle behavior prior to the depression, the depression is ultimately due to a combination of recurrent CMEs, SIRs and CIRs. A particular characteristic of the depression is that the largest impacts that help to create and maintain it are due to four CMEs from the same, highly active, magnetic source that persists for several solar rotations. This active magnetic source is unusual given the closeness of the solar cycle to solar minimum, which also helps to make the depression more evident.</description>

      <title>Probing time-dependent scalar wigs with extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational wave emission from extreme mass ratio inspirals, key targets for the upcoming space-based detector LISA, considering the scenario where the lighter black hole in the binary is endowed by a long-lived, time-dependent scalar field configuration, known as a scalar wig. We develop a formalism to compute scalar perturbations for extreme mass ratio inspirals on circular orbits around Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, and apply this framework to compute additional fluxes induced by the scalar wig as well as their dependence on the scalar field properties. Our computation provides strong indications that in this scenario the presence of the scalar field does not significantly affect the orbital motion and the gravitational waveform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel mechanism for the irreducible production of magnetic monopoles from interactions of cosmic rays and interstellar medium (ISM). Resulting monopoles drain energy from galactic magnetic fields, disrupting their formation and sustainability. We generalize conventional Parker bounds to monopoles with extended energy spectrum and, considering cosmic ray ISM monopole production, set novel constraints from disruption of Milky Way Galactic magnetic fields and their seeds. Further, we set first constraints on disruption of galactic magnetic fields and their seeds of Andromeda galaxy, with results being competitive with distinct existing bounds. Unlike Parker limits of previous works that relied on cosmological monopoles, our constraints are independent of cosmological monopole production or their primordial abundance. Besides, we estimate new constraints on dipole magnetic moments generated from cosmic ray ISM interactions. We discuss implications for monopoles with generalized magnetic charges.</description>

      <title>Phase consistency test to identify type II strongly lensed gravitational wave signals using a single event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For gravitationally lensed type II signals, the phase of the dominant (2, 2) mode and the higher order (3, 3) mode is offset by $-\pi/12$. Using this, we develop a test for type II imagery by allowing the phases of the (2,2) and (3,3) modes to vary separately and introducing a new waveform parameter to represent the phase offset between the two. We use simulated, low mass ratio, precessing signals to show that the test can reproduce the $-\pi/12$ phase offset when detected by three detectors for H-L optimal SNR $\gtrsim$ 40 and $\mathcal{M} \leq 30$. We analyze GW190412 and GW190814 using this parameterization, measuring the offset to be $0.13^{+0.22}_{-0.17}$ for GW190412 and $-0.05^{+0.20}_{-0.22}$ for GW190814. We also measure the Bayes Factor in support of no phase offset, $\log_{10} \mathcal{B}_{\Delta \varphi = 0}$, to be $-0.14$ for GW190412 and $0.21$ for GW190814.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the QCD phase transition and its phase structure within Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-scalar system and compare the results with those obtained from the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton system. It is shown that both models reproduce behavior consistent with lattice QCD. In particular, the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-scalar system exhibits a first-order phase transition in the pure gauge sector, aligning with predictions from Yang-Mills theory. Based on these models, we construct a holographic model for neutron stars, incorporating leptons to satisfy electric charge neutrality, and examine the cold equation of state, the mass-radius relation, and tidal deformability of neutron stars. It is demonstrated that the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-scalar system enables us to describe neutron star properties that meet current astrophysical constraints.</description>

      <title>FRB 20121102A monitoring: Updated periodicity in the L-band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: FRB 20121102A was the first fast radio burst to be observed to repeat. Since then, thousands of bursts have been detected by multiple radio telescopes around the world. Previous work has shown an indication of a cyclic activity level with a periodicity of around 160 days. Knowing when the source repeats is essential for planning multi-wavelength monitoring to constrain the emission extent and progenitor source. We report the monitoring of FRB 20121102A using the 100-m Effelsberg radio telescope in the L-band and update the periodicity of the cyclic activity level. We used the Lomb-Scargle periodogram on a sample of 284 observing epochs, of which 42% correspond to detections and 58% to non-detections. Our dataset is composed of the seven epochs of our monitoring plus publicly available data. We investigated two methods: i) a binary model, describing the observing epochs with 1 if there are detections and with 0 for non-detections, and ii) a normalised rates model that considers the inferred detections rates. We report no detections in 12.5-hour observations down to a fluence of 0.29 Jy ms. The best period we find for the cyclic activity window is $159.3 \pm 0.8$ days for the binary model and $159.3 \pm 0.3$ days for the normalised rates model. We show the activity phase to be 53%. The normalised rates show clear Gaussian-like behaviour for the activity level, in that the number of detections peak at the centre of the activity window. The periodicity found through both methods is consistent for the L and S-band datasets implying it is intrinsic to the source. The activity phase in the S band however, shows an indication of it ending before the L-band activity phase, supporting the idea of a chromatic dependence of the activity window. The sample in the C-band is not large enough to further confirm this result.</description>

      <title>Investigating the role of nuclear parameters in Neutron Star oscillations: a model comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies based on the relativistic mean field (RMF) model found certain nuclear empirical parameters, in particular the nucleon effective mass, to be strongly correlated with observable properties of Neutron Stars (NSs), such as the frequencies of $f-$mode oscillations. This shows the potential to constrain the values of effective mass from future observations of $f-$modes. One of our primary goals of this work is to investigate whether such correlations are physical or an artifact of the underlying nuclear model. To test this, we perform a comparative study of the correlations between NS astrophysical observables and nuclear physics parameters using two different equation of state models based on RMF theory and non-relativistic Meta-Modelling (MM) scheme. The nuclear meta-model does not assume any underlying nuclear model and therefore allows us to test the model dependence of the results. The calculations of the $f-$mode characteristics are performed within the relativistic Cowling approximation. We use state-of-the-art nuclear microscopic calculations at low density and multi-messenger astrophysical data at high-density within a Bayesian-inspired scheme to constrain the parameter space of the nuclear models. From the posterior distribution, we probe the underlying correlations among nuclear parameters and with NS observables. We find that the correlation between the symmetry energy and its slope is physical, while that of the nucleon effective mass with NS observables is model-dependent. The study shows that the effective mass governs the high density behaviour in RMF models, while in the MM it is controlled by the higher order saturation parameters, and hence the effective mass in the MM is not correlated with NS observables. The findings of this investigation are interesting both for astrophysics as well as nuclear physics communities.</description>

      <title>Detection of extended X-ray emission around the PeVatron microquasar V4641 Sgr with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent report on the detection of very-high-energy gamma rays from V4641 Sagittarii (V4641 Sgr) up to ~0.8 peta-electronvolt has made it the second confirmed "PeVatron" microquasar. Here we report on the observation of V4641 Sgr with X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) in September 2024. Thanks to the large field of view and low background, the CCD imager Xtend successfully detected for the first time X-ray extended emission around V4641 Sgr with a significance of &gt; 4.5 sigma and &gt; 10 sigma based on our imaging and spectral analysis, respectively. The spatial extent is estimated to have a radius of $7 \pm 3$ arcmin ($13 \pm 5$ pc at a distance of 6.2 kpc) assuming a Gaussian-like radial distribution, which suggests that the particle acceleration site is within ~10 pc of the microquasar. If the X-ray morphology traces the diffusion of accelerated electrons, this spatial extent can be explained by either an enhanced magnetic field (~80 uG) or a suppressed diffusion coefficient (~$10^{27}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ at 100 TeV). The integrated X-ray flux, (4-6)$\times 10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ (2-10 keV), would require a magnetic field strength higher than the galactic mean (&gt; 8 uG) if the diffuse X-ray emission originates from synchrotron radiation and the gamma-ray emission is predominantly hadronic. If the X-rays are of thermal origin, the measured extension, temperature, and plasma density can be explained by a jet with a luminosity of ~$2\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is comparable to the Eddington luminosity of this system.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Suzaku spectrum of the Galactic SNR W 49 B: non-detection of iron K-shell charge exchange emission and refined ejecta mass ratios of iron-group elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the recombining plasma in several Galactic SNRs has been debated. A plausible mechanism would be a rapid cooling in the past, either by adiabatic or conductive process. A recent spectral study of W 49 B reported a possible charge exchange (CX) emission due to collisions between the shock-heated ejecta and external cold clouds, which could be a direct support for the conduction cooling scenario. However, a potentially large systematic uncertainty in the spectral analysis has not been examined. In this paper, we revisit the Suzaku spectrum of W 49 B with taking into account the systematic uncertainties in spectral codes and instrumental gain calibration. We find that the previously reported CX flux is fully attributable to dielectronic recombination satellite lines of high-shell transitions that are missing from the present version of the spectral codes. We also report refined Fe-group ejecta mass ratios, which, in comparison to those in the literatures, show a better agreement with theoretical expectations from nucleosynthesis models, either of Type Ia explosions or spherical core-collapse explosions.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter (H)eats Young Planets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of dark matter annihilation on the formation of Jovian planets. We show that dark matter heat injections can slow or halt Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction, preventing the accretion of hydrogen and helium onto the solid core. The existence of Jupiter in our solar system can therefore be used to infer constraints on dark matter with relatively strong interaction cross sections. We derive novel constraints on the cross section for both spin-dependent and spin-independent dark matter. We highlight the possibility of a positive detection using future observations by JWST, which could reveal strongly varying planet morpholoiges close to our Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>Entropy based flux limiting scheme for conservation laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entropy based flux-limiting (EFL) scheme is a novel approach designed to accurately resolve shocks and discontinuities in special and general relativistic hydrodynamics. By adaptively adjusting the numerical fluxes, the EFL method mitigates oscillations and preserves smooth transition across discontinuities in shock-dominated flows. Here, we extend the applicability of the EFL method beyond special/general relativistic hydrodynamics to scalar conservation laws and show how to treat systems without a thermodynamic entropy. This is an indication that the method has universal applicability to any system of partial differential equations that can be written in conservation form. We also present some further very challenging special/general relativistic hydrodynamics applications of the EFL method.</description>

      <title>The curvature dependence of gravitational-wave tests of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy extensions to General Relativity modify the Einstein-Hilbert action with higher-order curvature corrections and theory-specific coupling constants. The order of these corrections imprints a universal curvature dependence on observations while the coupling constant controls the deviation strength. In this Letter, we leverage the theory-independent expectation that modifications to the action of a given order in spacetime curvature (Riemann tensor and contractions) lead to observational deviations that scale with the system length-scale to a corresponding power. Focusing on gravitational wave observations, the relevant scale is the binary total mass, and deviations scale as a power of mass $p$ related to the action order. For example, $p=4,6$ arise in effective field theory for cubic and quartic theories respectively. We incorporate this universal scaling into theory-agnostic tests of General Relativity with current gravitational-wave observations, thus enabling constraints on the curvature scaling without compromising the agnostic nature of these tests. This introduces a flexible yet highly interpretable new paradigm for tests of General Relativity with gravitational-wave catalogs.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscosity of nuclear matter with pions in the neutrino-trapped regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work [B. Fore and S. Reddy, Phys. Rev. C 101 035809 (2020)] has shown that the population of thermal pions could modify the equation of state and transport properties of hot and dense neutron-rich matter and introduce new reaction pathways to change the proton fraction. In this article we study their impact on the bulk viscosity of dense matter, focusing on the neutrino-trapped regime that would be realized in neutron star mergers and supernovae. We find that the presence of a thermal population of pions alters the bulk viscosity by modifying the EoS (via the susceptibilities) and by providing new reaction pathways to achieve beta-equilibrium. In neutron star merger conditions, the bulk viscosity in neutrino-trapped $npe\mu$ matter (without pions) has its peak at temperatures of at most a couple MeV and is quite small at temperatures of tens of MeV. We find that thermal pions enhance the low-temperature peak of the bulk viscosity by a factor of a few and shift it to slightly lower temperatures. At higher temperatures, where the pion abundance is large but the bulk viscosity is traditionally small, pions can increase the bulk viscosity by an order of magnitude or more, although it is still orders of magnitude smaller than its peak value.</description>

      <title>Constraining Light QCD Axions with Isolated Neutron Star Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of light QCD axions, whose mass depends on an additional free parameter, can lead to a new ground state of matter, where the sourced axion field reduces the nucleon effective mass. The presence of the axion field has structural consequences, in particular, it results in a thinner (or even prevents its existence) heat-blanketing envelope, significantly altering the cooling patterns of neutron stars. We exploit the anomalous cooling behavior to constrain previously uncharted regions of the axion parameter space by comparing model predictions with existing data from isolated neutron stars. Notably, this analysis does not require the light QCD axion to be the dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence for two peaks in the sound speed in cold dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I show that in addition to the well-known peak inside massive neutron stars, the sound speed in cold dense QCD matter likely exhibits another peak above neutron star densities before it asymptotes to $c_s=\sqrt{C_s}=\sqrt{1/3}$. Based on the framework reported in arxiv:2408.16738, this approach does not rely on any assumption about the ultra-dense matter not realized in nature. Current multimessenger observation of neutron stars favors the two-peak scenario with a Bayes factor $5.1_{-0.7}^{+0.9}$, where the uncertainties are systematics due to models of neutron star inner cores. This evidence grows to $27_{-8}^{+11}$ if the $2.6M_\odot$ component of GW190814 is a neutron star. The trough in $C_s$ separating the two peaks is inferred to be below $0.05^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ (at the $50\%$ level) if $2.6M_\odot$ neutron stars exist. The second peak above $1/3$ beyond baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=1.6-1.9$ GeV most likely signals non-perturbative effects in cold quark matter, for instance color superconductivity.</description>
