      <title>Analyzing the Role of Permutation Invariance in Linear Mode Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was empirically observed in Entezari et al. (2021) that when accounting for the permutation invariance of neural networks, there is likely no loss barrier along the linear interpolation between two SGD solutions -- a phenomenon known as linear mode connectivity (LMC) modulo permutation. This phenomenon has sparked significant attention due to both its theoretical interest and practical relevance in applications such as model merging. In this paper, we provide a fine-grained analysis of this phenomenon for two-layer ReLU networks under a teacher-student setup. We show that as the student network width $m$ increases, the LMC loss barrier modulo permutation exhibits a {\bf double descent} behavior. Particularly, when $m$ is sufficiently large, the barrier decreases to zero at a rate $O(m^{-1/2})$. Notably, this rate does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and demonstrates how substantial permutation can reduce the LMC loss barrier. Moreover, we observe a sharp transition in the sparsity of GD/SGD solutions when increasing the learning rate and investigate how this sparsity preference affects the LMC loss barrier modulo permutation. Experiments on both synthetic and MNIST datasets corroborate our theoretical predictions and reveal a similar trend for more complex network architectures.</description>

      <title>Fixing the Pitfalls of Probabilistic Time-Series Forecasting Evaluation by Kernel Quadrature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the significance of probabilistic time-series forecasting models, their evaluation metrics often involve intractable integrations. The most widely used metric, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), is a strictly proper scoring function; however, its computation requires approximation. We found that popular CRPS estimators--specifically, the quantile-based estimator implemented in the widely used GluonTS library and the probability-weighted moment approximation--both exhibit inherent estimation biases. These biases lead to crude approximations, resulting in improper rankings of forecasting model performance when CRPS values are close. To address this issue, we introduced a kernel quadrature approach that leverages an unbiased CRPS estimator and employs cubature construction for scalable computation. Empirically, our approach consistently outperforms the two widely used CRPS estimators.</description>

      <title>On Statistical Estimation of Edge-Reinforced Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforced random walks (RRWs), including vertex-reinforced random walks (VRRWs) and edge-reinforced random walks (ERRWs), model random walks where the transition probabilities evolve based on prior visitation history~\cite{mgr, fmk, tarres, volkov}. These models have found applications in various areas, such as network representation learning~\cite{xzzs}, reinforced PageRank~\cite{gly}, and modeling animal behaviors~\cite{smouse}, among others. However, statistical estimation of the parameters governing RRWs remains underexplored. This work focuses on estimating the initial edge weights of ERRWs using observed trajectory data. Leveraging the connections between an ERRW and a random walk in a random environment (RWRE)~\cite{mr, mr2}, as given by the so-called "magic formula", we propose an estimator based on the generalized method of moments. To analyze the sample complexity of our estimator, we exploit the hyperbolic Gaussian structure embedded in the random environment to bound the fluctuations of the underlying random edge conductances.</description>

      <title>Double Debiased Machine Learning for Mediation Analysis with Continuous Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncovering causal mediation effects is of significant value to practitioners seeking to isolate the direct treatment effect from the potential mediated effect. We propose a double machine learning (DML) algorithm for mediation analysis that supports continuous treatments. To estimate the target mediated response curve, our method uses a kernel-based doubly robust moment function for which we prove asymptotic Neyman orthogonality. This allows us to obtain asymptotic normality with nonparametric convergence rate while allowing for nonparametric or parametric estimation of the nuisance parameters. We then derive an optimal bandwidth strategy along with a procedure for estimating asymptotic confidence intervals. Finally, to illustrate the benefits of our method, we provide a numerical evaluation of our approach on a simulation along with an application to real-world medical data to analyze the effect of glycemic control on cognitive functions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Robust Identification of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the identification of the stochastic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process error model, which is characterized by an inverse time constant, and the unknown variances of the process and observation noises. Although the availability of the explicit expression of the log-likelihood function allows one to obtain the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), this entails evaluating the nontrivial gradient and also often struggles with local optima. To address these limitations, we put forth a sample-efficient global optimization approach based on the Bayesian optimization (BO) framework, which relies on a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model for the objective function that effectively balances exploration and exploitation to select the query points. Specifically, each evaluation of the objective is implemented efficiently through the Kalman filter (KF) recursion. Comprehensive experiments on various parameter settings and sampling intervals corroborate that BO-based estimator consistently outperforms MLE implemented by the steady-state KF approximation and the expectation-maximization algorithm (whose derivation is a side contribution) in terms of root mean-square error (RMSE) and statistical consistency, confirming the effectiveness and robustness of the BO for identification of the stochastic OU process. Notably, the RMSE values produced by the BO-based estimator are smaller than the classical Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound, especially for the inverse time constant, estimating which has been a long-standing challenge. This seemingly counterintuitive result can be explained by the data-driven prior for the learning parameters indirectly injected by BO through the GP prior over the objective function.</description>

      <title>Swift Hydra: Self-Reinforcing Generative Framework for Anomaly Detection with Multiple Mamba Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite a plethora of anomaly detection models developed over the years, their ability to generalize to unseen anomalies remains an issue, particularly in critical systems. This paper aims to address this challenge by introducing Swift Hydra, a new framework for training an anomaly detection method based on generative AI and reinforcement learning (RL). Through featuring an RL policy that operates on the latent variables of a generative model, the framework synthesizes novel and diverse anomaly samples that are capable of bypassing a detection model. These generated synthetic samples are, in turn, used to augment the detection model, further improving its ability to handle challenging anomalies. Swift Hydra also incorporates Mamba models structured as a Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enable scalable adaptation of the number of Mamba experts based on data complexity, effectively capturing diverse feature distributions without increasing the model's inference time. Empirical evaluations on ADBench benchmark demonstrate that Swift Hydra outperforms other state-of-the-art anomaly detection models while maintaining a relatively short inference time. From these results, our research highlights a new and auspicious paradigm of integrating RL and generative AI for advancing anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Reduced Rank Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced Rank Regression (RRR) is a widely used method for multi-response regression. However, RRR assumes a linear relationship between features and responses. While linear models are useful and often provide a good approximation, many real-world problems involve more complex relationships that cannot be adequately captured by simple linear interactions. One way to model such relationships is via multilinear transformations. This paper introduces Higher Order Reduced Rank Regression (HORRR), an extension of RRR that leverages multi-linear transformations, and as such is capable of capturing nonlinear interactions in multi-response regression. HORRR employs tensor representations for the coefficients and a Tucker decomposition to impose multilinear rank constraints as regularization akin to the rank constraints in RRR. Encoding these constraints as a manifold allows us to use Riemannian optimization to solve this HORRR problems. We theoretically and empirically analyze the use of Riemannian optimization for solving HORRR problems.</description>

      <title>Unique Rashomon Sets for Robust Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collecting labeled data for machine learning models is often expensive and time-consuming. Active learning addresses this challenge by selectively labeling the most informative observations, but when initial labeled data is limited, it becomes difficult to distinguish genuinely informative points from those appearing uncertain primarily due to noise. Ensemble methods like random forests are a powerful approach to quantifying this uncertainty but do so by aggregating all models indiscriminately. This includes poor performing models and redundant models, a problem that worsens in the presence of noisy data. We introduce UNique Rashomon Ensembled Active Learning (UNREAL), which selectively ensembles only distinct models from the Rashomon set, which is the set of nearly optimal models. Restricting ensemble membership to high-performing models with different explanations helps distinguish genuine uncertainty from noise-induced variation. We show that UNREAL achieves faster theoretical convergence rates than traditional active learning approaches and demonstrates empirical improvements of up to 20% in predictive accuracy across five benchmark datasets, while simultaneously enhancing model interpretability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a unifying view of optimal kernel hypothesis testing across the MMD two-sample, HSIC independence, and KSD goodness-of-fit frameworks. Minimax optimal separation rates in the kernel and $L^2$ metrics are presented, with two adaptive kernel selection methods (kernel pooling and aggregation), and under various testing constraints: computational efficiency, differential privacy, and robustness to data corruption. Intuition behind the derivation of the power results is provided in a unified way accross the three frameworks, and open problems are highlighted.</description>

      <title>The influence of missing data mechanisms and simple missing data handling techniques on fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness of machine learning algorithms is receiving increasing attention, as such algorithms permeate the day-to-day aspects of our lives. One way in which bias can manifest in a dataset is through missing values. If data are missing, these data are often assumed to be missing completely randomly; in reality the propensity of data being missing is often tied to the demographic characteristics of individuals. There is limited research into how missing values and the handling thereof can impact the fairness of an algorithm. Most researchers either apply listwise deletion or tend to use the simpler methods of imputation (e.g. mean or mode) compared to the more advanced ones (e.g. multiple imputation); we therefore study the impact of the simpler methods on the fairness of algorithms. The starting point of the study is the mechanism of missingness, leading into how the missing data are processed and finally how this impacts fairness. Three popular datasets in the field of fairness are amputed in a simulation study. The results show that under certain scenarios the impact on fairness can be pronounced when the missingness mechanism is missing at random. Furthermore, elementary missing data handling techniques like listwise deletion and mode imputation can lead to higher fairness compared to more complex imputation methods like k-nearest neighbour imputation, albeit often at the cost of lower accuracy.</description>

      <title>Efficient Distributed Learning over Decentralized Networks with Convoluted Support Vector Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of efficiently classifying high-dimensional data over decentralized networks. Penalized support vector machines (SVMs) are widely used for high-dimensional classification tasks. However, the double nonsmoothness of the objective function poses significant challenges in developing efficient decentralized learning methods. Many existing procedures suffer from slow, sublinear convergence rates. To overcome this limitation, we consider a convolution-based smoothing technique for the nonsmooth hinge loss function. The resulting loss function remains convex and smooth. We then develop an efficient generalized alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for solving penalized SVM over decentralized networks. Our theoretical contributions are twofold. First, we establish that our generalized ADMM algorithm achieves provable linear convergence with a simple implementation. Second, after a sufficient number of ADMM iterations, the final sparse estimator attains near-optimal statistical convergence and accurately recovers the true support of the underlying parameters. Extensive numerical experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Scaffold with Stochastic Gradients: New Analysis with Linear Speed-Up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel analysis for the Scaffold algorithm, a popular method for dealing with data heterogeneity in federated learning. While its convergence in deterministic settings--where local control variates mitigate client drift--is well established, the impact of stochastic gradient updates on its performance is less understood. To address this problem, we first show that its global parameters and control variates define a Markov chain that converges to a stationary distribution in the Wasserstein distance. Leveraging this result, we prove that Scaffold achieves linear speed-up in the number of clients up to higher-order terms in the step size. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals that Scaffold retains a higher-order bias, similar to FedAvg, that does not decrease as the number of clients increases. This highlights opportunities for developing improved stochastic federated learning algorithms</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Missing Data Imputation for Time Series Without Ground Truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenge of handling missing data in time series is critical for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of machine learning (ML) models in applications like fifth generation mobile communication (5G) network management. Traditional methods for validating imputation rely on ground truth data, which is inherently unavailable. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing two statistical metrics, the wasserstein distance (WD) and jensen-shannon divergence (JSD), to evaluate imputation quality without requiring ground truth. These metrics assess the alignment between the distributions of imputed and original data, providing a robust method for evaluating imputation performance based on internal structure and data consistency. We apply and test these metrics across several imputation techniques. Results demonstrate that WD and JSD are effective metrics for assessing the quality of missing data imputation, particularly in scenarios where ground truth data is unavailable.</description>

      <title>From Target Tracking to Targeting Track -- Part III: Stochastic Process Modeling and Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the third part of a series of studies that model the target trajectory, which describes the target state evolution over continuous time, as a sample path of a stochastic process (SP). By adopting a deterministic-stochastic decomposition framework, we decompose the learning of the trajectory SP into two sequential stages: the first fits the deterministic trend of the trajectory using a curve function of time, while the second estimates the residual stochastic component through parametric learning of either a Gaussian process (GP) or Student's-$t$ process (StP). This leads to a Markov-free data-driven tracking approach that produces the continuous-time trajectory with minimal prior knowledge of the target dynamics. Notably, our approach explicitly models both the temporal correlations of the state sequence and of measurement noises through the SP framework. It does not only take advantage of the smooth trend of the target but also makes use of the long-term temporal correlation of both the data noise and the model fitting error. Simulations in four maneuvering target tracking scenarios have demonstrated its effectiveness and superiority in comparison with existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Visualizations of Data Spaces for Classification Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do classification models "see" our data? Based on their success in delineating behaviors, there must be some lens through which it is easy to see the boundary between classes; however, our current set of visualization techniques makes this prospect difficult. In this work, we propose a hybrid supervised-unsupervised technique distinctly suited to visualizing the decision boundaries determined by classification problems. This method provides a human-interpretable map that can be analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, which we demonstrate through visualizing and interpreting a decision boundary for chemical neurotoxicity. While we discuss this method in the context of chemistry-driven problems, its application can be generalized across subfields for "unboxing" the operations of machine-learning classification models.</description>

      <title>Performance Comparisons of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Sequential Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in sequential experimental design look to construct a policy that can efficiently navigate the design space, in a way that maximises the expected information gain. Whilst there is work on achieving tractable policies for experimental design problems, there is significantly less work on obtaining policies that are able to generalise well - i.e. able to give good performance despite a change in the underlying statistical properties of the experiments. Conducting experiments sequentially has recently brought about the use of reinforcement learning, where an agent is trained to navigate the design space to select the most informative designs for experimentation. However, there is still a lack of understanding about the benefits and drawbacks of using certain reinforcement learning algorithms to train these agents. In our work, we investigate several reinforcement learning algorithms and their efficacy in producing agents that take maximally informative design decisions in sequential experimental design scenarios. We find that agent performance is impacted depending on the algorithm used for training, and that particular algorithms, using dropout or ensemble approaches, empirically showcase attractive generalisation properties.</description>

      <title>Dependency-aware Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active learning aims to efficiently build a labeled training set by strategically selecting samples to query labels from annotators. In this sequential process, each sample acquisition influences subsequent selections, causing dependencies among samples in the labeled set. However, these dependencies are overlooked during the model parameter estimation stage when updating the model using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), a conventional method that assumes independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data. We propose Dependency-aware MLE (DMLE), which corrects MLE within the active learning framework by addressing sample dependencies typically neglected due to the i.i.d. assumption, ensuring consistency with active learning principles in the model parameter estimation process. This improved method achieves superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets, reaching higher performance in earlier cycles compared to conventional MLE. Specifically, we observe average accuracy improvements of 6\%, 8.6\%, and 10.5\% for $k=1$, $k=5$, and $k=10$ respectively, after collecting the first 100 samples, where entropy is the acquisition function and $k$ is the query batch size acquired at every active learning cycle.</description>

      <title>Learning-Order Autoregressive Models with Application to Molecular Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have become the workhorse for sequence generation tasks, since many problems can be modeled as next-token prediction. While there appears to be a natural ordering for text (i.e., left-to-right), for many data types, such as graphs, the canonical ordering is less obvious. To address this problem, we introduce a variant of ARM that generates high-dimensional data using a probabilistic ordering that is sequentially inferred from data. This model incorporates a trainable probability distribution, referred to as an \emph{order-policy}, that dynamically decides the autoregressive order in a state-dependent manner. To train the model, we introduce a variational lower bound on the exact log-likelihood, which we optimize with stochastic gradient estimation. We demonstrate experimentally that our method can learn meaningful autoregressive orderings in image and graph generation. On the challenging domain of molecular graph generation, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k benchmarks, evaluated using the Fr\'{e}chet ChemNet Distance (FCD).</description>

      <title>Black Box Causal Inference: Effect Estimation via Meta Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal inference and the estimation of causal effects plays a central role in decision-making across many areas, including healthcare and economics. Estimating causal effects typically requires an estimator that is tailored to each problem of interest. But developing estimators can take significant effort for even a single causal inference setting. For example, algorithms for regression-based estimators, propensity score methods, and doubly robust methods were designed across several decades to handle causal estimation with observed confounders. Similarly, several estimators have been developed to exploit instrumental variables (IVs), including two-stage least-squares (TSLS), control functions, and the method-of-moments. In this work, we instead frame causal inference as a dataset-level prediction problem, offloading algorithm design to the learning process. The approach we introduce, called black box causal inference (BBCI), builds estimators in a black-box manner by learning to predict causal effects from sampled dataset-effect pairs. We demonstrate accurate estimation of average treatment effects (ATEs) and conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) with BBCI across several causal inference problems with known identification, including problems with less developed estimators.</description>

      <title>Nearly Optimal Differentially Private ReLU Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate one of the most fundamental nonconvex learning problems, ReLU regression, in the Differential Privacy (DP) model. Previous studies on private ReLU regression heavily rely on stringent assumptions, such as constant bounded norms for feature vectors and labels. We relax these assumptions to a more standard setting, where data can be i.i.d. sampled from $O(1)$-sub-Gaussian distributions. We first show that when $\varepsilon = \tilde{O}(\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}})$ and there is some public data, it is possible to achieve an upper bound of $\Tilde{O}(\frac{d^2}{N^2 \varepsilon^2})$ for the excess population risk in $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP, where $d$ is the dimension and $N$ is the number of data samples. Moreover, we relax the requirement of $\epsilon$ and public data by proposing and analyzing a one-pass mini-batch Generalized Linear Model Perceptron algorithm (DP-MBGLMtron). Additionally, using the tracing attack argument technique, we demonstrate that the minimax rate of the estimation error for $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithms is lower bounded by $\Omega(\frac{d^2}{N^2 \varepsilon^2})$. This shows that DP-MBGLMtron achieves the optimal utility bound up to logarithmic factors. Experiments further support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Randomized Quasi-Monte Carlo Features for Kernel Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the application of randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) methods in random feature approximations for kernel-based learning. Compared to the classical Monte Carlo (MC) approach \citep{rahimi2007random}, RQMC improves the deterministic approximation error bound from $O_P(1/\sqrt{n})$ to $O(1/M)$ (up to logarithmic factors), matching the rate achieved by quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods \citep{huangquasi}. Beyond the deterministic error bound guarantee, we further establish additional average error bounds for RQMC features: some requiring weaker assumptions and others significantly reducing the exponent of the logarithmic factor. In the context of kernel ridge regression, we show that RQMC features offer computational advantages over MC features while preserving the same statistical error rate. Empirical results further show that RQMC methods maintain stable performance in both low and moderately high-dimensional settings, unlike QMC methods, which suffer from significant performance degradation as dimension increases.</description>

      <title>Clustering-based Meta Bayesian Optimization with Theoretical Guarantee</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a well-established method for addressing black-box optimization problems. In many real-world scenarios, optimization often involves multiple functions, emphasizing the importance of leveraging data and learned functions from prior tasks to enhance efficiency in the current task. To expedite convergence to the global optimum, recent studies have introduced meta-learning strategies, collectively referred to as meta-BO, to incorporate knowledge from historical tasks. However, in practical settings, the underlying functions are often heterogeneous, which can adversely affect optimization performance for the current task. Additionally, when the number of historical tasks is large, meta-BO methods face significant scalability challenges. In this work, we propose a scalable and robust meta-BO method designed to address key challenges in heterogeneous and large-scale meta-tasks. Our approach (1) effectively partitions transferred meta-functions into highly homogeneous clusters, (2) learns the geometry-based surrogate prototype that capture the structural patterns within each cluster, and (3) adaptively synthesizes meta-priors during the online phase using statistical distance-based weighting policies. Experimental results on real-world hyperparameter optimization (HPO) tasks, combined with theoretical guarantees, demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our method in overcoming these challenges.</description>

      <title>FEDS: Feature and Entropy-Based Distillation Strategy for Efficient Learned Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) methods have recently outperformed traditional codecs such as VVC in rate-distortion performance. However, their large models and high computational costs have limited their practical adoption. In this paper, we first construct a high-capacity teacher model by integrating Swin-Transformer V2-based attention modules, additional residual blocks, and expanded latent channels, thus achieving enhanced compression performance. Building on this foundation, we propose a \underline{F}eature and \underline{E}ntropy-based \underline{D}istillation \underline{S}trategy (\textbf{FEDS}) that transfers key knowledge from the teacher to a lightweight student model. Specifically, we align intermediate feature representations and emphasize the most informative latent channels through an entropy-based loss. A staged training scheme refines this transfer in three phases: feature alignment, channel-level distillation, and final fine-tuning. Our student model nearly matches the teacher across Kodak (1.24\% BD-Rate increase), Tecnick (1.17\%), and CLIC (0.55\%) while cutting parameters by about 63\% and accelerating encoding/decoding by around 73\%. Moreover, ablation studies indicate that FEDS generalizes effectively to transformer-based networks. The experimental results demonstrate our approach strikes a compelling balance among compression performance, speed, and model parameters, making it well-suited for real-time or resource-limited scenarios.</description>

      <title>Generative modelling with jump-diffusions</title>

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models generate samples from an unknown target distribution using a time-reversed diffusion process. While such models represent state-of-the-art approaches in industrial applications such as artificial image generation, it has recently been noted that their performance can be further improved by considering injection noise with heavy tailed characteristics. Here, I present a generalization of generative diffusion processes to a wide class of non-Gaussian noise processes. I consider forward processes driven by standard Gaussian noise with super-imposed Poisson jumps representing a finite activity Levy process. The generative process is shown to be governed by a generalized score function that depends on the jump amplitude distribution. Both probability flow ODE and SDE formulations are derived using basic technical effort, and are implemented for jump amplitudes drawn from a multivariate Laplace distribution. Remarkably, for the problem of capturing a heavy-tailed target distribution, the jump-diffusion Laplace model outperforms models driven by alpha-stable noise despite not containing any heavy-tailed characteristics. The framework can be readily applied to other jump statistics that could further improve on the performance of standard diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards: GRPO's Effective Loss, Dynamics, and Success Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was introduced and used successfully to train DeepSeek R1 models for promoting reasoning capabilities of LLMs using verifiable or binary rewards. We show in this paper that GRPO with verifiable rewards can be written as a Kullback Leibler ($\mathsf{KL}$) regularized contrastive loss, where the contrastive samples are synthetic data sampled from the old policy. The optimal GRPO policy $\pi_{n}$ can be expressed explicitly in terms of the binary reward, as well as the first and second order statistics of the old policy ($\pi_{n-1}$) and the reference policy $\pi_0$. Iterating this scheme, we obtain a sequence of policies $\pi_{n}$ for which we can quantify the probability of success $p_n$. We show that the probability of success of the policy satisfies a recurrence that converges to a fixed point of a function that depends on the initial probability of success $p_0$ and the regularization parameter $\beta$ of the $\mathsf{KL}$ regularizer. We show that the fixed point $p^*$ is guaranteed to be larger than $p_0$, thereby demonstrating that GRPO effectively amplifies the probability of success of the policy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite collection of stochastic alternatives, we study the problem of sequentially allocating a fixed sampling budget to identify the optimal alternative with a high probability, where the optimal alternative is defined as the one with the smallest value of extreme tail risk. We particularly consider a situation where these alternatives generate heavy-tailed losses whose probability distributions are unknown and may not admit any specific parametric representation. In this setup, we propose data-driven sequential sampling policies that maximize the rate at which the likelihood of falsely selecting suboptimal alternatives decays to zero. We rigorously demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over existing approaches, which is further validated via numerical studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel way to integrate flexible, context-dependent constraints into combinatorial optimization by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside traditional algorithms. Although LLMs excel at interpreting nuanced, locally specified requirements, they struggle with enforcing global combinatorial feasibility. To bridge this gap, we propose an iterated fine-tuning framework where algorithmic feedback progressively refines the LLM's output distribution. Interpreting this as simulated annealing, we introduce a formal model based on a "coarse learnability" assumption, providing sample complexity bounds for convergence. Empirical evaluations on scheduling, graph connectivity, and clustering tasks demonstrate that our framework balances the flexibility of locally expressed constraints with rigorous global optimization more effectively compared to baseline sampling methods. Our results highlight a promising direction for hybrid AI-driven combinatorial reasoning.</description>

      <title>Learning Energy-Based Models by Self-normalising the Likelihood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training an energy-based model (EBM) with maximum likelihood is challenging due to the intractable normalisation constant. Traditional methods rely on expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to estimate the gradient of logartihm of the normalisation constant. We propose a novel objective called self-normalised log-likelihood (SNL) that introduces a single additional learnable parameter representing the normalisation constant compared to the regular log-likelihood. SNL is a lower bound of the log-likelihood, and its optimum corresponds to both the maximum likelihood estimate of the model parameters and the normalisation constant. We show that the SNL objective is concave in the model parameters for exponential family distributions. Unlike the regular log-likelihood, the SNL can be directly optimised using stochastic gradient techniques by sampling from a crude proposal distribution. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed method on various density estimation tasks as well as EBMs for regression. Our results show that the proposed method, while simpler to implement and tune, outperforms existing techniques.</description>

      <title>PIED: Physics-Informed Experimental Design for Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many science and engineering settings, system dynamics are characterized by governing PDEs, and a major challenge is to solve inverse problems (IPs) where unknown PDE parameters are inferred based on observational data gathered under limited budget. Due to the high costs of setting up and running experiments, experimental design (ED) is often done with the help of PDE simulations to optimize for the most informative design parameters to solve such IPs, prior to actual data collection. This process of optimizing design parameters is especially critical when the budget and other practical constraints make it infeasible to adjust the design parameters between trials during the experiments. However, existing experimental design (ED) methods tend to require sequential and frequent design parameter adjustments between trials. Furthermore, they also have significant computational bottlenecks due to the need for complex numerical simulations for PDEs, and do not exploit the advantages provided by physics informed neural networks (PINNs), such as its meshless solutions, differentiability, and amortized training. This work presents PIED, the first ED framework that makes use of PINNs in a fully differentiable architecture to perform continuous optimization of design parameters for IPs for one-shot deployments. PIED overcomes existing methods' computational bottlenecks through parallelized computation and meta-learning of PINN parameter initialization, and proposes novel methods to effectively take into account PINN training dynamics in optimizing the ED parameters. Through experiments based on noisy simulated data and even real world experimental data, we empirically show that given limited observation budget, PIED significantly outperforms existing ED methods in solving IPs, including challenging settings where the inverse parameters are unknown functions rather than just finite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Sequential Function-Space Variational Inference via Gaussian Mixture Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning is learning from a sequence of tasks with the aim of learning new tasks without forgetting old tasks. Sequential function-space variational inference (SFSVI) is a continual learning method based on variational inference which uses a Gaussian variational distribution to approximate the distribution of the outputs of a finite number of selected inducing points. Since the posterior distribution of a neural network is multi-modal, a Gaussian distribution could only match one mode of the posterior distribution, and a Gaussian mixture distribution could be used to better approximate the posterior distribution. We propose an SFSVI method which uses a Gaussian mixture variational distribution. We also compare different types of variational inference methods with and without a fixed pre-trained feature extractor. We find that in terms of final average accuracy, Gaussian mixture methods perform better than Gaussian methods and likelihood-focused methods perform better than prior-focused methods.</description>

      <title>Improving Deep Ensembles by Estimating Confusion Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensembling in deep learning improves accuracy and calibration over single networks. The traditional aggregation approach, ensemble averaging, treats all individual networks equally by averaging their outputs. Inspired by crowdsourcing we propose an aggregation method called soft Dawid Skene for deep ensembles that estimates confusion matrices of ensemble members and weighs them according to their inferred performance. Soft Dawid Skene aggregates soft labels in contrast to hard labels often used in crowdsourcing. We empirically show the superiority of soft Dawid Skene in accuracy, calibration and out of distribution detection in comparison to ensemble averaging in extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-vacuous Generalization Bounds for Deep Neural Networks without any modification to the trained models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network (NN) with millions or billions of parameters can perform really well on unseen data, after being trained from a finite training set. Various prior theories have been developed to explain such excellent ability of NNs, but do not provide a meaningful bound on the test error. Some recent theories, based on PAC-Bayes and mutual information, are non-vacuous and hence show a great potential to explain the excellent performance of NNs. However, they often require a stringent assumption and extensive modification (e.g. compression, quantization) to the trained model of interest. Therefore, those prior theories provide a guarantee for the modified versions only. In this paper, we propose two novel bounds on the test error of a model. Our bounds uses the training set only and require no modification to the model. Those bounds are verified on a large class of modern NNs, pretrained by Pytorch on the ImageNet dataset, and are non-vacuous. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first non-vacuous bounds at this large scale, without any modification to the pretrained models.</description>

      <title>Robust Multilinear Principal Component Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA) is an important tool for analyzing tensor data. It performs dimension reduction similar to PCA for multivariate data. However, standard MPCA is sensitive to outliers. It is highly influenced by observations deviating from the bulk of the data, called casewise outliers, as well as by individual outlying cells in the tensors, so-called cellwise outliers. This latter type of outlier is highly likely to occur in tensor data, as tensors typically consist of many cells. This paper introduces a novel robust MPCA method that can handle both types of outliers simultaneously, and can cope with missing values as well. This method uses a single loss function to reduce the influence of both casewise and cellwise outliers. The solution that minimizes this loss function is computed using an iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm with a robust initialization. Graphical diagnostic tools are also proposed to identify the different types of outliers that have been found by the new robust MPCA method. The performance of the method and associated graphical displays is assessed through simulations and illustrated on two real datasets.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Nonparametric Closeness Testing for Continuous Distributions and Its Application to Causal Discovery with Hidden Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of closeness testing for continuous distributions and its implications for causal discovery. Specifically, we analyze the sample complexity of distinguishing whether two multidimensional continuous distributions are identical or differ by at least $\epsilon$ in terms of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence under non-parametric assumptions. To this end, we propose an estimator of KL divergence which is based on the von Mises expansion. Our closeness test attains optimal parametric rates under smoothness assumptions. Equipped with this test, which serves as a building block of our causal discovery algorithm to identify the causal structure between two multidimensional random variables, we establish sample complexity guarantees for our causal discovery method. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first work that provides sample complexity guarantees for distinguishing cause and effect in multidimensional non-linear models with non-Gaussian continuous variables in the presence of unobserved confounding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models and Flow Matching generate high-quality samples but are slow at inference, and distilling them into few-step models often leads to instability and extensive tuning. To resolve these trade-offs, we propose Inductive Moment Matching (IMM), a new class of generative models for one- or few-step sampling with a single-stage training procedure. Unlike distillation, IMM does not require pre-training initialization and optimization of two networks; and unlike Consistency Models, IMM guarantees distribution-level convergence and remains stable under various hyperparameters and standard model architectures. IMM surpasses diffusion models on ImageNet-256x256 with 1.99 FID using only 8 inference steps and achieves state-of-the-art 2-step FID of 1.98 on CIFAR-10 for a model trained from scratch.</description>

      <title>Testing for Overfitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High complexity models are notorious in machine learning for overfitting, a phenomenon in which models well represent data but fail to generalize an underlying data generating process. A typical procedure for circumventing overfitting computes empirical risk on a holdout set and halts once (or flags that/when) it begins to increase. Such practice often helps in outputting a well-generalizing model, but justification for why it works is primarily heuristic.
  We discuss the overfitting problem and explain why standard asymptotic and concentration results do not hold for evaluation with training data. We then proceed to introduce and argue for a hypothesis test by means of which both model performance may be evaluated using training data, and overfitting quantitatively defined and detected. We rely on said concentration bounds which guarantee that empirical means should, with high probability, approximate their true mean to conclude that they should approximate each other. We stipulate conditions under which this test is valid, describe how the test may be used for identifying overfitting, articulate a further nuance according to which distributional shift may be flagged, and highlight an alternative notion of learning which usefully captures generalization in the absence of uniform PAC guarantees.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play Posterior Sampling under Mismatched Measurement and Prior Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Posterior sampling has been shown to be a powerful Bayesian approach for solving imaging inverse problems. The recent plug-and-play unadjusted Langevin algorithm (PnP-ULA) has emerged as a promising method for Monte Carlo sampling and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation by combining physical measurement models with deep-learning priors specified using image denoisers. However, the intricate relationship between the sampling distribution of PnP-ULA and the mismatched data-fidelity and denoiser has not been theoretically analyzed. We address this gap by proposing a posterior-L2 pseudometric and using it to quantify an explicit error bound for PnP-ULA under mismatched posterior distribution. We numerically validate our theory on several inverse problems such as sampling from Gaussian mixture models and image deblurring. Our results suggest that the sensitivity of the sampling distribution of PnP-ULA to a mismatch in the measurement model and the denoiser can be precisely characterized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a widely used technique for optimizing black-box functions, with Expected Improvement (EI) being the most commonly utilized acquisition function in this domain. While EI is often viewed as distinct from other information-theoretic acquisition functions, such as entropy search (ES) and max-value entropy search (MES), our work reveals that EI can be considered a special case of MES when approached through variational inference (VI). In this context, we have developed the Variational Entropy Search (VES) methodology and the VES-Gamma algorithm, which adapts EI by incorporating principles from information-theoretic concepts. The efficacy of VES-Gamma is demonstrated across a variety of test functions and read datasets, highlighting its theoretical and practical utilities in Bayesian optimization scenarios.</description>

      <title>Convergence Guarantees for RMSProp and Adam in Generalized-smooth Non-convex Optimization with Affine Noise Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides the first tight convergence analyses for RMSProp and Adam in non-convex optimization under the most relaxed assumptions of coordinate-wise generalized smoothness and affine noise variance. We first analyze RMSProp, which is a special case of Adam with adaptive learning rates but without first-order momentum. Specifically, to solve the challenges due to dependence among adaptive update, unbounded gradient estimate and Lipschitz constant, we demonstrate that the first-order term in the descent lemma converges and its denominator is upper bounded by a function of gradient norm. Based on this result, we show that RMSProp with proper hyperparameters converges to an $\epsilon$-stationary point with an iteration complexity of $\mathcal O(\epsilon^{-4})$. We then generalize our analysis to Adam, where the additional challenge is due to a mismatch between the gradient and first-order momentum. We develop a new upper bound on the first-order term in the descent lemma, which is also a function of the gradient norm. We show that Adam with proper hyperparameters converges to an $\epsilon$-stationary point with an iteration complexity of $\mathcal O(\epsilon^{-4})$. Our complexity results for both RMSProp and Adam match with the complexity lower bound established in \cite{arjevani2023lower}.</description>

      <title>Spectral Truncation Kernels: Noncommutativity in $C^*$-algebraic Kernel Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17823v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $C^*$-algebra-valued kernels could pave the way for the next generation of kernel machines. To further our fundamental understanding of learning with $C^*$-algebraic kernels, we propose a new class of positive definite kernels based on the spectral truncation. We focus on kernels whose inputs and outputs are vectors or functions and generalize typical kernels by introducing the noncommutativity of the products appearing in the kernels. The noncommutativity induces interactions along the data function domain. We show that the proposed kernels fill the gap between existing separable and commutative kernels. We also propose a deep learning perspective to obtain a more flexible framework. The flexibility of the proposed class of kernels allows us to go beyond previous separable and commutative kernels, addressing two of the foremost issues regarding learning in vector-valued RKHSs, namely the choice of the kernel and the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Federated Q-Learning with Reference-Advantage Decomposition: Almost Optimal Regret and Logarithmic Communication Cost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider model-free federated reinforcement learning for tabular episodic Markov decision processes. Under the coordination of a central server, multiple agents collaboratively explore the environment and learn an optimal policy without sharing their raw data. Despite recent advances in federated Q-learning algorithms achieving near-linear regret speedup with low communication cost, existing algorithms only attain suboptimal regrets compared to the information bound. We propose a novel model-free federated Q-learning algorithm, termed FedQ-Advantage. Our algorithm leverages reference-advantage decomposition for variance reduction and operates under two distinct mechanisms: synchronization between the agents and the server, and policy update, both triggered by events. We prove that our algorithm not only requires a lower logarithmic communication cost but also achieves an almost optimal regret, reaching the information bound up to a logarithmic factor and near-linear regret speedup compared to its single-agent counterpart when the time horizon is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Is merging worth it? Securely evaluating the information gain for causal dataset acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Merging datasets across institutions is a lengthy and costly procedure, especially when it involves private information. Data hosts may therefore want to prospectively gauge which datasets are most beneficial to merge with, without revealing sensitive information. For causal estimation this is particularly challenging as the value of a merge will depend not only on the reduction in epistemic uncertainty but also the improvement in overlap. To address this challenge, we introduce the first cryptographically secure information-theoretic approach for quantifying the value of a merge in the context of heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. We do this by evaluating the Expected Information Gain (EIG) and utilising multi-party computation to ensure it can be securely computed without revealing any raw data. As we demonstrate, this can be used with differential privacy (DP) to ensure privacy requirements whilst preserving more accurate computation than naive DP alone. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first privacy-preserving method for dataset acquisition tailored to causal estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our method on a range of simulated and realistic benchmarks. The code is available anonymously.</description>

      <title>Gap-Dependent Bounds for Q-Learning using Reference-Advantage Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gap-dependent bounds of two important algorithms for on-policy Q-learning for finite-horizon episodic tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs): UCB-Advantage (Zhang et al. 2020) and Q-EarlySettled-Advantage (Li et al. 2021). UCB-Advantage and Q-EarlySettled-Advantage improve upon the results based on Hoeffding-type bonuses and achieve the almost optimal $\sqrt{T}$-type regret bound in the worst-case scenario, where $T$ is the total number of steps. However, the benign structures of the MDPs such as a strictly positive suboptimality gap can significantly improve the regret. While gap-dependent regret bounds have been obtained for Q-learning with Hoeffding-type bonuses, it remains an open question to establish gap-dependent regret bounds for Q-learning using variance estimators in their bonuses and reference-advantage decomposition for variance reduction. We develop a novel error decomposition framework to prove gap-dependent regret bounds of UCB-Advantage and Q-EarlySettled-Advantage that are logarithmic in $T$ and improve upon existing ones for Q-learning algorithms. Moreover, we establish the gap-dependent bound for the policy switching cost of UCB-Advantage and improve that under the worst-case MDPs. To our knowledge, this paper presents the first gap-dependent regret analysis for Q-learning using variance estimators and reference-advantage decomposition and also provides the first gap-dependent analysis on policy switching cost for Q-learning.</description>

      <title>Learning signals defined on graphs with optimal transport and Gaussian process regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In computational physics, machine learning has now emerged as a powerful complementary tool to explore efficiently candidate designs in engineering studies. Outputs in such supervised problems are signals defined on meshes, and a natural question is the extension of general scalar output regression models to such complex outputs. Changes between input geometries in terms of both size and adjacency structure in particular make this transition non-trivial. In this work, we propose an innovative strategy for Gaussian process regression where inputs are large and sparse graphs with continuous node attributes and outputs are signals defined on the nodes of the associated inputs. The methodology relies on the combination of regularized optimal transport, dimension reduction techniques, and the use of Gaussian processes indexed by graphs. In addition to enabling signal prediction, the main point of our proposal is to come with confidence intervals on node values, which is crucial for uncertainty quantification and active learning. Numerical experiments highlight the efficiency of the method to solve real problems in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses a fundamental but largely unexplored challenge in sequential changepoint analysis: conducting inference following a detected change. We study the problem of localizing the changepoint using only the data observed up to a data-dependent stopping time at which a sequential detection algorithm $\mathcal A$ declares a change. We first construct confidence sets for the unknown changepoint when pre- and post-change distributions are assumed to be known. We then extend our framework to composite pre- and post-change scenarios. We impose no conditions on the observation space or on $\mathcal A$ -- we only need to be able to run $\mathcal A$ on simulated data sequences. In summary, this work offers both theoretically sound and practically effective tools for sequential changepoint localization.</description>

Abstract: Accurate prediction with multimodal data-encompassing tabular, textual, and visual inputs or outputs-is fundamental to advancing analytics in diverse application domains. Traditional approaches often struggle to integrate heterogeneous data types while maintaining high predictive accuracy. We introduce Generative Distribution Prediction (GDP), a novel framework that leverages multimodal synthetic data generation-such as conditional diffusion models-to enhance predictive performance across structured and unstructured modalities. GDP is model-agnostic, compatible with any high-fidelity generative model, and supports transfer learning for domain adaptation. We establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for GDP, providing statistical guarantees on its predictive accuracy when using diffusion models as the generative backbone. By estimating the data-generating distribution and adapting to various loss functions for risk minimization, GDP enables accurate point predictions across multimodal settings. We empirically validate GDP on four supervised learning tasks-tabular data prediction, question answering, image captioning, and adaptive quantile regression-demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>The Majority Vote Paradigm Shift: When Popular Meets Optimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliably labelling data typically requires annotations from multiple human workers. However, humans are far from being perfect. Hence, it is a common practice to aggregate labels gathered from multiple annotators to make a more confident estimate of the true label. Among many aggregation methods, the simple and well known Majority Vote (MV) selects the class label polling the highest number of votes. However, despite its importance, the optimality of MV's label aggregation has not been extensively studied. We address this gap in our work by characterising the conditions under which MV achieves the theoretically optimal lower bound on label estimation error. Our results capture the tolerable limits on annotation noise under which MV can optimally recover labels for a given class distribution. This certificate of optimality provides a more principled approach to model selection for label aggregation as an alternative to otherwise inefficient practices that sometimes include higher experts, gold labels, etc., that are all marred by the same human uncertainty despite huge time and monetary costs. Experiments on both synthetic and real world data corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Your Assumed DAG is Wrong and Here's How To Deal With It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents prior knowledge of causal relationships between variables is a common starting point for cause-effect estimation. Existing literature typically invokes hypothetical domain expert knowledge or causal discovery algorithms to justify this assumption. In practice, neither may propose a single DAG with high confidence. Domain experts are hesitant to rule out dependencies with certainty or have ongoing disputes about relationships; causal discovery often relies on untestable assumptions itself or only provides an equivalence class of DAGs and is commonly sensitive to hyperparameter and threshold choices. We propose an efficient, gradient-based optimization method that provides bounds for causal queries over a collection of causal graphs -- compatible with imperfect prior knowledge -- that may still be too large for exhaustive enumeration. Our bounds achieve good coverage and sharpness for causal queries such as average treatment effects in linear and non-linear synthetic settings as well as on real-world data. Our approach aims at providing an easy-to-use and widely applicable rebuttal to the valid critique of `What if your assumed DAG is wrong?'.</description>

      <title>A Tight Regret Analysis of Non-Parametric Repeated Contextual Brokerage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a contextual version of the repeated brokerage problem. In each interaction, two traders with private valuations for an item seek to buy or sell based on the learner's-a broker-proposed price, which is informed by some contextual information. The broker's goal is to maximize the traders' net utility-also known as the gain from trade-by minimizing regret compared to an oracle with perfect knowledge of traders' valuation distributions. We assume that traders' valuations are zero-mean perturbations of the unknown item's current market value-which can change arbitrarily from one interaction to the next-and that similar contexts will correspond to similar market prices. We analyze two feedback settings: full-feedback, where after each interaction the traders' valuations are revealed to the broker, and limited-feedback, where only transaction attempts are revealed. For both feedback types, we propose algorithms achieving tight regret bounds. We further strengthen our performance guarantees by providing a tight 1/2-approximation result showing that the oracle that knows the traders' valuation distributions achieves at least 1/2 of the gain from trade of the omniscient oracle that knows in advance the actual realized traders' valuations.</description>

      <title>Comparing regularisation paths of (conjugate) gradient estimators in ridge regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider standard gradient descent, gradient flow and conjugate gradients as iterative algorithms for minimizing a penalized ridge criterion in linear regression. While it is well known that conjugate gradients exhibit fast numerical convergence, the statistical properties of their iterates are more difficult to assess due to inherent nonlinearities and dependencies. On the other hand, standard gradient flow is a linear method with well known regularizing properties when stopped early. By an explicit non-standard error decomposition we are able to bound the prediction error for conjugate gradient iterates by a corresponding prediction error of gradient flow at transformed iteration indices. This way, the risk along the entire regularisation path of conjugate gradient iterations can be compared to that for regularisation paths of standard linear methods like gradient flow and ridge regression. In particular, the oracle conjugate gradient iterate shares the optimality properties of the gradient flow and ridge regression oracles up to a constant factor. Numerical examples show the similarity of the regularisation paths in practice.</description>

      <title>Double Machine Learning Methods for Estimating Average Treatment Effects: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10969v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observational cohort studies are increasingly being used for comparative effectiveness research to assess the safety of therapeutics. Recently, various doubly robust methods have been proposed for average treatment effect estimation by combining the treatment model and the outcome model via different vehicles, such as matching, weighting, and regression. The key advantage of doubly robust estimators is that they require either the treatment model or the outcome model to be correctly specified to obtain a consistent estimator of average treatment effects, and therefore lead to a more accurate and often more precise inference. However, little work has been done to understand how doubly robust estimators differ due to their unique strategies of using the treatment and outcome models and how machine learning techniques can be combined to boost their performance, which we call double machine learning estimators. Here we examine multiple popular doubly robust methods and compare their performance using different treatment and outcome modeling via extensive simulations and a real-world application. We found that incorporating machine learning with doubly robust estimators such as the targeted maximum likelihood estimator gives the best overall performance. Practical guidance on how to apply doubly robust estimators is provided.</description>

      <title>Learning time-scales in two-layers neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00055v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based learning in multi-layer neural networks displays a number of striking features. In particular, the decrease rate of empirical risk is non-monotone even after averaging over large batches. Long plateaus in which one observes barely any progress alternate with intervals of rapid decrease. These successive phases of learning often take place on very different time scales. Finally, models learnt in an early phase are typically `simpler' or `easier to learn' although in a way that is difficult to formalize.
  Although theoretical explanations of these phenomena have been put forward, each of them captures at best certain specific regimes. In this paper, we study the gradient flow dynamics of a wide two-layer neural network in high-dimension, when data are distributed according to a single-index model (i.e., the target function depends on a one-dimensional projection of the covariates). Based on a mixture of new rigorous results, non-rigorous mathematical derivations, and numerical simulations, we propose a scenario for the learning dynamics in this setting. In particular, the proposed evolution exhibits separation of timescales and intermittency. These behaviors arise naturally because the population gradient flow can be recast as a singularly perturbed dynamical system.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses second-order stochastic optimization for estimating the minimizer of a convex function written as an expectation. A direct recursive estimation technique for the inverse Hessian matrix using a Robbins-Monro procedure is introduced. This approach enables to drastically reduces computational complexity. Above all, it allows to develop universal stochastic Newton methods and investigate the asymptotic efficiency of the proposed approach. This work so expands the application scope of secondorder algorithms in stochastic optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The missing mass refers to the proportion of data points in an unknown population of classifier inputs that belong to classes not present in the classifier's training data, which is assumed to be a random sample from that unknown population. We find that in expectation the missing mass is entirely determined by the number $f_k$ of classes that do appear in the training data the same number of times and an exponentially decaying error. While this is the first precise characterization of the expected missing mass in terms of the sample, the induced estimator suffers from an impractically high variance. However, our theory suggests a large search space of nearly unbiased estimators that can be searched effectively and efficiently. Hence, we cast distribution-free estimation as an optimization problem to find a distribution-specific estimator with a minimized mean-squared error (MSE), given only the sample. In our experiments, our search algorithm discovers estimators that have a substantially smaller MSE than the state-of-the-art Good-Turing estimator. This holds for over 93% of runs when there are at least as many samples as classes. Our estimators' MSE is roughly 80% of the Good-Turing estimator's.</description>

      <title>Fourier Circuits in Neural Networks and Transformers: A Case Study of Modular Arithmetic with Multiple Inputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09469v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of machine learning, a pivotal challenge lies in deciphering the internal representations harnessed by neural networks and Transformers. Building on recent progress toward comprehending how networks execute distinct target functions, our study embarks on an exploration of the underlying reasons behind networks adopting specific computational strategies. We direct our focus to the complex algebraic learning task of modular addition involving $k$ inputs. Our research presents a thorough analytical characterization of the features learned by stylized one-hidden layer neural networks and one-layer Transformers in addressing this task. A cornerstone of our theoretical framework is the elucidation of how the principle of margin maximization shapes the features adopted by one-hidden layer neural networks. Let $p$ denote the modulus, $D_p$ denote the dataset of modular arithmetic with $k$ inputs and $m$ denote the network width. We demonstrate that a neuron count of $ m \geq 2^{2k-2} \cdot (p-1) $, these networks attain a maximum $ L_{2,k+1} $-margin on the dataset $ D_p $. Furthermore, we establish that each hidden-layer neuron aligns with a specific Fourier spectrum, integral to solving modular addition problems. By correlating our findings with the empirical observations of similar studies, we contribute to a deeper comprehension of the intrinsic computational mechanisms of neural networks. Furthermore, we observe similar computational mechanisms in attention matrices of one-layer Transformers. Our work stands as a significant stride in unraveling their operation complexities, particularly in the realm of complex algebraic tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been extensively used in various real-world applications. However, the predictive uncertainty of GNNs stemming from diverse sources such as inherent randomness in data and model training errors can lead to unstable and erroneous predictions. Therefore, identifying, quantifying, and utilizing uncertainty are essential to enhance the performance of the model for the downstream tasks as well as the reliability of the GNN predictions. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the GNNs from the perspective of uncertainty with an emphasis on its integration in graph learning. We compare and summarize existing graph uncertainty theory and methods, alongside the corresponding downstream tasks. Thereby, we bridge the gap between theory and practice, meanwhile connecting different GNN communities. Moreover, our work provides valuable insights into promising directions in this field.</description>

      <title>Length-Controlled AlpacaEval: A Simple Way to Debias Automatic Evaluators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-based auto-annotators have become a key component of the LLM development process due to their cost-effectiveness and scalability compared to human-based evaluation. However, these auto-annotators can introduce biases that are hard to remove. Even simple, known confounders such as preference for longer outputs remain in existing automated evaluation metrics. We propose a simple regression analysis approach for controlling biases in auto-evaluations. As a real case study, we focus on reducing the length bias of AlpacaEval, a fast and affordable benchmark for instruction-tuned LLMs that uses LLMs to estimate response quality. Despite being highly correlated with human preferences, AlpacaEval is known to favor models that generate longer outputs. We introduce a length-controlled AlpacaEval that aims to answer the counterfactual question: "What would the preference be if the model's and baseline's output had the same length?" To achieve this, we first fit a generalized linear model to predict the biased auto-annotator's preferences based on the mediators we want to control for (length difference) and other relevant features. We then obtain length-controlled preferences by predicting preferences while conditioning the GLM with a zero difference in lengths. Length-controlling not only improves the robustness of the metric to manipulations in model verbosity, but we also find that it increases the Spearman correlation with LMSYS Chatbot Arena from 0.94 to 0.98.</description>

      <title>MGDA Converges under Generalized Smoothness, Provably</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19440v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization (MOO) is receiving more attention in various fields such as multi-task learning. Recent works provide some effective algorithms with theoretical analysis but they are limited by the standard $L$-smooth or bounded-gradient assumptions, which typically do not hold for neural networks, such as Long short-term memory (LSTM) models and Transformers. In this paper, we study a more general and realistic class of generalized $\ell$-smooth loss functions, where $\ell$ is a general non-decreasing function of gradient norm. We revisit and analyze the fundamental multiple gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) and its stochastic version with double sampling for solving the generalized $\ell$-smooth MOO problems, which approximate the conflict-avoidant (CA) direction that maximizes the minimum improvement among objectives. We provide a comprehensive convergence analysis of these algorithms and show that they converge to an $\epsilon$-accurate Pareto stationary point with a guaranteed $\epsilon$-level average CA distance (i.e., the gap between the updating direction and the CA direction) over all iterations, where totally $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ samples are needed for deterministic and stochastic settings, respectively. We prove that they can also guarantee a tighter $\epsilon$-level CA distance in each iteration using more samples. Moreover, we analyze an efficient variant of MGDA named MGDA-FA using only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and space, while achieving the same performance guarantee as MGDA.</description>

      <title>Linear Contracts in Multitasking: Robustness, Uniformity, and Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the multitasking principal-agent problem. The agent performs several task for the principal, and the principal posts a contract incentivizing the agent to exert effort. The principal can observe a signal for each task, and the contract is a mapping from the space of possible signals to a payment. We study the special class of linear contracts from three perspectives: robustness, uniformity, and learning. Firstly, we show a robustness result: in an ambiguous setting when only first moment information is known, there is a linear contract maximizing the principal's payoff in a worst-case scenario. Secondly, we show a uniformity result: when the agent's cost function is homogeneous to a certain degree and the the principal's utility takes a linear form across tasks, then the optimal contract depends on the agent's cost function only through its homogeneuity degree. Thirdly, we study the problem of learning an optimal linear contract through observational data. We identify this as an measurement error model, and propose instrumental regression methods to estimate the optimal contract parameters in an offline setting, or to learn the optimal contract in an online setting.</description>

      <title>Learning in Feature Spaces via Coupled Covariances: Asymmetric Kernel SVD and Nystr\"om method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contrast with Mercer kernel-based approaches as used e.g., in Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA), it was previously shown that Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) inherently relates to asymmetric kernels and Asymmetric Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD) has been proposed. However, the existing formulation to KSVD cannot work with infinite-dimensional feature mappings, the variational objective can be unbounded, and needs further numerical evaluation and exploration towards machine learning. In this work, i) we introduce a new asymmetric learning paradigm based on coupled covariance eigenproblem (CCE) through covariance operators, allowing infinite-dimensional feature maps. The solution to CCE is ultimately obtained from the SVD of the induced asymmetric kernel matrix, providing links to KSVD. ii) Starting from the integral equations corresponding to a pair of coupled adjoint eigenfunctions, we formalize the asymmetric Nystr\"om method through a finite sample approximation to speed up training. iii) We provide the first empirical evaluations verifying the practical utility and benefits of KSVD and compare with methods resorting to symmetrization or linear SVD across multiple tasks.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-tolerant distributed learning of finite mixture models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional statistical methods need to be updated to work with modern distributed data storage paradigms. A common approach is the split-and-conquer framework, which involves learning models on local machines and averaging their parameter estimates. However, this does not work for the important problem of learning finite mixture models, because subpopulation indices on each local machine may be arbitrarily permuted (the "label switching problem"). Zhang and Chen (2022) proposed Mixture Reduction (MR) to address this issue, but MR remains vulnerable to Byzantine failure, whereby a fraction of local machines may transmit arbitrarily erroneous information. This paper introduces Distance Filtered Mixture Reduction (DFMR), a Byzantine tolerant adaptation of MR that is both computationally efficient and statistically sound. DFMR leverages the densities of local estimates to construct a robust filtering mechanism. By analysing the pairwise L2 distances between local estimates, DFMR identifies and removes severely corrupted local estimates while retaining the majority of uncorrupted ones. We provide theoretical justification for DFMR, proving its optimal convergence rate and asymptotic equivalence to the global maximum likelihood estimate under standard assumptions. Numerical experiments on simulated and real-world data validate the effectiveness of DFMR in achieving robust and accurate aggregation in the presence of Byzantine failure.</description>

      <title>Joint Graph Rewiring and Feature Denoising via Spectral Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When learning from graph data, the graph and the node features both give noisy information about the node labels. In this paper we propose an algorithm to jointly denoise the features and rewire the graph (JDR), which improves the performance of downstream node classification graph neural nets (GNNs). JDR works by aligning the leading spectral spaces of graph and feature matrices. It approximately solves the associated non-convex optimization problem in a way that handles graphs with multiple classes and different levels of homophily or heterophily. We theoretically justify JDR in a stylized setting and show that it consistently outperforms existing rewiring methods on a wide range of synthetic and real-world node classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Neural Spacetimes for DAG Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a class of trainable deep learning-based geometries called Neural Spacetimes (NSTs), which can universally represent nodes in weighted directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as events in a spacetime manifold. While most works in the literature focus on undirected graph representation learning or causality embedding separately, our differentiable geometry can encode both graph edge weights in its spatial dimensions and causality in the form of edge directionality in its temporal dimensions. We use a product manifold that combines a quasi-metric (for space) and a partial order (for time). NSTs are implemented as three neural networks trained in an end-to-end manner: an embedding network, which learns to optimize the location of nodes as events in the spacetime manifold, and two other networks that optimize the space and time geometries in parallel, which we call a neural (quasi-)metric and a neural partial order, respectively. The latter two networks leverage recent ideas at the intersection of fractal geometry and deep learning to shape the geometry of the representation space in a data-driven fashion, unlike other works in the literature that use fixed spacetime manifolds such as Minkowski space or De Sitter space to embed DAGs. Our main theoretical guarantee is a universal embedding theorem, showing that any $k$-point DAG can be embedded into an NST with $1+\mathcal{O}(\log(k))$ distortion while exactly preserving its causal structure. The total number of parameters defining the NST is sub-cubic in $k$ and linear in the width of the DAG. If the DAG has a planar Hasse diagram, this is improved to $\mathcal{O}(\log(k)) + 2)$ spatial and 2 temporal dimensions. We validate our framework computationally with synthetic weighted DAGs and real-world network embeddings; in both cases, the NSTs achieve lower embedding distortions than their counterparts using fixed spacetime geometries.</description>

      <title>ESG Rating Disagreement and Corporate Total Factor Productivity:Inference and Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13895v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines how ESG rating disagreement (Dis) affects corporate total factor productivity (TFP) in China based on data of A-share listed companies from 2015 to 2022. We find that Dis reduces TFP, especially in state-owned, non-capital-intensive, low-pollution and high-tech firms, green innovation strengthens the dampening effect of Dis on TFP, and that Dis lowers corporate TFP by increasing financing constraints and weakening human capital. Furthermore, XGBoost regression demonstrates that Dis plays a significant role in predicting TFP, with SHAP showing that the dampening effect of ESG rating disagreement on TFP is still pronounced in firms with large Dis values.</description>

      <title>Function-Space MCMC for Bayesian Wide Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14325v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks represent a fascinating confluence of deep learning and probabilistic reasoning, offering a compelling framework for understanding uncertainty in complex predictive models. In this paper, we investigate the use of the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson algorithm and its Langevin version to sample from a reparametrised posterior distribution of the neural network's weights, as the widths grow larger. In addition to being robust in the infinite-dimensional setting, we prove that the acceptance probabilities of the proposed algorithms approach 1 as the width of the network increases, independently of any stepsize tuning. Moreover, we examine and compare how the mixing speeds of the underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo, the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson and the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin samplers are influenced by changes in the network width in some real-world cases. Our findings suggest that, in wide Bayesian Neural Networks configurations, the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson algorithm allows for a scalable and more efficient sampling of the reparametrised posterior distribution, as also evidenced by a higher effective sample size and improved diagnostic results compared with the other analysed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Improving Pretraining Data Using Perplexity Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quality pretraining data is often seen as the key to high-performance language models. However, progress in understanding pretraining data has been slow due to the costly pretraining runs required for data selection experiments. We present a framework that avoids these costs and selects high-quality pretraining data without any LLM training of our own. Our work is based on a simple observation: LLM losses on many pretraining texts are correlated with downstream benchmark performance, and selecting high-correlation documents is an effective pretraining data selection method. We build a new statistical framework for data selection centered around estimates of perplexity-benchmark correlations and perform data selection using a sample of 90 LLMs taken from the Open LLM Leaderboard on texts from tens of thousands of web domains. In controlled pretraining experiments at the 160M parameter scale on 8 benchmarks, our approach outperforms DSIR on every benchmark, while matching the best data selector found in DataComp-LM, a hand-engineered bigram classifier. We have now also updated this paper to include results from preregistered experiments with new pretraining data on an aggregation of 22 benchmarks up to the 1.4B scale, showing increasing improvements of our method over others with more scale.

      <title>Upsample or Upweight? Balanced Training on Heavily Imbalanced Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04579v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data abundance across different domains exhibits a long-tailed distribution: few domains have abundant data, while most face data scarcity. Our work focuses on a multilingual setting, where available data is heavily skewed towards high-resource languages. Two common strategies to address this disparity are upsampling low-resource data (Temperature Sampling) and upweighting low-resource loss (Scalarization). These methods are often assumed to be equivalent, but this equivalence has not been rigorously established, prompting our investigation.
  Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify when these two methods are equivalent and when they diverge. We prove that they are equivalent under full gradient descent but differ under stochastic gradient descent due to differences in gradient variance. Specifically, Temperature Sampling exhibits lower variance in gradient estimation compared to Scalarization, leading to faster convergence but a higher risk of overfitting. Based on these insights, we propose Cooldown, a strategy that starts by heavily upsampling low-resource languages to accelerate convergence and gradually reduces the upsampling to prevent overfitting -- achieving the best of both worlds. Our method competes effectively with existing data re-weighting techniques while offering computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Machine Learning Approaches for Detecting Deceptive Activities on Social Media: Methods, Challenges, and Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20293v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have facilitated the spread of misinformation, necessitating automated detection systems. This systematic review evaluates 36 studies that apply machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to detect fake news, spam, and fake accounts on social media. Using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST), the review identified key biases across the ML lifecycle: selection bias due to non-representative sampling, inadequate handling of class imbalance, insufficient linguistic preprocessing (e.g., negations), and inconsistent hyperparameter tuning. Although models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks showed strong potential, over-reliance on accuracy as an evaluation metric in imbalanced data settings was a common flaw. The review highlights the need for improved data preprocessing (e.g., resampling techniques), consistent hyperparameter tuning, and the use of appropriate metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and AUROC. Addressing these limitations can lead to more reliable and generalizable ML/DL models for detecting deceptive content, ultimately contributing to the reduction of misinformation on social media.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Posterior Samples for Bayesian Optimization via Rootfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization devolves the global optimization of a costly objective function to the global optimization of a sequence of acquisition functions. This inner-loop optimization can be catastrophically difficult if it involves posterior sample paths, especially in higher dimensions. We introduce an efficient global optimization strategy for posterior samples based on global rootfinding. It provides gradient-based optimizers with two sets of judiciously selected starting points, designed to combine exploration and exploitation. The number of starting points can be kept small without sacrificing optimization quality. Remarkably, even with just one point from each set, the global optimum is discovered most of the time. The algorithm scales practically linearly to high dimensions, breaking the curse of dimensionality. For Gaussian process Thompson sampling (GP-TS), we demonstrate remarkable improvement in both inner- and outer-loop optimization, surprisingly outperforming alternatives like EI and GP-UCB in most cases. Our approach also improves the performance of other posterior sample-based acquisition functions, such as variants of entropy search. Furthermore, we propose a sample-average formulation of GP-TS, which has a parameter to explicitly control exploitation and can be computed at the cost of one posterior sample. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/UQUH/TSRoots .</description>

      <title>Integrating Dual Prototypes for Task-Wise Adaption in Pre-Trained Model-Based Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to acquire new classes while conserving historical knowledge incrementally. Despite existing pre-trained model (PTM) based methods performing excellently in CIL, it is better to fine-tune them on downstream incremental tasks with massive patterns unknown to PTMs. However, using task streams for fine-tuning could lead to catastrophic forgetting that will erase the knowledge in PTMs. This paper proposes the Dual Prototype network for Task-wise Adaption (DPTA) of PTM-based CIL. For each incremental learning task, a task-wise adapter module is built to fine-tune the PTM, where the center-adapt loss forces the representation to be more centrally clustered and class separable. The dual prototype network improves the prediction process by enabling test-time adapter selection, where the raw prototypes deduce several possible task indexes of test samples to select suitable adapter modules for PTM, and the augmented prototypes that could separate highly correlated classes are utilized to determine the final result. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DPTA. The code will be open-sourced after the paper is published.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been a go-to algorithm for nonconvex stochastic optimization problems arising in machine learning. Its theory however often requires a strong framework to guarantee convergence properties. We hereby present a full scope convergence study of biased nonconvex SGD, including weak convergence, function-value convergence and global convergence, and also provide subsequent convergence rates and complexities, all under relatively mild conditions in comparison with literature.</description>

      <title>A Causal World Model Underlying Next Token Prediction in GPT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Are generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models only trained to predict the next token, or do they implicitly learn a world model from which a sequence is generated one token at a time? We examine this question by deriving a causal interpretation of the attention mechanism in GPT, and suggesting a causal world model that arises from this interpretation. Furthermore, we propose that GPT-models, at inference time, can be utilized for zero-shot causal structure learning for in-distribution sequences. Empirical evaluation is conducted in a controlled synthetic environment using the setup and rules of the Othello board game. A GPT, pre-trained on real-world games played with the intention of winning, is tested on synthetic data that only adheres to the game rules, oblivious to the goal of winning. We find that the GPT model is likely to generate moves that adhere to the game rules for sequences for which a causal structure is encoded in the attention mechanism with high confidence. In general, in cases for which the GPT model generates moves that do not adhere to the game rules, it also fails to capture any causal structure.</description>

      <title>Treatment Effect Estimation for Graph-Structured Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Treatment effect estimation, which helps understand the causality between treatment and outcome variable, is a central task in decision-making across various domains. While most studies focus on treatment effect estimation on individual targets, in specific contexts, there is a necessity to comprehend the treatment effect on a group of targets, especially those that have relationships represented as a graph structure between them. In such cases, the focus of treatment assignment is prone to depend on a particular node of the graph, such as the one with the highest degree, thus resulting in an observational bias from a small part of the entire graph. Whereas a bias tends to be caused by the small part, straightforward extensions of previous studies cannot provide efficient bias mitigation owing to the use of the entire graph information. In this study, we propose Graph-target Treatment Effect Estimation (GraphTEE), a framework designed to estimate treatment effects specifically on graph-structured targets. GraphTEE aims to mitigate observational bias by focusing on confounding variable sets and consider a new regularization framework. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis on how GraphTEE performs better in terms of bias mitigation. Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Extragradient-Type Methods -- Part 2: Generalization and Sublinear Convergence Rates under Co-Hypomonotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the first part of our project, this paper comprehensively studies two types of extragradient-based methods: anchored extragradient and Nesterov's accelerated extragradient for solving [non]linear inclusions (and, in particular, equations), primarily under the Lipschitz continuity and the co-hypomonotonicity assumptions. We unify and generalize a class of anchored extragradient methods for monotone inclusions to a wider range of schemes encompassing existing algorithms as special cases. We establish $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ last-iterate convergence rates on the residual norm of the underlying mapping for this general framework and then specialize it to obtain convergence guarantees for specific instances, where $k$ denotes the iteration counter. We extend our approach to a class of anchored Tseng's forward-backward-forward splitting methods to obtain a broader class of algorithms for solving co-hypomonotone inclusions. Again, we analyze $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ last-iterate convergence rates for this general scheme and specialize it to obtain convergence results for existing and new variants. We generalize and unify Nesterov's accelerated extra-gradient method to a new class of algorithms that covers existing schemes as special instances while generating new variants. For these schemes, we can prove $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ last-iterate convergence rates for the residual norm under co-hypomonotonicity, covering a class of nonmonotone problems. We propose another novel class of Nesterov's accelerated extragradient methods to solve inclusions. Interestingly, these algorithms achieve both $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ and $o(1/k)$ last-iterate convergence rates, and also the convergence of iterate sequences under co-hypomonotonicity and Lipschitz continuity. Finally, we provide a set of numerical experiments encompassing different scenarios to validate our algorithms and theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>A Step Toward Interpretability: Smearing the Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of interpretability of machine learning architecture in particle physics has no agreed-upon definition, much less any proposed solution. We present a first modest step toward these goals by proposing a definition and corresponding practical method for isolation and identification of relevant physical energy scales exploited by the machine. This is accomplished by smearing or averaging over all input events that lie within a prescribed metric energy distance of one another and correspondingly renders any quantity measured on a finite, discrete dataset continuous over the dataspace. Within this approach, we are able to explicitly demonstrate that (approximate) scaling laws are a consequence of extreme value theory applied to analysis of the distribution of the irreducible minimal distance over which a machine must extrapolate given a finite dataset. As an example, we study quark versus gluon jet identification, construct the smeared likelihood, and show that discrimination power steadily increases as resolution decreases, indicating that the true likelihood for the problem is sensitive to emissions at all scales.</description>

      <title>Derivation of Output Correlation Inferences for Multi-Output (aka Multi-Task) Gaussian Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) is arguably one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms in practice. One of its prominent applications is Bayesian optimization (BO). Although the vanilla GP itself is already a powerful tool for BO, it is often beneficial to be able to consider the dependencies of multiple outputs. To do so, Multi-task GP (MTGP) is formulated, but it is not trivial to fully understand the derivations of its formulations and their gradients from the previous literature. This paper serves friendly derivations of the MTGP formulations and their gradients.</description>

      <title>Posterior SBC: Simulation-Based Calibration Checking Conditional on Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based calibration checking (SBC) refers to the validation of an inference algorithm and model implementation through repeated inference on data simulated from a generative model. In the original and commonly used approach, the generative model uses parameters drawn from the prior, and thus the approach is testing whether the inference works for simulated data generated with parameter values plausible under that prior. This approach is natural and desirable when we want to test whether the inference works for a wide range of datasets we might observe. However, after observing data, we are interested in answering whether the inference works conditional on that particular data. In this paper, we propose posterior SBC and demonstrate how it can be used to validate the inference conditionally on observed data. We illustrate the utility of posterior SBC in three case studies: (1) A simple multilevel model; (2) a model that is governed by differential equations; and (3) a joint integrative neuroscience model which is approximated via amortized Bayesian inference with neural networks.</description>

      <title>LEWIS (LayEr WIse Sparsity) -- A Training Free Guided Model Merging Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As specialized large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, model merging methods are being used to combine them to create a single multi-task model without requiring any additional data or training. However, these approaches fall short when the objective of merging is to increase the downstream model's performance on a particular task-specific benchmark. In this work, we propose LEWIS (Layer Wise Sparsity), a guided model-merging framework that uses activation-based layer importance to dynamically adjust layer-wise task-vector sparsity required for the merge process. LEWIS uses a calibration dataset to prioritize critical layers during the task-vector pruning process required for model merging. This approach guides existing merging methods by preserving essential layer-wise task-specific knowledge while ensuring the merged model performs the best at benchmarks resembling the calibration dataset. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LEWIS with performance improvements of code instruction-following and math-solving models created through model merging up to 4 percent and 11.3 percent, respectively, outperforming unguided data-less model merging approaches that use uniform-sparsity.</description>
