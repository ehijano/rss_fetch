      <title>Compact Moduli Spaces of Marked Cubic Plane Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study compactifications of the moduli space of a plane cubic curve marked by \(n\) labeled points up to projective equivalence via Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT). Specifically, we provide a complete description of the GIT walls and show that the moduli-theoretic wall-crossing can be understood through analysis of the singularities of the plane curves and the position of the points.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of twisted maps to smooth pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study moduli spaces of twisted maps to a smooth pair in arbitrary genus, and give geometric explanations for previously known comparisons between orbifold and logarithmic Gromov--Witten invariants. Namely, we study the space of twisted maps to the universal target and classify its irreducible components in terms of combinatorial/tropical information. We also introduce natural morphisms between these moduli spaces for different rooting parameters and compute their degree on various strata. Combining this with additional hypotheses on the discrete data, we show these degrees are monomial of degree between $0$ and $\max(0,2g-1)$ in the rooting parameter. We discuss the virtual theory of the moduli spaces, and relate our polynomiality results to work of Tseng and You on the higher genus orbifold Gromov--Witten invariants of smooth pairs, recovering their results in genus $1$. We discuss what is needed to deduce arbitrary genus comparison results using the previous sections. We conclude with some geometric examples, starting by re-framing the original genus $1$ example of Maulik in this new formalism.</description>

      <title>Remark to a Theorem of van Geemen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [ Ge], Bert van Geemen computed the dimension of the space of the fourth power of the theta nullwerte.
  In [SM2], it has been observe that all linear relations between the $\theta_m^4$ are consequences of the quartic Riemann relations.
  In this note, we want to give a new proof of these result and extend them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the space of stability conditions on the total space of the canonical line bundle over the three dimensional projective space. We construct a family of geometric stability conditions and some subset of the boudary of them, which are algebraic. We also use spherical twists to construct some other stability conditions.</description>

      <title>Brieskorn-Pham singularities via ACM bundles on Geigle-Lenzing projective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the singularity category of the Brieskorn-Pham singularity $R=k[X_1, \dots, X_4]/(\sum_{i=1}^{4} X_i^{p_i})$, associated with the Geigle-Lenzing projective space $\mathbb{X}$ of weight quadruple $(p_1,\dots, p_4)$, by investigating the stable category $\underline{\mathsf{ACM}} \, \mathbb{X}$ of arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay bundles on $\mathbb{X}$.
  We introduce the notion of $2$-extension bundles on $\mathbb{X}$, which is a higher dimensional analog of extension bundles on a weighted projective line of Geigle-Lenzing, and then establish a correspondence between $2$-extension bundles and a certain important class of Cohen-Macaulay $R$-modules studied by Herschend-Iyama-Minamoto-Oppermann. Furthermore, we construct a tilting object in $\underline{\mathsf{ACM}} \, \mathbb{X}$ consisting of $2$-extension bundles, whose endomorphism algebra is a $4$-fold tensor product of certain Nakayama algebras. We also investigate the Picard group action on $2$-extension bundles and obtain an explicit formula for the orbit number, which gives a positive answer to a higher version of an open question raised by Kussin-Lenzing-Meltzer.</description>

      <title>Working with weighted Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modified construction of a weighted generalised Grassmannian, which includes all weighted projective spaces as its special case. For a weighted Grassmannian (i.e., for series A) we obtain an explicit parametrisation of possible $\mathbb{Z}$-gradings on Pl\"{u}cker coordinates, and provide the explicit formulae for its dualising sheaf and Hilbert series in terms of this parametrisation. We expect that our approach can be generalised to other irreducible root systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using methods of stable homotopy theory, the category of symmetric quasi-coherent sheaves associated with non-commutative graded algebras with extra symmetries is introduced and studied in this paper. It is shown to be a closed symmetric monoidal Grothendieck category with invertible generators. It is proven that the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a projective scheme is recovered out of symmetric quasi-coherent sheaves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Shavel type surfaces are fake quadrics of even type which are not Mori dream surfaces, yet there are infinitely many primes $p$ such that the reduction modulo $p$ is a Mori dream surface.
  We investigate fake quadrics, first concerning the property of being Mori dream surfaces, then we try to determine which surfaces isogenous to a product are fake quadrics of even type.</description>

      <title>Moduli of curves and moduli of sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relationships between moduli spaces of curves and sheaves on 3-folds are presented starting with the Gromov-Witten/Donaldson-Thomas correspondence proposed more than 20 years ago with D. Maulik, N. Nekrasov, and A. Okounkov. The descendent and relative correspondences as developed with A. Pixton in the context of stable pairs led to the proof of the correspondence for the Calabi-Yau quintic 3-fold. More recently, the study of correspondences in families has played an important role in connection with other basic moduli problems in algebraic geometry. The full conjectural framework is presented here in the context of families of 3-folds. This article accompanies my lecture at the ICBS in July 2024.</description>

      <title>Characterization of linear spaces of matrices of constant rank from syzygy bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we characterize matrices of linear forms and constant rank, demonstrating that, under some natural assumptions, they are always associated with a syzygy bundle that fits into a (partially linear) resolution. Furthermore, our construction offers a new perspective that unifies the approaches used in known examples from the literature and enables the creation of new ones, as well as to list all indecomposable matrices of constant rank up to 7.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any base scheme $S$, real \'etale motivic (unstable) homotopy theory over $S$ coincides with unstable semialgebraic topology over $S$ (that is, sheaves of spaces on the real spectrum of $S$). Moreover we show that for pointed connected motivic spaces over $S$, the real \'etale motivic localization is given by smashing with the telescope of the map $\rho: S^0 \to {\mathbb G}_m$.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to deforming space curves lying on a del Pezzo surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the deformations of space curves $C \subset \mathbb P^4$, assuming that they are contained in a smooth complete intersection $S_{2,2} \subset \mathbb P^4$, i.e., a smooth del Pezzo surface of degree $4$. We give sufficient conditions for $C$ to be (un)obstructed in terms of the degree $d$ and the genus $g$ of $C$. We prove that if $d&gt;8$, $g\ge 2d-12$, and $h^1(C,\mathcal I_C(2))=1$, then $C$ is obstructed and stably degenerate, i.e., $C$ has some first order infinitesimal deformations in $\mathbb P^4$ not contained in any deformations of $S_{2,2}$ in $\mathbb P^4$, but they do not lift to any global deformations. (As a result, every global deformation of $C$ in $\mathbb P^4$ is contained in a deformation of $S_{2,2}$ in $\mathbb P^4$.) As an application, we construct infinitely many examples of irreducible components of the Hilbert scheme $\operatorname{Hilb}^{sc} \mathbb P^4$ of smooth connected curves in $\mathbb P^4$, along which $\operatorname{Hilb}^{sc} \mathbb P^4$ is generically non-reduced. In the case $d=14$ and $g=16$, we obtain a non-reduced component of $\operatorname{Hilb}^{sc} \mathbb P^4$ of dimension $55$ with $\dim T_{\operatorname{Hilb}^{sc} \mathbb P^4}=57$, analogous to Mumford's example of a non-reduced component of $\operatorname{Hilb}^{sc} \mathbb P^3$, whose general member is contained in a smooth cubic surface $S_3 \subset \mathbb P^3$.</description>

      <title>Components and codimension of mixed and $\mathscr{A}$-discriminants for square polynomial systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discriminant of a multivariate polynomial with indeterminate coefficients is not necessarily a hypersurface, and characterizing its codimension was an open problem for quite a while. We resolve this problem for discriminants of square and overdetermined systems of equations. This version is more involved, in the sense that the discriminant may have several components of different dimension. We enumerate all components and find their dimension and degree, for each of the three conventional ways to formalize the notion of the discriminant in this setting (namely, for mixed, Cayley and $\mathscr{A}$-discriminants).</description>

      <title>Geometry of genus sixteen K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized K3 surfaces of genus sixteen have a Mukai vector bundle of rank two. We study the geometry of the projectivization of this bundle. We prove that it has an embedding in $\mathbb{P}_9$ with an ideal generated by quadrics. We give an effective method to compute these quadrics from a general choice in Mukai's unirationalization of the moduli space. This linear system gives a double cover of $\mathbb{P}_9$ ramified on a degree $10$ hypersurface. It gives relative Weddle/Kummer surfaces over a Peskine variety associated to an explicit trivector. This work is also motivated by hyperk\"ahler geometry and Debarre-Voisin varieties. Oberdieck showed that the Hilbert square of a general K3-surface of genus $16$ is a Debarre-Voisin variety for some trivector. We start to investigate the relationship between these two trivectors.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Seshadri stratifications on normal toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the theory of Seshadri stratifications to embedded toric varieties $X_P\subseteq \mathbb P(V)$ associated with a normal lattice polytope $P$. The approach presented here is purely combinatorial and completely independent of \cite{CFL}. In particular, we get a close connection between a certain class of triangulations of the polytope $P$, Seshadri stratifications of $X_P$ arising from torus orbit closures, and the associated degenerate semi-toric varieties. In the last section we show that the approach here and the one in \cite{CFL} produce the same quasi-valuations and hence the same degenerations of $X_P$.</description>

      <title>Chern Classes of Open Projected Richardson Varieties and of Affine Schubert Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The open projected Richardson varieties form a stratification for the partial flag variety $G/P$. We compare the Segre--MacPherson classes of open projected Richardson varieties with those of the corresponding affine Schubert cells by pushing or pulling these classes to the affine Grassmannian. In the case of the Grassmannian $G/P=\operatorname{Gr}_k(\mathbb{C}^n)$, the open projected Richardson varieties are known as open positroid varieties. We obtain symmetric functions that represent the Segre--MacPherson classes of these open positroid varieties, constructed explicitly in terms of pipe dreams for affine permutations.</description>

Abstract: In 1969, Fulton introduced classical Hurwitz spaces parametrizing simple d-sheeted coverings of the projective line in the algebro-geometric setting. He established the irreducibility of these spaces under the assumption that the characteristic of the ground field is greater than d, but the irreducibility problem in smaller characteristics remained open. We resolve this problem in the current paper and prove that the classical Hurwitz spaces are irreducible over any algebraically closed field. On the way, we establish the irreducibility of Severi varieties in arbitrary characteristic for a rich class of toric surfaces, including all classical toric surfaces. Our approach to the irreducibility problems comes from tropical geometry, and the paper contains two more results of independent interest - a lifting result for parametrized tropical curves and a strong connectedness property of the moduli spaces of parametrized tropical curves.</description>

Abstract: Li, Mantovan, Pries, and Tang proved the existence of supersingular curves over Fpbar in each of the special families of curves in Moonen's classification. Their proof does not provide defining equations of these curves.

      <title>On functoriality of Baum-Bott residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the functoriality of Baum--Bott residues under certain conditions. As an application, we show that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a holomorphic foliation, of dimension $k$, on a (possibly non-compact) complex manifold $X$ of dimension $n$, then its singular set $Sing(\mathcal{F})$ has dimension $ \geq \min\{ k - 1,n-k-1\}$. In particular, if $k\leq n/2$, then $\dim(Sing(\mathcal{F}))\geq k-1$. This provides answers to questions posed by Cerveau and Lins Neto concerning foliations of dimension 2 in $\mathbb{C}^4$ and Druel regarding holomorphic foliations on projective manifolds. Furthermore, it confirms the Beauville--Bondal conjecture for the maximal degeneracy locus of Poisson structures. Specifically, if $X$ is a (possibly non-compact) complex Poisson manifold with generic rank $r \leq n/2$, and the degeneracy locus $ X \setminus X_r$ is non-empty, then it contains a component of dimension $ &gt; r - 2$.</description>

Abstract: Following a method introduced by Thomas-Vasquez and developed by Grundman, we prove that many Hilbert modular threefolds of arithmetic genus $0$ and $1$ are of general type, and that some are of nonnegative Kodaira dimension. The new ingredient is a detailed study of the geometry and combinatorics of totally positive integral elements $x$ of a fractional ideal $I$ in a totally real number field $K$ with the property that $\mathop{\mathrm{tr}} xy &lt; \mathop{\mathrm{min}} I \mathop{\mathrm{tr}} y$ for some $y \gg 0 \in K$.</description>

      <title>Constructing stable Hilbert bundles via Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On any complex smooth projective curve with positive genus, we construct Hilbert bundles that admit Hermitian--Einstein metrics. Our main constructive step is by investigating the arithmetic property of the upper half plane in Bridgeland's definition of stability conditions and its homological countparts.
  The main analytic ingredient in our proof is a notion called a geometrically well-approximable pair $(X,\theta)$. This notion compares a constant $L(X)$ that can be bounded by the geometric information of the Riemann surface $X$ with a constant $L_0(\theta)$ that depends only on the arithmetic information of the irrational number $\theta$. This notion helps us to apply the Diophantine approximation to Donaldson's functional.
  We further study the continuous structures, smooth structures, and holomorphic structures on such Hilbert bundles. We hope that this construction can shed some new light on the geometric background of quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over an algebraically closed field. Let $B$ be a Borel subgroup of $G$ and $W$ be the associated Weyl group. We show that for any $w \in W$ that is not contained in any standard parabolic subgroup of $W$, the intersection of the Bruhat cell $B w B$ with any regular conjugacy class of $G$ is always irreducible. We then prove that the associated Lusztig varieties are irreducible. This extends the previous work of Kim \cite{kim2020homology} on the regular semisimple and regular unipotent elements. The irreducibilitiy result of Lusztig varieties will be used in an upcoming work in the study of affine Lusztig varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a combinatorial reconfiguration problem on a subclass of quadrangulations of surfaces called square-tiled surfaces. Our elementary move is a shear in a cylinder that corresponds to a well-chosen sequence of diagonal flips that preserves the square-tiled properties. We conjecture that the connected components of this reconfiguration problem are in bijection with the connected components of the moduli space of quadratic differentials. We prove that the conjecture holds in the so-called hyperelliptic components of Abelian square-tiled surfaces. More precisely, we show that any two such square-tiled surfaces of genus $g$ can be connected by $O(g)$ powers of cylinder shears.</description>

      <title>Tropical cycles of discrete admissible covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article applies the technical framework developed in previous work by the author to discrete admissible covers and their moduli spaces. More precisely, we construct a poic-space that parameterizes the discrete admissible covers after fixing the genus of the target, the number of marked legs, and prescribing the ramification profiles above these marked legs. We then construct a linear poic-fibration over this poic-space and show that the usual weight assignment of covers produces an equivariant cycle of this poic-fibration. This poic-fibration comes naturally with source and target maps, and after taking the weak pushforward in top dimension through the source map and subsequently forgetting the marking, this gives rise to an equivariant tropical cycle of the corresponding spanning tree fibration. Through this framework we obtain a generalization of previously known results on these cycles pertaining to the gonality of tropical curves. Special cases of these tropical cycles yield the following result: \emph{A generic genus-$g$ $r$-marked tropical curve $\Gamma$ (with $g+r$ even) has $C_{\frac{g+r}{2}}$ many $r$-marked discrete admissible covers of degree $\frac{g+r}{2}+1$ of a tree (counted with multiplicity) that have a tropical modification of $\Gamma$ as a source, where $C_{\frac{g+r}{2}}$ is the $(\frac{g+r}{2})$th Catalan number}.</description>

Abstract: Faltings conjectured that under the p-adic Simpson correspondence, finite dimensional p-adic representations of the geometric \'etale fundamental group of a smooth proper p-adic curve X are equivalent to semi-stable Higgs bundles of degree zero over X. In this article, we establish, over a p-adic curve of genus $g\ge 2$, an equivalence between these representations and Higgs bundles, whose underlying bundles potentially admit a strongly semi-stable reduction of degree zero. We show that these Higgs bundles are semi-stable of degree zero and investigate some evidence for the aforementioned conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We give a complete classification of symplectic birational involutions of manifolds of $OG10$ type. We approach this classification with three techniques -- via involutions of the Leech lattice, via involutions of cubic fourfolds and finally lattice enumeration via a modified Kneser's neighbour algorithm. The classification consists of three involutions with an explicit geometric realisation via cubic fourfolds, and three exceptional involutions which cannot be obtained by any known construction.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we construct a flat degeneration of the derived moduli stack of Higgs bundles on smooth curves using the stack of expanded degenerations of Jun Li. We show that there is an intrinsic relative log-symplectic form on the degeneration and we compare it with the one constructed by the second author. We show that the Hitchin map of the degeneration we construct has complete fibers. Furthermore, we show that the Hitchin map is flat and that a suitable open subset of the smooth locus of the reduced nilpotent cone is Lagrangian. We also extend the construction of the moduli of Higgs bundles along with the relative log-symplectic form over the universal moduli stack of stable curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the derived category of the moduli space $SU_C(2)$ of rank $2$ vector bundles on a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $g\ge 2$ with trivial determinant. This generalizes the recent work by Tevelev and Torres on the case with fixed odd determinant. Since $SU_C(2)$ is singular, we work with its resolution of singularities, specifically with the noncommutative resolution constructed by P\u{a}durariu and \v{S}penko--Van den Bergh (in the more general setting of symmetric stacks). We show that this noncommutative resolution admits a semiorthogonal decomposition into derived categories of symmetric powers $Sym^{2k}C$ for $2k\le g-1$. In the case of even genus, each block appears four times. This is also true in the case of odd genus, except that the top symmetric power $Sym^{g-1}C$ appears twice. In the case of even genus, the noncommutative resolution is strongly crepant in the sense of Kuznetsov and categorifies the intersection cohomology of $SU_C(2)$. Since all of its components are "geometric," our semiorthogonal decomposition provides evidence for the expectation, which dates back to the work of Newstead and Tyurin, that $SU_C(2)$ is a rational variety. Finally, we study mutations of semiorthogonal decompositions on the Hecke correspondence, answering a question of P\u{a}durariu and Toda.</description>

      <title>Generalized Toric Polygons, T-branes, and 5d SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 5d Superconformal Field Theories (SCFTs) are intrinsically strongly-coupled UV fixed points, whose realization hinges on string theoretic methods: they can be constructed by compactifying M-theory on local Calabi-Yau threefold singularities or alternatively from the world-volume of 5-brane-webs in type IIB string theory. There is a correspondence between 5-brane-webs and toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, however this breaks down when multiple 5-branes are allowed to end on a single 7-brane. In this paper, we extend this connection and provide a geometric realization of brane configurations including 7-branes. A web with 7-branes defines a so-called generalized toric polygon (GTP), which corresponds to combinatorial data that is obtained by removing vertices along external edges of a toric polygon. We identify the geometries associated to GTPs as non-toric deformations of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and provide a precise, algebraic description of the geometry, when 7-branes are introduced along a single edge. The key ingredients in our analysis are T-branes in a type IIA frame, which includes D6-branes. We show that performing Hanany-Witten moves for the 7-branes on the type IIB side corresponds to switching on semisimple vacuum expectation values on the worldvolume of D6-branes, which in turn uplifts to complex structure deformations of the Calabi-Yau geometries. We test the proposal by computing the crepant resolutions of the deformed geometries, thereby checking consistency with the expected properties of the SCFTs.</description>

      <title>Homological stability for generalized Hurwitz spaces and Selmer groups in quadratic twist families over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a version of the Bhargava-Kane-Lenstra-Poonen-Rains heuristics for Selmer groups of quadratic twist families of abelian varieties over global function fields. As a consequence, we derive a result towards the "minimalist conjecture" on Selmer ranks of abelian varieties in such families. More precisely, we show that the probabilities predicted in these two conjectures are correct to within an error term in the size of the constant field, $q$, which goes to $0$ as $q$ grows. Two key inputs are a new homological stability theorem for a generalized version of Hurwitz spaces parameterizing covers of punctured Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus, and an expression of average sizes of Selmer groups in terms of the number of rational points on these Hurwitz spaces over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Berry Connections for 2d $(2,2)$ Theories, Monopole Spectral Data &amp; (Generalised) Cohomology Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Berry connections for supersymmetric ground states of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ GLSMs quantised on a circle, which are generalised periodic monopoles. Periodic monopole solutions may be encoded into difference modules, as shown by Mochizuki, or into an alternative algebraic construction given in terms of vector bundles endowed with filtrations. By studying the ground states in terms of a one-parameter family of supercharges, we relate these two different kinds of spectral data to the physics of the GLSMs. From the difference modules we derive novel difference equations for brane amplitudes, which in the conformal limit yield novel difference equations for hemisphere or vortex partition functions. When the GLSM flows to a nonlinear sigma model with K\"ahler target $X$, we show that the two kinds of spectral data are related to different (generalised) cohomology theories: the difference modules are related to the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$, whereas the vector bundles with filtrations are related to its equivariant K-theory.</description>

      <title>On Spectral Data for $(2,2)$ Berry Connections, Difference Equations &amp; Equivariant Quantum Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study supersymmetric Berry connections of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) quantized on a circle, which are periodic monopoles, with the aim to provide a fruitful physical arena for recent mathematical constructions related to the latter. These are difference modules encoding monopole solutions via a Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence established by Mochizuki. We demonstrate how the difference modules arise naturally by studying the ground states as the cohomology of a one-parameter family of supercharges. In particular, we show how they are related to one kind of monopole spectral data, a quantization of the Cherkis-Kapustin spectral curve, and relate them to the physics of the GLSM. By considering states generated by D-branes and leveraging the difference modules, we derive novel difference equations for brane amplitudes. We then show that in the conformal limit, these degenerate into novel difference equations for hemisphere partition functions, which are exactly calculable. When the GLSM flows to a nonlinear sigma model with K\"ahler target $X$, we show that the difference modules are related to the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$.</description>

      <title>Traces of Hecke operators on Drinfeld modular forms for $\mathbb{F}_q[T]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study traces of Hecke operators on Drinfeld modular forms of level 1 in the case $A = \mathbb{F}_q[T]$. We deduce closed-form expressions for traces of Hecke operators corresponding to primes of degree at most 2 and provide algorithms for primes of higher degree. We improve the Ramanujan bound and deduce the decomposition of cusp forms of level $\Gamma_0(\mathfrak{p})$ into oldforms and newforms, as conjectured by Bandini-Valentino, under the hypothesis that each Hecke eigenvalue has multiplicity less than $p$.</description>

      <title>Quantization of the universal centralizer and central D-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The group scheme of universal centralizers of a complex reductive group $G$ has a quantization called the spherical nil-DAHA. The category of modules over this ring is equivalent, as a symmetric monoidal category, to the category of bi-Whittaker $D$-modules on $G$. We construct a braided monoidal equivalence, called the Knop-Ng\^o functor, of this category with a full monoidal subcategory of the abelian category of $\mathrm{Ad}(G)$-equivariant $D$-modules, establishing a $D$-module abelian counterpart of an equivalence established by Bezrukavnikov and Deshpande, in a different way.
  As an application of our methods, we prove conjectures of Ben-Zvi and Gunningham by relating this equivalence to parabolic induction and prove a conjecture of Braverman and Kazhdan in the $D$-module setting.</description>

      <title>Mock modularity of Calabi-Yau threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating functions $h_r(\tau)$ of D4-D2-D0 BPS indices, appearing in Calabi-Yau compactifications of type IIA string theory and identical to rank 0 Donaldson-Thomas invariants, are known to be higher depth mock modular forms satisfying a specific modular anomaly equation, with depth determined by the D4-brane charge $r$. We develop a method to solve the anomaly equation for arbitrary charges, in terms of indefinite theta series. This allows us to find the generating functions up to modular forms that can be fixed by computing just a finite number of Fourier coefficients of $h_r$.</description>
