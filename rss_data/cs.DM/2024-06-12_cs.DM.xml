      <title>Highly Connected Graph Partitioning: Exact Formulation and Solution Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph partitioning (GP) and vertex connectivity have traditionally been two distinct fields of study. This paper introduces the highly connected graph partitioning (HCGP) problem, which partitions a graph into compact, size balanced, and $Q$-(vertex) connected parts for any $Q\geq 1$. This problem is valuable in applications that seek cohesion and fault-tolerance within their parts, such as community detection in social networks and resiliency-focused partitioning of power networks. Existing research in this fundamental interconnection primarily focuses on providing theoretical existence guarantees of highly connected partitions for a limited set of dense graphs, and do not include canonical GP considerations such as size balance and compactness. This paper's key contribution is providing a general modeling and algorithmic approach for HCGP, inspired by recent work in the political districting problem, a special case of HCGP with $Q=1$. This approach models $Q$-connectivity constraints as mixed integer programs for any $Q\geq 1$ and provides an efficient branch-and-cut method to solve HCGP. When solution time is a priority over optimality, this paper provides a heuristic method specifically designed for HCGP with $Q=2$. A computational analysis evaluates these methods using a test bed of instances from various real-world graphs. In this analysis, the branch-and-cut method finds an optimal solution within one hour in $82.8\%$ of the instances solved. For $Q=2$, small and sparse instances are challenging for the heuristic, whereas large and sparse instances are challenging for the exact method. Furthermore, this study quantifies the computational cost of ensuring higher connectivity using the branch-and-cut approach, compared to a baseline of ensuring $1$-connectivity. Overall, this work serves as an effective tool to partition a graph into resilient and cohesive parts.</description>

      <title>Relations between monotone complexity measures based on decision tree complexity</title>

Abstract: In a recent result, Knop, Lovett, McGuire and Yuan (STOC 2021) proved the log-rank conjecture for communication complexity, up to log n factor, for any Boolean function composed with AND function as the inner gadget. One of the main tools in this result was the relationship between monotone analogues of well-studied Boolean complexity measures like block sensitivity and certificate complexity. The relationship between the standard measures has been a long line of research, with a landmark result by Huang (Annals of Mathematics 2019), finally showing that sensitivity is polynomially related to all other standard measures. In this article, we study the monotone analogues of standard measures like block sensitivity (mbs(f)), certificate complexity (MCC(f)) and fractional block sensitivity (fmbs(f)); and study the relationship between these measures given their connection with AND-decision tree and sparsity of a Boolean function. We show the following results: 1) Given a Boolean function $f : \{0, 1\}^{n} \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$, the ratio $fmbs(f^l )/mbs(f^l )$ is bounded by a function of n (and not l). A similar result was known for the corresponding standard measures (Tal, ITCS 2013). This result allows us to extend any upper bound by a well behaved measure on monotone block sensitivity to monotone fractional block sensitivity. 2) The question of the best possible upper bound on monotone block sensitivity by the logarithm of sparsity is equivalent to the natural question of best upper bound by degree on sensitivity. One side of this relationship was used in the proof by Knop, Lovett, McGuire and Yuan (STOC 2021). 3) For two natural classes of functions, symmetric and monotone, hitting set complexity (MCC) is equal to monotone sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic methods of finite discrete structures. Isomorphism of Nonseparable Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this monography, it is proposed to consider the concepts of spectra of edge cuts and edge cycles of a graph as a basic mathematical structure for solving the problem of graph isomorphism. An edge cut is defined by an edge and the vertices incident to it. In contrast to the generation of iterated edge graphs, we consider an iterated chain of qualicuts of the original graph, generated by edge cuts and determined by a recurrence relation. An edge cycle is defined by the set of isometric cycles of a graph. The monography examines the issues of constructing the spectrum of edge cuts Ws and the spectrum of edge cycles Tc of a graph G. It is shown that the formation of spectra is based on the incidence matrix of the graph. The independence of the construction of the graph structure from the numbering of vertices and edges is shown. The necessity and sufficiency of the spectra of edge cuts and the spectrum of edge cycles for determining the isomorphism of graph structures is shown. The relation between the internal structures of the graph and Whitney's theorem is considered.</description>

      <title>Discrete Single-Parameter Optimal Auction Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the classic single-item auction setting of Myerson, but under the assumption that the buyers' values for the item are distributed over finite supports. Using strong LP duality and polyhedral theory, we rederive various key results regarding the revenue-maximizing auction, including the characterization through virtual welfare maximization and the optimality of deterministic mechanisms, as well as a novel, generic equivalence between dominant-strategy and Bayesian incentive compatibility.
  Inspired by this, we abstract our approach to handle more general auction settings, where the feasibility space can be given by arbitrary convex constraints, and the objective is a convex combination of revenue and social welfare. We characterize the optimal auctions of such systems as generalized virtual welfare maximizers, by making use of their KKT conditions, and we present an analogue of Myerson's payment formula for general discrete single-parameter auction settings. Additionally, we prove that total unimodularity of the feasibility space is a sufficient condition to guarantee the optimality of auctions with integral allocation rules.
  Finally, we demonstrate this KKT approach by applying it to a setting where bidders are interested in buying feasible flows on trees with capacity constraints, and provide a combinatorial description of the (randomized, in general) optimal auction.</description>

      <title>Maximal Line Digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A line digraph $L(G) = (A, E)$ is the digraph constructed from the digraph $G = (V, A)$ such that there is an arc $(a,b)$ in $L(G)$ if the terminal node of $a$ in $G$ is the initial node of $b$. The maximum number of arcs in a line digraph with $m$ nodes is $(m/2)^2 + (m/2)$ if $m$ is even, and $((m - 1)/2)^2 + m - 1$ otherwise. For $m \geq 7$, there is only one line digraph with as many arcs if $m$ is even, and if $m$ is odd, there are two line digraphs, each being the transpose of the other.</description>

      <title>On Circuit Diameter Bounds via Circuit Imbalances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.07913v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the circuit diameter of polyhedra, introduced by Borgwardt, Finhold, and Hemmecke (SIDMA 2015) as a relaxation of the combinatorial diameter. We show that the circuit diameter of a system $\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n: Ax=b, 0\leq x\leq u\}$ for $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is bounded by $O(m \min\{m, n-m\} \log(m+ \kappa_A)+n \log n)$, where $\kappa_A$ is the circuit imbalance measure of the constraint matrix. This yields a strongly polynomial circuit diameter bound if e.g., all entries of $A$ have polynomially bounded encoding length in $n$. Further, we present circuit augmentation algorithms for LPs using the minimum-ratio circuit cancelling rule. Even though the standard minimum-ratio circuit cancelling algorithm is not finite in general, our variant can solve an LP in $O(mn^2\log(n+\kappa_A))$ augmentation steps.</description>

      <title>New Results on Edge-coloring and Total-coloring of Split Graphs</title>

Abstract: A split graph is a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. A connected graph $G$ is said to be $t$-admissible if admits a special spanning tree in which the distance between any two adjacent vertices is at most $t$. Given a graph $G$, determining the smallest $t$ for which $G$ is $t$-admissible, i.e. the stretch index of $G$ denoted by $\sigma(G)$, is the goal of the $t$-admissibility problem. Split graphs are $3$-admissible and can be partitioned into three subclasses: split graphs with $\sigma=1, 2 $ or $3$. In this work we consider such a partition while dealing with the problem of coloring a split graph. Vizing proved that any graph can have its edges colored with $\Delta$ or $\Delta+1$ colors, and thus can be classified as Class 1 or Class 2, respectively. When both, edges and vertices, are simultaneously colored, i.e., a total coloring of $G$, it is conjectured that any graph can be total colored with $\Delta+1$ or $\Delta+2$ colors, and thus can be classified as Type 1 or Type 2. These both variants are still open for split graphs. In this paper, using the partition of split graphs presented above, we consider the edge coloring problem and the total coloring problem for split graphs with $\sigma=2$. For this class, we characterize Class 2 and Type 2 graphs and we provide polynomial-time algorithms to color any Class 1 or Type 1 graph.</description>

      <title>Improved Distributed Algorithms for Random Colorings</title>

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are a widely-used algorithmic tool for sampling from high-dimensional distributions, a notable example is the equilibirum distribution of graphical models. The Glauber dynamics, also known as the Gibbs sampler, is the simplest example of an MCMC algorithm; the transitions of the chain update the configuration at a randomly chosen coordinate at each step. Several works have studied distributed versions of the Glauber dynamics and we extend these efforts to a more general family of Markov chains. An important combinatorial problem in the study of MCMC algorithms is random colorings. Given a graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ and an integer $k\geq\Delta+1$, the goal is to generate a random proper vertex $k$-coloring of $G$.
  Jerrum (1995) proved that the Glauber dynamics has $O(n\log{n})$ mixing time when $k&gt;2\Delta$. Fischer and Ghaffari (2018), and independently Feng, Hayes, and Yin (2018), presented a parallel and distributed version of the Glauber dynamics which converges in $O(\log{n})$ rounds for $k&gt;(2+\varepsilon)\Delta$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$. We improve this result to $k&gt;(11/6-\delta)\Delta$ for a fixed $\delta&gt;0$. This matches the state of the art for randomly sampling colorings of general graphs in the sequential setting. Whereas previous works focused on distributed variants of the Glauber dynamics, our work presents a parallel and distributed version of the more general flip dynamics presented by Vigoda (2000) (and refined by Chen, Delcourt, Moitra, Perarnau, and Postle (2019)), which recolors local maximal two-colored components in each step.</description>

      <title>Graph Burning: Bounds and Hardness</title>

Abstract: Graph burning models the propagation of information within a network as a stepwise process where at each step, one node becomes informed, and this information also spreads to all neighbors of previously informed nodes. Formally, graph burning is defined as follows: For an undirected graph $G$, at step $t=0$ all vertices in $G$ are unburned. At each step $t\ge 1$, one new unburned vertex is selected to burn if such a vertex exists. If a vertex is burned at step $t$, then all its unburned neighbors are burned in step $t+1$, and the process continues until there are no unburned vertices in $G$. The burning number of a graph $G$, denoted by $b(G)$, is the minimum number of steps required to burn all the vertices of $G$. The burning number problem asks whether the burning number of an input graph $G$ is at most $k$ or not. In this paper, we study the burning number problem both from an algorithmic and a structural point of view. The burning number problem is known to be NP-complete for trees with maximum degree at most three and interval graphs. Here, we prove that this problem is NP-complete even when restricted to connected cubic graphs and connected proper interval graphs. The well-known burning number conjecture asserts that all the vertices of a graph of order $n$ can be burned in $\lceil\sqrt{n}~\rceil$ steps. In line with this conjecture, upper and lower bounds of $b(G)$ are well-studied for various graph classes. Here, we provide an improved upper bound for the burning number of connected $P_k$-free graphs and show that the bound is tight up to an additive constant $1$. Finally, we study two variants of the problem, namely edge burning (only edges are burned) and total burning (both vertices and edges are burned). In particular, we establish their relationship with the burning number problem and evaluate the algorithmic complexity of these variants.</description>

Abstract: The critical exponent of an infinite word $\bf x$ is the supremum, over all finite nonempty factors $f$, of the exponent of $f$. In this note we show that for all integers $k\geq 2,$ there is a binary infinite $k$-automatic sequence with critical exponent $\leq 7/3$. The same conclusion holds for Fibonacci-automatic and Tribonacci-automatic sequences.</description>
