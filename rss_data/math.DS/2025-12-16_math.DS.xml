      <title>Euclidean-type algorithm for functions with same or similar origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maps $f,g\colon X\to X$ are called kin if they are forward iterates of the same map $\varphi\colon X\to X$, up to a composition with a commuting homeomorphism. Kin form an important class of commuting maps on $X$. In this paper, we characterize kin, and give an Euclidean-type algorithm which tests when two maps $f,g\colon X\to X$ are kin. Furthermore, we compute the topological entropy of diagonal maps induced by commuting diagonal kin diagrams.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modelling of autonomous and forced dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper demonstrates that invariant foliations are accurate, data-efficient and practical tools for data-driven modelling of physical systems. Invariant foliations can be fitted to data that either fill the phase space or cluster about an invariant manifold. Invariant foliations can be fitted to a single trajectory or multiple trajectories. Over and underfitting are eliminated by appropriately choosing a function representation and its hyperparameters, such as polynomial orders. The paper extends invariant foliations to forced and parameter dependent systems. It is assumed that forcing is provided by a volume preserving map, and therefore the forcing can be periodic, quasi-periodic or even chaotic. The method utilises full trajectories, hence it is able to predict long-term dynamics accurately. We take into account if a forced system is reducible to an autonomous system about a steady state, similar to how Floquet theory guarantees reducibility for periodically forced systems. In order to find an invariant manifold, multiple invariant foliations are calculated in the neighbourhood of the invariant manifold. Some of the invariant foliations can be linear, while others nonlinear but only defined in a small neighbourhood of an invariant manifold, which reduces the number of parameters to be identified. An invariant manifold is recovered as the zero level set of one or more of the foliations. To interpret the results, the identified mathematical models are transformed to a canonical form and instantaneous frequency and damping information are calculated.</description>

      <title>Robustness of nonuniform exponential dichotomies under a wider class of perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The robustness property of exponential dichotomies refers to the stability of this notion under small linear perturbations. In recent work~\cite{PPX}, the authors have identified a new class of perturbations under which the notion of a nonuniform exponential dichotomy persists. In the present paper, we show that it is possible to extend this class. Moreover, unlike~\cite{PPX} where the results are restricted to the case of ordinary differential equations, in the present paper we deal with arbitrary evolution families consisting of possibly noninvertible linear operators.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Average Dominance for Unimodular Amenable Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the ergodic averages of the action of any unimodular amenable group along certain F{\o}lner sequences can be dominated by the Ces\`aro means of a suitably constructed Markov operator, that is, the ergodic averages of an integer action. Moreover, the restriction on these F{\o}lner sequences are mild enough so that every two-sided F{\o}lner sequence has a subsequence satisfying these conditions. As a consequence of this inequality, we obtain the maximal and pointwise (individual) ergodic theorems for actions of unimodular amenable groups directly from the corresponding ergodic theorems for integer actions. This allows us to deal with the commutative and noncommutative ergodic theorems on an equal footing.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-BS dimension on subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to investigate the dimension theory of $\alpha$-pressure-like quantities. By means of the Carath$\acute{\rm e}$odory-Pesin structure, we define $\alpha$-BS dimension and $\alpha$-Pesin topological pressure on subsets using $\alpha$-Bowen metric $$d_{n}^{\alpha}(x,y)=\max_{0\leq i\leq n-1}e^{\alpha i}d(f^{i}x,f^{i}y),$$ where $\alpha \geq 0$. Specifically, we show that $\alpha$-BS dimension and $\alpha$-Pesin topological pressure are related by a Bowen's equation. Inspired by the classical Brin-Katok entropy, we introduce the notion of $\alpha$-local Brin-Katok entropy, and establish a variational principle for $\alpha$-BS dimension on compact subsets in terms of $\alpha$-local Brin-Katok entropy. Besides, for subshifts of finite type, we prove that $\alpha$-Bowen topological entropy is closely related to spectral radius and Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>FlowClass.jl: Classifying Dynamical Systems by Structural Properties in Julia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FlowClass.jl is a Julia package for classifying continuous-time dynamical systems into a hierarchy of structural classes: Gradient, Gradient-like, Morse-Smale, Structurally Stable, and General. Given a vector field \(\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x})\) defining the system \(\mathrm{d}\mathbf{x}/\mathrm{d}t = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x})\), the package performs a battery of computational tests -- Jacobian symmetry analysis, curl magnitude estimation, fixed point detection and stability classification, periodic orbit detection, and stable/unstable manifold computation -- to determine where the system sits within the classification hierarchy. This classification has direct implications for qualitative behaviour: gradient systems cannot oscillate, Morse-Smale systems are structurally stable in less than 3 dimensions, and general systems may exhibit chaos. Much of classical developmental theory going back to Waddington's epigenetic landscape rests on an implicit assumption of gradient dynamics.
  The package is designed with applications in systems and developmental biology in mind, particularly the analysis of gene regulatory networks and cell fate decision models in the context of Waddington's epigenetic landscape. It provides tools to assess whether a landscape metaphor is appropriate for a given dynamical model, and to quantify the magnitude of non-gradient (curl) dynamics.</description>

      <title>Birkhoff Spectra of symbolic almost one-to-one extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a continuous self-map $f$ on some compact metrisable space $X$, it is natural to ask for the visiting frequencies of points $x\in X$ to sufficiently ``nice'' sets $C\subseteq X$ under iteration of $f$.
  For example, if $f$ is an irrational rotation on the circle, it is well-known that the Birkhoff average $\lim_{n\to\infty}1/n\cdot \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\mathbf 1_C(f^i(x))$ exists and equals $\textrm{Leb}_{\mathbb T^1}(C)$ for all $x$ whenever $C$ is measurable with boundary $\partial C$ of zero Lebesgue measure. If, however, $\partial C$ is fat (of positive measure), the respective averages can generally only be evaluated almost everywhere or on residual sets. In fact, there does not appear to be a single example of a fat Cantor set $C$ whose Birkhoff spectrum -- the full set of visiting frequencies -- is known.
  In this article, we develop an approach to analyse the Birkhoff spectra of a natural class of dynamically defined fat nowhere dense compact subsets of Cantor minimal systems. We show that every Cantor minimal system admits such sets whose Birkhoff spectrum is a full non-degenerate interval -- and also such sets for which the spectrum is not an interval. As an application, we obtain that every irrational rotation admits fat Cantor sets $C$ and $C'$ whose Birkhoff spectra are, respectively, an interval and not an interval.</description>

      <title>Idempotents in the Ellis semigroup of Floyd-Auslander systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study minimal idempotents $J^{\mathrm{min}}(X)$ in the Ellis semigroup $E(X)$ associated with a Floyd-Auslander system $(X,T)$. We show that $(X,T)$ is non-tame if and only if $|J^{\mathrm{min}}(X)| &gt; 2^{\aleph_0}$, which happens exactly when the factor map onto the maximal equicontinuous factor possesses uncountably many non-invertible fibres.
  This yields an easy-to-check criterion for distinguishing tame from non-tame Floyd-Auslander systems and, more importantly, provides an entire family of regular almost automorphic systems with $|J^{\mathrm{min}}(X)| &gt; 2^{\aleph_0}$. Notably, all previously known regular almost automorphic non-tame systems exhibited only a small (i.e. $\leq 2^{\aleph_0}$) set of minimal idempotents.
  We obtain our result by leveraging an alternative characterisation of (non)-tameness through, what we call, choice domains.</description>

      <title>On the centralizers of endomorphisms of the projective line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a dominant endomorphism of the projective line, which is not conjugate to a power map $z\mapsto z^{\pm d}$. We consider the centralizers of the iterates of $f$, $C(f^{n}):=\{\textrm{dominant}\;g:\mathbb{P}^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^{1}\;|\; g\circ f^{n}=f^{n}\circ g\}$, $n\geq1$, and prove that their union is equal to $C(f^{N})$ for some $N\geq1$. This solves a conjecture of F. Pakovich. As an application, we obtain a Tits alternative for cancellative semigroups of endomorphisms of the projective line, without an assumption of finite generation, extending the results of J.P. Bell, K. Huang, W. Peng and T.J. Tucker.</description>

      <title>Recurrence to rare events for all points in countable Markov shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantitative recurrence to rare events in Countable Markov Shifts with recurrent potentials, focusing on return-time statistics to natural target sets for every point. In the positive recurrent case, return-time processes associated with non-periodic points converge to a standard Poisson process, while those for periodic points converge to a compound Poisson limit. In the null-recurrent regime, three distinct behaviors arise. Points satisfying certain combinatorial conditions (in particular, this class is generic in the measure-theoretic sense) exhibit fractional Poisson limits, whereas periodic points yield compound fractional Poisson limits. For all remaining points, we describe the full family of possible limit laws, each Pareto-dominated. This classification is sharp: every limit behavior in this family can be realized by an explicit system. For canonical families of null-recurrent CMS, we identify the limit process for every point, providing a complete description of return-time statistics in these systems.</description>

      <title>When is a cut and project set substitutional?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cut and project sets are obtained by projecting an irrational slice through a lattice to a lower dimensional subspace. Under standard conditions, the resulting pattern has no translational periods even though it retains some regularity of the lattice. Cut and project sets are one of the archetypical examples of patterns featuring aperiodic order, the other construction methods being by substitution and matching rules. Many early examples of aperiodic tilings, including the famous Penrose and Ammann--Beenker tilings, have a description from all of these methods. In this article we answer the following question, in the case of a Euclidean total space: what property of the cut and project data characterises when the resulting cut and project sets may also be defined by a substitution rule?</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a numerical scheme for the Kepler problem that preserves exactly all first integrals: angular momentum, total energy, and the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector. This property ensures that orbital trajectories retain their precise shape and orientation over long times, avoiding the spurious precession typical of many standard methods. The scheme uses an adaptive time step derived from a constant angular increment. Analytical considerations and numerical experiments demonstrate that the algorithm combines high accuracy with long-term stability.</description>

      <title>Irreducible groups and ergodicity in the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if $G$ is a real semi-simple Lie group, and $\Gamma$ is a discrete subgroup of $G$ containing a subgroup $\Sigma$ acting ergodically (in a strong sense) on the Furstenberg boundary of $G$, then $\Gamma$ is not isomorphic to a free product of $\Sigma$ with $\mathbb{Z}$. Moreover, if $\Sigma$ has algebraic entries, then $\Gamma$ has algebraic entries as well. As a consequence, we show that if all irreducible discrete subgroups of ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{R}) \times {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ act ergodically on $\mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^1 $, such groups cannot be free groups (or even Gromov hyperbolic). In the appendix, we discuss a connection between the existence of discrete irreducible groups and diophantine properties of Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Prey-Predator Dynamics of Habu Snakes and Mongooses Leading to Ecological Disaster on Amami Oshima Island in Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of mongooses from Indian subcontinent to Amami Oshima Island, Japan, aimed at controlling the population of venomous Habu snakes, has led to significant ecological disruptions, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of the islands biodiversity. To highlight the unintended consequences of such interventions and the necessity of understanding predator-prey dynamics in preserving ecological balance, a mathematical model incorporating snake, mongooses, mouse and natural resources has been proposed to explore their role in the ongoing ecological disaster and analysis the other scenarios if the authorities applied different approaches in place of already implemented strategy. Determining the model's existence and uniqueness, stability at equilibrium points, and state variable characteristics are some of the parts of the analytical analysis of the model. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify sensitive factors. In addition, the Runge-Kutta 4th order has been used to execute the numerical simulations. Our research reveals that although the government began killing and trapping mongooses almost 20 years after their introduction, but if trapping had started just 10 years after their introduction, the outcome could have been drastically different. This time, mongooses would not have been extinct, and their coexistence with other native species would have helped to preserve the ecological balance and prevent the severe ecological damage that is presently being seen. Thus, It is recommended to use mathematical modeling to explore alternatives before decision-making, ensuring sustainable ecosystem management while preventing irreversible impacts of invasive species.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a pseudo-Anosov contact structure, which admits a type of singular contact form with pseudo-Anosov Reeb flow. We prove that contact homology detects the free homotopy classes of closed orbits of any pseudo-Anosov Reeb flow and that any pseudo-Anosov contact structure is universally tight and torsion free. Many applications are given, including new cases of the Finiteness Conjecture for transitive pseudo-Anosov flows. Our proofs use a flavor of contact homology graded by a free homotopy class of loops, defined for any contact manifold. We establish several properties of this type of contact homology that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Reversibility in finite-dimensional collapse dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite-dimensional quantum systems with arbitrary, discontinuous collapse events. Formally, we fix a realization map (a physically admissible selector of the collapse dynamics) and do not rely on any regularity of the induced dynamics. We prove the existence of a topologically closed, invariant subset of the projective state space in which any two states can be connected with arbitrarily fine Fubini-Study precision and arbitrarily small integrated energetic cost. This shows that the preservation of information along a realized branch guarantees islands of quasi-reversibility, while genuine irreversibility requires additional ingredients such as non-compactness, explicit erasure, or coupling to reservoirs.

      <title>Determining subgroups via stationary measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider random walks on the isometry groups of general metric spaces. Under some mild conditions, we show that if two non-elementary random walks on a discrete subgroup of the isometry group have non-singular stationary measures, then subgroups generated by the random walks are commensurable. This result in particular applies to separable Gromov hyperbolic spaces and Teichm\"uller spaces. As a specific application, we prove singularity between stationary measures associated to random walks on different fiber subgroups of the fundamental group of a hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over the circle.</description>

      <title>An abstract framework for a class of nonlocal structured population models: existence, uniqueness and stability of steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the study of a class of nonlinear nonlocal functional evolution problems defined in an abstract Banach algebra. We introduce an abstract functional setting that encompasses a wide range of structured population models appearing in biomathematical literature. Within this framework, we analyze the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem and the existence of stationary solutions in the positive cone of the Banach algebra. By reviewing a large number of approaches, we also derive conditions for the local and global stability of these stationary solutions. Additionally, we explore the limits of these conditions by exhibiting explicit counterexamples. In particular, for mutation--selection models with symmetric mutation operators, we uncover both sufficient conditions for existence, uniqueness and stability, and counterexamples to existence or stability.</description>

      <title>Nondimensionalization is more science than art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When faced with a mathematical model, often the first step is to reduce the complexity of the model by turning variables and parameters into dimensionless quantities. This process is often performed by hand, relying on a skill practiced over many years, and attempted for small models. Nondimensionalization is often considered an art, as there is no formal method accessible to applied scientists. Here we show how to systematically perform nondimensionalization for arbitrarily sized models described by rational first order ordinary differential equations. We translate and extend an existing approach for computing rational invariants of the maximal scaling symmetry, which combines ideas from differential algebra, invariant theory and linear algebra, to the setting arising in biological models. The modeler inputs the system of equations and our implemented algorithm outputs the nondimensional quantities for the corresponding nondimensionalized model. We extend the algorithm to include initial conditions, and the modeler's choice of invariants, thereby including a larger class of nondimensionalizations. We further prove that any dimensionally consistent change of variables preserves the dimension of the maximal scaling symmetry. We showcase the framework on various models, including the classical Michaelis-Menten equations, which serves as a benchmark for asking and answering specific modeling questions.</description>

      <title>Torus Time-Spectral Method for Quasi-Periodic Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic trajectories with two or more incommensurate frequencies are ubiquitous in nonlinear dynamics, yet the classical Fourier-based time-spectral method is tied to strictly periodic responses. We introduce a torus time-spectral method that lifts the governing equations to an extended angular phase space, applies double-Fourier collocation on the invariant torus, and solves for the state. The formulation exhibits spectral convergence for quasi-periodic problem which we give a rigorous mathematical proof and also verify numerically. We demonstrate the approach on Duffing oscillators and a nonlinear Klein-Gordon system, documenting spectral error decay on the torus and tight agreement with time-accurate integrations while using modest frequency grids. The method extends naturally to higher-dimensional tori and offers a computationally efficient framework for analyzing quasi-periodic phenomena in fluid mechanics, plasma physics, celestial mechanics, and other domains where multi-frequency dynamics arise.</description>

      <title>Slow-growing counterexamples to the strong Eremenko conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f\colon\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ be a transcendental entire function. In 1989, Eremenko asked the following question concerning the set $I(f)$ of points that tend to infinity under iteration: can every point of $I(f)$ be joined to $\infty$ by a curve in $I(f)$? This is known as the \emph{strong Eremenko conjecture} and was disproved in 2011 by Rottenfu{\ss}er, R\"uckert, Rempe and Schleicher by the construction of a counterexample. The function has relatively small infinite order: it can be chosen such that $\log \log \,\lvert f(z)\rvert = (\log \lvert z\rvert)^{1+o(1)}$ as $f(z)\to \infty$. Moreover, $f$ belongs to the \emph{Eremenko--Lyubich class $\mathcal{B}$}. When a function belongs to this class, we can study the function via a \textit{logarithmic change of coordinates}. In this frame of coordinates, we are able to study the function via the \textit{tracts} that arise which are Jordan domains with unbounded real part. The key feature of the tracts in the counterexample of Rottenfu{\ss }er et al is that of large \textit{wiggling} sections. In this article we adapt the tracts used by Benitez and Rempe in order to deduce the existence of counterexample functions $f \in \mathcal{B}$ satisfying certain growth properties. We consider how slowly such an $f$ may grow. Suppose that $\Theta\colon [t_0,\infty)\to [0,\infty)$ is a function such that $\Theta(t) \to 0$ and \[ (\log t)^{\beta \Theta(\log t)}\Theta(t) \to \infty \quad\text{ as $t\to \infty$} \] for some $0&lt;\beta&lt;1$, along with a certain regularity assumption. Then there exists a counterexample $f\in\mathcal{B}$ as above such that \[ \log \log \lvert f(z) \rvert = O\bigl( (\log \lvert z \rvert)^{1 + \Theta(\log \lvert z \rvert)}\bigr) \quad\text{as $f(z) \to\infty$}. \] The hypotheses are satisfied, in particular, for $\Theta(t) = 1/(\log \log t)^{\alpha}$, for any $\alpha&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics on invariant tori emerging through forced symmetry breaking in phase oscillator networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider synchrony patterns in coupled phase oscillator networks that correspond to invariant tori. For specific nongeneric coupling, these tori are equilibria relative to a continuous symmetry action. We analyze how the invariant tori deform under forced symmetry breaking as more general network interaction terms are introduced. We first show in general that perturbed tori that are relative equilibria can be computed using a parametrization method; this yields an asymptotic expansion of an embedding of the perturbed torus, as well as the local dynamics on the torus. We then apply this result to a coupled oscillator network, and we numerically study the dynamics on the persisting tori in the network by looking for bifurcations of their periodic orbits in a boundary-value-problem setup. This way we find new bifurcating stable synchrony patterns that can be the building blocks of larger global structures such as heteroclinic cycles.</description>

      <title>On the metric mean dimensions of saturated sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09218v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From a geometric perspective, we employ metric mean dimension to investigate the set of generic points of invariant measures and saturated sets in infinite entropy systems. For systems with the specification property, we establish certain variational principles for the Bowen and packing metric mean dimensions of saturated sets in terms of Kolmogorov-Sinai $\epsilon$-entropy, and prove that the upper capacity metric mean dimension of saturated sets has full metric mean dimension. Consequently, the Bowen and packing metric mean dimensions of the set of generic points of invariant measures coincide with the mean R\'enyi information dimension, and the upper capacity metric mean dimension of the set of generic points of invariant measures also has full metric mean dimension.
  As applications, for systems with the specification property, we present the qualitative characterization of the metric mean dimensions of level sets, the set of mean Li-Yorke pairs in infinite-entropy systems, and the set of generic points of invariant measures in full shifts over compact metric spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Similarity between Epidemiologic Strains, Minimal Self-Replicable Siphons, and autocatalytic cores in (Chemical) Reaction Networks: Towards a Unifying Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to study boundary stability and persistence of positive odes in mathematical epidemiology models by importing structural tools from chemical reaction networks. This is largely a review work, which attempts to bring closer together the fields of mathematical epidemiology (ME), and chemical reaction networks (CRNs), based on several observations. We started by observing the conceptual correspondence between epidemiologic strains and both critical minimal siphons and minimal autocatalytic sets (cores) in an underlying CRN, and confirmed this in all the models we studied. We leverage this to provide a definition of the disease free equilibrium (DFE) face/infected set as the union of either all minimal siphons, or of all cores (they coincide always in our examples). Next, we provide a proposed definition of ME models, as models which have a unique boundary fixed point on the DFE face, and for which the Jacobian of the infected subnetwork admits a regular splitting, which allows defining the famous next generating matrix (NGM). We then define the interaction graph on minimal siphons (IGMS), whose vertices are minimal siphons, and whose edges indicate the existence of reactions producing species in one siphon from species in another. When this graph is acyclic, we say the model exhibits a Acyclic Minimal Siphon Decomposition (AMSD). For AMSD models whose minimal siphons partition the infection species, we show that the NGM is block triangular after permutation, which implies the classical max structure of the reproduction number R0 for multi-strain models. We implement algorithms to compute IGMS and detect AMSD in the Epid-CRN Mathematica package (https://github.com/florinav/EpidCRNmodels) (which contains already modules to identify minimal siphons, criticality, drainability, self-replicability, etc).</description>

      <title>Threshold Graphs Are Globally Synchronizing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model describes phase oscillators on the unit circle whose interactions are encoded by a graph. Each edge acts like a spring that pulls the two adjacent oscillators toward each other whenever their phases differ. A central question is to determine which graphs are globally synchronizing, meaning that trajectories of the Kuramoto dynamics converge to the fully synchronized state from almost all initial conditions. This property is tightly linked to the benign nonconvexity of the model's energy landscape. Existing guarantees for global synchronization rely on minimum-degree thresholds, which require the graph to be highly dense. In this work, we show that connected threshold graphs, whose density may vary from $2/n$ to $1$, are globally synchronizing. Our proof relies on a phasor-geometric analysis of the stationary points of the associated energy landscape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to study the dynamics of random products of weighted shifts on a separable Fr\'echet sequence space. That is, given a measure-preserving dynamical system $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu, \tau)$, a Fr\'echet sequence space $X$ with a basis $(e_n)_{n \geq 0}$, and a strongly measurable map $T : \Omega \to \mathcal{B}(X)$ taking values in a finite set of weighted shifts on $X$, we study the dynamics of the sequence $(T(\tau^{n-1}\omega) \dotsm T(\tau \omega) T(\omega))_{n \geq 1}$ for almost every $\omega \in \Omega$. After proving criteria to determine whether this sequence is universal, weakly mixing or mixing for almost every $\omega \in \Omega$, we study some examples on the spaces $X = \ell_p$, $X = c_0$ and $X = H(\mathbb{C})$ involving two shifts, first in the commuting case and then in the non-commuting one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07040v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce high-order Basis-Update &amp; Galerkin (BUG) integrators based on explicit Runge-Kutta methods for large-scale matrix differential equations. These dynamical low-rank integrators extend the BUG integrator to arbitrary explicit Runge-Kutta schemes by performing a BUG step at each stage of the method. The resulting Runge-Kutta BUG (RK-BUG) integrators are robust with respect to small singular values, fully forward in time, and high-order accurate, while enabling conservation and rank adaptivity. We prove that RK-BUG integrators retain the order of convergence of the underlying Runge-Kutta method until the error reaches a plateau corresponding to the low-rank truncation error, which vanishes as the rank becomes full. This theoretical analysis is supported by several numerical experiments. The results demonstrate the high-order convergence of the RK-BUG integrator and its superior accuracy compared to other existing dynamical low-rank integrators.</description>

Abstract: We establish Nash equilibrium learning in large populations of noncooperative, strategic agents. Our analysis considers the broadest class to date of payoff mechanisms with first-order modifications, capable of modeling bounded rationality and anticipatory effects, averaging, or Pad\'{e} delay approximations. We propose a framework that, for the first time, combines two nonstandard system-theoretic passivity notions. Our results hold for discontinuous best response dynamics alongside continuous learning rules, significantly extending prior work.</description>

      <title>Solvability Complexity Index Classification For Koopman Operator Spectra In $L^p$ For $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the computation of the approximate point spectrum and the approximate point $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum of bounded Koopman operators acting on $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$ for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and a compact metric space $(\mathcal{X}, d_{\mathcal{X}})$ with finite Borel measure $\omega$. Building on finite sections in a computable unconditional Schauder basis of $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$, we design residual tests that use only finitely many evaluations of the underlying map and produce compact sets on a planar grid, that converge in the Hausdorff metric to the target spectral sets, without spectral pollution. From these constructions we obtain a complete classification, in the sense of the Solvability Complexity Index. Also we analyze the sufficiency and existence of a Wold-von Neumann decomposition analog, that was used in the special $L^2$-case.
  The main difficulty in extending from the already analyzed Hilbert setting $(p=2)$ to general $L^p$ is the loss of orthogonality and Hilbertian structure: there is no orthonormal basis with orthogonal coordinate projections in general, the canonical truncations $E_n$ in a computable Schauder dictionary need not be contractive (and may oscillate) and the Wold-von Neumann reduction has no directly computable analog in $L^p$. We overcome these obstacles by working with computable unconditional dictionaries adapted to dyadic/Lipschitz filtrations and proving stability of residual tests under non-orthogonal truncations.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous potentials, Lagrange's identity and Poisson geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lagrange identity expresses the second derivative of the moment of inertia of a system of material points through kinetic energy and homogeneous potential energy, from which follows the Jacobi well-known result on the instability of a system of gravitating bodies. In this work, it is proven that if a Hamiltonian system satisfies the Lagrange identity, then it possesses additional tensor invariants that are not expressed through the basic invariants existing for all Hamiltonian systems. A new class of Hamiltonian systems with inhomogeneous potentials is considered, which also possess similar additional tensor invariants.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Hofer's geometry in higher dimensional manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes robust obstructions to representing Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms as $k$-th powers ($k \geq 2$) or embedding them in flows for certain higher-dimensional symplectic manifolds $(M,\omega)$, including surface bundles. We prove that in the Hamiltonian group $(\mathrm{Ham}(M,\omega), d_H)$ equipped with the Hofer metric, there exist arbitrarily large balls that are disjoint from the set of $k$-th powers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the free group on two generators embeds into every asymptotic cone of $(\mathrm{Ham}(M,\omega), d_H)$, revealing the large-scale geometric complexity of the Hamiltonian group.</description>
