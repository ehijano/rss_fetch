      <title>Seasonal thermal stress analysis of defective mass concrete sidewalls based on the average forming temperature method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal cracking in urban underground sidewalls is frequently observed when structures are cast in summer and enter service in winter, as seasonal temperature gradients act under structural restraint. To quantify the local stress field associated with pre-existing cracks, an orthogonal finite-element simulation matrix of 16 combinations is constructed. Distributions of maximum principal stress () at the surface crack tip and along the upper half of the crack bottom are evaluated using steady-state thermal loading and a linear-elastic constitutive model. Across all cases, pronounced tensile stress concentration occurs at both locations: the maximum ranges from 19.2 to 34.1 MPa at the crack surface end and from 17.2 to 29.4 MPa at the crack bottom. These concentrated values are consistently higher than the stress level at the same locations in an otherwise identical uncracked wall, clarifying how seasonal temperature gradients under restraint amplify local stresses around existing defects. The quantitative ranges reported here provide a basis for risk screening and for formulating practical mitigation measures (e.g., joint spacing and insulation strategies) in the design and operation of urban underground enclosure walls. In addition, three-dimensional simulations of randomly distributed internal voids show that adopting average forming temperature increases the peak tensile stress on void surfaces from 3.42 to 4.40 MPa at 10 deg C and from 5.98 to 6.96 MPa at -5 deg C, further highlighting the risk amplification effect of AFT under cold service conditions.</description>

      <title>Matrix-free algorithms for fast ab initio calculations on distributed CPU architectures using finite-element discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08571v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-element (FE) discretisations have emerged as a powerful real-space alternative to large-scale Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) calculations, offering systematic convergence, excellent parallel scalability, while accommodating generic boundary conditions. However, the dominant computational bottleneck in FE-based DFT arises from the repeated application of the discretised sparse Hamiltonian to large blocks of trial vectors during iterations in an iterative eigensolver. Traditional sparse matrix-vector multiplications and FE cell-matrix approaches encounter memory limitations and high data-movement overheads, particularly at higher polynomial orders, typically used in DFT calculations. To overcome these challenges, this work develops matrix-free algorithms for FE-discretised DFT that substantially accelerate these products by doing on-the-fly operations that utilize structured tensor contractions over 1D basis functions and quadrature data. A unified multilevel batched data layout that handles both real and complex-valued operators is introduced to maximise cache reuse and SIMD utilisation on Frontier (AVX2), Param Pravega (AVX512) and Fugaku (SVE). We also combine terms for optimal cache reuse, even-odd decomposition to reduce FLOP, and mixed-precision intrinsics. Extensive benchmarks show that for large multivector pseudopotential DFT calculations, the matrix-free kernels deliver 1.5-4x speedups over the state-of-the-art cell-matrix approach baselines. For all-electron DFT calculations, the matrix-free operator achieves gains of up to 5.8x due to its efficient implementation and superior arithmetic intensity. When integrated with an error-tolerant Chebyshev-filtered subspace iteration eigensolver, the matrix-free formalism yields substantial reductions in end-to-end time-to-solution using FE meshes that deliver desired accuracies in ground-state properties.</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation framework for modeling collective emission in ensembles of inhomogeneous solid-state emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An efficient simulation framework is proposed to model collective emission in disordered ensembles of quantum emitters. Using a cumulant expansion approach, the computational complexity scales polynomially as opposed to exponentially with the number of emitters, enabling Monte Carlo sampling over a large number of realizations. The framework is applied to model negatively charged silicon-vacancy (SiV$^{-}$) centers inside diamond. Incorporating spatial disorder and inhomogeneous broadening, we obtain statistically averaged responses over hundreds of SiV$^{-}$ clusters. These simulations reveal two signatures of collective behavior. First, dynamics of fully inverted clusters show that superradiant emission occurs only with sufficiently large emitter number and high quantum efficiency. Unlike ideal Dicke superradiance, the burst is substantially suppressed by strong near-field dipole-dipole interaction, consistent with existing theoretical predictions. Second, under continuous-wave excitation we compute photoluminescence-excitation spectra, which exhibit interaction-induced broadening in the distribution of resonance peaks. The corresponding density of states also displays a non-zero skewness. Overall, by incorporating realistic inhomogeneities in emitter clusters, our framework is able to predict statistics for disordered ensembles that can be compared to experiments directly. Our approach generalizes to other types of emitters, including atoms, molecules, and quantum dots, thus providing a practical tool for analyzing collective behavior in realistic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A Transcorrelated Wave-Function Framework for Solids: An Application to Bulk and Defected Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate wave-function descriptions of pristine and defected solids remain challenging due to the simultaneous presence of finite-size, basis-set, and correlation errors. While embedding techniques alleviate finite-size effects and correlated wave-function approaches systematically improve correlation, basis-set incompleteness continues to limit practical accuracy. Here we present a study of transcorrelated (TC) many-body wave-function methods on properties of solid state systems. We augment the existing xTC theory to periodic systems, and establish an unified transcorrelated embedding framework that integrates periodic TC theory with fragment-based correlated solvers. Using silicon as a test case, we validate the method against coupled-cluster, FCIQMC, and diffusion Monte Carlo benchmarks for bulk. Then we apply TC embedding to calculation of formation energies of two silicon self-interstitials. The TC Hamiltonian yields rapid basis convergence and quantitatively reliable defect formation energies at the triple-$\zeta$ level, substantially reducing the basis-set bottleneck for wave-function treatments of crystalline defects.</description>

      <title>Many interacting particles in solution. I. Screening-ranged expansions of electrostatic potential and energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical many-body formalism for systems of spherical particles carrying arbitrary free charge distributions and interacting in a polarizable electrolyte solution, that we model within the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann framework. Building on the detailed spectral analysis of the associated nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators developed in our companion study~\cite{supplem_pre_math}, we construct exact explicit expansions of the electrostatic potential and energy in ascending orders of Debye screening thereby obtaining systematic "screening-ranged" series for potentials and energies. These screening-ranged expansions provide a unified and tractable description of many-body electrostatics. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach by showing how it generalizes and improves upon both classical and modern methods, enabling rigorous treatment of heterogeneously charged systems (such as Janus particles) and accurate modeling of higher-order phenomena (such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, like-charge attraction) as well as yielding many-body generalizations to analytical explicit results previously known only in the two-body setting.</description>

      <title>PyMieDiff: A differentiable Mie scattering library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08614v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light scattering by spherical-shaped particles of sizes comparable to the wavelength is foundational in many areas of science, from chemistry to atmospheric science, photonics and nanotechnology. With the new capabilities offered by machine learning, there is a great interest in end-to-end differentiable frameworks for scattering calculations. Here we introduce PyMieDiff, a fully differentiable, GPU-compatible implementation of Mie scattering for core-shell particles in PyTorch. The library provides native, autograd-compatible spherical Bessel and Hankel functions, vectorized evaluation of Mie coefficients, and APIs for computing efficiencies, angular scattering, and near-fields. All inputs - geometry, material dispersion, wavelengths, and observation angles and positions - are represented as tensors, enabling seamless integration with gradient-based optimisation or physics-informed neural networks. The toolkit can also be combined with "TorchGDM" for end-to-end differentiable multi-particle scattering simulations. PyMieDiff is available under an open source licence at https://github.com/UoS-Integrated-Nanophotonics-group/MieDiff.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Photocarrier and Phonon Dynamics from First Principles: a Unified Treatment of Carrier-Carrier, Carrier-Phonon, and Phonon-Phonon Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a first-principles many-body framework to describe the dynamics of photocarriers and phonons in semiconductors following ultrafast excitation. Our approach incorporates explicit ab initio light-matter coupling and first-principles collision integrals for carrier-carrier, carrier-phonon, and phonon-phonon scattering. It also yields time-dependent quasiparticle and phonon frequency renormalizations, along with light-induced coherent atomic motion. The equations of motion are solved in a maximally localized Wannier basis, ensuring gauge-consistent scattering integrals and ultradense momentum sampling, thereby enabling direct comparison with pump-probe experiments. The method can be coupled to constrained density-functional theory to access light-induced structural phase transitions at longer times after the light pulse. We showcase the capabilities and predictive power of this framework on MoS$_2$ and h-BN monolayers. For MoS$_2$, we resolve photoinduced renormalizations of electronic and lattice properties, ultrafast carrier relaxation, hot-phonon dynamics, and displacive coherent atomic motion. Including carrier-carrier scattering is crucial to obtain realistic photocarrier equilibration times, while omitting phonon-phonon scattering leads to incorrect long-time lattice thermalization and a factor of two larger A$_{1g}$ coherent phonon damping time. For h-BN, we quantify photoinduced changes in the electronic, optical, and lattice responses in quasi-equilibrium, demonstrating a fluence-dependent enhancement of screening and melting of excitonic features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully analytical integration of the Maxwell stress tensor and derive exact relations for interparticle forces in systems of multiple dielectric spheres immersed in a polarizable ionic solvent, within the framework of the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann theory. Building upon the screening-ranged (in ascending orders of Debye screening) expansions of the potentials developed and rigorously analyzed in the accompanying works \cite{supplem_pre,supplem_pre_math,supplem_prl}, we construct exact screening-ranged many-body expansions for electrostatic forces in explicit analytical form. These results establish a rigorous foundation for evaluating screened electrostatic interactions in complex particle systems and provide direct analytical connections to, and systematic improvements upon, various earlier approximate or limited-case formulations available in the literature, both at zero and finite ionic strength.</description>

      <title>Many interacting particles in solution. III. Spectral analysis of the associated Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of particles in an electrolytic medium can be calculated by solving the Poisson equation inside the solutes and the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation in the solvent, with suitable boundary conditions at the interfaces. Analytical approaches often expand the potentials in spherical harmonics, relating interior and exterior coefficients and eliminating some coefficients in favor of others, but a rigorous spectral analysis of the corresponding formulations is still lacking. Here, we introduce composite many-body Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators and prove that they are compact with spectral radii strictly less than one. These results provide the foundation for systematic screening-ranged expansions, in powers of the Debye screening parameters, of electrostatic potentials, interaction energies, and forces, and establish the analytical framework for the accompanying works~\cite{supplem_prl,supplem_pre,supplem_pre_force}.</description>

      <title>Residual-based Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration for sparse Hermitian eigenvalue problems tolerant to inexact matrix-vector products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22652v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chebyshev Filtered Subspace Iteration (ChFSI) has emerged as a robust alternative to Krylov eigensolvers for extracting a small subset of extremal eigenpairs from large sparse matrices, particularly in situations where these eigenpairs must be computed repeatedly as the system matrix evolves within an outer iteration. In this work, we propose R-ChFSI, a residual based reformulation of ChFSI designed to exhibit strong convergence properties even when the matrix-vector products are computed inexactly. We derive convergence guarantees under matrix-vector product approximations, providing a rigorous foundation for the method in large-scale eigenvalue computations. The tolerance of R-ChFSI to inexact matrix-vector products enables an efficient treatment of generalized Hermitian definite eigenproblems of the form $\textbf{A} \textbf{x} = \lambda \textbf{B} \textbf{x}$ where exact factorizations or high-accuracy iterative solves for evaluating $\textbf{B}^{-1}$ are often prohibitively expensive. Moreover, R-ChFSI naturally accommodates low-precision arithmetic for both standard and generalized eigenproblems, making it well-suited for modern hardware accelerators optimised for mixed-precision computation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, extensive numerical experiments are conducted on finite-element discretized eigenproblems with millions of degrees of freedom, solving for thousands of eigenpairs arising in \emph{ab initio} material modelling using Kohn-Sham density functional theory. For generalized eigenproblems employing approximate $\textbf{B}^{-1}$, R-ChFSI achieves desired residual norms orders of magnitude smaller than those obtained with standard ChFSI. In addition, R-ChFSI reliably reaches target residual tolerances (e.g., 10$^{-8}$) even with FP32 and TF32 arithmetic, significantly outperforming standard ChFSI in similar settings.</description>

      <title>An empirical formulation of accelerated molecular dynamics for simulating and predicting microstructure evolution in materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite its widespread use in materials science, conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are severely constrained by timescale limitations. To address this shortcoming, we propose an empirical formulation of accelerated MD method, adapted from a collective-variable-based extended system dynamics framework. While this framework is originally developed for efficient free energy sampling and reaction pathway determination of specific rare events in condensed matter, we have modified it to enable accelerated MD simulation and prediction of microstructure evolution of materials across a broad range of scenarios. In essence, the nearest neighbor off-centering absolute displacement (NNOAD), which quantifies the deviation of an atom from the geometric center of its nearest neighbors in materials, is introduced. We propose that the collection of NNOADs of all atoms can serve as a generalized reaction coordinate for various structural transitions in materials. The NNOAD of each atom, represented by its three components, is coupled with three additional dynamic variables assigned to the atom. Time evolution of the additional dynamic variables follows Langevin equation, while Nos\'e-Hoover dynamics is employed to thermostat the system. Through careful analysis and benchmark simulations, we established appropriate parameter ranges for the equations in our method. Application of this method to several test cases demonstrates its capability to accelerate MD simulations by several orders of magnitude while maintaining kinetic consistency and good accuracy in predicting long timescale microstructure evolutions of materials. We also provide some preliminary thoughts on theoretical justification of the method, offering insights into its underlying principles.</description>

      <title>A Non-Local Orientation Field Phase-Field Model for Misorientation- and Inclination- Dependent Grain Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to incorporate grain boundary (GB) anisotropy in phase-field modeling by extending the standard partial differential equations formulation to include a non-local functional of an orientation field. Regardless of the number of grains in the simulation, the model uses a single orientation field and incorporates grain misorientation and inclination information obtained from sampling the orientation field at optimized locations in the vicinity of the grain boundary. The formalism enables simple and precise tuning of GB energy anisotropy while avoiding an extensive fitting procedure. The functional includes an explicit GB anisotropy function to control the GB energy as a function of both misorientation and inclination. The model is validated by reproducing the linear grain growth rate, Wulff shapes with varying misorientations and anisotropic coefficients, and analytical equilibrium dihedral angles at triple junctions. Polycrystalline simulations demonstrate grain growth, coalescence, triple junction behavior, and the influence of anisotropy on grain morphology.</description>

      <title>Granite sliding on granite: friction, wear rates, surface topography, and the scale-dependence of rate-state effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study tribological granite-granite contacts as a model for tectonic faulting, combining experiments, theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. The high friction in this system is not dominated by particulate wear or plowing, as frequently assumed, but by cold welding within plastically deformed asperity junctions. We base this conclusion on the observation that wear is repeatedly high after cleaning contacts but decreases as gouge accumulates, while friction shows the opposite trend. Moreover, adding water reduces wear by a factor of ten but barely decreases friction. Thermal and rate-dependent effects - central to most earthquake models-are negligible: friction remains unchanged between -40{\deg}C and 20{\deg}C, across abrupt velocity steps, and after hours of stationary contact. The absence of rate-state effects in our macroscopic samples is rationalized by the scale-dependence of pre-slip. The evolution of surface topography shows that quartz grains become locally smooth, with height spectra isotropic for wavelength below 10 microns but anisotropic at longer wavelengths, similar to natural faults. The resulting gouge particles have the usual characteristic sizes near 100 nm. Molecular dynamics simulations of a rigid, amorphous silica tip sliding on {\alpha}-quartz reproduce not only similar friction coefficients near unity but also other experimentally observed features, including stress-introduced transitions to phases observed in post-mortem faults, as well as theoretical estimates of local flash temperatures. Additionally, they reveal a marked decrease of interfacial shear strength above 600{\deg}C. The overall correspondence between experiments, simulations, theory, and field observations indicates that our model system captures essential aspects of rock friction.</description>
