      <title>TASI/CERN/KITP Lecture Notes on "Toward Quantum Computing Gauge Theories of Nature"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hallmark of the computational campaign in nuclear and particle physics is the lattice-gauge-theory program. It continues to enable theoretical predictions for a range of phenomena in nature from the underlying Standard Model. The emergence of a new computational paradigm based on quantum computing, therefore, can introduce further advances in this program. In particular, it is believed that quantum computing will make possible first-principles studies of matter at extreme densities, and in and out of equilibrium, hence improving our theoretical description of early universe, astrophysical environments, and high-energy particle collisions. Developing and advancing a quantum-computing based lattice-gauge-theory program, therefore, is a vibrant and fast-moving area of research in theoretical nuclear and particle physics.
  These lecture notes introduce the topic of quantum computing lattice gauge theories in a pedagogical manner, with an emphasis on theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the program, and on the most common approaches and practices, to keep the presentation focused and useful. Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories is introduced within the Kogut-Susskind framework, the notion of Hilbert space and physical states is discussed, and some elementary numerical methods for performing Hamiltonian simulations are discussed. Quantum-simulation preliminaries and digital quantum-computing basics are presented, which set the stage for concrete examples of gauge-theory quantum-circuit design and resource analysis. A step-by-step analysis is provided for a simpler Abelian gauge theory, and an overview of our current understanding of the quantum-computing cost of quantum chromodynamics is presented in the end. Examples and exercises augment the material, and reinforce the concepts and methods introduced throughout.</description>

      <title>Universal parameters of the $\Lambda(1380)$, the $\Lambda(1405)$ and their isospin partners from a combined analysis of Lattice QCD and experimental results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a global analysis of lattice and experimental data on negative-strangeness meson-baryon scattering using a large set of variations of the theoretical framework based on the Chiral Unitary Approach. For the former, the L\"uscher formalism is utilized taking into account all pertinent coupled-channel effects. Through this, systematic uncertainties related to data scarcity, potential ambiguities, and possible framework dependence are quantified for the first time. The implementation of information criteria and other statistical tools is discussed. As a final result we provide pole positions for isoscalar resonances at the physical and lattice points including statistical and systematic uncertainties. Predictions for the isovector states are also provided showing large uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound peak in isospin QCD: a natural prediction of the Medium Separation Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present predictions for the zero-temperature equation of state at finite isospin density using the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model within the Medium Separation Scheme (MSS) -- a scheme that explicitly disentangles medium effects from the ultraviolet divergent vacuum terms. Recent lattice QCD results reveal a nonmonotonic speed of sound ($c_s^2$) as a function of isospin chemical potential ($\mu_I$), exhibiting explicit violation of the conformal bound $c_s^2 = 1/3$. These findings have attracted significant theoretical interest, as established models -- including the NJL model -- failed to anticipate this behavior prior to lattice simulations. Conventional NJL implementations yield unphysical artifacts, often attributed to regularization scale sensitivity stemming from nonrenormalizability. However, in this work, we demonstrate that the standard NJL framework combined with MSS quantitatively reproduces state-of-the-art lattice data for isospin QCD.</description>

      <title>Goldstone bosons across thermal phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temperature has a significant effect on the properties of quantum field theories (QFTs) with a spontaneously broken symmetry, in particular on the massless Goldstone bosons that exist in the vacuum state. It has recently been shown using lattice calculations for a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ complex scalar field theory that the Goldstone mode persists even when the symmetry is restored above the critical temperature $T_{c}$, and has the properties of a screened massless excitation, a so-called thermoparticle. In this work, we continue the investigation of this theory by determining explicitly how the Goldstone mode evolves as the temperature is increased both below and above $T_{c}$. We find that the two phases of the theory are entirely characterised by the thermal dissipative effects experienced by the Goldstone mode, with the broken and symmetry-restored phases associated with weak and strong damping, respectively. These findings are consistent with the non-perturbative constraints imposed by spontaneous symmetry breaking, and provide a new way in which to characterise thermal phase transitions in QFTs.</description>

      <title>Multipartite entanglement from ditstrings for 1+1D systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that multipartite entanglement can be used as an efficient way of identifying the critical points of 1+1D systems. We demonstrate this with the quantum Ising model, lattice $\lambda \phi^4$ approximated with qutrits, and arrays of Rydberg atoms. To do so we make use of multipartite compositions of entanglement quantities for different parts combined to form the strong subadditivity, weak monotonicity, and a convex combination of these with conformal properties. These quantities display some remarkable properties. We will demonstrate how the entanglement of individual parts together displays behavior at phase boundaries, but the combination of these in the aforementioned quantities sharpens and localizes this behavior to the boundaries even better. We will show that we can extend a scheme for approximating the entanglement with the mutual information, and that this acts as a lower bound which will also follow the changes in the entanglement for the above quantities, despite the additional contributions of different signs. This mutual information approximation to the identifying quantities can have its lower probabilities removed in a process we call filtering, and despite the combination of terms will respond well to the filtering and offer improvements to the lower bound.</description>

      <title>Mechanical properties of the $\Omega^-$ baryon from gravitational form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the mechanical properties of the $\Omega^-$ baryon by analyzing its gravitational form factors (GFFs) within the framework of QCD sum rules. These form factors encode rich information about the internal structure of hadrons and offer deep insights into the dynamics that govern their stability. The spin-3/2 nature of the $\Omega^-$ baryon manifests in its gravitational form factors as intricate multipole structures, which encapsulate higher-order deformations and demonstrate the influence of intrinsic spin on internal dynamics. We extract the GFFs of the $\Omega^-$ baryon and apply their specific multipole combinations, gravitational multipole form factors (GMFFs), to quantify key mechanical observables-including energy density, angular momentum, pressure and shear force distributions, mass and mechanical radii, and D-terms-associated with different multipole orders. Notably, this work provides the first determination of several of these observables, such as the mechanical radii and the quadrupole contributions to the pressure and shear force distributions. Our analysis shows that the quadrupole contributions to the mechanical properties are generally subdominant compared to those from the monopole component. We further investigate the mechanical stability of the $\Omega^-$ through a multipole analysis of its internal force distributions. These results enhance our understanding of the mechanical structure of spin-3/2 hadrons and provide useful benchmarks for future theoretical and lattice QCD studies.</description>

      <title>Criticality in 1-dimensional field theories with mesoscopic, infinite range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of critical phenomena in one-dimensional field theories with long-range interactions has garnered significant attention following the implications of the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, which precludes phase transitions in most low-dimensional theories with local interactions. This research investigates a novel class of one-dimensional theories characterised by a distinctly defined infinite interaction range. We propose that such theories emerge naturally through a mesoscopic feedback mechanism. In this proof-of-concept study, we examine Ising-type models and demonstrate that the natural emergence of phase transitions, criticality, and previously unidentified universality classes is evident.</description>

      <title>Timelike electromagnetic form factors of hyperons at large $q^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last few years there has been considerable progress in the study of the electromagnetic form factors of baryons in the timelike region, through electron-positron scattering, with increasing square transfer momentum $q^2$. The modulus of the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors has been measured for nucleons, hyperons and other baryons at BaBar, CLEO, Belle and BESIII. The novel measurements motivated the extension of a covariant quark model, developed to the spacelike region ($q^2 \le 0$), to the timelike region, without any further parameter fitting. The extension is based on asymptotic relations derived from analyticity and unitarity, valid for the large-$q^2$ region. We use the model to make predictions for the effective form factor $|G|$ (combination of $G_E$ and $G_M$) and the ratio $|G_E/G_M|$ for spin 1/2 hyperons at large $q^2$ (above 10 GeV$^2$). Our calculations are in good agreement with the data from CLEO and BESIII for $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^+$ and $\Xi^-$ above $q^2=15$ GeV$^2$. Upcoming data for $\Sigma^0$, $\Sigma^-$ and $\Xi^-$ at large $q^2$ may be used to further test our predictions. We also compare our model calculations with the scarce available data for $|G_E/G_M|$. We conclude that the present $q^2$ range is not large enough to test our calculations, but that a more definitive test can be made by experiments above $q^2=20$ GeV$^2$.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive approach to the physics of mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach for the self-consistent solution of coupled sets of Bethe-Salpeter and Schwinger-Dyson equations in QCD. This framework allows us to maintain the axial Ward-Takahashi identities of the theory within advanced approximation schemes, such as the skeleton or three-particle irreducible expansions. For this purpose we reformulate the Schwinger-Dyson equation of the axial-vector vertex such that the bulk of its quantum corrections is expressed in terms of a novel vertex. Crucially, this vertex satisfies a symmetry-induced relation of its own, which involves the full quark-gluon vertex. As a result, the Schwinger-Dyson equation reproduces the standard Ward-Takahashi identity satisfied by the axial-vector vertex. Consequently, the known relation between the quark mass function and the wave function of the pion in the chiral limit is duly fulfilled. The present approach offers valuable insights into the interplay between symmetry and dynamics, and provides a practical path towards computations of hadron physics within sophisticated approximations. In particular, the one-loop dressed truncation of the key dynamical equations, including that of the quark-gluon vertex, is shown to be completely compatible with the required symmetry relations. Further extensions and potential phenomenological applications of the developed framework are briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: We study topology in Quantum Chromodynamics at high temperatures by means of lattice calculations. Simulations are performed with $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson twisted mass fermions at maximal twist with physical quark masses, and temperatures $T~\gtrsim~180$ MeV. The results obtained with three lattice spacings ranging between $0.057$ and $0.080$ fm are extrapolated to the continuum limit. We compare the results for the topological susceptibility obtained with the field-theoretic definition with those obtained from an observable constructed with the disconnected part of the chiral susceptibility, and we confirm their agreement -- within the largish errors -- on our range of temperatures. We also study the topological charge distribution, the next order cumulant $b_2$ and, for the first time, the Free Energy as a function of the $\theta$ angle. We find a rapid crossover to the Dilute Instanton Gas behaviour above $ T \simeq 300$ MeV for all the observables we have considered.</description>

      <title>Structure of center-vortex matter in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structure of center vortices is studied in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory for the first time to illuminate the interplay between elementary (center charge $\pm 1$) and doubly charged vortices. Unlike in SU(3), where charge $+2$ vortices are simply elementary vortices with reversed orientations in spacetime, these possibilities are physically distinct in SU(4). Visualizations of the vortex structure in three-dimensional slices reveal the various ways in which doubly charged objects manifest, as the convergence and matching of elementary vortices or as isolated doubly charged loops. An algorithm is described to classify every doubly charged chain as one of these three types. A collection of vortex statistics is considered to quantify the vortex structure. Many of these pertain to the novel doubly charged objects, including their relative proportions and chain lengths, which are analyzed to highlight the differences between each chain type. Three different lattice spacings are employed to investigate the approach to the continuum limit. Vortex matching chains are found to be shorter on average but also more prevalent than vortex convergences, ascribed to their interpretation as extended center monopoles. In addition, the lengths of both vortex convergences and vortex matchings are observed to follow an exponential distribution, allowing the introduction of a constant probability for a doubly charged chain to split into two elementary vortices as it propagates. Combined, these findings provide a characterization of the vortices that comprise center-vortex structures in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Color-magnetic correlations in SU(N) lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by color-magnetic instabilities in QCD, we investigate field-strength correlations in both SU(2) and SU(3) lattice QCD. In the Euclidean Landau gauge, we numerically calculate the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation, $C_{\perp}(r) \equiv g^2 \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r\hat \perp)) \rangle$ with $\perp \equiv x, y$, and the parallel-type one, $C_{\parallel}(r) \equiv g^2 \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r\hat \parallel) \rangle$ with $\parallel~\equiv z, t$. In the Landau gauge, all two-point field-strength correlations $g^2 \langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^b_{\alpha\beta}(s')\rangle$ are described by these two quantities, due to the Lorentz and global SU($N_c$) color symmetries. Curiously, the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ is found to be always negative for arbitrary $r$, except for the same point of $r=0$. The parallel-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\parallel}(r)$ is always positive. In the infrared region, $C_{\perp}(r)$ and $C_{\parallel}(r)$ strongly cancel each other, which leads to an approximate cancellation for the sum of the field-strength correlations as $\sum_{\mu, \nu} \langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^a_{\mu\nu}(s')\rangle \propto C_{\perp}(|s-s'|)+ C_{\parallel}(|s-s'|) \simeq 0$. Next, we decompose the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ into quadratic, cubic and quartic terms of the gluon field $A_\mu$. The quadratic term is always negative, which is explained by the Yukawa-type gluon propagator $\langle A^a_\mu(s)A^a_\mu(s')\rangle \propto e^{-mr}/r$ with $r\equiv |s-s'|$ in the Landau gauge. The quartic term gives a relatively small contribution. In the infrared region, the cubic term is positive and tends to cancel with the quadratic term, resulting in a small value of $C_{\perp}(r)$.</description>

      <title>O(5) multicriticality in the 3D two flavor SU(2) lattice gauge Higgs model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the multicritical behavior of the three dimensional lattice system in which a SU(2) gauge field is coupled to two flavors of scalar fields transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. In this system a multicritical point is present, where the global symmetry O(2)$\oplus$O(3) gets enlarged to O(5). Such a symmetry enlargement is hindered for generic systems by the instability of the O(5) multicritical point, but the SU(2) gauge symmetry prevents the appearance of the term triggering the instability. All the numerical results obtained in this lattice gauge model fully support the expectations coming from the O(2)$\oplus$O(3) multicritical Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\phi^4$ theory, and we discuss possible implications of these results for some models of deconfined quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Criticality at absolute zero from Ising model on two-dimensional dynamical triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:1710.03402v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reconsider the criticality of the Ising model on two-dimensional dynamical triangulations based on the $N \times N$ hermitian two-matrix model with the introduction of a loop-counting parameter and linear terms in the potential. We show that in the large-N limit even though the Ising model is classical, the critical temperature can reach absolute zero by tuning the loop-counting parameter, and the corresponding continuum theory turns out to be the quantised theory of neither pure gravity nor gravity coupled to conformal matter with central charge being 1/2.</description>

      <title>Towards elucidation of zero-temperature criticality of Ising model on 2d DT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.08524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the zero-temperature criticality of the Ising model on two-dimensional dynamical triangulations to contemplate its physics. As it turns out, an inhomogeneous nature of the system yields an interesting phase diagram and the physics at the zero temperature is quite sensitive about how we cool down the system. We show the existence of a continuous parameter that characterizes the way we approach the zero-temperature critical point and it may enter in a critical exponent.</description>

      <title>Tensor-network study of the roughening transition in a (2 + 1)D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the confined phase of (2+1)D lattice gauge theories a roughening transition arises between a weakly confined regime with floppy string excitations and a strongly confined regime with stiff string excitations. In this work, we use an infinite Density Matrix Renormalization Group (iDMRG) algorithm to quantitatively characterize the properties of confined strings. To this end, we stabilize the state with a string excitation by 't Hooft loop operators. While for zero gauge-matter coupling we can use bare 't Hooft loop operators to do so, for finite gauge-matter coupling we have to transform them to emergent ones, which we achieve with an adiabatic protocol. By analyzing the scaling of both a novel order parameter and the entanglement entropy, our approach allows us to accurately determine the roughening transition, even at finite gauge-matter coupling.</description>
