      <title>Localization of Singularities and Universal Geometric Rank Bounds in the Satake Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a framework for the localization and isolation of singularities in the affine Grassmannian. Our primary result is a structural factorization of the transition matrix $C$ between the Mirkovi\'c--Vilonen (MV) basis and the convolution basis into $C = P \cdot M \cdot A \cdot Q^{-1}$, where the four factors represent: equivariant localization ($Q$), fusion via nearby cycles ($A$), local intersection cohomology stalks ($M$), and diagonal normalization ($P$). Utilizing this factorization, and by introducing the Geometric Efficiency metric ($\eta$) we establish a Universal Geometric Rank Bound, proving that the rank of the transition matrix $C$ is bounded by the dimension of the local Braden--MacPherson (BMP) stalks.</description>

      <title>The Brauer group of $BG$ and gerbe structures of moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\mu _N$-gerbe of curves of genus $g$ with an order $N$ automorphism, and explore what corresponding $H^2$-cohomology classes the components of this stack can have. In particular, we look at curves whose quotients by the order $N$ automorphism are genus 0, and completely determine the Brauer classes of these gerbes. The key technical input is the calculation of the Brauer group of $BG$, for $G$ a smooth connected semisimple linear algebraic group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a stratified topological space, we answer the question whether the functor from the derived category of constructible sheaves to the derived category of sheaves with constructible cohomology is an equivalence. We also establish basic facts on the category of locally constant sheaves and on the category of constructible sheaves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cubic forms $C$ are constructed in the work of R. Aguilar, M. Green and P. Griffiths to establish the generic global Torelli theorem for Fano-K3 pairs $(X,Y)$, where $X: F=0$ is a cubic threefold in $\mathbb{P}^4$ and $Y\in|-K_X|$ is an anticanonical smooth section of $X$ defined by a quadratic form $Q$. In this article, we prove the following two results, which were previously verified with the computer aid of Macaulay2: for a generic pair $(X,Y)$, (i) the cubic form $C$ is smooth; (2) $(J_{F,3}:Q)=0$, and thereby give a precise meaning of the word ``generic" in this context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a correspondence between the compact exceptional curves and divisors on $G-{\rm Hilb}(\mathbf{C}^3)$ and some non-trivial irreducible representations of $G \subset GL(n,C)$ which are special (or essential). Moreover, we provide an explicit construction of the small resolution of $G-{\rm Hilb}(\mathbf{C}^3)$ and, using this resolution, we construct a correspondence between special and essential representations. These results are an extension of ``Special McKay correspondence'' and ``Reid's recipe''.</description>

      <title>Geometric Rigidity in Moduli Stacks of Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quadratic moduli schemes $X$ of algebra laws on a fixed vector space $W$ under the transport-of-structure action of $GL(W)$ on $Hom(W^{\otimes 2},W)$. We construct an intrinsic three-term deformation complex on $X$ whose fibers encode transverse first-order classes and primary obstructions, and whose cohomology agrees on the operadic loci with the standard low-degree deformation cohomology (\`a la Gerstenhaber and Nijenhuis--Richardson). We then define a canonical quadratic map $\kappa^{inc}_{2,\mu}\colon H^2_{inc}(\mu)\to H^3_{inc}(\mu)$ that controls second-order lifts modulo isotriviality. If $\mu$ is smooth point in a reduced component and $(\kappa^{inc}_{2,\mu})^{-1}(0)=\{0\}$, then the $G$-orbit of $\mu$ is Zariski open in that component. This provides a coordinate-free explanation of Richardson-type geometric rigidity even when the second deformation cohomology does not vanish.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler Characteristic of Low Symmetric Powers and Split Toric Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a smooth, projective scheme $X$ over a field $k$ or any variety $X$ if $k$ has characteristic zero, we compute the compactly supported $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristic of $\operatorname{Sym}^2(X)$ if $\operatorname{char}(k) \ne 2$ and of $\operatorname{Sym}^3(X)$ if $\operatorname{char}(k) \ne 2,3$. We do so by extending the definition of a $G$-equivariant quadratic Euler characteristic first studied by Pajwani-P\'al to arbitrary characteristic and by studying its relation to the $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristic of quotients. As an application, we show that the compactly supported $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristic of $\operatorname{Sym}^n(X)$ agrees with the prediction from the power structure constructed by Pajwani-P\'al for $n = 2,3$.
  Furthermore, we compute the compactly supported $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristic of split toric varieties and show that the compactly supported $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristic of all of their symmetric powers agrees with the prediction from the power structure constructed by Pajwani-P\'al.</description>

      <title>The low degree cohomology of compactifications of $A_g$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the low degree $\ell$-adic intersection cohomology of symplectic local systems on the Satake compactification of the moduli space $A_g$ of principally polarized abelian varieties. We prove that only a small finite list of irreducible Galois representations can appear in the low degree cohomology of any nonsingular toroidal compactification of $A_g$ or $X_{g,s}$, the $s$-fold fiber product of the universal abelian variety. We give several applications, including to spaces of holomorphic forms on toroidal compactifications and to the cohomology of the interior. In particular, we give a complete characterization of when the cohomology of $X_{g,s}$, or one of its toroidal compactifications, is of Tate type. The result is independent of the choice of toroidal compactification.</description>

      <title>Abelian surfaces in Hesse form and explicit isogeny formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new method for the computation of $(3,3)$-isogenies between principally polarized abelian surfaces. The idea is to work with models in $\mathbb{P}^8$ induced by a symmetric level-$3$ theta structure. In this setting, the action of three-torsion points is linear, and the isogeny formulas can be described in a simple way as the composition of easy-to-evaluate maps. In the description of these formulas, the relation with the Burkhardt quartic threefold plays an important role. Furthermore, we discuss generalizations of the idea to higher dimensions as well as different isogeny degrees.</description>

      <title>Canonical Lattices and Integer Relations Associated to Rational Fans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a canonical local-to-global lattice theory for rational fans. We define the $\textit{ray lattice } L_{\mathrm{rays}}(\Sigma)$ and the $\textit{relation lattice } L_{\mathrm{rel}}(\Sigma)$ as invariants functorial under fan isomorphisms. We introduce $\textit{star-local relation lattices}$, defined via the relation lattice of the localized quotient fan, which capture the linear dependencies visible within local neighborhoods. We define a $\textit{codimension filtration}$ on the global relation lattice and prove a generation theorem: the global lattice is generated by local relations supported on the stars of cones of codimension at least 1. This filtration is sensitive to the facial structure of $\Sigma$; explicit examples and a conjecture suggest that subdivisions can only preserve or lower filtration depths, distinguishing fans with different combinatorial topologies.</description>

      <title>Unlikely intersections with CM abelian varieties in a family and explicit bounds for canonical heights under endomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a smooth irreducible curve over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, and let $\mathcal{A} \to S$ be an abelian scheme with a curve $C \subset \mathcal{A}$, both defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. In 2020, Barroero and Capuano proved that if $C$ is not contained in a proper subgroup scheme, then the intersection of $C$ with the union of the flat subgroup schemes of $\mathcal{A}$ of codimension at least 2 is finite. In this article, we continue to study this problem by considering the intersections with the algebraic subgroups of the CM fibers, generalizing a previous result of Barroero for fibered powers of elliptic schemes. A key ingredient of the proof is an explicit control of canonical heights under endomorphisms: for an abelian variety $A/\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, an ample symmetric divisor $D$, and $f \in \mathrm{End}(A)$, we bound explicitly $\widehat{h}_{A, D}(f(P))$ in terms of $\widehat{h}_{A, D}(P)$ by determining the values of $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ for which the divisors $\lambda D - f^* D$ and $f^* D - \lambda D$ are ample.</description>

      <title>Refinement of the Infinitesimal Variation of Hodge Structure: the case of canonical curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11442v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a smooth complex projective curve with canonical divisor $K_C$ very ample. We explore the relation between the cup-product $$ H^1 (\Theta_C ) \longrightarrow (H^0({\cal O}_C (K_C))^{\ast} \otimes H^1 ({\cal O}_C) $$ where $\Theta_C ={\cal O}_C (-K_C)$ is the holomorphic tangent bundle of $C$, and the geometry of the canonical embedding of $C$. The cup-product, following Griffiths, stratifies ${\mathbb P}(H^1 (\Theta_C ))$ by the subvarieties $\Sigma_r$, according to the rank $r$ of $\xi \in H^1 (\Theta_C )$ viewed as the linear map $$ \xi:H^0({\cal O}_C (K_C)) \longrightarrow H^1 ({\cal O}_C) $$ or, equivalently, by the dimension of the kernel of $\xi$ $$ W_{\xi}=ker(\xi). $$ The refinement consists of the filtration of $W^{\bullet}_{\xi} ([\phi])$ of $W_{\xi}$, varying with $[\phi] \in {\mathbb P}(W_{\xi})$. This filtration has geometric meaning:
  1) it is related to special divisors on $C$,
  2) it `counts' certain rational normal curves in the canonical embedding of $C$.
  As an illustration, the results about the strata $\Sigma_0$ and $\Sigma_1$ are recovered and as corollaries one obtains the classical theorems of Max Noether on projective normality of the canonical embedding and Babbage-Enriques-Petri about the canonical curve being cut out by quadrics.
  The refinement brings out new aspects: quiver representations, Fano toric varieties with a distinguished anti-canonical divisor, dimer models. The quiver emerges from the construction and properties of the refinement; the Fano variety arises from the graph underlying the quiver and related to the Higgs structures. The graph underlying the refinement becomes an important part of the theory: it connects to topics such as the Topological Quantum field theory, moduli of elliptic curves with marked points, modular curves, higher categorical structures.</description>

      <title>A relative orientation for the moduli space of stable maps to a del Pezzo surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove orientation results for evaluation maps of moduli spaces of rational stable maps to del Pezzo surfaces over a field, both in characteristic $0$ and in positive characteristic. These results and the theory of degree developed in a sequel produce quadratically enriched counts of rational curves over non-algebraically closed fields of characteristic not $2$ or $3$. Orientations are constructed in two steps. First, the ramification locus of the evaluation map is shown to be the divisor in the moduli space of stable maps where image curves have a cusp. Second, this divisor is related to the discriminant of a branched cover of the moduli space given generically by pairs of points on the universal curve with the same image.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stable pair on a projective variety consists of a sheaf and a global section subject to stability conditions parameterized by rational polynomials. We will show that for a smooth projective threefold and a class of a rank 2 sheaf, there are two stability chambers (in the space of rational polynomials under the lexicographic order) for which the moduli spaces of semistable pairs admit morphisms to a Gieseker moduli space of rank 2 semistable sheaves and a Hilbert scheme, respectively. In the latter moduli space, every semistable pair corresponds to a closed sub-scheme of codimension 2 with an extension class, providing a generalization of the Serre correspondence. These two moduli spaces are related by finitely many wall-crossings. We provide explicit descriptions of those wall-crossings for certain fixed numerical classes. In particular, these wall-crossings preserve the connectedness of the moduli space of semistable pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let G be a finite group acting tamely on a proper reduced curve C over an algebraically closed field. We study the G-module structure on the cohomology groups of a G-equivariant locally free sheaf F on C, and give formulas of Chevalley--Weil type, with values in the Grothendieck ring R_k(G)_Q of finitely generated G-modules. We also give a similar formula for the singular cohomology of compact complex spaces.
  The focus is on the case where C is nodal. Using the Chevalley--Weil formula, we compute the G-invariant part of the global sections of the pluricanonical bundle \omega_C^{\otimes m}. In turn, we use the formula for m=2 to compute the equivariant deformation space of a stable G-curve C. We also obtain numerical criteria for the presence of any given irreducible representation in space of the global sections of \omega_C\otimes F, where F is an ample locally free G-sheaf on C. Some new phenomena, pathological compared to the smooth curve case, are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute an analogue of Pascal's triangle enriched in bilinear forms over a finite field. This gives an arithmetically meaningful count of the ways to choose $j$ ring homomorphisms into an algebraic closure from an \'etale extension of degree $n$. We also compute a quadratic twist. These (twisted) enriched binomial coefficients are defined in joint work of Brugall\'e and the second-named author, building on work of Serre. Such binomial coefficients support curve counting results over non-algebraically closed fields, using $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>Closed real plane curves of hyperelliptic solutions of focusing gauged modified KdV equation of genus $g$</title>

Abstract: The real part of the focusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation defined over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ is reduced to the focusing gauged MKdV (FGMKdV) equation. In this paper, we construct the real hyperelliptic solutions of FGMKdV equation in terms of data of the hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ and demonstrate the closed hyperelliptic plane curves of genus $g=5$ whose curvature obeys the FGMKdV equation by extending the previous results of genus three (Matsutani, {\it{J. Geom. Phys}} {\bf{215}} (2025) 105540). These are a generalization of Euler's elasticae.</description>

      <title>Reconstrucion of oriented matroids from Varchenko-Gelfand algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algebra of $R$-valued functions on the set of chambers of a real hyperplane arrangement is called the Varchenko-Gelfand (VG) algebra. This algebra carries a natural filtration by the degree with respect to Heaviside functions, giving rise to the associated graded VG algebra. When the coefficient ring $R$ is an integral domain of characteristic $2$, the graded VG algebra is known to be isomorphic to the Orlik-Solomon algebra.
  In this paper, we study VG algebras over coefficient rings of characteristic different from $2$, and investigate to what extent VG algebras determine the underlying oriented matroid structures.
  Our main results concern hyperplane arrangements that are generic in codimension $2$. For such arrangements, if $R$ is an integral domain of characteristic not equal to $2$, then the oriented matroid can be recovered from both the filtered and the graded VG algebras.
  We also formulate an algorithm that is expected to reconstruct oriented matroids from VG algebras in the case of general arrangements.</description>
