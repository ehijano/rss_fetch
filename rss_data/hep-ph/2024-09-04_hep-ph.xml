      <title>CP-odd effects at NLO in SMEFT $WH$ and $ZH$ production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CP-violation (CPV) is a rare phenomenon in the Standard Model whilst there is compelling indirect evidence for additional CPV sources in the Universe. The search for CPV effects at the LHC is thus one of the best-motivated precision tests of the Standard Model (SM) and an excellent probe of New Physics. NLO QCD corrections can affect the predictions for those measurements substantially. We study the impact of NLO QCD corrections in $WH$ and $ZH$ production in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory with bosonic CP-odd dimension-6 operators. We analyze the angular distributions at LO of those processes that can be used to probe CPV effects. We then show how NLO QCD effects modify those distributions. We encounter that the corrections have a clear angular dependence and differ between the SM, the dimension-6 squared and their interference, emphasising the need for an exact inclusion of NLO QCD in precision computations. We then perform a phenomenological analysis of $WH$ production at the LHC to study the impact of NLO QCD effects on the projected bounds on the CP-odd Wilson Coefficient $c_{\varphi\widetilde{W}}$. NLO QCD effects in the signal improve the bounds by $\sim10\%$ but reduce the significance of the interference.</description>

      <title>Discovering Dark Matter with the MUonE Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MUonE experiment aims to extract the hardonic contribution the muon anomalous magnetic moment from a precise measurement of the muon-electron differential scattering cross section. We show that MUonE can also discover thermal relic dark matter using only its nominal experimental setup. Our search strategy is sensitive to models of dark matter in which the pairs of pseudo-Dirac fermions are produced in muon-nucleus scattering in the target, and the heavier state decays semi-visibly to yield dilepton pairs displaced downstream from the interaction point. This approach can probe sub-GeV thermal-relic dark matter whose cosmological abundance is governed by the same model parameters that set the MUonE signal strength. Furthermore, our results show that the downstream ECAL plays a key role in rejecting backgrounds for this search, thereby providing strong motivation for the MUonE to keep this component in the final experimental design.</description>

      <title>On the smallness of charm loop effects in $B\to K^{(*)} \ell\ell$ at low $q^2$: light meson Distribution Amplitude analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-local effects originating from the charm quark loops at dilepton invariant masses smaller than the charmonium threshold in $B\to K \ell\ell$ are evaluated with light meson distribution amplitudes. The revised estimates with B-meson distribution amplitude within a Light Cone Sum Rule approach yielded results about three orders smaller than the original computation. In view of the importance of these non-factorizable soft gluon effects, both conceptually and phenomenologically, an independent evaluation is necessary. It is found that to twist-4 accuracy, these soft gluon effects vanish when evaluated employing the kaon distribution amplitude. Similar results hold for $B\to K^* \ell\ell$ to the leading twist. This eliminates one of the major sources of potential uncertainty which usually makes it difficult for a clear case of new physics, should the data show deviations from the standard model.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Phase Transition in Two Scalar Singlet Model with pNGB Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition within an extended Standard Model framework that includes one real scalar $(\Phi)$ and one complex scalar $(S)$, both of which are SM gauge singlets. The global $U(1)$ symmetry is softly broken to a $\mathcal{Z}_3$ symmetry by the $S^3$ term in the scalar potential. After this $U(1)$ symmetry breaking, the imaginary component of the complex scalar $(S)$ acts as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) dark matter candidate, naturally stabilized by $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry of the scenario. Specially, the spontaneous breaking of the global $U(1)$ symmetry to a discrete $\mathcal{Z}_3$ subgroup can introduce effective cubic terms in the scalar potential, which facilitates a strong first-order phase transition. We analyze both single-step and multi-step first-order phase transitions, identifying the parameter space that satisfies the dark matter relic density constraints, complies with all relevant experimental constraints, and exhibits a strong first-order electroweak phase transition. The interplay of these criteria significantly restricts the model parameter space, often leading to an under-abundant relic density. Moreover, we delve into the gravitational wave signatures associated with this framework, offering valuable insights that complement traditional dark matter direct and indirect detection methods.</description>

      <title>Baryon number violation with top quark operators in the SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory framework, we set indirect constraints on top quark operators that violate baryon number by one unit above the TeV scale. We find that these constraints are typically many orders of magnitude more stringent than the recently derived direct bounds from collider experiments. Therefore, direct observation of baryon number violation in top-quark observables at the TeV scale would imply a large fine-tuning among operators across different energy scales. This possibility is not protected under universal radiative corrections or any known symmetry principles.</description>

      <title>tParton: an updated implementation of next-to-leading order transversity evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide code to solve the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations for the nucleon transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs), which encode nucleon transverse spin structure. Though codes are widely available for the evolution of unpolarized and polarized PDFs, there are no recent codes publicly available for the transversity PDF. Here, we present Python code which implements two methods of solving the leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) approximations of the DGLAP equations for the transversity PDF, and we highlight the theoretical differences between the two.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the semileptonic decay $ \Xi^{++}_{cc}\rightarrow \Xi^+_{c} \bar{\ell}\nu_{\ell}$ within QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the semileptonic decay of the doubly heavy baryon $ \Xi^{++}_{cc} $ into the singly heavy baryon $ \Xi^+_{c}$ within the three point QCD sum rule approach in two possible lepton channels. Our analysis includes perturbative as well as nonperturbative condensation contributions up to dimension five. We evaluate the form factors of this semileptonic decay entering the amplitude described by the vector and axial vector transition currents. The fit functions of the form factors with respect to the transferred momentum squared are utilized to predict the decay widths and branching ratios of the $ \Xi^{++}_{cc}\rightarrow \Xi^+_{c} \bar{\ell}\nu_{\ell}$ channels. We compare our findings with other predictions in the literature. Our outcomes can be useful for experimental groups in their search for the weak decays of doubly heavy baryons and may be checked via future experiments such as LHCb.</description>

      <title>Corrections from space-time dependent electromagnetic fields to Wigner functions and spin polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have derived the Wigner equations at global equilibrium with constant vorticity but space-time dependent electromagnetic fields up to second order in semiclassical expansion. We obtain the new second-order contributions to the charge currents and energy-momentum tensor from the varying electromagnetic fields. We also compute the new corrections to the spin polarization pesudo-vector from both contant and varying electromagnetic fields. We also find that the space-time dependent electromagnetic field provides a tighter constraint on the solutions of Wigner functions in global equilibrium compared with constant electromagnetic field.</description>

Abstract: We derive self-consistent constraint conditions for collision terms in quantum kinetic theory within Wigner function formalism. We present simple specific solutions for the collision terms in quantum kinetic theory which is compatible with these constraints. We obtain the self-consistent quantum kinetic theory at relaxation-time approximation, with which we discuss spin polarization effects and electric charge separation effects in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>The study of strongly intensive observables for $\pi^{\pm,0}$ in $pp$ collisions at LHC energy in the framework of PYTHIA model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00525v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractal and phase transitional properties of each type of pions (i.e. $\pi^{\pm,0}$) through one-dimensional $\eta-$space, at an energy of $\sqrt{s}=13~$TeV, have been studied with the help of the Scaled Factorial Moment (SFM) framework. To generate simulated data sets for $pp$ collisions under the minimum bias (MB) condition at $\sqrt{s}=13~$TeV, we have employed the Monte Carlo-based event simulator PYTHIA. Various parameters such as the Levy index $(\mu)$, degree of multifractality $(r)$, anomalous fractal dimension $(d_q)$, multifractal specific heat $(c)$ and critical exponent $(\nu)$ have been calculated. To study the Bose Einstein(BE) effect due to identical particles (here pions) we have also derived these parameters for mixed pion pairs (i.e. $\{\pi^{+},\pi^{-}\}$, $\{\pi^{+},\pi^{0}\}$ and $\{\pi^{-},\pi^{0}\}$) and we find that the effects of identical particles weakened for the mixture with respect to the individual distributions. The quest for the quark-hadron phase transition has also been conducted within the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory of second-order phase transition. Analysis revealed that for PYTHIA-generated MB events, there is a clear indication of the quark-hadron phase transition according to the GL theory. Furthermore, the values of the multifractal specific heat ($c$) for each $\pi^{+}, \pi^{-}, \pi^{0}$ and the mixture pair data sets of pions generated by PYTHIA model at MB condition, indicate a transition from multifractality to monofractality in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~$TeV.</description>

      <title>Neutrino oscillations from the perspective of the quantum Yang-Baxter equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origins of neutrino masses is one of the biggest mysteries in modern physics since they are beyond the realm of the Standard Model. As massive particles, neutrinos undergo flavor oscillations throughout their propagation. In this paper we show that when a neutrino oscillates from a flavor state {\alpha} to a flavor state \b{eta}, it follows three possible paths consistent with the Quantum Yang- Baxter Equations. These trajectories define the transition probabilities of the oscillations. Moreover, we define a probability matrix for flavor transitions consistent with the Quantum Yang-Baxter Equations, and estimate the values of the three neutrino mass eigenvalues within the framework of the triangular formulation.</description>

      <title>Probing heavy meson lightcone distribution amplitudes with heavy quark spin symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on a previous work~\cite{Han:2024min}, we illustrate that the leading-twist light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) defined in heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) can be determined through lattice simulations of quasi-distribution amplitudes (quasi-DAs) with a large momentum component $P^z$. Exploiting heavy-quark spin symmetry, we show that the LCDAs for a heavy pseudoscalar and vector meson in the context of HQET exhibit degeneracy, and the degeneracy allows for the utilization of quasi DAs for both pseudoscalar and vector mesons on the lattice. We then derive the relevant short-distance coefficients for the matching between LCDAs defined with QCD fields and HQET LCDAs at the one-loop level. The incorporation of these three quasi DAs can not only confirm the methodology introduced in Ref.~\cite{Han:2024min} but also provides possible insight into power corrections. Discrepancies between the corresponding results offer a valuable perspective for estimating power corrections within the system which are imperative for precise investigations into heavy-meson LCDAs in the future particularly in the context of lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Charm Sivers function at EicC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC) is pivotal in enhancing our knowledge of the internal structure of nucleons and nuclei, particularly through the study of transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs). Among the leading-twist TMDs, the Sivers function is of particular interest, as it provides crucial insights into the spin and momentum structure of hadrons and plays a significant role in describing transverse single spin asymmetries (SSAs) in high-energy scatterings.
  In this study, we focus on the theoretical framework and phenomenological implications of the Sivers function in the context of small-x physics, where it is intricately connected to the spin-dependent QCD odderon, demonstrating that the SSA can be expressed in terms of transverse momentum-dependent factorization within the Color Glass Condensate effective theory. Furthermore, we present simulation results using PythiaeRHIC to assess the feasibility of measuring the charm quark Sivers function at EicC. The simulation outcomes suggest that EicC, with its unique kinematic coverage, offers distinct advantages for probing the Sivers function, which would provide compelling evidence for the existence of the elusive spin-dependent odderon.</description>

      <title>Processes $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow \phi_i\phi_j$ in Higgs Extensions of the Standard Models, II: Inert Higgs Doublet Models, Two Higgs Doublet Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study one-loop contributions to the processes $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow \phi_i\phi_j$ with CP-even Higgses $\phi_{i,j} \equiv h,~H$ at high energy photon-photon collision, within the Higgs Extensions of the Standard Models, considering Inert Higgs Doublet Models and Two Higgs Doublet Models. Analytic results for one-loop form factors of the processes under investigations are written in terms of the scalar Passarino-Veltman functions in following the standard notations of the packages {\tt LoopTools} and {\tt Collier}. As a result, the physical results can be generated by using one of the above-mentioned packages. In phenomenological studies, the enhancement factors defined as the ratio of cross-sections of $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow \phi_i\phi_j$ in the Higgs Extensions of the Standard Models over the corresponding ones for $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow hh$ in the SM, are examined in parameter space of the models under consideration.</description>

      <title>Summing large Pomeron loops in the saturation region: amplitude and multiplicity distributions for dipole-dipole scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we found the parton densities at high energies. Their expressions stems from our attempts to reconcile the exact solution to the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation, which describes the rare fluctuation in the dipole-target scattering, with the fact that this equation sums the 'fan' Pomeron diagrams. Using these densities we can calculate the contributions of large Pomeron loops to dipole-dipole scattering at high energies. We detected that the scattering matrix for this process has the same suppression as was predicted by Iancu and Mueller from their estimates of the 'rare' fluctuation in QCD.
  Applying the Abramovsky,Gribov and Kancheli cutting rules we found that the produced gluons are distributed accordingly the KNO (Koba, Nielsen and Olesen) law which leads to the entropy $S_E = \ln(x G(x,Q^2))$. $xG$ has to be in the saturation region at high energies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The particle production in photon-photon ($\gamma \gamma$) interactions present in electron-ion collisions is investigated. We present calculations for the total cross sections and event rates related to the production of light mesons [$\eta, \eta^\prime, f_0$ and $f_2$], charmonium [$\eta_c$ and $\chi_c$] and charmoniumlike [$X(3915), X(3940), X(4140)$ and $X(6900)$] states, considering the EIC, EicC, LHeC and FCC-eh energies. Our predictions demonstrate that experimental studies of these processes are feasible and useful to constrain the properties of light mesons and quarkonium states and shed some light on the configuration of the considered charmoniumlike states.</description>

      <title>Charmonium pair production at the LHCb in the ICEM using the $k_T$-factorization: DPS versus SPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the article, we study pair production of $\psi[1S]$ and $\psi[2S]$ charmonium states in the forward rapidity region of the LHCb experiment at the $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV using the improved color evaporation model and the parton Reggeization approach, which is a gauge invariant version of the $k_T$-factorization approach. Taking into account single and double parton scattering mechanisms and using the set of model parameters which have been fixed early, we compare our theoretical predictions with the recent LHCb experimental data as well as with another theoretical predictions. The numerical calculations are performed using the parton--level Monte-Carlo event generator KaTie and modified KMRW model for unintegrated parton distribution functions. We have found absolutely dominant role of the double parton scattering mechanism in the charmonium pair production at the LHCb.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the hot dense matter at LHC energies through light and heavy-flavor hadrons using non-extensive thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation and evolution of hot systems comprising charmed and light hadrons using non-extensive thermodynamics. We analyze data from pp, p--Pb, and Pb--Pb collisions at center-of-mass energies ranging from $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 2.76$~TeV to 13~TeV, measured by the CERN LHC ALICE experiment. The hadron species examined include charged pions and kaons, ${\rm K}^0_{\rm s}$, (anti)protons, $\phi$ mesons, $\Lambda^0$ hyperons, and D mesons. Employing our previously established methods, we determine the common Tsallis parameters $T_{\rm eq}$ and $q_{\rm eq}$ for each hadron type. While charm comes from earlier than light hadrons, we see that $T_{\rm eq}$ is ordered by mass, reflecting a similar ordering in the time-scale relevant for the spectrum. Our results also allow for constraining the heat capacity of the system. The current analysis thus enhances our understanding of hadron production dynamics and thermal properties in high-energy collisions.</description>

      <title>QCD Perturbation Theory: It's not what you were taught</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical quantities in QCD do not depend upon $\alpha_s(Q)$. There is no way to measure $\alpha_s(Q)$ experimentally. If those statements sound shocking, please read on. They are actually well-known facts, though ones that are constantly being ignored in the QCD literature. Renormalized perturbation theory is not an ordinary power-series expansion; its renormalization-scheme ambiguity is not merely a minor nuisance. Rather, it is a structure in which invariance under redefinitions of the coupling is a fundamental symmetry -- a symmetry that, like any other, deserves respect. I speak bluntly because without a change in mindset perturbative QCD can never become a proper, scientific enterprise.</description>

      <title>Deep Inelastic Scattering Cross Section Uncertainties in Tau Neutrino Appearance Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In neutrino experiments sensitive to multiple flavors, the analyzers may be presented with a choice of treating the uncertainties on the respective cross sections in a correlated or an uncorrelated manner. This study focuses on the charged current deep inelastic scattering (CC DIS) channel in experiments sensitive to both muon and tau neutrinos. We evaluate the ratio of the leading-order $\nu_{\tau}$ and $\nu_{\mu}$ cross sections and derive its uncertainty from the underlying parton distribution functions (PDFs). We find that, for neutrino energies above 5 GeV, the PDF-driven uncertainty on the cross section ratio is less than 3%, with a larger (2-30%) variation seen in antineutrinos at energies below 10 GeV. These results suggest that for atmospheric tau neutrino appearance analyses, the uncertainties in $\nu_{\tau}$ and $\nu_{\mu}$ DIS cross sections should be coupled, while separate treatment for the two flavors may be warranted in long-baseline experiments with an antineutrino beam. We further explore the role of the invariant hadronic mass threshold defining the onset of the DIS regime. We argue that its impact may be incorporated only if it is applied to both DIS and resonance cross sections, and if the correlations with other DIS and resonance cross section parameters are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Probing Anomalous Higgs Boson Couplings at Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, our main focus is on the $HHH$ and $VVHH$ couplings which are loosely bound. The $HHH$ coupling will determine the shape the Higgs potential and $VVHH$ couplings will tell us how the gauge bosons are coupled to the Higgs fields. We consider a few processes of Higgs boson production and decay to study these couplings. We calculate one-loop QCD and electroweak correction for these processes. In this thesis, we discuss spinor helicity formalism, which has been used in computing Feynman amplitudes for QCD and electroweak correction to these processes. We discuss one-loop Feynman integrals and one-loop electroweak renormalization and Catani-Seymour dipole subtraction scheme in this thesis. We compute all possible self-energy contributions at one-loop for electroweak renormalization. In this thesis, in the first work, we consider the process $b\bar{b}\rightarrow W^+W^-H$. Due to the non-negligible coupling of the Higgs boson with the bottom quarks, there is a dependence on the $WWHH$ coupling in this process. We find that the corrections to the final state with the longitudinally polarized $W$ bosons are large. In the second work, we study one-loop electroweak correction to $H\rightarrow \nu_e\bar{\nu_e}\nu_\mu\bar{\nu_\mu}$. We discuss $\gamma^5$-anomaly, complex mass scheme and input parameter schemes which are relevant for one-loop electroweak correction. The corrections depend on the $HHH$ and $ZZHH$ couplings. We investigate this dependence in $\kappa$-framework. In the third work, we study one-loop electroweak correction to the $H\rightarrow e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$ process. The corrections depend on $HHH$ and $ZZHH$ couplings. We observe the same behavior in the relative change of the decay width for this process as the process $H\rightarrow \nu_e\bar{\nu_e}\nu_\mu\bar{\nu_\mu}$ when we vary $HHH$ and $ZZHH$ couplings.</description>

      <title>Signature of (axial)vector operators in $B_c\to D_s^{(*)} \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistent anomalies observed in $B$ mesons related to $b \to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ transitions point to the potential for new physics beyond the Standard Model. To explore this further, we conduct an analysis of the exclusive semileptonic decays $B_c\to D_s^{(*)} \mu^+ \mu^-$ within an effective field theory formalism. We perform a global fit to new (axial)vector couplings using the current experimental data for $b \to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ transitions. We compute the branching ratios and physical observables such as forward-backward asymmetries, lepton polarization asymmetries, form factor independent observables for $B_c\to D_s^{(*)} \mu^+ \mu^-$, both within the Standard Model and in new physics scenarios. Additionally, we examine the existence of lepton flavor universality violation in the $B_c\to D_s^{(*)} \ell^+ \ell^-$ process.</description>

      <title>Loop Tree Duality with generalized propagator powers: numerical UV subtraction for two-loop Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An explicit Loop Tree Duality (LTD) formula for two-loop Feynman integrals with integer power of propagators is presented and used for a numerical UV divergence subtraction algorithm. This algorithm proceeds recursively and it is based on the $\mathcal{R}$ operator and the Hopf algebraic structure of UV divergences. After a short review of LTD and the numerical evaluation of multi-loop integrals, LTD is extended to two-loop integrals with generalized powers of propagators. The $\mathcal{R}$ operator and the tadpole UV subtraction are employed for the numerical calculation of two-loop UV divergent integrals, including the case of quadratic divergences.</description>

      <title>Binding of the three-hadron DD^{*}K system from the lattice effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT), an efficient tool for nuclear ab initio calculations, to solve the asymmetric multi-hadron systems. We take the $DD^*K$ three-body system as an illustration to demonstrate the capability of the method. Here the two-body chiral interactions between $D$, $D^*$ and $K$ are regulated with a soft lattice regulator and calibrated with the binding energies of the $T_{cc}^+$, $D^{*}_{s0}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ molecular states. We then calculate the three-body binding energy using the NLEFT and analyze the systematic uncertainties due to the finite volume effects, the sliding cutoff and the leading-order three-body forces. Even when the three-body interaction is repulsive (even as large as the infinite repulsive interaction), the three-body system has a bound state unambiguously with binding energy no larger than the $D_{s1}(2460)D$ threshold. To check the renormalization group invariance of our framework, we extract the first excited state. We find that when the ground state is fixed, the first excited states with various cutoffs coincide with each other when the cubic size goes larger. In addition, the standard angular momentum and parity projection technique is implemented for the quantum numbers of the ground and excited states. We find that both of them are S-wave states with quantum number $J^{P}=1^-$. Because the three-body state contains two charm quarks, it is easier to be detected in the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photons impinging on strong electromagnetic fields can change both momentum and helicity state, due to quantum vacuum polarisation. We investigate these effects in the collision of photons with impulsive PP-waves, which describe e.g. the fields of ultra-boosted charge distributions. We connect our results to vacuum birefringence and quantum reflection in both QED and SUSY QED. We also compare with helicity flip in plane wave backgrounds, exploring how and when known tree-level relations, relating amplitudes in PP-waves and in plane waves, extend to one-loop corrections.</description>

Abstract: General expressions for one-loop contributions associated with the lepton-flavor violating decays of the standard model-like Higgs boson $h\to e_b^\pm e_a^\mp$ and gauge boson $Z\to e^\pm_b e_a^\mp$ are introduced in the unitary gauge. The results are used to discuss these decays as new physics signals in a minimal left-right symmetric model containing only one bidoublet Higgs and a $SU(2)_R$ Higgs doublet accommodating data of neutrino oscillations and $(g-2)_{\mu}$. The numerical investigation indicates that some of these decay rates can reach the near future experimental sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Density correlations under global and local charge conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a formalism to compute spatial $n$-point correlations of a conserved charge density in a large thermal system in the canonical ensemble, with explicit results presented up to 4th order. The resulting correlators contain local and balancing terms expressed through the grand-canonical susceptibilities for any equation of state. The new formalism is used to introduce a Gaussian local baryon number conservation in (spatial) rapidity in heavy-ion collisions at LHC conditions through a modulation of the balancing term. Connection to the widely used conservation volume $V_c = k dV/dy$ approach is established, indicating that the latter is appropriate for observables within $k/2$ units around midrapidity with $k \approx \sqrt{2\pi} \sigma_y$ with $\sigma_y$ being the Gaussian rapidity width of local baryon conservation. Analysis of the experimental data of the ALICE Collaboration on net proton cumulants in central Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV constraints the range of local baryon conservation to $\sigma_{y} = 0.78^{+0.19}_{-0.16}$ units, equivalent to $V_c = (1.95^{+0.48}_{-0.39}) dV/dy$ in the conservation volume approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt photon production is highly sensitive to the distribution of quarks and gluons in free protons and nuclei and an important baseline for phenomenological studies of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. In this paper, we present a new calculation of the production of prompt photons in association with two jets at next-to-leading order in quantum chromodynamics matched to parton showers with the POWHEG method. This calculation extends our previous analysis of prompt photon production in association with one jet using \texttt{POWHEG+PYTHIA}. We investigate the role of the parton shower as an alternative description of the parton-to-photon fragmentation process and analyse correlations between the photon and the jets. In addition, we compare \texttt{POWHEG+PYTHIA} with \texttt{POWHEG+HERWIG} predictions, experimental ATLAS data for isolated photons, and a perturbative calculation at next-to-next-to-leading order. Both parton shower models bring the next-to-leading order prediction into good agreement with the experimental data and the next-to-next-to-leading order calculation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leading Fock state light-front wave functions of heavy quarkonia and $D$ and $B$ mesons are obtained from the projections of their Bethe-Salpeter wave functions on the light front. We compute therefrom their leading-twist time-reversal even transverse momentum distributions and parton distribution functions. Mirroring the behavior of parton distribution amplitudes, the support of both distributions is increasingly narrower and shifted towards larger $x$ as a function of the meson mass. The dependence of $x$ and $\k_\perp^2$ of the transverse distributions does not factorize into separate functions, and their fall-off with $\k_\perp^2$ is much slower than that of light mesons.</description>

      <title>Implications of direct detection experiments in search of mirror dark matter in Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibilities of the mirror dark sector and its potential discovery in present and future experiments. Certainly, the mirror dark matters are isomorphic to the standard model lives in the hidden dark sector, and can be investigated in direct detection experiments if kinetic mixing interaction with ordinary matter exists. In this work, we study mirror electrons and mirror nuclei dark matter kinetic mixing interactions with the germanium and xenon targets. We estimate an upper limit on kinetic mixing $\epsilon\leq 10^{-9}$ at 95\% C.L. for mirror electrons in dark plasma at local temperature ranges from 0.1 to 0.3 KeV. This limit manifests strong agreement with the experimental bound from LUX, and appreciably constrain the parameter space for the mirror electrons temperature below 0.3 KeV in the Milky Way halo around spiral galaxies. For mirror nuclei dark matter potentially viable parameter space on kinetic mixing of $10^{-11}$ to $4\cdot 10^{-10}$ can be probed at 95\% C.L for the mirror carbon, mirror oxygen to mirror neon compositions in halos within the mirror dark matter theory. In addition, we examine the dependence of the mirror nuclei dark matter scattering rate on the choice of halo model parameters, mirror nuclear form factors and demonstrate how these choices propagate to the predicted events and kinetic mixing sensitivity limits. We find the choice of halo model parameters affects the predicted sensitivity up to $(15-71)\%$ and parameterizations in nuclear form factor can lead to less than $2\%$ effect on kinetic mixing sensitivity in the allowed parameter space over the mass scale $(11-20)$ GeV. Analyzing all these aspects, we forecast direct detection experiments are highly sensitive and will allow a test of the mirror dark matter theory.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the semileptonic decay $D\to K_0^\ast(1430)\ell\nu_{\ell}$ with $\ell=(e,\mu)$ induced by $c\to s\ell\nu_{\ell}$ transition. For the key component, $D\to K_0^\ast(1430)$ transition form factors (TFFs) $f_{\pm}(q^2)$ are calculated within the framework of QCD light-cone sum rule. Then, we consider two scenarios for $K_0^\ast(1430)$-meson twist-2 distribution amplitude. For the scenario 1 (S1), we take the truncated form based on Gegenbauer polynomial series. Meanwhile, we also consider the scenario 2 (S2) constructed by light-cone harmonic oscillator model, where the model parameters are fixed by the $K_0^\ast(1430)$-meson twist-2 distribution amplitude $10$th-order $\xi$-moments calculated by using the background field theory. For the TFFs at large recoil point, we have $f_+^{\rm (S1)}(0)=0.597^{+0.122}_{-0.121}$ and $f_-^{\rm (S1)}(0)=-0.136^{+0.023}_{-0.035}$, $f_+^{\rm (S2)}(0)= 0.663^{+0.135}_{-0.134}$ and $f_-^{\rm (S2)}(0)=-0.202^{+0.026}_{-0.046}$. After extrapolating TFFs to the whole physical $q^2$-region, we calculate the branching fractions of $D^0\to K_0^{\ast +}(1430)\ell^-\bar\nu_\ell$ and $D^+\to K_0^{\ast 0}(1430)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ which at $10^{-4}$-order level for the S1 and S2 cases. Meanwhile, we predict the CKM matrix $|V_{cs}|^{\rm (S1)}=0.997^{+0.258}_{-0.172}, |V_{cs}|^{\rm (S2)}=0.903^{+0.233}_{-0.155}$, and leptonic flavour universality $\mathcal{R}^{\rm (S1)}_{K_0^*}=0.768^{+0.560}_{-0.368}, \mathcal{R}_{K_0^*}^{\rm (S2)}=0.764^{+0.555}_{-0.365}$. Finally, we discuss the angular observables of forward-backward asymmetries, lepton polarization asymmetries and $q^2$-differential flat terms for this decay.</description>

      <title>Next-to-soft threshold effects on Higgs boson production via bottom quark annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the behavior of singular leading and sub-leading logarithms, commonly referred to as the soft-virtual (SV) and next-to-soft-virtual (NSV) terms, in the production of the Higgs boson via the bottom quark annihilation channel. We derive analytic expressions at the SV+NSV resummed level, up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N3LL) accuracy in perturbative QCD, applicable to both the inclusive production cross-section and rapidity distribution. This has been achieved using an existing resummation formalism based on factorization and renormalization group (RG) invariance. A phenomenological analysis of our resummed results is performed for the 13 TeV Large Hadron Collider. Furthermore, we present the SV coefficients at the fourth order in the strong coupling and explore the impact of next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N4LL) resummation on the total cross-section.</description>

      <title>Entropy in Toy Regge models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probabilistic interpretation of the standard Regge-Gribov model with triple pomeron interactions is discussed. It is stated that introduction of probabilities within this model is not unique and depends on what is meant under the relevant substructures, The traditional interpretation in terms of partons (quarks and gluons) is shown to be external to the model, imported from the QCD, and actually referring to the single pomeron exchange without interactions. So this interpretation actually forgets the model as such. Alternative probabilities based on the pomerons as basic quantities within the model are discussed. Two different approaches are considered, based either on the pomerons in Fock's expansion of the wave function or on pomeron propagators in Feynman diagrams. These pomeron probabilities and entropy turn out to be very different from the mentioned standard ones in the purelyp obabilistic treatment. The entropy, in particular, either rises with the rapidity and saturates at a certain fixed value or first rises, reaches some maximum and goes down to zero afterwards. Possible observable manifestations of these probabilities and entropy are to be seen in the distributions of the cross-section in powers of the coupling constants to the participants. 23</description>

      <title>Various Illustrative Brief Glances at the Flavour-Cryptoexotic Tetraquark States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constituting the largest subset of multiquark states so far observed by experiment, tetraquark mesons carrying overall quark flavour quantum numbers identical to those of the (conventional) quark-antiquark mesons necessitate their particularly deliberate phenomenological analyses. A collection of (more or less recent) insights specific to the latter subclass of exotic hadrons bears the promise to enable even significant improvement in the understanding of these hadrons by theoretical approaches such as, among others, the framework of QCD sum rules.</description>

      <title>Peculiarities of Regge cuts in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As is known from the classical theory of complex angular momenta, along with the Regge poles in the complex $j$ - plane should be cuts that are generated by the poles. In QCD, the cuts are generated by exchanges of the Reggeized gluons, whose properties are strikingly different from the properties of Reggeons in classical theory, which leads to peculiarities of the formation of the cuts. The talk is devoted to the discussion of these peculiarities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks represent a recent advancement in machine learning, with the potential to outperform traditional perceptron-based neural networks across various domains as well as provide more interpretability with the use of symbolic formulas and pruning. This study explores the application of KANs to specific tasks in high-energy physics. We evaluate the performance of KANs in distinguishing multijet processes in proton-proton collisions and in reconstructing missing transverse momentum in events involving dark matter.</description>

      <title>Inclusive photoproduction of vector quarkonium in ultra-peripheral collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of using ultra-peripheral proton-lead collisions at the LHC to study inclusive vector-quarkonium photoproduction, that occurs when a quasi-real photon emitted by a fully stripped lead ion breaks a proton to produce a vector quarkonium. Owing to the extremely large energies of the colliding hadrons circulating in the LHC, the range of accessible photon-nucleon centre-of-mass energies, W_gamma+p, largely exceeds what has been and will be studied at lepton-hadron colliders, HERA and the EIC. We perform a tune to HERA photoproduction data, use this tune to predict the yields of photoproduced J/psi, and estimate the corresponding transverse-momentum reach at LHC experiments. We also model the hadroproduction background and demonstrate that inclusive photoproduction can be isolated at the LHC from such background by imposing constraints on the hadronic activity in the lead-going direction at mid, forward, or far-forward rapidities depending on the capability of the detector under consideration. We find that the resulting cross sections are large enough to be measured by ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb. We estimate the background-to-signal ratio after isolation to be of the order of 0.001 and 0.1 in the low and large transverse-momentum regions, respectively. In addition, we propose and assess the Jacquet-Blondel method to reconstruct the photon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy and the fractional energy of the quarkonium with respect to the photon.</description>

      <title>Inclusive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production in forward proton-proton and proton-lead collisions at high energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the cross section for forward $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production in proton-proton and minimum bias proton-lead collisions using the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) and Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) formalism consistently with Deep Inelastic Scattering data. The cross section for color singlet states is sensitive to a 4-point correlator of Wilson lines for which we describe in the Gaussian approximation in the large-$N_c$ limit. Furthermore, we quantify the importance of finite-$N_c$ corrections to have a small $\sim 12\%$ effect. In contrast with the generic NRQCD expectation, we show that the color singlet contribution is only $15\%$ to the total cross section. We also compare our predictions for $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production as well as for the nuclear modification ratio $R_{pPb}$ to LHCb and ALICE data. We find a good agreement at forward rapidities, except at low transverse momenta where the cross sections are overestimated.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutrinophilic mediators at FASER$\nu$, FLArE and FASER$\nu$2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High energy collider neutrinos have been observed for the first time by the FASER$\nu$ experiment. The detected spectrum of collider neutrinos scattering off nucleons can be used to probe neutrinophilic mediators with GeV-scale masses. We find that constraints on the pseudoscalar (axial vector) neutrinophilic mediator are close to the scalar (vector) case since they have similar cross section in the neutrino massless limit. We perform an analysis on the measured muon spectra at FASER$\nu$, and find that the bounds on the vector mediator from the current FASER$\nu$ data are comparable to the existing bounds at $m_{Z^\prime}\approx 0.2$ GeV. We also study the sensitivities to a neutrinophilic mediator at future Forward Physics Facilities including FLArE and FASER$\nu$2 by using both the missing transverse momentum and the charge identification information. We find that FLArE and FASER$\nu$2 can impose stronger bounds on both the scalar and vector neutrinophilic mediators than the existing bounds. The constraints on the scalar mediator can reach 0.08 (0.1) for $m_\phi\lesssim1$ GeV with (without) muon charge identification at FASER$\nu$2.</description>

      <title>Aspects of holographic Langevin diffusion in the presence of anisotropic magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the holographic Langevin diffusion coefficients of a heavy quark, when travelling through a strongly coupled anisotropic plasma in the presence of magnetic field $\mathcal{B}$. The Langevin diffusion coefficients are calculated within the membrane paradigm in the magnetic branes model which has been extensively studied to investigate the magnetic effects on various observables in strongly coupled QCD scenarios by holography. In addition to confirming some conventional conclusions, we also find several new interesting features among the five Langevin diffusion coefficients in the magnetic anisotropic plasma. It is observed that the transverse Langevin diffusion coefficients depend more on the direction of motion rather than the directions of momentum diffusion at the ultra-fast limit, while one would find an opposite conclusion when the moving speed is sufficiently low. For the Longitudinal Langevin diffusion coefficient, we find that motion perpendicular to $\mathcal{B}$ affects the Langevin coefficients stronger at any fixed velocity. We should also emphasize that all five Langevin coefficients are becoming larger with increasing velocity. We find that the universal relation $\kappa^{\parallel}&gt;\kappa^{\perp}$ in the isotropic background, is broken in a different new case that a quark moving paralleled to $\mathcal{B}$. This is one more particular example where the violation of the universal relation occurs for the anisotropic background. Further, we find the critical velocity of the violation will become larger with increasing $\mathcal{B}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charge asymmetry in the process $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ is studied taking into account a longitudinal polarization of electrons (positrons). The asymmetry arises due to interference of amplitudes corresponding to production of pions in C-odd and C-even states. It is a manifestation of $a_1(1260)$ meson in the intermediate state. Polarization leads to additional correlations in the differential cross section, which simplifies the experimental study of the process. It is shown that the charge asymmetry can reach several percent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarks for beyond the Standard Model (BSM) searches are mostly constructed around particular features of interest related to the experiment under consideration without giving due address to the results from other experiments. In this article, we present a 30-parameter MSSM phenomenological framework and benchmark points relevant for the long-lived particles and Higgs boson decays to BSM particle studies. These are extracted via scans of the model parameter space compatible with low-energy constraints from electroweak physics, B-physics, the dipole moment of the electron, and cold dark matter relic density measurements. We present four benchmark points that are illustrative on how light values of supersymmetric particles can still be. For example, neutralinos and charginos can be as low as 8 GeV, while charged Higgs and gluinos around 3 TeV. This is in sharp contrast to the expectations by conclusions derived based on simplified supersymmetric models.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Excluding Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter Based on Solar System Ephemeris"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently claimed (arXiv:2408.10799) that solar system ephemeris data can exclude primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter in the mass range $10^{18}$-$10^{22}\,$g. We show that this conclusion is based on an implausible, implicit assumption; namely the uncertainty on the solar system mass within 50 au is as small as the uncertainty on the mass of the sun. Correcting for this error, we find that ephemeris data can only constrain PBH's with mass below $10^{16}\,$g, which is already excluded by constraints on their evaporation via Hawking radiation. Correcting a further error concerning the time-averaged rate of such fluctuations nullifies even this weaker constraint.</description>

      <title>Implications of first neutrino-induced nuclear recoil measurements in direct detection experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PandaX-4T and XENONnT have recently reported the first measurement of nuclear recoils induced by the $^8$B solar neutrino flux, through the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) channel. As long anticipated, this is an important milestone for dark matter searches as well as for neutrino physics. This measurement means that these detectors have reached exposures such that searches for low mass, $\lesssim 10$ GeV dark matter cannot be analyzed using the background-free paradigm going forward. It also opens a new era for these detectors to be used as neutrino observatories. In this paper we assess the sensitivity of these new measurements to new physics in the neutrino sector. We focus on neutrino non-standard interactions (NSI) and show that -- despite the still moderately low statistical significance of the signals -- these data already provide valuable information. We find that limits on NSI from PandaX-4T and XENONnT measurements are comparable to those derived using combined COHERENT CsI and LAr data, as well as those including the latest Ge measurement. Furthermore, they provide sensitivity to pure $\tau$ flavor parameters that are not accessible using stopped-pion or reactor sources. With further improvements of statistical uncertainties as well as larger exposures, forthcoming data from these experiments will provide important, novel results for CE$\nu$NS-related physics.</description>

      <title>On the mass distribution of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The merging black hole binaries detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave observatories, may help us shed light on how such binaries form. In addition, these detections can help us probe the hypothesized primordial black holes, a candidate for the observed abundance of dark matter. In this work, we study the black-hole mass distribution obtained from the LVK binary black hole merger events. We obtain that distribution by first associating a skewed normal distribution to each event detected with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;$ 8 and then summing all such distributions. We also simulate black hole binaries from two separate populations of merging binaries. One of these is a stellar-origin population that follows a mass-distribution similar to the zero-age mass function of stars. The second population of black holes follows a Gaussian mass-distribution. Such a distribution could approximate a population of black hole binaries formed from earlier black hole mergers in dense stellar environments, or binaries of primordial black holes. For those populations, we evaluate the number of detectable events and fit their combination to the LVK observations. In our work, we rely on a wide range of stellar-origin black-hole mass distributions. We find that the observed LVK events can be fitted much better by the combination of such a stellar-origin mass distribution and a Gaussian distribution, than by the stellar-origin mass distribution alone.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of the $SO(9) \rightarrow SO(3) \times SO(6)$ Symmetry Breaking in the IKKT Matrix Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest a dynamical mechanism which explains why in the supersymmetric IKKT matrix model the $SO(9)$ symmetry of the Lagrangian is spontaneously broken to $SO(3) \times SO(6)$, allowing only three large classical spatial dimensions to emerge. The argument relies on the identification of D1-strings as stable excitations of the matrices about the cosmological background, and the absence of forces between parallel D1-string excitations. A spatial dimension can only become large if the D1-strings winding that direction can annihilate. In the absence of forces, this requires the string world sheets to intersect, a process which is highly suppressed if more than three dimensions of space are large. Implications for a recently proposed matrix cosmology scenario are discussed.</description>

      <title>Impact of extreme magnetic fields on the QCD topological susceptibility in the vicinity of the crossover region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first determination of the topological susceptibility from lattice QCD in the presence of strong background magnetic fields. Our simulations employ 2+1 flavours of stout improved staggered quarks with physical masses and cover a broad range of temperatures and magnetic field values. The results are extrapolated to the continuum limit using four different lattice spacings and an eigenvalue reweighting technique to reduce discretisation errors. For low temperatures, our calculations show an enhancement of the topological susceptibility due to the magnetic field, compatible with predictions from chiral perturbation theory. At high temperatures, we observe the impact of inverse magnetic catalysis on the susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Analytic results in aligned axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The original model of axion natural inflation produces a tensor-to-scalar ratio above the experimental limit. Aligned axion inflation admits inflationary trajectories that originate near a saddle point of the two-field potential, and terminate due to the instability of the orthogonal direction. The phenomenology of these solutions is within the current constraints, and a range of parameters will be probed by the next stage CMB experiments. We provide the analytic solution for these trajectories and very compact analytic expressions for the associated phenomenology. For parameters leading to the observed value for the scalar spectral tilt the extension of the inflationary trajectory is sub-Planckian. However, one eigenvalue of the axion kinetic matrix (in the basis that diagonalizes the potential) is trans-Planckian. Finally, we discuss the post-inflationary evolution after the instability. In some cases, the fields reach a second inflationary valley, connected to a minimum. Multiple stages of inflation might be a more general occurrence in multiple-field inflationary models with trajectories starting next to critical points.</description>

      <title>The Dark Dimension and the Grand Unification of Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark dimension scenario, predicting one extra mesoscopic dimension in the micron range, has emerged by applying various Swampland principles to the dark energy. In this note we find that realizing the grand unification of gauge forces is highly constraining in this context. Without actually constructing any GUT models, we argue that the mere assumption of grand unification of forces in this scenario, together with the experimental bounds on massive replicas of the Standard Model gauge bosons, predicts an upper bound for the GUT scale, $M_{GUT}\lesssim 10^{16}\ {\rm GeV}$. Combined with the experimental bound on the proton lifetime, this predicts that the $X$ gauge boson mediating proton decay is a 5d solitonic string of Planckian tension stretched across a length scale $L\sim ({\rm 1-10\ TeV})^{-1}$ ending on gauge branes of the same diameter $\sim L$. This leads to a mass of $M_X\sim 10^{15}-10^{16}\ {\rm GeV}$. In particular assuming grand unification in the dark dimension scenario results in a tower of Kaluza-Klein excitations of Standard Model gauge bosons on the gauge branes in the 1-10 TeV range. This suggests that the diameter/separation $L$ of the gauge branes correlates with both the weak scale $\sim 1/L$ near a TeV {\it and} the GUT scale $\sim M_5^2 L$ at $10^{16}\ {\rm GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Time Variation of the Fine-structure Constant with Quasars Detected by LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The [O III] $\lambda\lambda\ 4960,5008$ emission lines in the optical spectra of galaxies and quasars have been widely used to investigate the possible variation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ over cosmic time. In this work, we utilize the Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) quasar survey, for the first time, to measure the relative $\alpha$ variation $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ in time through the [O III] doublet method. From the LAMOST Data Release 9 quasar catalog, we refine a sample of 209 quasar spectra with strong and narrow [O III] emission lines over a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.8$. Analysis on all of the 209 spectra obtains $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = (0.5 \pm 3.7) \times 10^{-4}$, which suggests that there is no evidence of varying $\alpha$ on the explored cosmological timescales. Assuming a linear variation, the mean rate of change in $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is limited to be $(-3.4 \pm 2.4)\times 10^{-13}$ $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ in the last 7.0 Gyr. While our LAMOST-based constraint on $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is not competitive with those of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar observations, our analysis serves to corroborate the results of SDSS with another independent survey.</description>

      <title>Merging cosmologically coupled black holes: stochastic gravitational wave background and implications for pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that realistic models of (singularity-free) black holes (BHs) embedded within an expanding Universe are coupled to the large-scale cosmological dynamics, with striking consequences, including pure cosmological growth of BH masses. We examine the consequences of this growth for the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by merging supermassive cosmologically coupled BHs. We show that the predicted SGWB amplitude is enhanced relative to the standard uncoupled case, while maintaining the $\Omega_{\text{gw}} \propto f^{2/3}$ frequency scaling of the spectral energy density. For the case where BH masses grow with scale factor as $M_{\text{bh}} \propto a^3$, thus contributing as a dark energy component to the cosmological dynamics, the enhancement factor can exceed an order of magnitude. This has important consequences for the SGWB signal detected by pulsar timing arrays, whose measured amplitude is slightly larger than most theoretical predictions for the spectrum from binary BH mergers, a discrepancy which can be alleviated by the cosmological mass growth mechanism.</description>

      <title>Extreme softening of QCD phase transition under weak acceleration: first principle Monte Carlo results for gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of gluon plasma subjected to a weak acceleration using first-principle numerical Monte Carlo simulations. We use the Luttinger (Tolman-Ehrenfest) correspondence between temperature gradient and gravitational field to impose acceleration in imaginary time formalism. Under acceleration, the system resides in global thermal equilibrium. Our results indicate that even the weakest acceleration up to $a \simeq 27$ MeV drastically softens the deconfinement phase transition, converting the first-order phase transition of a static system to a soft crossover for accelerating gluons. The accelerating environment can be relevant to the first moments of the early Universe and the initial glasma regime of relativistic heavy ion collisions. In particular, our results imply that the acceleration, if present, may also inhibit the detection of the thermodynamic phase transition from quark-gluon plasma to the hadronic phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may have formed through the gravitational collapse of cosmological perturbations that were generated and stretched during the inflationary era, later entering the cosmological horizon during the decelerating phase, if their amplitudes were sufficiently large. In this article, I will briefly introduce the basic concept of PBHs and review the formation dynamics through this mechanism, the estimation of the initial spins of PBHs and the time evolution of type II fluctuations, with a focus on the radiation-dominated and (early) matter-dominated phases.</description>

      <title>Fragments of harmony amid apparent chaos: a closer look at the X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions of the galaxy RX J1301.9+2747</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are an extreme X-ray variability phenomenon associated with low-mass supermassive black holes. First discovered in the nucleus of the galaxy GSN 069, they have been so far securely detected in five other galaxies, including RX J1301.9+2747. When detected, the out-of-QPE emission (quiescence) is consistent with the high-energy tail of thermal emission from an accretion disk. We present the X-ray and radio properties of RX J1301.9+2747, both in quiescence and during QPEs. We analyse X-ray data taken during five XMM-Newton observations between 2000 and 2022. The last three observations were taken in coordination with radio observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. We also make use of EXOSAT, ROSAT, and Chandra archival observations taken between 1983 and 2009. XMM-Newton detected 34 QPEs of which 8 have significantly lower amplitudes than the others. No correlated radio/X-ray variability was observed during QPEs. In terms of timing properties, the QPEs in RX J1301.9+2747 do not exhibit the striking regularity observed in the discovery source GSN 069. In fact there is no clear repetition pattern between QPEs: the average time separation between their peaks is about four hours, but it can be as short as one, and as long as six hours. The QPE spectral properties of RX J1301.9+2747 as a function of energy are however very similar to those of GSN 069 and of other QPE sources. The quiescent emission of RX J1301.9+2747 is more complex than that of GSN 069, as it requires a soft X-ray excess-like component in addition to the thermal emission from the accretion disk. Its long-term X-ray quiescent flux variations are of low-amplitude and not strictly monotonic, with a general decay over $\sim 22$ years. We discuss our observational results in terms of some of the ideas and models that have been proposed so far for the physical origin of QPEs.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Mass Generation with four SU(2) doublet fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a single exactly massless staggered fermion in the fundamental representation of an $SU(2)$ gauge group. We utilize an nHYP-smeared fermion action supplemented with additional heavy Pauli-Villars fields which serve to decrease lattice artifacts. The phase diagram exhibits a clear two-phase structure with a conformal phase at weak coupling and a novel new phase, the Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG) phase, appearing at strong coupling. The SMG phase is confining with all states gapped and chiral symmetry unbroken. Our finite size scaling analysis provides strong evidence that the phase transition between these two phases is continuous, which would allow for the existence of a continuum SMG phase. Furthermore, the RG flows are consistent with a $\beta$-function that vanishes quadratically at the new fixed point suggesting that the $N_f=4$ flavor SU(2) gauge theory lies at the opening of the conformal window.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic fields produced in collisions of electrically charged particles at relativistic energies are strong enough to affect the dynamics of the strong interactions. In particular, it induces radiation of vector bosons by relativistic fermions. To develop deeper insight into this problem, I calculate the corresponding spectrum in constant magnetic field and analyze its angular distribution and mass dependence. As an application, I consider synchrotron radiation of virtual photon by the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

Abstract: We consider the upscattering of atmospheric neutrinos in the interior of the Earth producing heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) which subsequently decay inside large volume detectors (e.g. Super-Kamiokande or DUNE). We compute the flux of upscattered HNLs arriving at a detector, and the resultant event rate of visible decay products. Using Super-Kamiokande's atmospheric neutrino dataset we find new leading constraints for dipole couplings to any flavor with HNL masses between roughly 10 MeV and 100 MeV. For mass mixing with tau neutrinos, we probe new parameter space near HNL masses of $\sim 20$ MeV with prospects for substantial future improvements. We also discuss prospects at future experiments such as DUNE, JUNO, and Hyper-Kamiokande.</description>

      <title>Domain Wall Network: A Dual Solution for Gravitational Waves and Hubble Tension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that domain wall networks generate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) observed as a strong common power-law process in the Data Release-2 of Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. We find that a broad range of parameters, specifically wall tension around $\sigma_{\textrm{DW}} \sim (29-414 , \textrm{TeV})^3$ and wall-decay temperature within $T_d \sim 20-257 , \textrm{MeV}$, can explain this phenomenon at a $68\%$ credible level. Meanwhile, the same parameters could ease the Hubble tension if particles from these domain wall networks decay into dark radiation. We establish a direct analytical relationship, $\Omega_{\textrm{GW}}(f_p,T_0) h^2 \sim \Omega_{\textrm{rad}} h^2 ( \Omega_\nu \Delta N_{\textrm{eff}})^2$, to illustrate this coincidence, underlining its importance in the underlying physics and potential applicability to a wider range of models and data. Conversely, if the common power-law process is not attributed to domain wall networks, our findings impose tight limits on the wall tension and decay temperature.</description>

      <title>Retuning the radio astronomical search for axion dark matter with neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A model is constructed to predict the emission originating from axion-to-photon conversion in the strongly magnetized ultrarelativistic plasma of neutron stars. The acceleration and multiplicity of the charges are observed to shift the axion-induced spectral feature with respect to previous expectations. The frequency range of interest widens accordingly, and heavier dark matter axions may resonate in magnetospheric splits giving rise to detectable radio signals that could extend into the millimeter band. Ultimately, this work follows an affirmative answer to the question of whether neutron stars can give rise to any detectable high-frequency spectral feature that would allow us to probe axion dark matter of masses up to about a millielectronvolt.</description>

      <title>Coleman-Weinberg dynamics of ultralight scalar dark matter and GeV-scale right-handed neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an extension of the Standard Model by three singlet fermions and one singlet real scalar field. The scalar is an ultralight dark matter candidate whose abundance is set by dynamically induced misalignment from the Higgs portal. We focus on parameter space where the Coleman-Weinberg potential both fixes the dark matter relic abundance, and predicts the mass scale of right-handed neutrinos. The model prefers scalar masses in the range of $10 ~{\rm {\mu}eV} \lesssim m_{\phi} \lesssim 10 ~{\rm meV}$, and can be tested via direct searches for a light scalar (e.g. fifth force tests), or by searching for right-handed neutrinos in laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing a Dark Sector with Collider Physics, Direct Detection, and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assess the complementarity between colliders, direct detection searches, and gravitational wave interferometry in probing a scenario of dark matter in the early universe. The model under consideration contains a $B-L$ gauge symmetry and a vector-like fermion which acts as the dark matter candidate. The fermion induces significant a large dark matter-nucleon scattering rate, and the $Z^\prime$ field produces clear dilepton events at colliders. Thus, direct detection experiments and colliders severely constrain the parameter space in which the correct relic density is found in agreement with the data. Nevertheless, little is known about the new scalar responsible for breaking the $B-L$ symmetry. If this breaking occurs via a first-order phase transition at a TeV scale, it could lead to gravitational waves in the mHz frequency range detectable by LISA, DECIGO, and BBO instruments. The spectrum is highly sensitive to properties of the scalar sector and gauge coupling. We show that a possible GW detection, together with information from colliders and direct detection experiments, can simultaneously pinpoint the scalar self-coupling, and narrow down the dark matter mass where a thermal relic is viable.</description>

      <title>Seeing Beauty in the Quark-Gluon Plasma with Energy Correlators</title>

Abstract: Heavy quarks created in heavy-ion collisions serve as an excellent probe of the produced quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The radiation pattern of jets formed from heavy quarks as they traverse the QGP exhibits a particularly interesting structure due to the interplay of two competing effects: the suppression of small-angle radiation, also known as the ``dead-cone'' effect, and the enhancement of emitted gluons by medium-induced radiation. In this Letter, we propose a new observable, based on the energy correlator approach to jet substructure, which will allow us to disentangle the two scales associated to these two phenomena and to determine under which conditions the dead-cone is filled by medium-induced radiation. Combined with the forthcoming high-statistics measurements of heavy-flavor jets, this work provides a novel tool to unravel the dynamics of the QGP.</description>

      <title>Second resonance of the Higgs field: motivations, experimental signals, unitarity constraints</title>

Abstract: Perturbative calculations predict that the Standard Model (SM) effective potential should have a new minimum, well beyond the Planck scale, much deeper than the electroweak vacuum. As it is not obvious that gravitational effects can get so strong to stabilize the potential, most authors have accepted the metastability scenario in a cosmological perspective. This perspective is needed to explain why the theory remains trapped into our electroweak vacuum, but requires to control the properties of matter in the extreme conditions of the early universe. Alternatively, one can consider the completely different idea of a non-perturbative effective potential which, as at the beginning of the SM, is restricted to the pure $\Phi^4$ sector yet consistent with the now existing analytical and numerical studies. In this approach, where the electroweak vacuum is the lowest-energy state, besides the resonance of mass $m_h=125$ GeV defined by the quadratic shape of the potential at its minimum, the Higgs field should exhibit a second resonance with mass $690\pm10({\rm stat})\pm20({\rm sys})$ GeV associated with the zero-point energy determining the potential depth. Despite its large mass, this would couple to longitudinal $W$s with the same typical strength as the low-mass state at 125 GeV and represent a relatively narrow resonance of width $\Gamma_H=30\div 38$ GeV, mainly produced at LHC by gluon-gluon fusion. So it is interesting that, in the LHC data, one can find various indications for a new resonance in the expected mass range with a non-negligible statistical significance. As this could become an important new discovery by just adding two missing samples of RUN2 data, we outline further refinements of the theoretical predictions that could be obtained by implementing unitarity constraints, in the presence of fermion and gauge fields, with coupled-channel calculations used for meson spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Searching for axions with kaon decay at rest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a novel search strategy for axions (or hadronically coupled axion-like particles) in the mass range of $m_a \lesssim 350\,{\rm MeV}$. The search relies on kaon decay at rest, which produces a mono-energetic signal in a large volume detector (e.g.\ a tank of liquid scintillator) from axion decays $a\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ or $a\rightarrow e^+e^-$. The decay modes $K^+\to \pi^+ a$ and $a \to \gamma \gamma$ are induced by the axion's coupling to gluons, which is generic to any model which addresses the strong CP problem. We recast a recent search from MicroBooNE for $e^+e^-$ pairs, and study prospects at JSNS$^2$ and other near-term facilities. We find that JSNS$^2$ will have world-leading sensitivity to hadronically coupled axions in the mass range of $40\,\mathrm{MeV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 350\,\mathrm{MeV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fermi function $F(Z,E)$ accounts for QED corrections to beta decays that are enhanced at either small electron velocity $\beta$ or large nuclear charge $Z$. For precision applications, the Fermi function must be combined with other radiative corrections and with scale- and scheme-dependent hadronic matrix elements. We formulate the Fermi function as a field theory object and present a new factorization formula for QED radiative corrections to beta decays. We provide new results for the anomalous dimension of the corresponding effective operator complete through three loops, and resum perturbative logarithms and $\pi$-enhancements with renormalization group methods. Our results are important for tests of fundamental physics with precision beta decay and related processes.</description>

Abstract: In the limit of large nuclear charge, $Z\gg 1$, or small lepton velocity, $\beta \ll 1$, Coulomb corrections to nuclear beta decay and related processes are enhanced as $Z\alpha/\beta$ and become large or even non-perturbative (with $\alpha$ the QED fine structure constant). We provide a constructive demonstration of factorization to all orders in perturbation theory for these processes and compute the all-orders hard and soft functions appearing in the factorization formula. We clarify the relationship between effective field theory amplitudes and historical treatments of beta decay in terms of a Fermi function.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the ability of $\mu\rightarrow e$ facilities, Mu2e and COMET, to probe, or discover, new physics with their detector validation datasets. The validation of the detector response may be performed using a dedicated run with $\mu^+$, collecting data below the Michel edge, $E_e\lesssim 52$ MeV; an alternative strategy using $\pi^+\rightarrow e^+ \nu_e$ may also be considered. We focus primarily on a search for a monoenergetic $e^+$ produced via two-body decays $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ X$ or $\pi^+\rightarrow e^+X$, with $X$ a light new physics particle. Mu2e can potentially explore new parameter space beyond present astrophysical and laboratory constraints for a set of well motivated models including: axion like particles with flavor violating couplings ($\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ a$), massive $Z'$ bosons ($\mu^+ \rightarrow Z' e^+$), and heavy neutral leptons ($\pi^+\rightarrow e^+N$). The projected sensitivities presented herein can be achieved in a matter of days.</description>

Abstract: In order to study the validity of analytical formulas used in the calculation of characteristic physical quantities related to vacuum bubbles, we conduct several numerical simulations of bubble kinematics in the context of cosmological first-order phase transitions to determine potentially existing systematic uncertainties. By comparing with the analytical results, we obtain the following observations: (1) The simulated false vacuum fraction will approach the theoretical one with increasing simulated volume. When the side length of the cubic simulation volume becomes larger than 14.5 $\beta_{th}^{-1}$ , the simulated results do not change significantly; (2) The theoretical expected total number of bubbles do not agree with the simulated ones, which may be caused by the inconsistent use of the false vacuum fraction formula; (3) The different nucleation rate prefactors do not affect the bubble kinetics much; (4) The lifetime distribution in the sound shell model does not obey an exponential distribution, in such a way as to cause a suppression in the gravitational wave spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the doubly bottom state $T^-_{bb}$ composed of two bottom mesons with $J^P=1^+$. The potentials are obtained using the one-boson exchange model. With the heavy quark flavor symmetry, all the parameters in the model are determined by fitting the experimental data of doubly charmed state $T_{cc}^{+}$ from our previous work. Our analysis indicates that the isospin symmetry is well-preserved. We identify a deeply bound $T^-_{bb}$ state with quantum numbers $I(J^{P})=0(1^+)$, in contrast to the loosely bound $T_{cc}^{+}$. Additionally, we discover a resonant $T^-_{bb}$ state with $I(J^{P})=1(1^+)$. Furthermore, our investigation into the $\bar{B}\bar{B}^*$-$\bar{B}^*\bar{B}^*$ coupled channel effect reveals its important impact. The binding energy of the bound $I(J^{P})=0(1^+)$ states becomes deeper, while the resonant $T^-_{bb}$ state with $I(J^{P})=1(1^+)$ remains nearly unchanged.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions between dark matter and ordinary matter will transfer momentum, and therefore give rise to a force on ordinary matter due to the dark matter `wind.' We show that this force can be maximal in a realistic model of dark matter, meaning that an order-1 fraction of the dark matter momentum incident on a target of ordinary matter is reflected. The model consists of light ($m_\phi \lsim \text{eV}$) scalar dark matter with an effective interaction $\phi^2 \bar{\psi}\psi$, where $\psi$ is an electron or nucleon field. If the coupling is repulsive and sufficiently strong, the field $\phi$ is excluded from ordinary matter, analogous to the Meissner effect for photons in a superconductor. We show that there is a large region of parameter space that is compatible with existing constraints, where the force is large enough to be detected by existing force probes, such as satellite tests of the equivalence principle and torsion balance experiments. However, shielding of the dark matter by ordinary matter prevents existing experiments from being sensitive to the dark matter force. We show that precise measurements of spacecraft trajectories proposed to test long distance modifications of gravity are sensitive to this force for a wide range of parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on recently constructed inflationary vector dark matter production mechanisms as well as studies of magnetogenesis, we show that an inflationary dark Schwinger mechanism can generate the observed dark matter relic abundance for `dark electron' masses as light as $\sim 0.1$ eV and as heavy as $10^{12}$ GeV. The dark matter can interact very weakly via the exchange of light dark photons with a power spectrum which is peaked at very small scales, thus evading isocurvature constraints. This mechanism is viable even when (purely) gravitational particle production is negligible. Thus dark matter can be produced solely via the Schwinger effect during inflation including for light masses.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive constraints on fermionic dark matter-quark tensor interactions in direct detection experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective field theory (EFT) provides a model-independent framework for interpreting the results of dark matter (DM) direct detection experiments. In this study, we demonstrate that the two fermionic DM-quark tensor operators, $(\bar{\chi} i\sigma^{\mu\nu} \gamma^5 \chi) (\bar{q} \sigma_{\mu\nu}q)$ and $(\bar{\chi} \sigma^{\mu\nu} \chi) (\bar{q} \sigma_{\mu\nu} q)$, can contribute to the DM electric and magnetic dipole moments via nonperturbative QCD effects, in addition to the well-studied contact DM-nucleon operators. We then investigate the constraints on these two operators by considering both the contact and the dipole contributions using the XENON1T nuclear recoil and Migdal effect data. We also recast other existing bounds on the DM dipole operators, derived from electron and nuclear recoil measurements in various direct detection experiments, as constraints on the two tensor operators. For $m_\chi \lesssim 1\,\rm GeV$, our results significantly extend the reach of constraints on the DM-quark tensor operators to masses as low as $5\,\rm MeV$, with the bound exceeding that obtained by the Migdal effect with only contact interactions by an order of magnitude or so. In particular, for the operator $(\bar{\chi} \sigma^{\mu\nu}i\gamma_5 \chi) (\bar{q} \sigma_{\mu\nu}q)$ with DM mass $m_\chi \gtrsim 10\,\rm GeV$, the latest PandaX constraint on the DM electric dipole moment puts more stringent bounds than the previous direct detection limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anomalous dimension for heavy-heavy-light effective theory operators describing nuclear beta decay is computed through three-loop order in the static limit. The result at order $Z^2\alpha^3$ corrects a previous result in the literature. An all-orders symmetry is shown to relate the anomalous dimensions at leading and subleading powers of $Z$ at a given order of $\alpha$. The first unknown coefficient for the anomalous dimension now appears at $O(Z^2\alpha^4)$.</description>

      <title>Generalized eikonal identities for charged currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss QED radiative corrections to contact operators coupling two heavy fields and one light field. New eikonal identities are derived in the static limit that demonstrate the equivalence of a class of ladder graphs to an equivalent theory with a single heavy-light vertex and a background Coulomb field which communicates exclusively with the light field. We apply these new identities to nuclear beta decays and demonstrates that the "independent particle model" used by Jaus, Rasche, Sirlin \&amp; Zucchini is closely related, though not identical, to a model independent EFT calculation.</description>

      <title>Mass and decay width of $T_{ccs}$ from symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the mass and width of the doubly heavy tetraquark $T_{ccs}$ composed of a heavy diquark and a light-quark cloud with strangeness with assuming that a color antitriplet heavy diquark is a dominant component of the doubly charmed tetraquarks $T_{cc}$ and $T_{ccs}$. We construct an effective Lagrangian for masses of heavy hadrons based on the superflavor symmetry between the doubly heavy tetraquarks and the singly heavy baryons by including the terms that simultaneously break the heavy-quark and light-flavor symmetries, and predict the mass of $T_{ccs}$ as $M(T_{ccs}) = 4047\pm11$\,MeV. The comparison of this prediction with future experimental observation will give a clue to understand the color structure of the heavy diquark. We also predict the mass of $\Omega_{cc}$ as $M(\Omega_{cc}) = 3706^{+14}_{-15}\,$MeV. We next calculate the decay width of $T_{ccs}$, based on solely the light-flavor symmetry, as $\Gamma(T_{ccs}) = 42\pm 24$\,MeV.</description>

      <title>$B$-meson production at forward rapidities in $pp$ collisions at the LHC: Estimating the intrinsic bottom contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production of $B$ mesons at forward rapidities is strongly sensitive to the behavior of the gluon and bottom distribution functions for small and large values of the Bjorken - $x$ variable. In this exploratory study, we estimate the cross - section for the $B^{\pm}$ meson production in the kinematic range probed by the LHCb detector and that will be analyzed by the future Forward Physics Facility (FPF) considering the hybrid formalism, the solution of the running coupling Balitsky - Kovchegov equation and distinct descriptions for the bottom distribution function. We assume an ansatz for the intrinsic bottom component in the proton wave function, and estimate its impact on the transverse momentum, rapidity and Feynman - $x$ distributions. Our results indicate that the presence of an intrinsic bottom strongly modifies the magnitude of the cross - section at ultra - forward rapidities ($y \ge 6$), which implies an enhancement of the $B^{\pm}$ production at the FPF. Possible implications on the prompt neutrino flux at ultra-high energies are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify two metastable excited states in Sm$ ^{10+} $ highly charged ion as candidates for high accuracy optical clocks. Several atomic properties relevant to optical clock development are calculated using relativistic many-body methods. This includes energy levels, transition amplitudes, lifetimes, scalar polarizabilities, black body radiation shift, and the sensitivity to the fine structure constant variation. We found that the clock transitions are not sensitive to perturbation, e.g., relative black body radiation shifts are $\sim 10^{-19}$. The enhancement factor for the $\alpha$ variation is $\sim$ 0.8 for one clock transition and $\sim$ 16 for another.</description>

      <title>Probing the spatial distribution of gluons within the proton in the coherent vector meson production at large $|t|$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coherent production of vector mesons in photon - hadron interactions is considered one of the most promising observables to probe the QCD dynamics at high energies and the transverse spatial distribution of the gluons in the hadron wave function. In this paper, we perform an exploratory study about the dependence of the transverse momentum distributions, $d\sigma/dt$, on the model assumed for the proton density profile. We consider a set of non-Gaussian profiles and include them in the forward dipole - proton scattering amplitude associated with the IP-sat model. We demonstrate that the predictions for $d\sigma/dt$ are similar in the HERA kinematical range, but are very distinct for values of $t$ that will be probed in future colliders. In particular, the presence of diffractive dips in the $t$-distributions associated with the production of $J/\Psi$ and $\rho$ mesons is strongly dependent on the model assumed for the density profile. Similar conclusions are also derived when the non-linear effects on the dipole - target interaction are disregarded. Our results indicate that a future study of the coherent vector meson production at large - $t$ will be useful to constrain the spatial distribution of gluons within the proton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04826v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ascribed as $\rho\rho$ and $K^* \bar{K}^*$ molecular states, respectively, iso-scalar $f_0(1500)$ and $f_0(1710)$ states are expected to have iso-vector partners, potentially identified as $a_0(1450)$ and $a_0(1710)$. The predicted dominant decay modes for these two $a_0$ resonances are $a_0(1450) \to \omega\pi\pi$ and $a_0(1710) \to \omega\pi\pi,\,\phi\pi\pi$. We estimate cross sections for two-photon production of these four resonances within the hadronic molecular picture, and demonstrate that SuperKEKB's luminosity is sufficient for their observation and more precise parameter measurements.</description>

      <title>A common framework for fermion mass hierarchy, leptogenesis and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore an extension of the Standard Model designed to elucidate the fermion mass hierarchy, account for the dark matter relic abundance, and explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. Beyond the Standard Model particle content, our model introduces additional scalars and fermions. Notably, the light active neutrinos and the first two generations of charged fermions acquire masses at the one-loop level. The model accommodates successful low-scale leptogenesis, permitting the mass of the decaying heavy right-handed neutrino to be as low as 10 TeV. We conduct a detailed analysis of the dark matter phenomenology and explore various interesting phenomenological implications. These include charged lepton flavor violation, muon and electron anomalous magnetic moments, constraints arising from electroweak precision observables, and implications for collider experiments.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum properties of top quark pairs in lepton colliders with unpolarised beams, including spin correlations, entanglement, and violation of Bell inequalities. We present analytical results in the SM and in the SMEFT and discuss several practical aspects, like the choice of quantization axes and $t \bar t$ threshold effects. We also note a correspondence between parity symmetry and entanglement. We find that quantum observables exhibit a rich phenomenology in the SM, and can also provide additional leverage in detecting new physics residing at higher scales.</description>

Abstract: We examine the thin accretion disk behaviors surrounding black holes embedded in cold dark matter halos and scalar field dark matter halos. We first calculate the event horizons and derive the equations of motion and effective potential in black hole geometries with different dark matter halos. We then compute the specific energy, specific angular momentum, and angular velocity of particles moving along circular orbits. We also derive the effective potentials to find the locations of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and compare them to the Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes without the dark matter haloes. We also use the observed ISCO of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A*, to constrain the dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Two-loop electroweak corrections to the Higgs boson rare decay process $H\to Z\gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations jointly announced the first evidence of the rare Higgs boson decay channel $H\to Z\gamma$, with a ratio of $2.2\pm 0.7$ times the leading order standard model (SM) prediction. In order to face this challenge, it is urgent to produce an even more accurate calculation within the SM. To this end, we calculate in this paper the next-to-leading order (NLO) electroweak (EW) corrections to the $H\to Z\gamma$ process, in which the NLO quantum chromodynamics (QCD) corrections were found tiny. Our calculation finds that the inclusion of NLO EW corrections greatly enhances the prediction reliability. To tame the theoretical uncertainty, we adopt five different renormalization schemes. Combining our result with previous NLO QCD corrections and the signal-background interference, we conclude that the excess in $H\to Z\gamma$ cannot be explained within the SM. In fact, the incompatibility between the SM prediction and the LHC measurement of the concerned process is exacerbated upon considering the higher order EW corrections, which implies that something beyond the SM could be involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Multiverse can arise from landscapes without de Sitter minima. It can be populated during a period of eternal inflation without trans-Planckian field excursions and without flat potentials. This Multiverse can explain the values of the cosmological constant and of the weak scale. In the process of proving these statements we derive a few simple, but counter-intuitive results. We show that it is easy to write models of eternal inflation compatible with the distance and refined de Sitter conjectures. Secondly, tunneling transitions that move fields from a lower-energy vacuum to a higher-energy vacuum and generate baby Universes are possible, and occur during eternal inflation. Finally, we relax the assumption of no de Sitter minima and show that this more standard Multiverse can be populated by Coleman-De Luccia transitions in about 100 $e$-folds of inflation.</description>

      <title>Producing Fully-Charmed Tetraquarks via Charm Quark Fragmentation in Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD), we calculate the fragmentation function for a charm quark into an $S$-wave fully-charmed tetraquark, denoted as $T_{4c}$. The charm-to-$T_{4c}$ fragmentation function is expressed as a sum of products of the perturbatively calculable short-distance coefficients and the nonperturbative long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs). The short-distance coefficients are ascertained through the perturbative matching procedure at lowest order in $\alpha_{s}$ expansion. The LDMEs are approximated using the $T_{4c}$ four-body wave functions at the origin, which have been evaluated by various phenomenological potential models in literature. Incorporating the celebrated QCD factorization and the charm-to-$T_{4c}$ fragmentation function, we predict the $T_{4c}$ production rate at high transverse momentum $p_T$ regime in colliders. %After implementing appropriate kinematic constraints, Both the differential distribution over $p_T$ and the integrated cross sections are predicted at the \texttt{LHC}. The cross sections for $T_{4c}$ states production can reach several femtobarns to several hundreds femtobarns, suggesting a substantial potential for $T_{4c}$ event production at the \texttt{LHC}. Additionally, we estimate for the photoproduction of $T_{4c}$ in electron-proton ($ep$) collisions. It is observed that the cross sections for these processes are moderate at the \texttt{HERA} and \texttt{EIC}, and relatively small at the \texttt{EicC}. Given the luminosities of these colliders, the prospect of detecting these fully-charmed tetraquarks at $ep$ colliders is somewhat challenging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversion-driven freeze-out is an appealing mechanism to explain the observed relic density while naturally accommodating the null-results from direct and indirect detection due to a very weak dark matter coupling. Interestingly, the scenario predicts long-lived particles decaying into dark matter with lifetimes favorably coinciding with the range that can be resolved at the LHC. However, the small mass splitting between the long-lived particle and dark matter renders the visible decay products soft, challenging current search strategies. We consider four different classes of searches covering the entire range of lifetimes: heavy stable charge particles, disappearing tracks, displaced vertices, and missing energy searches. We discuss the applicability of these searches to conversion-driven freeze-out and derive current constraints highlighting their complementarity. For the displaced vertices search, we demonstrate how a slight modification of the current analysis significantly improves its sensitivity to the scenario.</description>

      <title>Vector dark matter and LHC constraints, including a 95 GeV light Higgs boson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study LHC searches for an extension of the Standard Model (SM) by exploiting an additional Abelian $U_D(1)$ gauge symmetry and a complex scalar Higgs portal. As the scalar is charged under this gauge symmetry, a vector dark matter (VDM) candidate can satisfy the observed relic abundance and limits from direct dark matter (DM) searches. The ATLAS and CMS experiments have developed a broad search program for the DM candidates, including associate production of Higgs boson, $Z$ boson, and top quark that couple to DM. In this paper, we perform an extensive analysis to constrain the model by using these experiments at LHC. It can be seen that the LHC results can exclude some parts of the parameter space that are still allowed by relic density and the direct detection searches. Using the LHC results, all scalar Higgs portal masses are excluded for the light VDM. Furthermore, exclusion limits on the parameter space of the model by using the new results of the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations for a new light Higgs boson with mass $\sim95~\rm GeV$ are provided.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corrections to the Decay Law in Flight</title>

Abstract: The deviation of the decay law from the exponential is a well known effect of quantum mechanics. Here we analyze the relativistic survival probabilities, $S(t,p)$, where $p$ is the momentum of the decaying particle and provide analytical expressions for $S(t,p)$ in the exponential (E) as well as the nonexponential (NE) regions at small and large times. Under minimal assumptions on the spectral density function, analytical expressions for the critical times of transition from the NE to the E at small times and the E to NE at large times are derived. The dependence of the decay law on the relativistic Lorentz factor, $\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$, reveals several interesting features. In the short time regime of the decay law, the critical time, $\tau_{st}$, shows a steady increase with $\gamma$, thus implying a larger NE region for particles decaying in flight. Comparing $S(t,p)$ with the well known time dilation formula, $e^{-\Gamma t/\gamma}$, in the exponential region, an expression for the critical $\gamma$ where $S(t,p)$ deviates most from $e^{-\Gamma t/\gamma}$ is presented. This is a purely quantum correction. Under particular conditions on the resonance parameters, there also exists a critical $\gamma$ at large times which decides if the NE region shifts backward or forward in time as compared to that for a particle at rest. All the above analytical results are supported by calculations involving realistic decays of hadrons and leptons.</description>

      <title>Primordial monopoles, black holes and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how topologically stable superheavy magnetic monopoles and primordial black holes can be generated at observable levels by the waterfall field in hybrid inflation models based on grand unified theories. In $SU(5) \times U(1)_\chi$ grand unification, the monopole mass is of order $4 \times 10^{17}$ GeV, and it carries a single unit ($2 \pi /e$) of Dirac magnetic charge as well as screened color magnetic charge. The monopole density is partially diluted to an observable value, and accompanied with the production of primordial black holes with mass of order $10^{17}$-$10^{19}$ g which may make up the entire dark matter in the universe. The tensor to scalar ratio $r$ is predicted to be of order $10^{-5}$ - $10^{-4}$ which should be testable in the next generation of CMB experiments such as CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD. The gravitational wave spectrum generated during the waterfall transition is also presented. The observed baryon asymmetry can be explained via leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Particle-Particle Correlations and the Ridge Effect in Proton-Proton Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, the study of particle-particle correlations in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions constitutes a pivotal frontier in the effort to understand the fundamental dynamics of the strong force. To the best of our knowledge, we employ for the first time the BFKL dynamics implemented in a Monte Carlo code in momentum space to compute final state correlations in proton-proton collisions. Our present work aims to investigate whether the particular dynamics of the high-energy limit of QCD can contribute to the long-range rapidity correlations and the enigmatic ridge effect in proton-proton collisions.</description>

      <title>High-precision analysis of radiative decays in singly heavy baryons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study the radiative decays of singly heavy baryons, a crucial aspect of their spectroscopic behavior. To enhance the accuracy of our calculations, we utilize numerical spatial wave functions for the singly heavy baryons obtained through the Gaussian Expansion Method, which also yields their mass spectrum. As hadron spectroscopy enters an era of high precision, we believe our study of the radiative decays of singly heavy baryons will provide valuable insights for further exploration of these particles.</description>

      <title>Searching for signatures of new physics in $B \to K \, \nu \, \overline{\nu}$ to distinguish between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a model-independent analysis of the distinct signatures of various generic new physics possibilities in the decay $B \to K \, \nu \, \overline{\nu}$ by analyzing the branching ratio as well as the missing mass-square distribution. Considering the final neutrinos to be of the same flavor with non-zero mass, we discuss the new physics contributions for both Dirac and Majorana neutrino possibilities. In our study, we utilize the analytical relations among form factors in semi-leptonic $B \to K$ transitions, which are consistent with current lattice QCD predictions to a very high numerical accuracy. We provide constraints on different new physics parameters, taking into account the recent measurement of $B^+ \to K^+ \, \nu \, \overline{\nu}$ branching ratio by the Belle-II collaboration. In future, if the missing mass-square distribution for $B^+ \to K^+ \, \nu \, \overline{\nu}$ decay gets reported by Belle-II with analysis of more events than their present data set, one can not only investigate possible new physics effects in these decays, but also probe the Dirac/Majorana nature of the neutrinos using quantum statistics, since a difference between the two cases is known to exist in the presence of non-standard neutrino interactions.</description>

      <title>Determination of Strong Coupling Constant from Inclusive Semileptonic Decays of Charmed Mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing the heavy quark expansion model with the kinetic scheme, we evaluate $\alpha_S(m_c^2)$, the strong coupling constant at the charm quark mass $m_c$ with data on inclusive semileptonic decays of charmed mesons. Using the experimental values of semileptonic decay widths of the $D^0$ and the $D^+$, the value of $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ is determined to be $0.445\pm0.009\pm0.114$, where the first uncertainty is experimental and the second systematic. This reported $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ is in good agreement with the value of $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ calculated by running $\alpha_S(m_Z^2)$ at the $Z^0$ boson mass $m_Z$ with the renormalization group evolution equation. In addition, values of $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ obtained individually from each of the $D^0$, $D^+$, and $D_s^+$ mesons are found to be consistent being of the same origin.</description>

      <title>Q-Balls in the presence of attractive force</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Q-balls are non-topological solitons in field theories whose stability is typically guaranteed by the existence of a global conserved charge. A classic realization is the Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin (FLS) Q-ball in a two-scalar system where a real scalar $\chi$ triggers symmetry breaking and confines a complex scalar $\Phi$ with a global $U(1)$ symmetry. A quartic interaction $\kappa \chi^2|\Phi|^2$ with $\kappa&gt;0$ is usually considered to produce a nontrivial Q-ball configuration, and this repulsive force contributes to its stability. On the other hand, the attractive cubic interaction $\Lambda \chi |\Phi|^2$ is generally allowed in a renormalizable theory and could induce an instability. In this paper, we study the behavior of the Q-ball under the influence of this attractive force which has been overlooked. We find approximate Q-ball solutions in the limit of weak and moderate force couplings using the thin-wall and thick-wall approximations respectively. Our analytical results are consistent with numerical simulations and predict the parameter dependencies of the maximum charge. A crucial difference with the ordinary FLS Q-ball is the existence of the maximum charge beyond which the Q-ball solution is classically unstable. Such a limitation of the charge fundamentally affects Q-ball formation in the early Universe and could plausibly lead to the formation of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>$\tau$-lepton pair spin in proton-proton LHC collisions for anomalous dipole moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin correlations in the pair of $\tau$ leptons produced in the high-energy proton-proton collisions are studied. The invariant mass of the $\tau$-lepton pair is chosen close to $Z$-boson mass, in these conditions $Z$-boson exchange gives the dominant contribution to the Drell-Yan mechanism. The interaction of $Z$ boson with $\tau$ lepton, in addition to the Standard Model couplings, can include weak anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments (or form-factors) of the $\tau$ lepton. Dependence of elements of the $pp$ spin-correlation matrix on the weak anomalous moments is determined for various regions of the rapidity of the $\tau$-lepton pair. Based on this calculation, we construct a semi-realistic observable built on the momenta of pions in the $\tau^\mp \to \pi^\mp \nu_\tau$ and $\tau^\pm \to \rho^\pm \nu_\tau \to \pi^\pm \pi^0 \nu_\tau$ decay channels, and show that this observable can be sensitive to the weak anomalous dipole moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the well-known Heisenberg uncertainty relations and Landau-Peierls uncertainty relations implicitly contain ``hidden'' angular variables, which belong to new uncertainty relations. Based on the obtained relations, we derive a formula for estimating the speed $U^*$ of a virtual particle in indirect measurements. We applied the theory of indirect measurements and the derived formula to estimate the module of the group velocity of virtual photons from the DIS HERA data. The HERA data indicate that the speed of virtual photons exceeds the speed of light $c$ in free space, $U^*&gt;c$. The properties of virtual photons and a hypothetical tachyon particle are almost identical. It is found that in the realm of particle interaction, the new angular parameters are closely related to the type of the phase-space geometry and dimensionality of the space-time continuum. It is suggested that the problem of the normalization condition $U^* =c$ at $Q^2=0\, \rm{GeV}^2$ can be solved naturally within the framework of ``Two-Time Physics'' developed by I. Bars. 2T-physics is the theory with local symplectic $\mathrm{Sp(2,R)}$ gauge symmetry in phase-space and the space-time geometry of signature $\mathrm{(1+1',d+1')}$ with one extra time-like and one extra space-like dimensions.</description>

      <title>X(2370) glueball-like particle productions in $e^+e^-$ collisions at the BESIII energy and in pp collisions at the LHC energy with PACIAE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the BESIII newest observation of X(2370) glueball-like particle, we search its productions in both $e^+e^-$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 4.95 GeV and proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV with a parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE. In this model, the final partonic state (FPS) and the final hadronic state (FHS) are consecutively simulated and recorded. The X(2370) glueball- or tetraquark-state is then, respectively, recombined by two gluons or four quarks $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ in the FPS using the quantum statistical mechanics inspired dynamically constrained phase-space coalescence (DCPC) model. The X(2370) molecular-state is recombined by the baryon-antibaryon of $\Lambda$-$\bar{\Lambda}$ or $\Sigma$-$\bar{\Sigma}$, or by three mesons of $\pi^+\pi^{-}\eta'$, $K^+K^-\eta'$, or $K_S^0K_S^0\eta'$ in the FHS using DCPC model. In both $e^+e^-$ and pp collisions, significant discrepancies in the yields, the transverse momentum spectra and the rapidity distributions among the X(2370) glueball-, tetraquark-, and molecular-state are observed. These discrepancies are proposed as valuable criteria identifying the X(2370) different states from each other. Our results not only support the BESIII observation of glueball-like particle $\rm X(2370)$ production in $e^+e^-$ collisions, but also serve as a prediction for the $\rm X(2370)$ production in pp collisions. We strongly suggest the experimental measurement of the X(2370) glueball-like particle production in pp collisions at the LHC energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism that the spin alignment of vector meson $\phi$ and $K^{*0}$ in most central heavy ion collisions is induced by intrinsic QCD dynamics without external vortical/ magnetic fields. The local spin density fluctuation of quarks due to the axial-vector and tensor interactions between quarks can induce the spin alignments of vector meson. It is found that axial-vector interaction results in $\rho_{00}&lt;1/3$ for the spin alignment of $\phi$ meson, while tensor interaction results in $\rho_{00}&gt;1/3$. We argue that the spin alignment of $K^{*0}$ due to the spin density fluctuation from flavor-mixing would be a signature or hint of instanton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At ICHEP 2024 CMS has published RUN2 results for X650-&gt;ZZ-&gt;4leptons and reached the conclusion that there is no evidence for a scalar resonance H650 decaying into ZZ, as was also concluded by ATLAS using an MVA analysis optimised for a scalar particle. Since this resonance is indicated into ZZ in a Cut Based Analysis and into three other modes: WW, H95H125 and A450Z, the present paper is an attempt to understand these apparent contradictions. Our conclusion, to be confirmed by ATLAS and CMS experiments, is that strict selections for the reaction H650-&gt;ZZ mode seem inadequate, cutting as much into the signal than into the background, therefore reducing its statistical significance. A possible interpretation of this behaviour is that these selections are inefficient for a tensor particle produced by VBF and decaying into ZZ with an angular distributions similar to the Drell Yan background. If true, our description of the various findings in term of the Georgi Machacek model needs to be deeply revised, which is attempted in the present note. A scenario with T650 as a tensor resonance is presented which naturally accommodates WW/ZZ and H95H125 decays, while we suggest that A450Z coud come from a scalar resonance degenerate in mass with T650.</description>

      <title>Power corrections to quasi-distribution amplitudes of a heavy meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently demonstrated that lightcone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) for a heavy meson, defined in the heavy quark limit, can be extracted by simulating quasi-distribution amplitudes on the lattice with a large meson momentum $P^z$. This extraction involves a two-step procedure. In the first-step, the quasi-distribution amplitudes are matched onto the QCD LCDAs in the large $P^z$ limit. In the second step, the QCD LCDAs are matched onto the desired LCDAs defined in HQET. In this work, we present the $m_H^{2n}/(P^z)^{2n}$ and $\Lambda_\text{QCD}^2/(P^z)^2$ corrections in the first step with $m_H$ being the heavy meson mass. To account for $m_H^{2n}/(P^z)^{2n}$ corrections, we employ two methods: the moment relation that can provide mass corrections to all orders, and a leading-twist projector that gives the leading-order mass corrections. For the $\Lambda_\text{QCD}^2/(P^z)^2$ corrections, we employ a renormalon model that addresses the renormalon ambiguity stemming from the divergence of the perturbative series. We adopt two parametrizations for QCD LCDAs to conduct a numerical analysis. The results suggest that these corrections are typically smaller than 20\% in most regions, and should be included in a precision analysis. These findings will serve as a valuable guide for future studies on heavy meson LCDAs, particularly in the context of Lattice QCD, where accounting for such corrections is crucial for improving the accuracy and reliability of the results.</description>

      <title>The $g^6$ pressure of hot Yang-Mills theory: Canonical form of the integrand</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present major progress towards the determination of the last missing piece for the pressure of a Yang-Mills plasma at high temperatures at order $g^6$ in the strong coupling constant. This order is of key importance due to its role in resolving the long-standing infrared problem of finite-temperature field theory within a dimensionally reduced effective field theory setup. By systematically applying linear transformations of integration variables, or momentum shifts, we resolve equivalences between different representations of Feynman sum-integrals. on the integrand level, transforming those into a canonical form. At the order $g^6$, this results in reducing a sum of O(100000) distinct sum-integrals which are produced from all four-loop vacuum diagrams down to merely 21. Furthermore, we succeed to map 11 of those onto known lower-loop structures. This leaves only 10 genuine 4-loop sum-integrals to be evaluated, thereby bringing the finalization of three decades of theoretical efforts within reach.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from thermal heavy scalar dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a gauge singlet scalar with mass around $1-10$ TeV as a thermal heavy dark matter candidate along with a dilaton as a Higgs portal mediator in a dimensionless scalar extension of the Standard Model. We demonstrate analytically that such a model gives rise to very strong first-order electroweak phase tyransition through supercooling. We calculate the corresponding gravitational wave signals due to bubble collisions during the phase transition. The produced gravitational waves can be detected by future space-based gravitational wave detectors in the frequency range from $10^{-4}$ Hz to $0.1$ Hz.</description>

      <title>Study of the heavy quarks energy loss through medium polarization, elastic collision and radiative processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy quarks serve as crucial probes for exploring the properties of the hot and dense medium formed in heavy-ion collision experiments. Understanding the modification of their energy as they traverse the medium is a focal point of research, with various authors extensively studying this phenomenon. This study specifically concentrates on the equilibrium phase, the quark-gluon plasma, and offers a comparative analysis of heavy quark energy loss through medium polarization, elastic collisions, and radiation. Notably, while previous studies have compared polarization loss and radiation, our work extends this by incorporating elastic collisions for a more comprehensive examination. The significance of medium polarization, particularly at low momentum, is underscored, as it has been found to contribute substantially. The formalism for energy loss and drag coefficient in each case is presented, followed by the calculation of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) for a holistic comparative study.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Constant, Dark Matter and the ElectroWeak Scale meet in the Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Swampland program, which looks for low energy theories consistent with quantum gravity, has led to the introduction of a dark dimension stemming from the cosmological constant. We show that the same argument leads to the emergence of the electroweak scale, once the dark dimension is realised in a warped background. A second warped extra dimension at the TeV scale is, therefore, postulated, where the long-standing problem of the hierarchy between the electroweak and the Planck scales can be addressed. Furthermore, standard model contributions to the cosmological constant are tamed, together with the gravitational ones. In the emergent holistic picture of gravity and gauge interactions, both Planck and the electroweak scales are emergent from a theory with two fundamental scales: $10^{-2}$ eV and $10^{10}$ GeV, which are of geometric origin and, following the Distance Conjecture, natural. Hence, a bridge is established between the two standard models of particle physics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Confinement Transitions in QCD from Symmetry Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In gauge theories with fundamental matter there is typically no sharp way to distinguish confining and Higgs regimes, e.g. using generalized global symmetries acting on loop order parameters. It is standard lore that these two regimes are continuously connected, as has been explicitly demonstrated in certain lattice and continuum models. We point out that Higgsing and confinement sometimes lead to distinct symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases -- necessarily separated by a phase transition -- for ordinary global symmetries. We present explicit examples in 3+1 dimensions, obtained by adding elementary Higgs fields and Yukawa couplings to QCD while preserving parity P and time reversal T. In a suitable scheme, the confining phases of these theories are trivial SPTs, while their Higgs phases are characterized by non-trivial P- and T-invariant theta-angles $\theta_f, \theta_g = \pi$ for flavor or gravity background gauge fields, i.e. they are topological insulators or superconductors. Finally, we consider conventional three-flavor QCD (without elementary Higgs fields) at finite $U(1)_B$ baryon-number chemical potential $\mu_B$, which preserves P and T. At very large $\mu_B$, three-flavor QCD is known to be a completely Higgsed color superconductor that also spontaneously breaks $U(1)_B$. We argue that this high-density phase is in fact a gapless SPT, with a gravitational theta-angle $\theta_g = \pi$ that safely co-exists with the $U(1)_B$ Nambu-Goldstone boson. We explain why this SPT motivates unexpected transitions in the QCD phase diagram, as well as anomalous surface modes at the boundary of quark-matter cores inside neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves in Radiative Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition due to the effects of one-loop radiative corrections of Yukawa couplings between the inflaton and a dark fermion in a non-supersymmetric hybrid inflationary model. We obtain a spectral index $n_s$, and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, consistent with the current Planck data. We identify parameter space where PBHs can be the entire dark matter (DM) candidate of the universe or a fraction of it. Our predictions are consistent with any existing constraints of PBH from microlensing, BBN, CMB, etc. Moreover, the scenario is also testable via induced gravitational waves (GWs) from first-order scalar perturbations detectable in future observatories such as LISA and ET. For instance, with inflaton mass $m \sim 2\times 10^{12}$ GeV, $m_N \sim 5.4\times 10^{15}$ GeV, we obtain PBHs of around $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$ mass that can explain the entire abundance of DM and predict GWs with amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2$ $\sim 10^{-9}$ with peak frequency $f$ $\sim$ $0.1$ Hz in LISA. By explicitly estimating fine-tuning we show that the model has very mild tuning. We discuss successful reheating at the end of the inflationary phase via the conversion of the waterfall field into standard model (SM) particles. We also briefly speculate a scenario where the dark fermion can be a possible heavy right-handed neutrino (RHN) which is responsible for generating the SM neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. The RHN can be produced due to waterfall field decay and its subsequent decay may also explain the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe via leptogenesis. We find the reheat temperature $T_R\lesssim5\times10^9$~GeV that explains the matter-anti-matter asymmetry of the universe.</description>

      <title>Numerical challenges for energy conservation in N-body simulations of collapsing self-interacting dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) halos can be subject to gravothermal collapse if the DM is not collisionless, but engaged in strong self-interactions. When the scattering can efficiently transfer heat from the centre to the outskirts, the central region of the halo collapses and reaches densities much higher than those for collisionless DM. This phenomenon is potentially observable in studies of strong lensing. Current theoretical efforts are motivated by observations of surprisingly dense substructures. A comparison with observations requires accurate predictions. One method to obtain such predictions is to use N-body simulations. Collapsed halos are extreme systems that pose challenges when applying state-of-the-art codes to model self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We investigate the root of such problems, with a focus on energy non-conservation and discuss possible strategies to avoid them. We ran N-body simulations, with and without SIDM, of an isolated DM-only halo and we adjusted the numerical parameters to check the accuracy of the simulation. We find that not only the numerical scheme for SIDM can lead to energy non-conservation, but also the modelling of gravitational interaction and the time integration are problematic. The issues we find are: (a) particles changing their time step in a non-time-reversible manner; (b) the asymmetry in the tree-based gravitational force evaluation; and (c) SIDM velocity kicks breaking the time symmetry. Tuning the parameters of the simulation allows us to conserve energy not only at early stages of the evolution, but also later on. However, the cost of the simulations becomes prohibitively large. Some of the problems that make the simulations of the gravothermal collapse phase inaccurate can be overcome by choosing appropriate numerical schemes. However, other issues still pose a challenge. Our findings motivate further works on addressing these challenges.</description>

      <title>The $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ twisted gradient flow strong coupling without topological freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of topology on the lattice determination of the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ strong coupling renormalized via gradient flow. To deal with the topological freezing of standard local algorithms, the definition of the coupling is usually projected onto the zero topological sector. However, it is not obvious that this definition is not biased by the loss of ergodicity. We instead avoid the topological freezing using a novel algorithm, the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions. The comparison with a standard algorithm shows that, even in the case where the latter is severely frozen, one obtains the same projected coupling. Moreover, we show that the two definitions of the coupling, projected and non-projected, lead to the same flow of the renormalization scale. Our results imply that projecting the coupling does not affect the determination of the dynamically-generated scale of the theory $\Lambda$, as obtained through the step-scaling method.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Goldstone Modes in Magnetized $T^{2n}$ Extra Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a $U(1)$ gauge theory on $M^4\times T^4$ with background magnetic fluxes. We show that a theory including arbitrary fluxes can always be studied in a theory involving only diagonal fluxes by appropriate coordinate transformations. It is found that the number of independent magnetic fluxes is equal to the rank of the classical value of the field strength matrix, ${\rm rank}\langle F\rangle$. The number of massless zero modes induced from extra components of higher-dimensional gauge field (Wilson-line scalar field), is also determined by ${\rm rank}\langle F\rangle$. We explicitly confirm that the quantum corrections due to the matter fermion to the squared mass of Wilson-line scalar field cancel out at one-loop level. For this purpose, we derive the fermion mass spectrum on $M^4\times T^4$ with arbitrary fluxes. By taking the flux diagonal basis, creation and annihilation operators for Kaluza-Klein quantum numbers are defined appropriately. Our results are easily generalized to the case of $M^4\times T^{2n}~(n\geq3)$.</description>

      <title>Astrophysics and Nuclear Physics Informed Interactions in Dense Matter: Inclusion of PSR J0437-4715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how vector-isoscalar and vector-isovector interactions can be determined within the density regime of neutron stars (NSs), while fulfilling nuclear and astrophysics constrains. We make use of the Chiral Mean Field (CMF) model, a SU(3) nonlinear realization of the sigma model within the mean-field approximation, for the first time within a Bayesian analysis framework. We show that neutron-matter $\chi$EFT constraints at low density are only satisfied if the vector-isovector mixed interaction term is included, e.g., a $\omega^2\rho^2$ term. We also show the behavior of the model with respect to the conformal limit. We demonstrate that the CMF model is able to predict a value for the parameter $d_c$ related to the trace anomaly and its derivative takes values below 0.2 above four times saturation density within a hadronic version of the model that does not include hyperons or a phase transition to deconfined matter. We compare these effects with results from other (non-chiral) Relativistic Mean Field models to assess how different approaches to incorporating the same physical constraints affect predictions of NS properties and dense matter equations of state. We also include data from the gravitation wave event GW230529 detected by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration and the most recent radius measurement of PSR J0437-4715 from the NASA NICER mission. Our analysis reveals that this new NICER measurement leads to an average reduction of approximately $\sim 0.1$ km radius in the posterior of the NS mass-radius relationship.</description>

      <title>Coupling renormalization flow in the strongly interacting regime of an asymptotically free quantum field theory in four dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a scalar quantum field theory with global $O(N)^3$ symmetry in four Euclidean dimensions and solve it numerically in closed form in the large-N limit. For imaginary tetrahedral coupling the theory is asymptotically free, with stable and real quantum effective action. We demonstrate the dynamical build-up of a strong interaction as the correlation length increases in a regime where the coupling renormalization flow remains well defined in the infrared. This is in contrast to perturbative results of asymptotically free theories, which predict that the coupling becomes ill-defined in the infrared, like in quantum chromodynamics. These properties make the model an important laboratory for the study of strong-coupling phenomena in quantum field theory from first principles.</description>

Abstract: A bouncing Universe avoids the big-bang singularity. Using the time-like and null Raychaudhhuri equations, we explore whether the bounce near the big-bang, within a broad spectrum of modified theories of gravity, allows for cosmologically relevant power-law solutions under reasonable physical conditions. Our study shows that certain modified theories of gravity, such as Stelle gravity, do not demonstrate singularity resolution under any reasonable conditions, while others including $f(R)$ gravity and Brans-Dicke theory can demonstrate singularity resolution under suitable conditions. For these theories, we show that the accelerating solution is slightly favoured over ekypyrosis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constrain the parameters of the $k$-essence scalar field model with inverse square and exponential potentials using data sets including Pantheon+SHOES and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) of Type Ia supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from SDSS and DESI surveys, and direct measurements of the Hubble parameter and redshift obtained from the differential age method (CC). We also provide a brief perspective on the dynamical evolution of both models and derive stability constraints on the model parameters, which are then used to set appropriate priors. We adopt a Bayesian inference procedure to estimate the model parameters that best fit the data. A comprehensive analysis in light of observational data shows that the $k$-essence model fits well across all data combinations. However, according to the BIC criterion, the $\Lambda$CDM model provides a slightly better fit compared to the $k$-essence model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various gravity theories beyond general relativity have been rigorously investigated in the literature such as Horndeski and degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. In general, numerous model parameters are involved in such theories, which should be constrained to test the theories with experiments and observations. We construct the kurtosis consistency relations, calculated based on matter density fluctuations, in which the information of gravity theories is encoded. We derive two independent consistency relations that should hold in the framework of the DHOST theories and argue that such consistency relations would be useful for testing gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Self-dualities and Galois symmetries in Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that all Feynman integrals within a given family can be expressed as a finite linear combination of master integrals. The master integrals naturally group into sectors. Starting from two loops, there can exist sectors made up of more than one master integral. In this paper we show that such sectors may have additional symmetries. First of all, self-duality, which was first observed in Feynman integrals related to Calabi--Yau geometries, often carries over to non-Calabi--Yau Feynman integrals. Secondly, we show that in addition there can exist Galois symmetries relating integrals. In the simplest case of two master integrals within a sector, whose definition involves a square root $r$, we may choose a basis $(I_1,I_2)$ such that $I_2$ is obtained from $I_1$ by the substitution $r \rightarrow -r$. This pattern also persists in sectors, which a priori are not related to any square root with dependence on the kinematic variables. We show in several examples that in such cases a suitable redefinition of the integrals introduces constant square roots like $\sqrt{3}$. The new master integrals are then again related by a Galois symmetry, for example the substitution $\sqrt{3} \rightarrow -\sqrt{3}$. To handle the case where the argument of a square root would be a perfect square we introduce a limit Galois symmetry. Both self-duality and Galois symmetries constrain the differential equation.</description>

      <title>Holographic Lifshitz flows</title>

Abstract: Without Lorentz symmetry, generic fixed points of the renormalization group (RG) are labelled by their dynamical (or `Lifshitz') exponent $z$. Hence, a rich variety of possible RG flows arises. The first example is already given by the standard non-relativistic limit, which can be viewed as the flow from a $z=1$ UV fixed point to a $z=2$ IR fixed point. In strongly coupled theories, there are good arguments suggesting that Lorentz invariance can emerge dynamically in the IR from a Lorentz violating UV. In this work, we perform a generic study of fixed points and the possible RG flows among them in a minimal bottom-up holographic model without Lorentz invariance, aiming to shed light on the possible options and the related phenomenology. We find: i) A minor generalization of previous models involving a massive vector field with allowed self-couplings leads to a much more efficient emergence of Lorentz invariance than in the previous attempts. Moreover, we find that generically the larger is the UV dynamical exponent $z_{UV}$ the faster is the recovery of Lorentz symmetry in the IR. ii) We construct explicitly a holographic model with a line of fixed points, realizing different Lifshitz scaling along the line. iii) We also confirm the monotonicity of a recently proposed a-function along all our Lorentz violating RG flows.</description>

      <title>Fermi acceleration under Lorentz invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the acceleration of particles in astrophysical sources by the Fermi mechanism is revisited under the assumption of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). We calculate the energy spectrum and the acceleration time of particles leaving the source as a function of the energy beyond which the Lorentz invariance violation becomes relevant. Lorentz invariance violation causes significant changes in the acceleration of particles by the first and second-order Fermi mechanisms. The energy spectrum of particles accelerated by first-order Fermi mechanism under LIV assumption shows a strong suppression for energies above the break. The calculations presented here complete the scenario for LIV searches with astroparticles by showing, for the first time, how the benchmark acceleration mechanisms (Fermi) are modified under LIV assumption.</description>

      <title>Vertex correction to nuclear matrix elements of double-$\beta$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The predicted neutrinoless double-$\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay is the crucial phenomenon to prove the existence of the Majorana neutrino, which gives a foundation to leptogenesis to explain the matter prevalence of the universe. The nuclear matrix element (NME) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay is an important theoretical quantity to determine the effective neutrino mass and help the detector design for the next generation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay search. Reliable calculation of this NME is a long-standing problem because of the diversity of the predicted values of the NME. The main reason for this difficulty is that the effective strength of the Gamow-Teller transition operator $g_A$ for this decay is unknown. I will show the lowest-order vertex corrections for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ and the $2\nu\beta\beta$ NME of $^{136}$Xe in the framework of the hybrid application of the quantum field theory to the leptons and the Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbation to the nucleus. The unperturbed nuclear states are obtained by the quasiparticle random-phase approximation. These corrections reduce the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME by 30%. The effective $g_A$ referring to this reduced NME is also obtained, and it is shown for the first time that the effective $g_A$ for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME is not quite different from that for the $2\nu\beta\beta$ NME; the difference is only 10%. This indicates the possibility that the phenomenological effective $g_A$ to reproduce the experimental half-life of the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay can be approximately used for the calculation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME.</description>
