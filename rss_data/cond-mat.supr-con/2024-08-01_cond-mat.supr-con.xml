      <title>The possible coexistence of superconductivity and topological electronic states in 1T-RhSeTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), exhibit a range of crystal structures and topological quantum states. The 1$T$ phase, in particular, shows promise for superconductivity driven by electron-phonon coupling, strain, pressure, and chemical doping. In this theoretical investigation, we explore 1$T$-RhSeTe as a novel type of TMD superconductor with topological electronic states. The optimal doping structure and atomic arrangement of 1$T$-RhSeTe are constructed. Phonon calculations validate the integrity of the constructed doping structure. The analysis of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) using the Electron-phonon Wannier (EPW) method has confirmed the existence of a robust electron-phonon interaction in 1$T$-RhSeTe, resulting in total EPC constant $\lambda$ = 2.02, the logarithmic average frequency $\omega_{\text{log}}$ = 3.15 meV and $T_c$ = 4.61 K, consistent with experimental measurements and indicative of its classification as a BCS superconductor. The band structure analysis revealed the presence of Dirac-like band crossing points. The topological non-trivial electronic structures of the 1$T$-RhSeTe are confirmed via the evolution of Wannier charge centers (WCCs). Collectively, these distinctive properties underscore 1$T$-RhSeTe as a possible candidate for a topological superconductor, warranting further investigation into its potential implications and applications.</description>

      <title>Pressure induced nonmonotonic evolution of superconductivity in 6R-TaS2 with a natural bulk van der Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The natural bulk van der Waals heterostructures compound 6R-TaS2 consists of alternate stacking 1T- and 1H-TaS2 monolayers, creating a unique system that incorporates charge-density-wave (CDW) order and superconductivity (SC) in distinct monolayers. Here, after confirming that the 2D nature of the lattice is preserved up to 8 GPa in 6R-TaS2, we documented an unusual evolution of CDW and SC by conducting highpressure electronic transport measurements. Upon compression, we observe a gradual suppression of CDW within the 1T-layers, while the SC exhibits a dome-shaped behavior that terminates at a critical pressure Pc around 2.9 GPa. By taking account of the fact that the substantial suppression of SC is concomitant with the complete collapse of CDW order at Pc, we argue that the 6R-TaS2 behaves like a stack of Josephson junctions and thus the suppressed superconductivity can be attributed to the weakening of Josephson coupling associated with the presence of CDW fluctuations in the 1T-layers. Furthermore, the SC reversely enhances above Pc, implying the development of emergent superconductivity in the 1T-layers after the melting of T-layer CDW orders. These results show that the 6R-TaS2 not only provides a promising platform to explore emergent phenomena but also serves as a model system to study the complex interactions between competing electronic states.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on the possibility of high $T_c$ s$\pm$-wave superconductivity in the heavily hole-doped infinite layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a possibility of realizing high $T_c$ superconductivity having $s\pm$-wave symmetry in the heavily hole-doped infinite layer nickelates La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$. We consider situations where the original $P4/mmm$ symmetry of LaNiO$_2$ is maintained even for a significant amount of Sr substitution by growing thin films on substrates having tetragonal symmetry. Considering such cases is indeed justified by our phonon calculations. For electron configurations somewhat close to $d^8$, the interaction between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band and the other $3d$ bands that lie just below the Fermi level results in an enhancement of superconductivity where the sign of the gap function is reversed between the former and the latter bands. The strong enhancement of superconductivity can be attributed to the large energy level offset between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other orbitals due to the absence of the apical oxygens, as has been pointed out in previous studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We searched for violations of the weak equivalence principle using a cryogenic torsion balance with a pendulum comprised of superconducting niobium and copper. We constrain the E\"otv\"os parameter with 95\%-confidence to $\eta_{\text{Nb*-Cu}}~\leq~2.0\times10^{-9}$ and $\eta_{\text{CP-ee}}\leq6.9\times10^{-3}$ for superconducting niobium and Cooper pairs, respectively.</description>

      <title>Competition between d-wave superconductivity and magnetism in uniaxially strained Sr2RuO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pairing symmetry of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is a long-standing fundamental question in the physics of superconducting materials with strong electronic correlations. We use the functional renormalization group to investigate the behavior of superconductivity under uniaxial strain in a two-dimensional realistic model of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ obtained with density functional theory and incorporating the effect of spin-orbit coupling. We find a dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ superconductor mostly hosted by the $d_{xy}$-orbital, with no other closely competing superconducting state. Within this framework we reproduce the experimentally observed enhancement of the critical temperature under strain and propose a simple mechanism driven by the density of states to explain our findings. We also investigate the competition between superconductivity and spin-density wave ordering as a function of interaction strength. By comparing theory and experiment, we discuss constraints on a possible degenerate partner of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ superconducting state.</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum metric due to vacancies in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random vacancies in a graphene monolayer induce defect states that are known to form a narrow impurity band centered around zero energy at half-filling. We use a space-resolved formulation of the quantum metric and establish a strong enhancement of the electronic correlations in this impurity band. The enhancement is primarily due to strong correlations between pairs of vacancies situated on different sublattices at anomalously large spatial distances. We trace the strong enhancement to both the multifractal vacancy wave functions, which ties the system exactly at the Anderson insulator transition for all defect concentrations, and preserving the chiral symmetry.</description>
