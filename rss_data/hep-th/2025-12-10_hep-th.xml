      <title>Emergent Strings from Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a procedure that reorganizes the perturbative expansion in a class of quantum field theories into a stringy amplitude expressed as a sum over two-dimensional geometries. Using Schwinger parametrization and the one-to-one correspondence between metric ribboned graphs and the moduli space of Riemann surfaces established via Strebel differentials, we map each Feynman diagram to a surface. We then construct a conformal field theory on the worldsheet whose correlation functions encode the full set of QFT Feynman rules directly from the geometry of the associated Riemann surface. Restoring diffeomorphism and Weyl invariance promotes the integral over moduli space to a path integral over worldsheet metrics, yielding a non-critical string theory whose Liouville mode naturally becomes a holographic direction. By construction, the expansion of the string theory amplitudes in the number of boundary state insertions matches the loop expansion in the QFT at fixed genus. Moreover, loop divergences are shown to match standard string-theoretic degeneration limits, indicating that gravitational backreaction is equivalent to QFT renormalization. Our construction provides a microscopic route from generic QFTs to emergent string theories and offers a framework for deriving holographic duals directly from field-theoretic data.</description>

      <title>From Frame Covariance to the Swampland Distance Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field space geometry plays a central role within the Swampland Programme, most notably in the various Distance Conjectures. However, for gravitational EFTs, this geometry is not uniquely defined: one can cast the action in many synonymous descriptions related by Weyl transformations, in which the field space metric transforms non-trivially across conformal frames. This raises a crucial question of how we are meant to think of the field space metric in view of employing the Swampland Conjectures. In this work we resolve this ambiguity by developing a fully frame-covariant framework for studying gravitational EFTs. We show that all conformal frames arise as distinct foliations of a singular higher-dimensional auxiliary geometry. Applying ADM formalism to the augmented field space, it is clear how Weyl- and unit transformations can be understood from a geometric point of view. Using this framework, we revisit the Species Scale Distance Conjecture and Sharpened Distance Conjecture, and show how the bounds derive from universal properties of gravitational EFTs under Weyl transformations. This strongly suggests that aspects of these conjectures apply to a much broader class of scalar-tensor theories and are consequences of frame covariance, rather than constraints imposed by quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Particle Production and the Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of particle production during inflation in scenarios where an infinite tower of states features a mass scale that decreases exponentially along the inflationary trajectory. Such couplings naturally arise in string effective field theories and are in fact motivated by the Swampland Distance Conjecture (SDC). We show that the corrections to inflationary observables sourced by the tower scale as $(H/\Lambda_{\text{sp}})^{2+p}$, with $H$ being the Hubble scale, $\Lambda_{\text{sp}}$ being the species scale, that is the quantum gravity cut-off, and $p\geq 1$ characterizes the density of states in the tower. As a result, in gravitationally weakly coupled cosmological effective theories, the tower-induced contributions are suppressed relative to the standard single-field predictions, leaving the inflationary phenomenology essentially unchanged. We demonstrate this explicitly across a set of well-motivated inflationary potentials, and we compare the resulting predictions with the most recent observational constraints, including those from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope.</description>

      <title>Open Effective Field Theory and the Physics of Cosmological Collider Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the origin of the cosmological collider signal using the framework of open effective field theories. Focusing on the single exchange of a massive scalar field, we demonstrate that the trispectrum splits cleanly into its local and non-local components once the heavy-field propagators are decomposed in the Keldysh basis. Integrating out the massive degree of freedom yields a single-field effective field theory for the light scalar that necessarily contains both unitary operators and non-unitary contributions associated with dissipation and stochastic noise. We show that the leading local signal in parity-preserving theories arises from the unitary part of this effective field theory, whereas the non-local signal is intrinsically associated with its stochastic sector. The effective field theory coefficients themselves are a priori non-analytic in the external kinematics; however, this non-analyticity can be softened when a scale hierarchy - such as the heavy-mass expansion - is imposed, up to spurious contributions that ultimately cancel in observables. Finally, we establish a connection between the cosmological collider signal and entropy production, linking the observable non-local signal to intrinsic properties of the quantum state, including its degree of mixedness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Network Field Theories (NN-FTs) represent a novel construction of arbitrary field theories, including those of conformal fields, through the specification of the network architecture and prior distribution for the network parameters. In this work, we present a formalism for the construction of conformally invariant defects in these NN-FTs. We demonstrate this new formalism in two toy models of NN scalar field theories. We develop an NN interpretation of an expansion akin to the defect OPE in two-point correlation functions in these models.</description>

      <title>Strong-field regime within effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the Covariant Derivative Expansion, we develop a method to compute effective actions that is able to capture non-perturbative effects induced by strong background fields. We demonstrate the method in scalar QED, by deriving the full second-derivative corrections to the scalar Heisenberg--Euler effective action. The corresponding result is interpreted as an effective field theory with three characteristic scales, two of which are large (mass and field strength) in comparison with the remaining one (derivatives of the field). As an application, we show that, at this order, the transseries structure of the Schwinger pair production rate is preserved, even if the involved coefficients are modified. Our analysis also helps clarify recent disagreements concerning the coefficients of this effective action.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian threads and nonlocal computation in holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in holography and quantum gravity have shown that CFTs with classical gravity duals can implement nonlocal quantum computation protocols that appear local from the bulk perspective. We examine the extent to which current prescriptions for holographic complexity support this claim, focusing on the Complexity=Volume (CV) proposal. The reformulation of CV in terms of Lorentzian threads suggests that bulk computations are performed with local gates. However, we find that the original formalism is insufficient when it comes to analyzing the complexity of subsystems and their inequalities. Specifically, standard Lorentzian threads cannot account for the negativity of `mutual complexity' and its higher-partite generalizations. To address this deficiency, we modify the Lorentzian threads program by introducing multiple flavors of threads. Our analysis reveals that an optimal solution for this new program implies the existence of additional types of gates that enable nonlocal computations in the dual CFT. We give a tentative interpretation of the multiflavor program in terms of Lorentzian `hyperthreads,' in analogy with the Riemannian case.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Through Topological Defects: Reconciling Theory with Numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Present theoretical predictions for the entanglement entropy through topological defects are violated by numerical simulations. In order to resolve this, we introduce a paradigm shift in the preparation of reduced density matrices in the presence of topological defects, and emphasize the role of defect networks with which they can be dressed. We consider the cases of grouplike and duality defects in detail for the Ising model, and match all numerically found entanglement entropies. Since our construction functions at the level of reduced density matrices, it accounts for topological defects beyond the entanglement entropy to other entanglement measures.</description>

      <title>Haagerup Symmetry in $(E_8)_1$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest that the chiral $(\mathfrak{e}_8)_1$ theory -- in many senses the simplest VOA -- may have Haagerup symmetry $\mathcal{H}_i$ for $i=1,2,3$. Likewise, we suggest that the non-chiral $(E_8)_1$ WZW model may have $\mathcal{H}_i \times \mathcal{H}_i^\textrm{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives a $c=8$ theory with $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{H}_3)$ symmetry, which is the theory predicted in \cite{Evans:2010yr}. Along the way, we show that $(E_8)_1$ also has a $\mathrm{Fib} \times \mathrm{Fib}^\text{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives the $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1$ WZW model, explaining the well-known conformal embedding $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1 \subset (E_8)_1$. Finally, we suggest a relation to theories with $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry at $c=2,6$, complimenting the discussion with new modular bootstrap results.</description>

      <title>Yang-Baxter deformations of the OSP(1|2) WZW model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain inequivalent classical r-matrices of the $osp(1|2)$ Lie superalgebra as real solutions of the graded (modified) classical Yang-Baxter equation, in such a way that the corresponding automorphism transformation is employed. Then, Yang-Baxter deformations of the Wess-Zumino-Witten model based on the OSP$(1|2)$ Lie supergroup are specified by super skew-symmetric classical r-matrices. In this regard, the effect coming from the deformation is reflected as the coefficient of both metric and $B$-field. Furthermore, it is shown that all resulting classical r-matrices are non-Abelian and also non-unimodular, which leads us to graded generalized supergravity equations. We show that the background of undeformed model is a solution of the graded generalized supergravity equations when supplemented by an appropriate supervector field obtaining from the linear combination of the Killing supervectors corresponding to the background, while the deformed models do not satisfy these equations. This is consistent with our expectations, since the deformed models under consideration do not describe a Green-Schwarz superstring. However, the deformed backgrounds are interesting, in particular in the OSP$(1|2)$ case they are rare, much hard technical work was needed to obtain them.</description>

      <title>Expansion formula of one-loop Einstein-Yang-Mills integrand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the algebraic consistency construction of one-loop Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) numerators for Yang-Mills (YM) and Yang-Mills-scalar (YMS) theories, we explore the expansion formula of one-loop Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) integrands (with a gluon loop) in terms of conventional one-loop YM integrands with quadratic propagators. We first express the EYM integrand by tree-level amplitudes according to the forward limit approach. Employing a two-step expansion strategy, the gluon-loop EYM integrand is decomposed into tree-level YM amplitudes under the forward limit, which are subsequently expanded into tree-level bi-adjoint scalar (BS) ones. We then prove that when the kinematic coefficients in both expansion steps satisfy the one-loop consistency conditions, the EYM integrand is finally expanded as a combination of YM integrands with quadratic propagators. The coefficients in this expansion formula coincide exactly with those in the expansion formula for YMS integrands. This correspondence highlights a shared kinematic structure, providing the proper foundation for constructing BCJ numerators in both YMS and EYM theories at one loop.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the composite models of gravity and investigate how dynamical tensor fields emerge by utilizing the functional Renormalization Group. In this paper, we consider two models: One is the fermionic theory. Another is the scalar theory. In both cases, we introduce an auxiliary tensor field corresponding to a composite field of the energy-momentum tensor by means of the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. We derive the flow equations for the field renormalization factors of the auxiliary tensor field and show the tensor field becomes dynamical in the infrared regime. The resulting kinetic terms are interpreted as gauge-fixed terms.</description>

      <title>Viscosity of $R^2$ Modified AdS Black Brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Einstein-Hilbert black brane solution in four-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime supplemented by a quadratic Ricci scalar term $q L^2 R^2$, where $q$ is a dimensionless coupling constant and $L$ is the AdS radius. The shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\frac{\eta}{s}$, is calculated holographically, and deviations from the universal Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound are analyzed. Our results indicate that $\frac{\eta}{s} = \frac{1}{4\pi}(1 - 24q)$, demonstrating that the ratio falls below the conjectured lower limit for positive $q$, while it respects the bound for negative $q$. We confirm that our solutions smoothly reduce to the standard Einstein-Hilbert case when $q \to 0$, consistent with expectations. The physical implications of violating the KSS bound are discussed in depth, particularly regarding stability, causality, and the strongly coupled nature of the dual field theory. These findings provide valuable insights into the influence of higher curvature terms on holographic transport properties.</description>

      <title>BPS Fivebrane Stars and BTZ Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a large new class of BPS supergravity solutions parametrized by arbitrary chiral wave profiles on fundamental string and Neveu-Schwarz fivebrane sources. The effective action approach we employ describes the regime where the brane sources are slightly separated. String probes see these backgrounds as smooth and effectively capped off at the scale of that separation. Within the space of solutions is a large ensemble of ultracompact objects exhibiting many of the features of extremal BTZ black holes, in particular having a deep $AdS_2$ throat. We present the details of solutions with circular source profiles, and compare them to known superstratum geometries. The separation of the sources makes them structurally more like BPS fivebrane stars than like extremal black hole microstates. When evaluated on the supergravity background, the brane effective action governs (chaotic) near-BPS dynamics, and exhibits a collective mode analogous to the Schwarzian mode of $AdS_2$ black holes. Finally, we discuss the approach to the black hole phase as the sources coalesce, in which the semiclassical approximation breaks down due to the appearance of light D-brane excitations; this bulk realization of the fivebrane deconfinement transition connects directly to the Hawking-Page transition.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy and Topological Mass in Interacting Elko and Scalar Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a four-dimensional system composed of a mass-dimension-one fermionic field, also known as Elko, interacting with a real scalar field. Our main objective is to analyze the Casimir effects associated with this system, assuming that both the Elko and scalar fields satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions on two large parallel plates separated by a distance $L$. In this scenario, we calculate the vacuum energy density and its first-order correction in the coupling constants of the theory. Additionally, we consider the mass correction for each field separately, namely the topological mass that arises from the boundary conditions imposed on the fields and which also depends on the coupling constants. To develop this analysis, we use the mathematical formalism known as the effective potential, expressed as a path integral in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Exact $S$-duality Map for Rigid Surface Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface operators in four-dimensional gauge theories are two-dimensional defects, serving as natural generalizations of Wilson lines and 't Hooft line operators. They act as ideal probes for exploring the non-perturbative structure of the theory. Rigid surface operators are a specific class of surface operators characterized by the absence of continuous deformation parameters. It is expected that a closed $S$-duality map should exist among these rigid operators. While progress has been made on specific examples or subclasses by leveraging invariants and empirical conjectures, a complete picture remains elusive.
  A significant challenge arises when multiple rigid surface operators share identical invariants, making the determination of $S$-duality relations difficult. More critically, a mismatch exists in the number of rigid surface operators between dual theories when classified by invariants; this is referred to as the \textit{mismatch problem}. This discrepancy suggests the necessity of extending the scope of consideration beyond strictly rigid operators.
  In this paper, we propose a direct, natural, and precise $S$-duality map for rigid surface operators.
  Our map is realized by moving the longest row in the pair of partitions defining a surface operator from one factor to the other, with an additional box appended or deleted to balance the total number of boxes.
  This mapping naturally incorporates non-rigid surface operators, thereby resolving the mismatch problem. The proposed map is applicable to gauge groups of all ranks and clarifies several long-standing puzzles in the field.</description>

      <title>The Strong-$CP$ Problem and its Gauge Axion solution as Evidence for Fundamental Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological susceptibility of the QCD vacuum provides an understanding of $\theta$-vacua as vacua of a Chern-Simons gauge theory. In this way, it gives an immediate proof of the physicality of the boundary $\theta$-term. This makes the essence of the strong-$CP$ puzzle very transparent and offers a solution in form of the gauge axion, which has exact quality. This axion represents an intrinsic part of the QCD gauge redundancy without any reference to an anomalous global symmetry. It is a two-form transforming under the QCD gauge symmetry. Due to its pure gauge nature, the gauge axion represents a powerful tool to monitor physics of $\theta$-vacua in various regimes. Unlike the ordinary Peccei-Quinn axion, which is UV-completed into a Goldstone phase of a complex scalar and thereby suffers from the quality problem, the gauge axion is UV-completed directly into a fundamental theory of gravity. We study the domain wall and string structure of the gauge axion and show that the strings sourcing it must be a part of this fundamental theory. We thus observe that the absence of the axion quality problem motivates the presence of fundamental strings. This provides a new argument for a connection between the axion and gravity.</description>

      <title>Finite size effects in DBI and Born-Infeld for screened spherically symmetric objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite size effects on the linear response of spherically symmetric objects in Born-Infeld (BI) electromagnetism and Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) scalar field theories. Previous works show that the linear response coefficients for a point-like source vanish for odd multipoles above the dipole, a feature that resembles the vanishing of Love numbers for black holes. This work goes beyond the point-like idealisation and considers a sphere of finite radius. We find that the vanishing of the linear response coefficients ceases as they acquire a correction due to the finite size of the object. This introduces a hierarchy between the even and odd multipoles of the response coefficients determined by the separation of scales between the radius of the sphere and the screening scale of non-linearities. From a phenomenological viewpoint, the hierarchy between the odd and even multipoles would give access to the screening scale and the object's radius by measuring the behaviour of the potentials at infinity.</description>

      <title>Beyond Extremality: Weak Gravity Conjecture Constraints on Gravitational Lensing in Gravity's Rainbow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the constraints imposed by the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) on gravitational lensing in gravity's rainbow, focusing in particular on scenarios beyond extremality and on the interplay between the WGC and the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) in the context of Reissner-Nordstr\"om-Anti-de Sitter black holes modified by rainbow gravity. Using topological methods, we first analyze the configuration of photon spheres and confirm that unstable circular photon spheres with topological charge $(\omega = -1)$ exist outside the event horizon throughout the parameter space, thereby verifying the simultaneous validity of both the WGC and the WCCC. The rainbow functions $f(\varepsilon)$ and $g(\varepsilon)$, which encode Planck-scale corrections through the energy ratio $(\varepsilon =E/E_P)$, modify both the spacetime metric and the extremality bound. We derive the corresponding modified extremal charge-to-mass ratio, $(q^2/m^2)&gt;(Q^2/M^2)_{\text{ext}}$, and show that gravity's rainbow offers a natural mechanism for reconciling these two fundamental conjectures. By applying the Gauss-Bonnet theorem in conjunction with Jacobi-Maupertuis optical geometry, we compute the weak deflection angles for both photons and massive particles to second order. The rainbow function $g(\varepsilon)$ appears with powers $(g^{-2})$ and $(g^{-4})$, enhancing the deflection angle when $g(\varepsilon)&lt;1$, while $f(\varepsilon)$ influences only the charge-dependent contributions. At extremality, the deflection angle becomes independent of $f(\varepsilon)$, yielding a universal prediction that can be tested without specifying the form of the rainbow functions. We further find that super-extremal configurations exhibit stronger lensing effects than extremal black holes, suggesting a potential observational discriminator between WGC-satisfying naked singularities and WCCC-preserving black holes.</description>

      <title>Minimal Models of Entropic Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to entropic effects, it is possible that generic high-energy states of a quantum or classical system are ordered. This leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking at arbitrarily high temperatures. We present minimal models of entropic order that arise from very simple interactions. Our main examples are the Arithmetic Ising Model (AIM) and its quantum analogue, where usual Ising spins are replaced by non-negative integers. Using a large-flavor expansion together with numerical simulations, we find that the high-temperature phase is ordered in the classical and quantum models. We also introduce classical gas models whose interactions drive the system to a crystal at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Analytical Study for Primordial Non-Gaussianity in the gravity 4D Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08047v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An inflationary model can be constrained by non-gaussian statistics as a parameter in the LSS (Large Scale Structure) distribution, and in the radiation of CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) fluctuating temperature. Data on the CMB from Planck Collaboration provide up-to-date constraints on the parameters controlling the degree of non-Gaussianity in certain inflationary models, thus supporting or not supporting the model. Setting the non-Gaussianity parameter investigated in this study can be a reference whether or not it is a good parameter in constraining cosmological inflation models. This study attempts to examine the non-Gaussianity of the 3+1-dimensional 4DEGB gravitational cosmological inflation model starting from random field statistics. The non-Gaussian signature generated by the model is quantified, and the parameters controlling the degree of non-Gaussianity are constrained using data observation of Planck Collaboration. The method used in investigating non-Gaussianity is the in-in formalism, applied after obtaining the 3-point of $\zeta$ (curvature perturbation) terms of the perturbation expansion to the third order. The 3-point correlation function helps to create a bispectrum used to investigate the non-gaussinity of the inflation model. The results of this study show that the model tested is the slow roll pressed in the squeezed limit, because it witnesses a dominant local shape function. It has such as the non-gaussianity possessed by the single scalar field inflation as confirmation that Gauss-Bonnet term within Einstein-Hilbert action is topologically invariant in $D&lt;5$ spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Some Difference Relations for Orthogonal Polynomials of a Continuous Variable in the Askey Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal polynomials of a continuous variable in the Askey scheme satisfying second order difference equations, such as the Askey-Wilson polynomial, can be studied by the quantum mechanical formulation, idQM (discrete quantum mechanics with pure imaginary shifts). These idQM systems have the shape invariance property, which relates the Hilbert space $\mathsf{H}_{\lambda}$ ($\lambda$ : a set of parameters) and that with shifted parameters $\mathsf{H}_{\lambda+\delta}$ ($\delta$ : shift of $\lambda$), and gives the forward and backward shift relations for the orthogonal polynomials. Based on the forward shift relation and the Christoffel's theorem with some polynomial $\check{\Phi}(x)$, which is expressed in terms of the quantities appeared in the forward and backward shift relations, we obtain some difference relations for the orthogonal polynomials. The multiplication of $\sqrt{\check{\Phi}(x)}$ gives a surjective map from $\mathsf{H}_{\lambda+2\delta}$ to $\mathsf{H}_{\lambda}$. Similarly, for the orthogonal polynomials in the Askey scheme satisfying second order differential equations, such as the Jacobi polynomial, we obtain some differential relations, and the multiplication of $\sqrt{\check{\Phi}(x)}$ in this case gives a surjective map from $\mathsf{H}_{\lambda+\delta}$ to $\mathsf{H}_{\lambda}$.</description>

      <title>$D$-dimensional aether charged black hole and aether waves in M-subset of Einstein-aether theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the black hole solution and gravitational wave polarizations in a M-subset of the Einstein-aether theory with Lorentz invariance violated by an unit norm vector field -- the aether field $u^a$. This M-subset of Einstein-aether theory has a form of Einstein-Maxwell theory with a term of Lagrange multiplier potential $\lambda(u_au^a\mp1)$. We find that if the aether field is timelike, there is no static black hole solution existing, which is different from the result reported in Phys. Rev. D {\bf64} 024028. When the aether field is spacelike, there exists a static solution -- $D$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom-like black hole solution, in which the aether charge have a minimum and maximum values. The conception of the aether charge also exists in the $c_i$ subset of the Einstein-aether theory. The Smarr formula and the first law can be still constructed via the extended method of Killing potential. For the linearized M-subset Einstein-aether theory with the timelike aether field, we find the speed of spin-2 modes is unit, which aren't dependent on spacetime dimensions $D$ and aether constant $b_1$, but some parts of polarizations are disappeared. The speed of spin-1 modes is unit also. The third kind mode is the longitudinal aether-metric mode, which is linearly time dependent and not the spin-0 mode.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Structure from Basis Light-Front Quantization : Status and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent advancements in understanding nucleon structure within the Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) framework--a fully relativistic, nonperturbative approach to solving quantum field theories. In its initial phase, we start with the leading Fock sector $|qqq\rangle$ and an effective light-front Hamiltonian incorporating confinement and one-gluon exchange within which BLFQ can already successfully describe key nucleon observables. The framework has since been extended to include the next-to-leading Fock sector $|qqqg\rangle$, enabling studies of gluonic contributions to the nucleon's internal structure, including gluon helicity, orbital angular momentum, and three-dimensional imaging through generalized and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (GPDs and TMDs). Most recently, BLFQ has achieved a significant milestone by computing nucleon light-front wavefunctions as eigenstates of the QCD Hamiltonian without an explicit confining potential. These calculations, including Fock sectors up to $|qqqq\bar{q}\rangle$, further develop the path to first-principles predictions of quark and gluon matter densities, helicity and transversity distributions, and spin observables, showing qualitative agreement with experimental and phenomenological results. Together, these developments highlight BLFQ's growing capacity to provide an increasingly complete and realistic picture of nucleon structure grounded in QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study neutrino flavor oscillations using the approach based on the quantum field theory (QFT), where neutrinos are taken to be virtual particles. One deals with the propagators of neutrino mass eigenstates in this formalism. Previously, while applying this approach to neutrino oscillations in external fields, we decomposed the propagators and used only the particle contribution in the calculation of the matrix element. In the present work, we carefully justify the validity of this kind of transformation by considering neutrino oscillations in vacuum. In principle, the results obtained can be extended for the QFT applied to neutrino oscillations in external fields.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Strings via Black Hole Quasinormal Modes in Gravitational Wave Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes, the simplest solution to Einstein's field equations, do not emit light, making their observations a major challenge for researchers. However, discovery of binary black holes (BBHs) in 2015 by LIGO has transformed the study of compact objects, with over 300 BBHs recorded, providing a new avenue for probing new physics. GWs remain a prominent and precise method of observing not only BBHs, but also dark matter and cosmic strings. Cosmic strings -- hypothetical one dimensional topological defects formed in the early universe, are yet to be observed, with multiple detection methods such as particle radiation, gravitational waves and lensing being proposed. Here we present a novel framework to search for cosmic strings by modeling them as perturbations within non-rotating black hole spacetime, focusing on their imprint on the spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs). Our numerical simulations identify a lower limit on perturbation strength, $\lambda \sim 10^{-10}$ for uncharged string and $\lambda \sim 10^{-7}$ for charged string, below which cosmic string effects become unobservable in QNM signals. By analyzing eigenvalue splitting and centers, we show that cosmic string properties impart distinct and detectable features to GW signals. Our results establish QNM analysis as a powerful, alternative observational strategy for constraining or detecting cosmic strings, and offer an inverse approach to estimate string energy or charge if a signal is detected. With upgrades in LIGO technologies and advanced multimessenger astronomy under development, these findings highlight new potential for detecting cosmic strings.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Extraction of HQET Parameters from Inclusive Semi-Leptonic Decay of the $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ Baryon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extract the non-perturbative Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) parameters from the inclusive semi-leptonic decay $\Lambda_c^+ \to X e^+ \nu_e$. Unlike charmed mesons produced near threshold, $\Lambda_c^+$ baryons produced in $e^+e^-$ annihilation exhibit a complex momentum distribution, making the transformation of the electron energy spectrum from the laboratory frame to the $\Lambda_c^+$ rest frame non-trivial. To address this, we develop a novel Bayesian inference method to reconstruct the electron energy moments in the $\Lambda_c^+$ rest frame. By performing a global fit of theoretical predictions in the 1S mass scheme to these extracted moments, we determine the HQET parameters $\mu_{\pi}^2(\Lambda_c^+)$ and $\rho_D^3(\Lambda_c^+)$ for the first time using a purely data-driven approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the radiative process of three entangled quantum probes initially prepared in a tripartite W state. As a basic set-up, we consider the probes to be inertial in flat spacetime and investigate how the radiative process is affected by different probe configurations. We take the quantum probes as either static or moving with uniform velocities and consider different switching scenarios. Our main observation confirms that the radiative process depends distinctively on the initial configuration in which the probes are arranged, as well as on the direction of the probe velocity. We also extend our analysis to a thermal environment, thereby simulating a more realistic background. We thoroughly discuss the effects due to different switchings, the thermal background, and probe motion on the radiative process of these tripartite entangled probes. We also comment on how the observations from this work can help prepare a set-up least affected by quantum decoherence.</description>

      <title>Horizon Brightened Acceleration Radiation from Massive Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a quantum-optical treatment of acceleration radiation for atoms freely falling into a Schwarzschild black hole when the ambient field is a massive spin-1 (Proca) field. Building on the HBAR framework of Scully and collaborators, we analyze two detector realizations: a charged-monopole current coupling and a physical electric-dipole coupling, both within a cavity that isolates a single outgoing Schwarzschild mode prepared in the Boulware state. Using a near-horizon stationary-phase analysis, we show that the thermal detailed-balance factor governing excitation versus absorption is universal and depends only on the near-horizon Rindler coordinate transformation. At the same time, the absolute spectra acquire distinctive Proca signatures: a hard mass threshold, polarization-dependent prefactors, and axial/polar greybody transmissions. Promoting single-pass probabilities to escaping rates yields a master equation whose steady state is geometric and whose entropy flux obeys an HBAR-style area-entropy relation identical in form to the scalar case, with all vector-field specifics entering through the radiative area change. Our results provide a controlled pathway to probe longitudinal versus transverse responses, mass thresholds, and polarization-resolved greybody effects in acceleration radiation, and set the stage for extensions to rotating backgrounds, alternative exterior states, and detector-engineering strategies.</description>

      <title>Quantum particle production and radiative properties of a new bumblebee black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the quantum and radiative properties of a recently proposed static bumblebee black hole arising from a general Lorentz-violating vacuum configuration. The analysis begins with the geometric structure of the solution and the thermodynamic temperature obtained from the surface-gravity prescription. The associated thermodynamic topological structure is also examined. Quantum particle production is then analyzed for bosonic and fermionic fields using the tunneling method. Analytic greybody bounds are derived for spin-0, spin-1, spin-2, and spin-1/2 fields. Furthermore, full greybody factors are computed with the sixth-order WKB method, together with the corresponding absorption cross sections and their characteristic spin-dependent peak patterns. These results support the evaluation of the evaporation lifetimes and the emission rates of energy and particle modes associated with each spin contribution, followed by a comparison of the high-frequency regime with other Lorentz-violating geometries, including the \textit{metric} bumblebee, \textit{metric-affine} bumblebee, Kalb-Ramond, and non-commutative Kalb-Ramond black holes. In addition, greybody factors are obtained using a quasinormal-mode-based prescription.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Noncommutative Geometry with Dirac Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper surveys a bootstrap framework for random Dirac operators arising from finite spectral triples in noncommutative geometry. Motivated by a toy model for quantum gravity to replace integration over metrics by integration over Dirac operators, we give an overview of multitrace and multimatrix random matrix models built from spectral triples and analyze them in the large $N$ limit using positivity constraints on Hankel moment matrices. In this setting, the bootstrap philosophy, originating in the S-matrix program and revived in modern conformal bootstrap theory, reappears as a rigorous analytic tool for extracting spectral data from consistency alone, without solving the model explicitly.
  We explain how Schwinger-Dyson equations, factorization at large $N$, and the noncommutative moment problem lead to finite-dimensional semidefinite programs whose feasible regions encode the allowed pairs of coupling constants and moments. Connections with spectral geometry, in particular the study of Laplace eigenvalues, are also discussed, illustrating how bootstrapping provides a unified mechanism for deriving bounds in both commutative and noncommutative settings.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass constraints in the context of 4-parameter dark energy equation of state and DESI DR2 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological constraints on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu$, are strongly shaped by assumptions about the dark-energy equation of state due to the well-known degeneracy between massive neutrinos and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this work, we move beyond the two-parameter Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) form adopted in recent DESI analyses and re-examine neutrino mass constraints using a flexible four-parameter dark energy equation of state (4pDE). We implement the 4pDE model in a modified version of CLASS and perform a full MCMC analysis using Planck, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon+ data. Relative to our previous 4pDE study based on pre-DESI BAO datasets, the inclusion of DESI DR2 substantially tightens the constraints on the transition parameters while still yielding a relaxed neutrino-mass bound compared to $\Lambda$CDM, $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.101$ eV ($95\%$ C.L.). This upper limit is more stringent than the DESI DR2 constraint obtained within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. From the best-fit parameters, we reconstruct the evolution of the 4pDE equation of state along with both $68\%$ and $95\%$C.L. We do not find a statistically significant phantom-crossing at $z \sim 0.5$, consistent with the conclusion from the DESI collaboration; at higher redshifts, the reconstructed $w(z)$ follows the CPL evolution and deviates only at low redshift. Additionally we also find reduction in $\Delta \chi^2_{\rm min}=-7.3$ compared to $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Backwards Gamma-Ray Bursts: Searching for Exploding Primordial Black Holes in Short-Duration GRB Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for signatures of terminal black-hole evaporation in short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) catalogs. An exploding primordial black hole (PBH) undergoing final-stage Hawking radiation is predicted to produce a distinctive "backwards burst"-a very short, spectrally hard transient with monotonically increasing flux and little or no longer-wavelength afterglow. We develop a forward-modeling framework that directly compares theoretical PBH evaporation light curves, computed with full Standard Model particle content and detector response folding, against empirical GRB pulse templates. Analyzing 39 well-characterized Swift sGRBs with non-detected or extremely faint afterglows, we find that all events exhibit fast-rise, slow-decay temporal profiles inconsistent with the PBH prediction. Model comparison via Akaike and Bayesian information criteria decisively favors conventional FRED or ERCA fits over the PBH template for every burst. No candidates for terminal PBH evaporation are identified. The null result yields an upper bound on the local PBH explosion rate density $R_{\mathrm{PBH}} \lesssim 10^5~\mathrm{pc}^{-3}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, comparable to constraints from dedicated TeV $\gamma$-ray searches. Our methodology establishes a robust template-matching approach that can be scaled to larger multi-instrument catalogs, providing a foundation for future searches targeting this unique signature of quantum gravity and early-Universe physics.</description>

      <title>Two-loop renormalization of general bosonic effective field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The renormalization of higher-dimensional operators in quantum field theory is essential for phenomenological analyses in particle physics, and plays a significant role in the study of critical phenomena. We present a framework for renormalizing general bosonic effective field theories beyond one loop, with arbitrary gauge symmetry and scalar field content. In particular, we calculate the renormalization group equations in such theories up to two loops and dimension six. When specialized to the bosonic sector of the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) using simple replacement rules, our general expressions reproduce recent results from the literature. Due to the broad applicability of effective field theory, our general results can readily be applied to obtain the anomalous dimensions in extensions of the bosonic SMEFT and in a plethora of other theories. We also envision our results to provide useful data on the scaling dimensions of composite operators in conformal field theories without fermions.</description>

      <title>Local Zeta Functions of Multiparameter Calabi-Yau Threefolds from the Picard-Fuchs Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08067v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deformation approach of arXiv:2104.07816 for computing zeta functions of one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds is generalised to cover also multiparameter manifolds. Consideration of the multiparameter case requires the development of an improved formalism. This allows us, among other things, to make progress on some issues left open in previous work, such as the treatment of apparent and conifold singularities and changes of coordinates. We also discuss the efficient numerical computation of the zeta functions. As examples, we compute the zeta functions of the two-parameter mirror octic, a non-symmetric split of the quintic threefold also with two parameters, and the $S_5$ symmetric five-parameter Hulek-Verrill manifolds. These examples allow us to exhibit the several new types of geometries for which our methods make practical computations possible. They also act as consistency checks, as our results reproduce and extend those of arXiv:hep-th/0409202 and arXiv:math/0304169. To make the methods developed here more approachable, a Mathematica package "CY3Zeta" for computing the zeta functions of Calabi-Yau threefolds, which is attached to this paper, is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12104v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical effective action in string theory is background-independent, and its invariance under the Buscher rules constrains its form up to a few parameters. This work investigates how this picture changes at the quantum level, where loop corrections introduce an inherent background dependence. We propose a T-duality map for the loop-level effective action. It connects the circle-reduced effective action at large radius, where loops include only Kaluza-Klein (KK) momentum modes, to the base-space effective action at small radius, where loops include only winding modes. The resulting effective action is fundamentally distinct: it cannot be obtained from the KK reduction of any standard higher-dimensional action, revealing a uniquely stringy phenomenon at the loop level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of rotation on the confinement/deconfinement phase transition of strongly interacting matter, at low temperatures, in the soft wall AdS/QCD model at finite density. To achieve it, we apply the Hawking-Page approach to the exact Andreev's solution of a charged rotating black hole in five-dimensional AdS space. We observe that there is a critical angular velocity ($\omega_0$) of hadronic matter that depends on the baryon density, representing a strong constraint on the rotation in hadronic matter. We obtain the curve $\omega_0(\mu)$, which shows that the critical rotational velocity allowed for hadronic matter decreases as the chemical potential ($\mu$) increases. When $\mu$ approaches the most critical quark chemical potential, identified as the density of a phase transition at zero temperature for a non-rotating plasma, the rotational velocity allowed for the hadrons tends to zero. If $\omega \geq \omega_0 $, there is no phase transition and the QCD matter remains in the deconfined plasma phase. The QCD phase diagram is also obtained for the exact solution, and the critical temperatures are compared with the ones obtained from the Reissner-Nordstr\"om approximation. The results are interpreted as a consequence of contributions from regions relatively distant from the AdS boundary, which cause a non-negligible reduction in the deconfinement temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We venture a proof of crossing symmetry for non-planar diagrams in perturbative QFT. For the planar diagrams a proof of crossing is available in the literature and our method closely follows the one depicted in that case. We classify the non-planar diagrams broadly into two types. For one of these types the proof is pretty straightforward and hence the result extends to all point all loop on-shell amplitudes. These are called the "trivial" cases while for the other type we find certain cases called the "non trivial" cases for which the proof is much more subtle. We present an explicit example of such a "non trivial" case at 3-loop order and argue how the proof of crossing symmetry holds true when all subtleties are taken into consideration. Based on this simple example we argue how the proof works out in general for these "non-trivial" cases at higher loop and with arbitrary number of non-planar edges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum sinh-Gordon model in 1+1 dimensions is one of the simplest and best-studied massive integrable relativistic quantum field theories. We consider this theory on a multi-sheeted Riemann surfaces with a flat metric, which can be seen as a pile of planes connected to each other along cut lines. The cut lines end at branch points, which are represented by a twist operator ${\cal T}_n.$ Operators of such kind are interesting in the framework of the problem of computing von Neumann and Renyi entanglement entropies in the original model on the plane. The composite branch-point twist operators (CTO) are a natural generalization of the twist operators, obtained by placing a local operator to a branch point by means of a certain limiting procedure. Correlation function in quantum field theory can be, in principle, found by means of the spectral decomposition. It allows one to express them in terms of form factors of local operators, i.e. their matrix elements in the basis of stationary states. In integrable models complete sets of exact form factors of all operators can be found exactly as solutions of a system of bootstrap equations. Nevertheless, identification of these solution to the operators in terms of the basic fields remains problematic. In this work, we develop a technique of computing form factors of a class of CTO determined in terms of the basic field in the semiclassical approximation.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy and Topological Mass from a Constant Magnetic Field and Boundary Conditions in Coupled Scalar Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of a uniform magnetic field and boundary conditions on vacuum energy and topological mass generation in a coupled scalar field theory. The system consists of a real scalar field, subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions, interacting via self- and cross-couplings with a gauge-coupled complex scalar field obeying mixed boundary conditions between two perfectly reflecting parallel plates. The magnetic field induces Landau quantization, leading to novel contributions. Employing zeta-function regularization within the effective potential formalism, we derive the renormalized effective potential up to second order in the coupling constants without imposing a vanishing magnetic field in the renormalization scheme. Our renormalization approach preserves magnetic contributions while properly removing divergences, enabling a consistent treatment of finite-size corrections, magnetic effects, and interaction terms. We compute the vacuum energy per unit area of the plates, analyze the emergence of a topological mass from boundary and magnetic contributions, and evaluate the first-order coupling-constant corrections at two-loop order. Detailed asymptotic analysis are presented for both weak- and strong-field regimes, revealing exponential suppression at high magnetic fields and nontrivial polynomial and logarithmic behavior in the weak-field limit.</description>

Abstract: We present a detailed study of the regularized on-shell action of the recently found asymptotically AdS$_7$ black hole supergravity solution with three angular momenta and two electric charges. We show that a particular choice of finite counterterms in the holographic renormalization procedure yields a result for the on-shell action of the supersymmetric limit of the black hole solution which is in perfect agreement with the large $N$ limit of the superconformal index of the dual 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ $A_{N}$ SCFT on $S^1\times S^5$. We also discuss a generalization of this 7d supergravity background to a new general family of black holes with horizons given by the $L^{p,q,r}$ 5d Sasaki-Einstein manifolds. The regularized on-shell action of these new 7d black holes is also in agreement with supersymmetric localization results for the 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ SCFT on $S^1\times L^{p,q,r}$. Finally, we briefly discuss a generalization of known AdS$_5$ gauged supergravity backgrounds to new 5d black holes with $L(p,q)$ lens space horizon topologies.</description>

      <title>Hypergeometry from $\mathrm{\widehat P}$-Symmetry: Feynman Integrals in One and Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feynman integrals with generic propagator powers in one and two spacetime dimensions are investigated from various perspectives. In particular, we argue that the class of track integrals at any loop order is fixed by the recently found $\mathrm{\widehat P}$-symmetries of Yangian type. All track integrals up to six external points (and four loops) are bootstrapped explicitly as well as the full family of one-loop integrals at any multiplicity. Moreover, the triangle tracks at generic loop order, which constitute the most generic family of track-type integrals, are bootstrapped in this way. The results are compared to the direct evaluation via a `spectral transform' from the integrability toolbox that turns out to be particularly efficient for position-space tree integrals in lower dimensions. We prove that all $\mathrm{\widehat P}$-symmetries of these integrals can be derived from the framework of Aomoto--Gelfand hypergeometric functions, which applies to integrals in one and two dimensions. Finally, we also demonstrate the method's applicability to conformal integrals by deriving the complete results for all comb-channel conformal partial waves as well as the conformal double-box integral. We explicitly go through all examples of the above integrals in 1D and then provide a straightforward recipe for how to read off their 2D counterparts.</description>

      <title>Holography vs. Scale Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we point out a contradiction between holography and scale-separated AdS (i.e. parametrically large mass gap) in string theory, making the standard assumption that the holographic CFT describes the IR degrees of freedom on a brane that decouple from gravity. We show that the CFT can only decouple from gravity if the scalar potential in the dual AdS satisfies a certain criterion. Namely, there must exist a scalar field trajectory that follows the gradient of the scalar potential to the asymptotic region of the scalar field space in which limit $\partial_\phi\ln(V)\partial_\phi\ln(\Lambda_s)\leq2/(d-2)$, where $\Lambda_s$ is the quantum gravity cut-off. This condition, which generically implies lack of scale-separation, is satisfied in the standard examples of AdS/CFT. However, proposed attempts at achieving scale separation, such as DGKT, employ scalar potentials that violate this condition. We therefore conclude that the CFT duals of DGKT vacua cannot exist in string theory. Barring fine-tuning, our conclusions apply to other Ricci-flat flux compactifications including the KKLT scenario which relies on scale separation to obtain a metastable de Sitter uplift.</description>

      <title>Holographic Constraints on the String Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that holography imposes strong and general constraints on scalar field potentials in the string landscape, determined by the asymptotic structure of the underlying spacetime. Applying these holographic consistency conditions, we identify broad classes of scalar potentials that are incompatible with a well-defined dual description. These include potentials with extended plateaus, excessively steep or shallow asymptotics, certain zero crossings, and specific alignments of stable AdS minima in moduli space. In particular, making the standard assumption that the CFT dual to a stable AdS vacuum must be realized as a worldvolume theory of a brane in string theory, we show that the brane selects an infinite-distance limit in moduli space where parametric scale separation is forbidden. Furthermore, the steepness and positivity of the potential are restricted in that infinite distance direction. We also find that requiring the validity of the effective theory in the future vacuum, a natural holographic criterion, automatically enforces the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) for classical cosmological solutions with positive potentials. Taken together, these constraints exclude the leading proposals to realize scale-separated AdS vacua and metastable de Sitter vacua in the string theory landscape such as DGKT and KKLT.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^2$ Skyrmion with Fermion Backreaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When fermions interact with a topological soliton, they localize on the soliton. In studies of such systems, solitons are often treated as fixed background fields, and the backreaction due to the fermion localization is usually neglected for simplicity. In this work, we investigate the backreaction of localized fermions on a $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^2$ Skyrmion. We find that the Skyrmion profile deforms in response, becoming more concentrated around the localized fermions. We also discuss the possibility that this backreaction may play a role analogous to that of the potential term.</description>

      <title>Correlation length in random MPS and PEPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11682</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.11682v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network states are used extensively as a mathematically convenient description of physically relevant states of many-body quantum systems. Those built on regular lattices, i.e. matrix product states (MPS) in dimension 1 and projected entangled pair states (PEPS) in dimension 2 or higher, are of particular interest in condensed matter physics. The general goal of this work is to characterize which features of MPS and PEPS are generic and which are, on the contrary, exceptional. This problem can be rephrased as follows: given an MPS or PEPS sampled at random, what are the features that it displays with either high or low probability? One property which we are particularly interested in is that of having either rapidly decaying or long-range correlations. In a nutshell, our main result is that translation-invariant MPS and PEPS typically exhibit exponential decay of correlations at a high rate. We have two distinct ways of getting to this conclusion, depending on the dimensional regime under consideration. Both yield intermediate results which are of independent interest, namely: the parent Hamiltonian and the transfer operator of such MPS and PEPS typically have a large spectral gap. In all these statements, our aim is to get a quantitative estimate of the considered quantity (generic correlation length or spectral gap), which has the best possible dependency on the physical and bond dimensions of the random MPS or PEPS.</description>

      <title>Heavy-flavor multimodal fragmentation to $S$-wave pentacharms at next-generation hadron colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the leading-power fragmentation of fully charmed pentaquark states ($S$-wave $|c\bar{c}ccc\rangle$ pentacharms) at hadron colliders. We introduce a new set of multimodal collinear fragmentation functions, named PQ5Q1.0. They rely on an enhanced calculation of the initial-scale input for the constituent heavy-quark fragmentation channel, making them well suited to describe the short-distance emission of either a compact multicharm state or a dicharm-charm-dicharm configuration. To explore phenomenological implications, we use the (sym)JETHAD multimodular interface to study NLL/NLO$^+$ semi-inclusive production rates for pentacharm-plus-jet systems at the forthcoming HL-LHC and the future FCC. Our analysis represents a further step toward bridging the domains of hadronic structure, precision QCD, and exotic matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the cosmological dynamics of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity models in a four-dimensional spatially flat FLRW metric. These models are described by $f\left( R,\mathcal{G}\right) =f\left( R+\mu \mathcal{G}\right) $ theory of gravity. They are equivalent to models linear in the Ricci scalar $R$ and in the Gauss-Bonnet scalar $\mathcal{G}$ with one nonminimally coupled scalar field without kinetic term. We analyze the stability of the de Sitter solutions and construct the phase space of the field equations to investigate the cosmological evolution. We show that $f\left( R+\mu \mathcal{G}\right) $-theory provides a double inflationary epoch, this can be used to unify the early-time and late-time acceleration phases of the universe. Moreover, we discuss the initial value problem for theory to be cosmologically viable. Finally, the effects of the cold dark matter in cosmic evolution are discussed.</description>

      <title>Power-Law Bounces in $f(R)$ Gravity: Analysis of the Ekpyrosis and Accelerating Regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetime within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity using a compact, model-independent dynamical systems approach. By assuming a power-law scale factor, we explore ekpyrotic and accelerating solutions to address the big bang singularity. Our analysis demonstrates that a cosmological bounce, characterized by a transition from contraction to expansion, possibly avoids the singularity without directly using the Raychaudhuri equation, unlike previous approaches using specific $f(R) \simeq R^n$ forms. We identify a key fixed point in the phase space corresponding to the bounce, supported by perturbation analysis and qualitative description of trajectories in the phase space. The results suggest that $f(R)$ gravity provides a robust framework for non-singular cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem from statistical mechanics and chaotic mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem (which is the prototype of undecidable problems in combinatorics and statistical physics) by constructing a suitable mapping from tilings of finite squares of different sizes. Such mapping depends on the initial family of Wang tiles (the alphabet) with which one would like to tile the plane. This allows to define effective entropy and temperature associated to the alphabet (together with the corresponding partition function). We identify a subclass of good alphabets by observing that when the entropy and temperature of a given alphabet are well-behaved in the thermodynamical sense then such alphabet is a good candidate to tile the infinite two-dimensional plane. Our proposal is tested successfully with the known available good alphabets (which produce periodic tilings, aperiodic but self-similar tilings as well as tilings which are neither periodic nor self-similar). Our analysis shows that the Kendall Tau coefficient is able to distinguish alphabets with a good thermodynamical behavior from alphabets with bad thermodynamical behavior. The transition from good to bad behavior is related to a transition from non-chaotic to chaotic regime in discrete dynamical systems of logistic type.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative determination of meson masses and low-energy constants in large-$N$ QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide first-principles non-perturbative determinations of the low-lying meson mass spectrum of large-$N$ QCD in the 't Hooft limit $N_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm f}}/N\to 0$, as well as of three low-energy constants appearing in the QCD chiral expansion: the quark condensate $\Sigma$, the pion decay constant $F_\pi$, and the next-to-leading-order coupling $\bar{\ell}_4$. Using the excited state masses in the $\pi$ and $\rho$ channels, we are able to investigate the behavior of their radial Regge trajectories. Concerning QCD low-energy constants, we are able to assess the magnitude of sub-leading corrections in $1/N$ by combining our $N=\infty$ results with previous finite-$N$ determinations. Our calculation exploits large-$N$ twisted volume reduction to efficiently perform numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the large-$N$ lattice discretized theory. We employ several values of $N$ up to $N=841$, 5 values of the lattice spacing, and several values of the quark mass, to achieve controlled continuum and chiral extrapolations.</description>

      <title>Comparing a Compact-Binary Mass-Shell Model with Select Observed Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent work, coalescing compact binaries (CCBs) were modeled as a rotating and contracting compact mass shell, providing an alternative effective representation to the state-of-the-art effective-one-body approach. Using a variational methodology, the Laplace-Beltrami formulation of the Ricci tensor was applied to a Kerr metric Ansatz, and the corresponding energy density $T_{00}$ of the CCB mass shell was obtained via the Einstein field equations. At the time of coalescence $t_C$, the resulting surface energy depends on the reduced mass $\mu$, the symmetric mass ratio $\alpha$, and the normalized orbital spin velocity of the CCB. In this work, we evaluate the radiated energy predicted by this variational approach for 45 select gravitational wave (GW) events from the O1--O4 runs, and compare these values with those inferred from observational catalogs, either directly or via the total-minus-remnant mass difference. For 38 of the 45 events analyzed, the predicted radiated energies agree with observationally inferred values within the reported uncertainties, with 1:1 ratios spanning from $0.828$ to $0.997$ (mean $0.942$, median $0.955$). Three events exhibit ratios in the range $0.721\sim0.779$, one event yields a ratio of $0.466$, and for the remaining events the radiated energy is either unconstrained or inaccessible due to undocumented total-minus-remnant mass differences. These results indicate that the analytical approximation captures, for the most part, the leading-order energy scaling of compact binary mergers, while also suggesting clear avenues for further systematic improvement, including incorporating post-Newtonian corrections due to e.g. a non-zero eccentricity or combined tidal deformability.</description>

      <title>Toward Axion Signal Extraction in Semiconductor Spin Qubits Via Spectral Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum sensing and computational technologies indicate the possibility of improving the precision of measurements aimed at detecting cosmological particles and weakly interacting massive particles using various qubit platforms. While recent progress has been made, mitigating environmental noise remains a challenge in extracting particle parameters with high fidelity. Addressing these challenges requires efforts on two levels. At the device level, the qubit and its array acting as a probe, must be isolated from electrical and magnetic noise through optimized device geometry. At the signal-processing level, it is necessary to develop filtering methods targeting specific noise spectra based on different qubit architectures. In this work, we explore the possibility of using semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits as a platform to search for quantum chromodynamics axions and, more broadly, axion like particles (ALPs). Starting by deriving an effective Hamiltonian for electron-axion interactions, we identify an axion-induced effective magnetic field and determine the characteristic axion oscillation frequency. To suppress charge noise in the devices and environmental noise, we first analyze the charge noise spectrum and then develop a dedicated filtering and noise-reduction protocol, paving the way for exploring feasible axion mass ranges. Our preliminary study holds promise for enhancing the screening of various axion signals using quantum technologies. We expect that our analysis and filtering protocol can help advance the use of semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit arrays in axion detection.</description>

Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background is secondarily and inevitably induced by the primordial curvature perturbations beyond the first order of the cosmological perturbation theory. We analytically calculate the integration kernel of the power spectrum of the induced GWs, which is the universal part independent of the spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations, in the radiation-dominated era and in the matter-dominated era. We derive fully analytic expressions of the GW spectrum when possible. As a minor update, we study the case of the top-hat function as the spectrum of the curvature perturbations. We also discuss generalization in the presence of multiple cosmological eras with different equations of state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A growing body of examples reveals that topology and geometry are deeply intertwined in shaping universal properties of quantum matter, as seen in fracton orders with size-dependent topological ground-state degeneracy and in cluster states with spurious topological entanglement entropy. We introduce the \textit{subdimensional entanglement entropy} (SEE), defined on \textit{subdimensional entanglement subsystems} (SESs) embedded in the bulk, as a direct probe of this intertwinement. By virtually tuning SES dimension, geometry and topology, the subleading components of SEE show sharply distinct geometric and topological responses in cluster states, $\mathbb{Z}_q$ topological orders, and fracton orders. Further viewing the SES reduced density matrix as a mixed state on the SES manifold, we establish an exact correspondence between stabilizers and mixed-state symmetries, distinguishing \textit{strong} from \textit{weak} classes. Nontrivial SEE enforces weak symmetries to act as \textit{transparent patch operators} of strong ones, together forming \textit{transparent composite symmetries} that are robust against finite depth quantum circuits. Due to the presence of transparent patch operators, each $D$-dimensional SES holographically encodes a $(D+1)$-dimensional topological order. Thus, SEE simultaneously accesses various forefront directions, providing a unified and versatile nexus linking phenomena previously regarded as distinct.</description>

      <title>Is The Trace Anomaly at its Minimum Value at Neutron Star Centers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03714</link>

Abstract: While the equation of state (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of neutron star (NS) matter has been extensively studied, the EOS-parameter $\phi = P/\varepsilon$ or equivalently the dimensionless trace anomaly $\Delta = 1/3 - \phi$, which quantifies the balance between pressure $P$ and energy density $\varepsilon$, remains far less explored, especially in NS cores. Its bounds and density profile carry crucial information about the nature of superdense matter. Physically, the EOS-parameter $\phi$ represents the mean stiffness of matter accumulated from the stellar surface up to a given density. Based on the intrinsic structure of the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations, we show that $\phi$ decreases monotonically outward from the NS center, independent of any specific input NS EOS model. Furthermore, observational evidence of a peak in the speed-of-sound squared (SSS) density-profile near the center effectively rules out a valley and a subsequent peak in the radial profile of $\phi$ at similar densities, reinforcing its monotonic decrease. These model-independent relations impose strong constraints on the near-center behavior of the EOS-parameter $\phi$, particularly demonstrating that the mean stiffness (or equivalently $\Delta$) reaches a local maximum (minimum) at the center.</description>

      <title>A model-independent assessment of the late-time dark energy density evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combined measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia), have recently challenged the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm, indicating potential evidence for a dynamical dark energy component. These results are usually obtained in the context of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameterizations, generally implying in phantom-crossing at intermediate redshifts. However, a general mapping between these parameterizations that yields approximately the same background observables clouds the inference of the true nature of dark energy in the context of these parametric methods. In this work, we propose a model-independent reconstruction of the dark energy density, which is more directly constrained than its EoS, based on the Gaussian Process (GP) regression method with the use of DESI DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 SN Ia samples. In addition, we perform a statistical comparison between the energy densities of $\Lambda$, a non-phantom thawing quintessence-type dark energy, and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization with the reconstructed function. We find that all models agree with the GP reconstruction at 95\% C.L., with the largest discrepancy coming from $\Lambda$CDM with DESY5 at low redshifts. Even in this case, our findings suggest that it may be premature to claim statistically significant evidence for evolving or phantom dark energy with current DESI and SN Ia measurements.</description>

      <title>Absence of charged pion condensation in a magnetic field with parallel rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the critical temperature of a relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate of charged bosons driven by rotation in a parallel magnetic field [Y. Liu and I. Zahed, Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 032001 (2018)]. For non-interacting bosons, the critical temperature can only be determined for a system with fixed angular momentum. We find that the critical temperature of the non-interacting system vanishes due to the fact that the system is quasi-one-dimensional, indicating that non-interacting bosons cannot undergo Bose-Einstein condensation. For interacting bosons, we investigate a system with quartic self-interaction. We show that the order parameter vanishes and the off-diagonal long-range order is absent at any nonzero temperature because of the quasi-one-dimensional feature, in accordance with the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem.</description>
