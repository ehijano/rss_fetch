      <title>Effects of symmetry on coupled rotary molecular motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As engineering advances toward the nanoscale, understanding design principles for molecular motors becomes increasingly valuable. Many molecular motors consist of coupled components transducing one free-energy source into another. Here, we study the performance of coupled rotary molecular motors with different rotational symmetries under constant and scaling driving forces. Under constant driving and strong coupling, symmetry match between the motors decreases the output power. In contrast, under a scaling driving force, the output power is not sensitive to symmetries. However, driving the upstream motor too strongly reduces the downstream motor's output power, leading to a perhaps counterintuitive phenomenon we term disruption, in which the two motors become disconnected. Across both driving schemes, output power peaks at intermediate coupling, confirming the value of flexible coupling. Beyond providing insights into biological motors, these findings could inform the future design of synthetic nanomotors and structure-based drugs.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Dynamics and First-Passage Properties of Stochastic Processes: From Brownian Motion to Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we develop analytical methods to study out-of-equilibrium stochastic processes driven by colored noise, i.e., noise with temporal correlations. These non-Markovian processes pose significant analytical challenges compared to processes driven by white noise, such as Brownian motion. A primary focus is on active particle systems, specifically the run-and-tumble particle subjected to an arbitrary force. We derive exact expressions for its mean first-passage time (MFPT) and exit probability from an interval using the backward Fokker-Planck equation. Remarkably, we find that the MFPT can be optimized as a function of the tumbling rate. Additionally, we investigate stochastic resetting and switching diffusion models. For switching diffusion models which are examples of "Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusions", we use a renewal approach and large deviation theory to derive exact results for various observables. These include the distribution of the position of the particle and its moments, but also its cumulants which are key observables to characterize non-Gaussian fluctuations. Notably, we uncover an unexpected connection between this model and free cumulants. We also examine these models in the presence of a harmonic potential by using Kesten variables. This approach enables us to write an integral equation for the steady-state distribution, which we solve in specific cases. Furthermore, we extend Siegmund duality - a concept that is not widely known in the physics literature - to active particles, random diffusion models, stochastic resetting, and continuous-time random walks. This duality establishes a direct relation between first passage observables and the spatial properties of a dual process, which we explicitly construct.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic protocol for the generalized Langevin equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a self-consistent methodology for determining the work involved in an adiabatic process where the dynamics of a Brownian particle is trapped in an optical tweezers. Instead of varying the frequency of the trap, it is displaced through a defined protocol. Assuming the dynamics follow a modified generalized Langevin equation previously proposed by the author, it is found that the external adiabatic driving is uniquely derived in terms of the system's dynamical properties, and unlike isothermal processes, does not require optimization. There is no need to include other parameters than those characterizing the model.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus for Pathwise Observables of Markov-Jump Processes: Unification of Diffusion and Jump Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path-wise observables--functionals of stochastic trajectories--are at the heart of time-average statistical mechanics and are central to thermodynamic inequalities such as uncertainty relations, speed limits, and correlation-bounds. They provide a means of thermodynamic inference in the typical situation, when not all dissipative degrees of freedom in a system are experimentally accessible. So far, theories focusing on path-wise observables have been developing in two major directions, diffusion processes and Markov-jump dynamics, in a virtually disjoint manner. Moreover, even the respective results for diffusion and jump dynamics were derived with a patchwork of different approaches that are predominantly indirect. Stochastic calculus was recently shown to provide a direct approach to path-wise observables of diffusion processes, while a corresponding framework for jump dynamics remained elusive. In our work we develop, in an exact parallelism with continuous-space diffusion, a complete stochastic calculus for path-wise observables of Markov-jump processes. We formulate a "Langevin equation" for jump processes, define general path-wise observables, and establish their covariation structure, whereby we fully account for transients and time-inhomogeneous dynamics. We prove the known kinds of thermodynamic inequalities in their most general form and discus saturation conditions. We determine the response of path-wise observables to general (incl. thermal) perturbations and carry out the continuum limit to achieve the complete unification of diffusion and jump dynamics. Our results open new avenues in the direction of discrete-state analogs of generative diffusion models and the learning of stochastic thermodynamics from fluctuating trajectories.</description>

      <title>The Cost of Nonlocality: A Dynamical Performance Equation of Energy-Entanglement-Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to quantify the physical cost of generating non-local entanglement in systems governed by local interactions. By unifying the quantum speed limit and Lieb-Robinson bounds, we establish an "energy-entanglement performance equation." This framework connects theoretical computational complexity with experimental observables by introducing a measurable proxy for complexity, thereby revealing a performance trade-off among the "energy variance-entanglement product," the strength of local interactions, and dynamical efficiency. Our work not only defines a "performance frontier"-constrained by theoretical bounds and amenable to experimental benchmarking-but also provides a novel diagnostic tool for identifying the performance bottlenecks of a process.</description>

      <title>Thermalization with partial information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A many-body system, whether in contact with a large environment or evolving under complex dynamics, can typically be modeled as occupying the thermal state singled out by Jaynes' maximum entropy principle. Here, we find analogous fundamental principles identifying a noisy quantum channel $\mathcal{T}$ to model the system's dynamics, going beyond the study of its final equilibrium state. Our maximum channel entropy principle states that $\mathcal{T}$ should maximize the channel's entropy, suitably defined, subject to any available macroscopic constraints. These may correlate input and outputs, and may lead to restricted or partial thermalizing dynamics including thermalization with average energy conservation. This principle is reinforced by an independent extension of the microcanonical derivation of the thermal state to channels, which leads to the same $\mathcal{T}$. Our technical contributions include a derivation of the general mathematical structure of $\mathcal{T}$, a custom postselection theorem relating an arbitrary permutation-invariant channel to nearby i.i.d. channels, as well as novel typicality results for quantum channels for noncommuting constraints and arbitrary input states. We propose a learning algorithm for quantum channels based on the maximum channel entropy principle, demonstrating the broader relevance of $\mathcal{T}$ beyond thermodynamics and complex many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Maximum channel entropy principle and microcanonical channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal state plays a number of significant roles throughout physics, information theory, quantum computing, and machine learning. It arises from Jaynes' maximum-entropy principle as the maximally entropic state subject to linear constraints, and is also the reduced state of the microcanonical state on the system and a large environment. We formulate a maximum-channel-entropy principle, defining a thermal channel as one that maximizes a channel entropy measure subject to linear constraints on the channel. We prove that thermal channels exhibit an exponential form reminiscent of thermal states. We study examples including thermalizing channels that conserve a state's average energy, as well as Pauli-covariant and classical channels. We propose a quantum channel learning algorithm based on maximum channel entropy methods that mirrors a similar learning algorithm for quantum states. We then demonstrate the thermodynamic relevance of the maximum-channel-entropy channel by proving that it resembles the action on a single system of a microcanonical channel acting on many copies of the system. Here, the microcanonical channel is defined by requiring that the linear constraints obey sharp statistics for any i.i.d. input state, including for noncommuting constraint operators. Our techniques involve convex optimization methods to optimize recently introduced channel entropy measures, typicality techniques involving noncommuting operators, a custom channel postselection technique, as well as Schur-Weyl duality. As a result of potential independent interest, we prove a constrained postselection theorem for quantum channels. The widespread relevance of the thermal state throughout physics, information theory, machine learning, and quantum computing, inspires promising applications for the analogous concept for quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and particle production from cosmological perturbations: a quantum optical simulation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a computational framework based on the Gaussian formalism and symplectic circuit representation to explore cosmological perturbations during inflation. These tools offer an efficient means to study entanglement generation and particle production, particularly when analytical methods become insufficient and numerical simulations are essential. By evolving an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum through a two-mode squeezer, we simulate the behavior of the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity across a wide range of cosmological backgrounds, each characterized by a distinct equation of state. The von Neumann entropy obtained via QuGIT simulations is compared with analytic R\'enyi entropy bounds, thereby validating the accuracy of our circuit implementation of the cosmological squeezing Hamiltonian in both accelerating and decelerating scenarios. We further investigate the role of thermal noise and demonstrate how the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity are affected by its presence.</description>

      <title>Almost local integrable models from supersymmetry algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetry algebras can be used to obtain algebraic expressions for constant Yang-Baxter solutions, also known as braid group generators. This was done for non-invertible braid operators in \cite{maity2025non}. In this work we extend this construction for the invertible ones. The resulting expressions are then shown to obey relations analogous to those satisfied by quotients of braid groups. Examples of the latter include the Iwahori-Hecke algebra and the Birman-Murakami-Wenzl (BMW) algebra. As a result, we can Baxterize the constant Yang-Baxter solutions to yield spectral parameter dependent $R$-matrices. The regularity of these $R$-matrices depend on the representation of SUSY generators. In some cases they are regular in the usual sense and in the remaining they are `almost' regular. In the latter case they are also non-invertible. Nevertheless we show that they can still help us construct integrable models in all dimensions of the local Hilbert space. These models can be described by Hamiltonian densities that are either local or non-local, depending on the representation chosen for the SUSY generators. We demonstrate this for all constant $4\times 4$ invertible Yang-Baxter solutions. Apart from finding new nearest-neighbor interaction spin $\frac{1}{2}$ systems, we also find their higher spin analogs due to the algebraic [representation independent] approach.</description>

      <title>Probing the statistics of sequence-dependent DNA conformations in solution using SAXS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SAXS studies of four 60 base-pair DNA duplexes with sequences closely
  related to part of the GAGE6 (G-antigen 6) promoter have been performed to
  study the role of DNA conformations in solution and their potential
  relationship to DNA-protein binding. We show that the SAXS data can be
  analysed using a simple polymer model which nevertheless quantitatively
  describes the average persistence length and torsional rigidity of the DNA
  double helix to determine the statistical distribution of local
  conformations of the DNA in solution to a high accuracy. Although the SAXS
  data is averaged over time and all spatial orientations of the molecules,
  for sequences which have some asymmetry in the data we show that the
  conformations can be oriented with respect to the sequence. This allows
  specific features detected by the analysis to be precisely related to the
  DNA sequence, opening up new opportunities for SAXS to investigate the
  properties of DNA in solution. The biological implications of these results
  are discussed.</description>

      <title>Odd elasticity in disordered chiral active materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral active materials are abundant in nature, including the cytoskeleton with attached motor proteins, rotary clusters of bacteria flagella, and self-spinning starfish embryos. These materials break both time reversal and mirror-image (parity) symmetries due to injection of torques at the microscale. Recently, it was found that chiral active materials may show a new type of elastic response termed `odd' elasticity. Currently, odd elasticity is understood microscopically only in ordered structures, e.g., lattice designs of metamaterials. It still remains to explore how odd elasticity can emerge in natural or biological systems, which are usually disordered. To address this, we propose a minimal generic model for disordered `odd solids', using micropolar (Cosserat) elasticity in the presence of local active torques. We find that odd elasticity naturally emerges as a nonlinear effect of internal particle rotations. Exploring the viscoelasticity of this solid, when immersed in active self-spinning solvent (`odd fluid'), we discover both dynamically unstable regions and regions in which bulk waves can propagate even in an overdamped solid.</description>

      <title>Local-global correlations of dynamics on disordered energy landscapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stationary distribution of a continuous-time Markov chain generally arises from a complicated global balance of probability fluxes. Nevertheless, empirical evidence shows that the effective potential, defined as the negative logarithm of the stationary distribution, is often highly correlated with a simple local property of a state: the logarithm of its exit rate. To better understand why and how typically this correlation is high, we study reversible reaction kinetics on energy landscapes consisting of Gaussian wells and barriers, respectively associated with the vertices and edges of regular graphs. We find that for the correlation to be high it suffices for the heights of the barriers to vary significantly less than the depths of the wells, regardless of the degree of the underlying graph. As an application, we bound below the expected correlation exhibited by dynamics of the random energy model, known as the Bouchaud trap model. We anticipate that the proof, which combines a general lower bound of the expected correlation with the Gaussian concentration inequality, can be extended to several other classes of models.</description>

      <title>A short combinatorial proof of Di Francesco's conjecture on Aztec triangles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Di Francesco conjectured in 2021 that the number of domino tilings of a certain family of regions -- called Aztec triangles -- on the square lattice is given by a product formula reminiscent of the one giving the number of alternating sign matrices. This turned out to be a real challenge to prove without the use of computers -- each of the two existing proofs (one due to Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser, the other to Corteel, Huang and Krattenthaler) relies on substantial computer calculations which would be hard to check directly. In this paper we present a short combinatorial proof that relies on the second author's factorization theorem and complementation theorem for perfect matchings.</description>

Abstract: The network density matrix (NDM) framework, enabling an information-theoretic and multiscale treatment of network flow, has been gaining momentum over the last decade. Benefiting from the counterparts of physical functions such as free energy and entropy, NDM's applications range from estimating how nodes influence network flows across scales the centrality of nodes at the local level to explaining the emergence of structural and functional order. Here, we introduce a generalized notion of the network internal energy $E_\tau$, where $\tau$ denotes a temporal hyperparameter allowing for multi-resolution analysis, showing how it measures the leakage of dynamical correlations from arbitrary partitions, where the minimally leaky subsystems have minimal $E_\tau$. Moreover, we analytically demonstrate that $E_\tau$ reduces to the well-known modularity function at the smallest temporal scale $\tau = 0$. We investigate this peculiar resemblance by comparing the communities minimizing $E_\tau$, with those detected by widely used methods like multiscale modularity and Markov stability. Our work provides a detailed analytical and computational picture of network generalized internal energy, and explores its effectiveness in detecting communities in synthetic and empirical networks within a unifying framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum transport plays a central role in both fundamental physics and the development of quantum technologies. While significant progress has been made in understanding transport phenomena in quantum systems, methods for optimizing transport properties remain limited, particularly in complex quantum networks. Building on recent advances in classical network optimization via the generalized Doob transform, we introduce a novel method that extends this approach to quantum networks. Our framework leverages a single diagonalization of the system generator to efficiently tailor both the Hamiltonian and dissipative contributions, optimizing transport observables such as currents and activities. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness through extensive numerical explorations, showing that optimal performance arises from non-trivial modifications to both coherent and incoherent dynamics. We also assess the robustness of the optimization under constraints that preserve specific physical features, such as fixed dissipative structures and input-output interactions. Finally, we discuss the connection between optimized transport and centrosymmetry, highlighting the relevance of this property for enhanced transport efficiency in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Simulations of dielectric permittivity of water by Machine Learned Potentials with long-range Coulombic interactions</title>

Abstract: The dielectric permittivity of liquid water is a fundamental property that underlies its distinctive behaviors in numerious physical, biological, and chemical processes. Within a machine learning framework, we present a unified approach to compute the dielectric permittivity of water, systematically incorporating various electric boundary conditions. Our method employs a long-range-inclusive deep potential trained on data from hybrid density functional theory calculations. Dielectric response is evaluated using an auxiliary deep neural network that predicts the centers of maximally localized Wannier functions. We investigate three types of electric boundary conditions--metallic, insulating, and Kirkwood-Frohlich--to assess their influence on correlated dipole fluctuations and dielectric relaxation dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate a consistent methodology for computing the Kirkwood correlation factor, correlation length, and dielectric permittivity under each boundary condition, where long-range electrostatics play a critical role. This work establishes a robust and generalizable machine-learning framework for modeling the dielectric properties of polar liquids under diverse electrostatic environments.</description>

      <title>Diffusion in a $d$-dimensional rough potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prediction of diffusion in solids is necessary to understand the microstructure evolution in materials out of equilibrium. Although one can reasonably predict diffusive transport coefficients using atomistic methods, these approaches can be very computationally expensive. In this work, we develop an analytical model for the diffusivity in a noisy solid solution in an arbitrary number of dimensions using a mean first passage time analysis. These analytical results are then compared with kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, which are in good agreement with the simulation data in the low-noise limit. We argue that the difference is expected from percolation pathways that increase the diffusivity in the KMC analysis but are not captured by the model. This generalization to arbitrary dimensions has been elusive to the community since Zwanzig [PNAS, 85, 2029 (1988)] published his seminal work on 1-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Field theories and quantum methods for stochastic reaction-diffusion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex systems are composed of many particles or agents that move and interact with one another. The underlying mathematical framework to model many of these systems must incorporate the spatial transport of particles and their interactions, as well as changes to their copy numbers, all of which can be formulated in terms of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. The probabilistic representation of these processes is complex because of combinatorial aspects arising due to nonlinear interactions and varying particle numbers. This review presents the main field theory representations of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, which handle these issues `under-the-hood'. First, we focus on bringing techniques familiar to theoretical physicists -- such as second quantization, Fock space, and path integrals -- back into the classical domain of reaction-diffusion systems. We demonstrate how various field theory representations can all be unified under a single basis-independent representation. We then extend existing quantum-based methods and notation to work directly on the level of the unifying representation, and we illustrate how they can be used to consistently obtain previous known results, such as numerical discretizations and relations between model parameters at multiple scales. Throughout the work, we contextualize how these representations mirror well-known models of chemical physics depending on their spatial resolution, as well as the corresponding macroscopic limits. The framework presented here may find applications in a diverse set of scientific fields, including physical chemistry, theoretical ecology, epidemiology, game theory and socio-economical models of complex systems. The presentation is done in a self-contained educational and unifying manner such that it can be followed by researchers across several fields.</description>

      <title>Optimal performance of thermoelectric devices with small external irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the thermodynamic analysis of thermoelectric devices, typical irreversibilities are for the processes of finite-rate heat transfer, heat leak and Joule heating. Approximate analyses often focus on either internal or external irreversibility, obtaining well-known expressions for the efficiency at maximum power (EMP), such as the Curzon-Ahlborn value for endoreversible model and the Schmiedl-Seifert form for exoreversible model. Within the Constant Properties model, we simultaneously incorporate internal as well as external irreversibilities. We employ the approximation of a symmetric and small external irreversibility (SEI), allowing a tractable expression for EMP that depends on three parameters i) the ratio of internal to external thermal conductance ii) the figure of merit of the thermoelectric material and iii) the ratio of hot and cold reservoir temperatures. We study limiting forms of this EMP and compare our framework with the exact model as well as with other irreversible models in finite-time thermodynamics, such as the minimally nonlinear model. In particular, we argue that the TEG in endoreversible approximation can be mapped to the mesoscopic model of Feynman's ratchet in the high temperatures regime, thus providing an alternative to the viewpoint in literature where the TEG in linear regime is mapped to an exoreversible case. Finally, extending our study to the thermoelectric refrigerator under similar assumptions as for the generator, we analyze the efficiency at the maximum cooling power.</description>

      <title>Canonical equilibrium of mean-field $O(n)$~models in the presence of random fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study canonical-equilibrium properties of Random Field $O(n)$ Models involving classical continuous vector spins of $n$ components with mean-field interactions and subject to disordered fields acting on individual spins. To this end, we employ two complementary approaches: the mean-field approximation, valid for any disorder distribution, and the replica trick, applicable when the disordered fields are sampled from a Gaussian distribution. On the basis of an exact analysis, we demonstrate that when replica symmetry holds, both the approaches yield identical expression for the free energy per spin of the system. As consequences, we study the case of $n=2$ ($XY$ spins) and that of $n=3$ (Heisenberg spins) for two representative choices of the disorder distribution, namely, a Gaussian and a symmetric bimodal distribution. For both $n=2$ and $n=3$, we demonstrate that while the magnetization exhibits a continuous phase transition as a function of temperature for the Gaussian case, the transition could be either continuous or first-order with an emergent tricriticality when the disorder distribution is bimodal. We also discuss in the context of our models the issue of self-averaging of extensive variables near the critical point of a continuous phase transition.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the ground-state entanglement entropy in inhomogeneous free-boson models in one spatial dimension. We develop a powerful method to extract the leading term in the entanglement scaling, based on the analytic properties of the inhomogeneous potential. This method is applicable to a broad class of models with smooth spatial inhomogeneities. As a case study, we apply this approach for a family of exactly-solvable models characterized by orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme, finding a perfect match between the numerical and analytical results.</description>

      <title>$1/f^{3/2}$ Power Spectrum at the Phonon Bottleneck</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The common observation of a `$1/f^\alpha$' power spectrum with $\alpha&lt;2$ constitutes one of the enduring mysteries of condensed matter physics. Here it is shown that a $1/f^{\alpha}$ power spectrum, with $\alpha = 3/2$, can arise when an ensemble of two--level systems is coupled to a heat bath by means of a system of Bosonic quasiparticles. The model considered is the classic model of Faughnan and Strandberg of the phonon bottleneck, and the anomalous relaxation is associated with an approximate non-equilibrium steady state of the phonons maintained by slow spin relaxation. It is shown that a frequency-dependent susceptibility can be defined in the steady state and that the prediction $\alpha=3/2$, or the equivalent stretched exponential relaxation with exponent $\beta = 2-\alpha = 1/2$, is consistent with existing experimental data. These results give an insight into the origins of anomalous relaxation in condensed matter and the practical behaviour of two-level systems.</description>

Abstract: The family of Boltzmann distributions is used in statistical mechanics to describe the distribution of states in systems with a given temperature. We give a novel characterization of this family as the unique one satisfying independence for uncoupled systems. The theorem boils down to a statement about endomorphisms of the convolution semi-group of finitely supported probability measures on the natural numbers, or, alternatively, about endomorphisms of the multiplicative semi-group of polynomials with non-negative coefficients.</description>

      <title>Brain functions emerge as thermal equilibrium states of the connectome</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental idea in neuroscience is that cognitive functions -- such as perception, learning, memory, and locomotion -- are shaped and constrained by the brain's structural organization. Despite significant progress in mapping and analyzing structural connectomes, the principles linking the brain's physical architecture to its functional capabilities remain elusive. Here, we introduce an algebraic quantum model to bridge this theoretical gap, offering new insights into the relationship between the connectome and emergent brain functions, while connecting structural data to functional predictions. Using the well-mapped C. elegans anatomical and extrasynaptic connectomes, we demonstrate that brain functions, defined as functional networks of a neural system, emerge as thermal equilibrium states of an algebraic quantum system derived from the graph algebra of the underlying directed multigraph. Specifically, these equilibrium states, characterized by the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) formalism, reveal how individual neurons contribute to functional network formation. Our model illuminates the structure-function relationship in neural circuits through two key features: (1) a functional connectome that delineates topologically driven neuronal interactions and (2) an Integration Capacity (IC) index that quantifies how effectively neurons coordinate and modulate diverse information flows. Together, these features provide a statistical and mechanistic account of information flow and reveal how the network topology of the connectome predicts cognition and complex behaviors.</description>

Abstract: This review presents recent developments in the study of inhomogeneous XX spin chains, highlighting results on perfect state transfer, out-of-equilibrium stationary dynamics in open systems, and entanglement and correlations in ground states. We discuss the conditions on couplings that enable perfect state transfer, examine how heat currents scale when the chains are coupled to thermal baths, explore the role of tridiagonal matrices in approximating the entanglement Hamiltonian and investigate bulk and boundary entanglement negativity and correlation decay. These findings underscore some of the distinctive physical behavior of inhomogeneous spin chains and their potential applications in quantum information and thermal transport.</description>

Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Continuous majorization in quantum phase space for Wigner-positive states and proposals for Wigner-negative states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum resource theory, one is often interested in identifying which states serve as the best resources for particular quantum tasks. If a relative comparison between quantum states can be made, this gives rise to a partial order, where states are ordered according to their suitability to act as a resource. In the literature, various different partial orders for a variety of quantum resources have been proposed. In discrete variable systems, vector majorization of Wigner functions in discrete phase space provides a natural partial order between quantum states. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) in Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, Cerf, Quantum 7, 1021 (2023). In this work, we develop the theory of continuous majorization in the general $N$-mode case. In addition, we propose extensions to include states with finite Wigner negativity. For the special case of the convex hull of $N$-mode Gaussian states, we prove a conjecture made by Van Herstraeten, Jabbour and Cerf. We also prove a phase space counterpart of Uhlmann's theorem of majorization.</description>

      <title>Atomistic mechanisms of viscosity in 2D liquid-like fluids</title>

Abstract: Shear viscosity plays a fundamental role in fluid dynamics from heavy-ion collisions to biological processes. Still, its microscopic mechanisms at the individual particle kinetic level remain a subject of ongoing research, specially in dense systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the shear viscosity ($\eta$) of two-dimensional (2D) simple fluids using computer simulations of Lennard-Jones, Yukawa, and one-component plasma systems. By combining Frenkel's liquid description, consisting of solid-like quasi-harmonic vibrations interrupted by thermally activated hops, with the concept of lifetime of local atomic connectivity $\tau_{LC}$, we find a surprisingly simple formula for the kinematic viscosity that is solely determined by $\tau_{LC}$ and the average kinetic particle speed $\bar{v}_p$. The derived analytical expression provides a direct link between macroscopic and microscopic dynamics, which shows excellent agreement with the simulation data in the dense liquid-like regime in all the 2D fluids considered. Moreover, it is discovered that, $\tau_{LC}$ in 2D fluids is universally determined by the effective potential difference between the first peak and valley of the pair correlation function, implying a direct connection between macroscopic shear transport and microscopic structure. Finally, we demonstrate that the characteristic length scale $l_p= \bar{v}_p \tau_{LC}$, which governs the macroscopic shear viscosity, aligns with the elastic length-scale that defines the propagation limit of collective shear waves in liquids. These findings establish that shear viscosity in 2D fluids arises from the diffusive transport of average particle momentum across the elastic length scale. Moreover, they highlight that shear dynamics are fundamentally governed by localized configurational excitations within the atomic connectivity network.</description>

      <title>Emergence of ecological structure and species rarity from fluctuating metabolic strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ecosystems frequently display the coexistence of diverse species under resource competition, typically resulting in skewed distributions of rarity and abundance. A potential driver of such coexistence is environmental fluctuations that favor different species over time. How to include and treat such temporal variability in existing consumer-resource models is still an open problem. In this work, we study correlated temporal fluctuations in species' resource uptake rates -- i.e. metabolic strategies -- within a stochastic consumer-resource framework. In a biologically relevant regime, we are able to find analytically the species abundance distributions through the path integral formalism. Our results reveal that stochastic dynamic metabolic strategies induce community structures that align more closely with empirical ecological observations. Within this framework, ecological communities show a higher diversity than expected under static competitive scenarios. We find that all species become extinct when the ratio of the number of species to the number of resources exceeds a critical threshold. Conversely, diversity peaks at intermediate values of the same ratio. Furthermore, when metabolic strategies of different species are different on average, maximal biodiversity is achieved for intermediate values of the amplitude of fluctuations. This work establishes a robust theoretical framework for exploring how temporal dynamics and stochasticity drive biodiversity and community structure.</description>

      <title>A Generative Neural Annealer for Black-Box Combinatorial Optimization</title>

Abstract: We propose a generative, end-to-end solver for black-box combinatorial optimization that emphasizes both sample efficiency and solution quality on NP problems. Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard, the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively "opening" the black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.</description>
