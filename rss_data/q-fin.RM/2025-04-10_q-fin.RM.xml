      <title>Jointly Exchangeable Collective Risk Models: Interaction, Structure, and Limit Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for systemic risk modeling in insurance portfolios using jointly exchangeable arrays, extending classical collective risk models to account for interactions. We establish central limit theorems that asymptotically characterize total portfolio losses, providing a theoretical foundation for approximations in large portfolios and over long time horizons. These approximations are validated through simulation-based numerical experiments. Additionally, we analyze the impact of dependence on portfolio loss distributions, with a particular focus on tail behavior.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Enhanced Financial Risk Management Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06293v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Risk management in finance involves recognizing, evaluating, and addressing financial risks to maintain stability and ensure regulatory compliance. Extracting relevant insights from extensive regulatory documents is a complex challenge requiring advanced retrieval and language models. This paper introduces RiskData, a dataset specifically curated for finetuning embedding models in risk management, and RiskEmbed, a finetuned embedding model designed to improve retrieval accuracy in financial question-answering systems. The dataset is derived from 94 regulatory guidelines published by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) from 1991 to 2024. We finetune a state-of-the-art sentence BERT embedding model to enhance domain-specific retrieval performance typically for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Experimental results demonstrate that RiskEmbed significantly outperforms general-purpose and financial embedding models, achieving substantial improvements in ranking metrics. By open-sourcing both the dataset and the model, we provide a valuable resource for financial institutions and researchers aiming to develop more accurate and efficient risk management AI solutions.</description>

      <title>On the Efficacy of Shorting Corporate Bonds as a Tail Risk Hedging Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: United States (US) IG bonds typically trade at modest spreads over US Treasuries, reflecting the credit risk tied to a corporation's default potential. During market crises, IG spreads often widen and liquidity tends to decrease, likely due to increased credit risk (evidenced by higher IG Credit Default Index spreads) and the necessity for asset holders like mutual funds to liquidate assets, including IG credits, to manage margin calls, bolster cash reserves, or meet redemptions. These credit and liquidity premia occur during market drawdowns and tend to move non-linearly with the market. The research herein refers to this non-linearity (during periods of drawdown) as downside convexity, and shows that this market behavior can effectively be captured through a short position established in IG Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).
  The following document details the construction of three signals: Momentum, Liquidity, and Credit, that can be used in combination to signal entries and exits into short IG positions to hedge a typical active bond portfolio (such as PIMIX). A dynamic hedge initiates the short when signals jointly correlate and point to significant future hedged return. The dynamic hedge removes when the short position's predicted hedged return begins to mean revert. This systematic hedge largely avoids IG Credit drawdowns, lowers absolute and downside risk, increases annualised returns and achieves higher Sortino ratios compared to the benchmark funds. The method is best suited to high carry, high active risk funds like PIMIX, though it also generalises to more conservative funds similar to DODIX.</description>

      <title>Dimension Reduction of Distributionally Robust Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems with uncertainty sets consisting of high dimensional random vectors that are close in the multivariate Wasserstein distance to a reference random vector. We give conditions under which the images of these sets under scalar-valued aggregation functions are equal to or contained in uncertainty sets of univariate random variables defined via a univariate Wasserstein distance. This allows to rewrite or bound high-dimensional DRO problems with simpler DRO problems over the space of univariate random variables. We generalize the results to uncertainty sets defined via the Bregman-Wasserstein divergence and the max-sliced Wasserstein and Bregman-Wasserstein divergence. The max-sliced divergences allow us to jointly model distributional uncertainty around the reference random vector and uncertainty in the aggregation function. Finally, we derive explicit bounds for worst-case risk measures that belong to the class of signed Choquet integrals.</description>
