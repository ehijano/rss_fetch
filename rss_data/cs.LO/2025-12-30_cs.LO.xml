      <title>ReVEAL: GNN-Guided Reverse Engineering for Formal Verification of Optimized Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ReVEAL, a graph-learning-based method for reverse engineering of multiplier architectures to improve algebraic circuit verification techniques. Our framework leverages structural graph features and learning-driven inference to identify architecture patterns at scale, enabling robust handling of large optimized multipliers. We demonstrate applicability across diverse multiplier benchmarks and show improvements in scalability and accuracy compared to traditional rule-based approaches. The method integrates smoothly with existing verification flows and supports downstream algebraic proof strategies.</description>

      <title>A Representation of Explicit Knowledge and Epistemic Indistinguishability in a Logic of Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The logic of awareness, first proposed by Fagin and Halpern, addressed the problem of logical omniscience by introducing the notion of awareness and distinguishing explicit knowledge from implicit knowledge. In their framework, explicit knowledge was defined as the conjunction of implicit knowledge and awareness, each of which was represented by modal operators. Their definition, however, may derive undesirable propositions that cannot be considered explicit knowledge when Modus Ponens is applied within implicit knowledge. Hence, focusing on indistinguishability among possible worlds, dependent on awareness, we refine the definition of explicit knowledge. In our semantics, we require that the aware implicit knowledge is not necessarily explicit knowledge, though explicit knowledge must be aware as well as implicit. We employ an example of elementary geometry, where different students may or may not reach the final answer, depending on whether they are aware of learned mathematical facts. Thereafter, we formally present the syntax and the semantics of our language, named Awareness-Based Indistinguishability Logic ($\mathrm{AIL}$). We prove that $\mathrm{AIL}$ has more expressive power than the logic of Fagin and Halpern, and show that the latter is embeddable in $\mathrm{AIL}$. Furthermore, we provide an axiomatic system of $\mathrm{AIL}$ and prove its soundness and completeness.</description>

      <title>Many-valued coalgebraic dynamic logics: Safety and strong completeness via reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a coalgebraic framework for studying generalisations of dynamic modal logics such as PDL and game logic in which both the propositions and the semantic structures can take values in an algebra $\mathbf{A}$ of truth-degrees. More precisely, we work with coalgebraic modal logic via $\mathbf{A}$-valued predicate liftings where $\mathbf{A}$ is a $\mathsf{FL}_{\mathrm{ew}}$-algebra, and interpret actions (abstracting programs and games) as $\mathsf{F}$-coalgebras where the functor $\mathsf{F}$ represents some type of $\mathbf{A}$-weighted system. We also allow combinations of crisp propositions with $\mathbf{A}$-weighted systems and vice versa. We introduce coalgebra operations and tests, with a focus on operations that are reducible in the sense that modalities for composed actions can be reduced to compositions of modalities for the constituent actions. We prove that reducible operations are safe for bisimulation and behavioural equivalence, and prove a general strong completeness result, from which we obtain new strong completeness results for $2$-valued iteration-free PDL with $\mathbf{A}$-valued accessibility relations when $\mathbf{A}$ is a finite chain, and for many-valued iteration-free game logic with many-valued strategies based on finite Lukasiewicz logic.</description>

      <title>PSPACE-Completeness of the Equational Theory of Relational Kleene Algebra with Graph Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the equational theory of relational Kleene algebra with \emph{graph loop} is PSpace-complete. Here, the graph loop is the unary operator that restricts a binary relation to the identity relation. We further show that this PSpace-completeness still holds by extending with top, tests, converse, and nominals. Notably, we also obtain that for Kleene algebra with tests (KAT), the equational theory of relational KAT with domain is PSpace-complete, whereas the equational theory of relational KAT with antidomain is ExpTime-complete.
  To this end, we introduce a novel automaton model on relational structures, named \emph{loop-automata}. Loop-automata are obtained from non-deterministic finite string automata (NFA) by adding a transition type that tests whether the current vertex has a loop. Using this model, we give a polynomial-time reduction from the above equational theories to the language inclusion problem for 2-way alternating string automata.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Semantics for Doxastic Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simplicial models have become a crucial tool for studying distributed computing. These models, however, are only able to account for the knowledge, but not for the beliefs of agents. We present a new semantics for logics of belief. Our semantics is based on directed hypergraphs, a generalization of ordinary directed graphs in which edges are able to connect more than two vertices. Directed hypergraph models preserve the characteristic features of simplicial models for epistemic logic, while also being able to account for the beliefs of agents. We provide systems of both consistent belief and merely introspective belief. The completeness of our axiomatizations is established by the construction of canonical hypergraph models. We also present direct conversions between doxastic Kripke models and directed hypergraph models.</description>

      <title>Checking Satisfiability of Hyperproperties using First-Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces and occur, e.g., when specifying security and information-flow properties. Checking if a hyperproperty is satisfiable has many important applications, such as testing if some security property is contradictory, or analyzing implications and equivalences between information-flow policies. In this paper, we present FOLHyper, a tool that can automatically check satisfiability of hyperproperties specified in the temporal logic HyperLTL. FOLHyper reduces the problem to an equisatisfiable first-order logic (FOL) formula, which allows us to leverage FOL solvers for the analysis of hyperproperties. As such, FOLHyper is applicable to many formulas beyond the decidable $\exists^*\forall^*$ fragment of HyperLTL. Our experiments show that FOLHyper is particularly useful for proving that a formula is unsatisfiable, and complements existing bounded approaches to satisfiability.</description>

      <title>Verifying Asynchronous Hyperproperties in Reactive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces and commonly occur when specifying information-flow and security policies. Logics like HyperLTL utilize explicit quantification over execution traces to express temporal hyperproperties in reactive systems, i.e., hyperproperties that reason about the temporal behavior along infinite executions. An often unwanted side-effect of such logics is that they compare the quantified traces synchronously. This prohibits the logics from expressing properties that compare multiple traces asynchronously, such as Zdancewic and Myers's observational determinism, McLean's non-inference, or stuttering refinement. We study the model-checking problem for a variant of asynchronous HyperLTL (A-HLTL), a temporal logic that can express hyperproperties where multiple traces are compared across timesteps. In addition to quantifying over system traces, A-HLTL features secondary quantification over stutterings of these traces. Consequently, A-HLTL allows for a succinct specification of many widely used asynchronous hyperproperties. Model-checking A-HLTL requires finding suitable stutterings, which, thus far, has been only possible for very restricted fragments or terminating systems. In this paper, we propose a novel game-based approach for the verification of arbitrary $\forall^*\exists^*$ A-HLTL formulas in reactive systems. In our method, we consider the verification as a game played between a verifier and a refuter, who challenge each other by controlling parts of the underlying traces and stutterings. A winning strategy for the verifier then corresponds to concrete witnesses for existentially quantified traces and asynchronous alignments for existentially quantified stutterings. We identify fragments for which our game-based interpretation is complete and thus constitutes a finite-state decision procedure.</description>

      <title>Modelling of logical systems by means of their fragments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the algorithmic complexity of non-classical logics, focusing on superintuitionistic and modal systems. It is shown that propositional logics are usually polynomial-time reducible to their fragments with at most two variables (often to the one-variable or even variable-free fragments). Also, it is proved that predicate logics are usually reducible to their fragments with one or two unary predicate letters and two or three individual variables. The work describes conditions sufficient for such reductions and provides examples where they fail, establishing non-reducibility in those cases. Furthermore, the work provides new complexity bounds for several logics, results on Kripke-incompleteness of predicate calculi, and analogues of the classical theorems of Church and Trakhtenbrot for the logic of quasiary predicates.</description>

      <title>Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP): A Deterministic and Interpretable Prompting Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language reasoning but remain unreliable on tasks requiring strict rule adherence, determinism, and auditability. Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP) is a lightweight prompting framework that introduces typed variables, deterministic condition evaluators, and a rule based validator that produces traceable and repeatable outputs. Using two pharmacologic logic compliance tasks, we benchmark LSP against zero shot prompting, chain of thought prompting, and concise prompting across three open weight models: Gemma 2, Mistral, and Llama 3. Across both tasks and all models, LSP consistently achieves the highest accuracy (0.83 to 0.89) and F1 score (0.83 to 0.89), substantially outperforming zero shot prompting (0.24 to 0.60), concise prompts (0.16 to 0.30), and chain of thought prompting (0.56 to 0.75). McNemar tests show statistically significant gains for LSP across nearly all comparisons (p &lt; 0.01). These results demonstrate that LSP improves determinism, interpretability, and consistency without sacrificing performance, supporting its use in clinical, regulated, and safety critical decision support systems.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Specification and Reasoning for Quantum Data and Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum information and computation research, symbolic methods have been widely used for human specification and reasoning about quantum states and operations. At the same time, they are essential for ensuring the scalability and efficiency of automated reasoning and verification tools for quantum algorithms and programs. However, a formal theory for symbolic specification and reasoning about quantum data and operations is still lacking, which significantly limits the practical applicability of automated verification techniques in quantum computing.
  In this paper, we present a general logical framework, called Symbolic Operator Logic $\mathbf{SOL}$, which enables symbolic specification and reasoning about quantum data and operations. Within this framework, a classical first-order logical language is embedded into a language of formal operators used to specify quantum data and operations, including their recursive definitions. This embedding allows reasoning about their properties modulo a chosen theory of the underlying classical data (e.g., Boolean algebra or group theory), thereby leveraging existing automated verification tools developed for classical computing. It should be emphasised that this embedding of classical first-order logic into $\mathbf{SOL}$ is precisely what makes the symbolic method possible.
  We envision that this framework can provide a conceptual foundation for the formal verification and automated theorem proving of quantum computation and information in proof assistants such as Lean, Coq, and related systems.</description>

      <title>On Conformant Planning and Model-Checking of $\exists^*\forall^*$ Hyperproperties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the connection of two problems within the planning and verification community: Conformant planning and model-checking of hyperproperties. Conformant planning is the task of finding a sequential plan that achieves a given objective independent of non-deterministic action effects during the plan's execution. Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces of a system and, e.g., capture information-flow and fairness policies. In this paper, we show that model-checking of $\exists^*\forall^*$ hyperproperties is closely related to the problem of computing a conformant plan. Firstly, we show that we can efficiently reduce a hyperproperty model-checking instance to a conformant planning instance, and prove that our encoding is sound and complete. Secondly, we establish the converse direction: Every conformant planning problem is, itself, a hyperproperty model-checking task.</description>

      <title>Representing Sugihara monoids via weakening relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12935v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that all Sugihara monoids can be represented as algebras of binary relations, with the monoid operation given by relational composition. Moreover, the binary relations are weakening relations. The first step is to obtain an explicit relational representation of all finite odd Sugihara chains. Our construction mimics that of Maddux (2010), where a relational representation of the finite even Sugihara chains is given. We define the class of representable Sugihara monoids as those which can be represented as reducts of distributive involutive FL-algebras of binary relations. We then show that the class of representable distributive involutive FL-algebras is closed under ultraproducts. This fact is used to demonstrate that the two infinite Sugihara monoids that generate the quasivariety are also representable. From this it follows that all Sugihara monoids are representable.</description>

      <title>Verification of Linear Dynamical Systems via O-Minimality of the Real Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13053v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A discrete-time linear dynamical system (LDS) is given by an update matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$, and has the trajectories $\langle s, Ms, M^2s, \ldots \rangle$ for $s \in \mathbb{R}^d$. Reachability-type decision problems of linear dynamical systems, most notably the Skolem Problem, lie at the forefront of decidability: typically, sound and complete algorithms are known only in low dimensions, and these rely on sophisticated tools from number theory and Diophantine approximation. Recently, however, o-minimality has emerged as a counterpoint to these number-theoretic tools that allows us to decide certain modifications of the classical problems of LDS without any dimension restrictions. In this paper, we first introduce the Decomposition Method, a framework that captures all applications of o-minimality to decision problems of LDS that are currently known to us. We then use the Decomposition Method to show decidability of the Robust Safety Problem (restricted to bounded initial sets) in arbitrary dimension: given a matrix $M$, a bounded semialgebraic set $S$ of initial points, and a semialgebraic set $T$ of unsafe points, it is decidable whether there exists $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ such that all orbits that begin in the $\varepsilon$-ball around $S$ avoid $T$.</description>

      <title>Expressive Temporal Specifications for Reward Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12808v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Specifying informative and dense reward functions remains a pivotal challenge in Reinforcement Learning, as it directly affects the efficiency of agent training. In this work, we harness the expressive power of quantitative Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (($\text{LTL}_f[\mathcal{F}]$)) to synthesize reward monitors that generate a dense stream of rewards for runtime-observable state trajectories. By providing nuanced feedback during training, these monitors guide agents toward optimal behaviour and help mitigate the well-known issue of sparse rewards under long-horizon decision making, which arises under the Boolean semantics dominating the current literature. Our framework is algorithm-agnostic and only relies on a state labelling function, and naturally accommodates specifying non-Markovian properties. Empirical results show that our quantitative monitors consistently subsume and, depending on the environment, outperform Boolean monitors in maximizing a quantitative measure of task completion and in reducing convergence time.</description>

      <title>RapunSL: Untangling Quantum Computing with Separation, Linear Combination and Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Separation Logic (QSL) has been proposed as an effective tool to improve the scalability of deductive reasoning for quantum programs. In QSL, separation is interpreted as disentanglement, and the frame rule brings a notion of entanglement-local specification (one that only talks about the qubits entangled with those acted upon by the program). In this paper, we identify two notions of locality unique to the quantum domain, and we construct a novel quantum separation logic, RapunSL, which is able to soundly reduce reasoning about superposition states to reasoning about pure states (basis-locality), and reasoning about mixed states arising from measurement to reasoning about pure states (outcome-locality). To do so, we introduce two connectives, linear combination and mixing, which together with separation provide a dramatic improvement in the scalability of reasoning, as we demonstrate on a series of challenging case studies.</description>
