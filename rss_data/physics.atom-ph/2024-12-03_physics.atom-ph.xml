      <title>Precise Determination of Excited State Rotational Constants and Black-Body Thermometry in Coulomb Crystals of Ca$^+$ and CaH$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution rovibronic spectroscopy of calcium monohydride molecular ions (CaH$^+$) co-trapped in a Coulomb crystal with calcium ions ($^{40}$Ca$^+$), focusing on rotational transitions in the $|X^1\Sigma^+, \nu" = 0&gt; \rightarrow |A^1\Sigma^+, \nu' = 2&gt;$ manifold. By resolving individual P and R branch transitions with record precision and using Fortrat analysis, we extract key spectroscopic constants for the excited state $|A^1\Sigma^+, \nu' = 2&gt;$, specifically, the band origin, the rotational constant, and the centrifugal correction. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of high-resolution rotational spectroscopy of CaH$^+$ presented here as an in-situ probe of local environmental temperature. We correlate the relative amplitudes of the observed transitions to the underlying thermalized ground-state rotational population distribution and extract the black-body radiation (BBR) temperature.</description>

      <title>Coherence of Symmetry-Protected Rotational Qubits in Cold Polyatomic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar polyatomic molecules provide an ideal but largely unexplored platform to encode qubits in rotational states. Here, we trap cold (100-600 mK) formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) inside an electric box and perform a Ramsey-type experiment to observe long-lived (~100 $\mu$s) coherences between symmetry-protected molecular states with opposite rotation but identical orientation, representing a quasi-hidden molecular degree of freedom. As a result, the observed qubit is insensitive to the magnitude of an external electric field, and depends only weakly on magnetic fields. Our findings provide a basis for future quantum and precision experiments with trapped cold molecules.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Effects in Attosecond Four-Wave Mixing Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear optical response of argon to a four-wave-mixing pulse sequence consisting of an extreme ultraviolet pulse, an overlapping collinear IR and an non-collinear delayed IR pulses. Absorption of an extreme ultraviolet and an IR photon from the collinear beams excites, sequentially, the $3s^{-1}4p$ bright state and the {$3s^{-1}3d/5s$} dark states. The subsequent absorption of an IR photon from the non-collinear beam results in an angled extreme ultraviolet emission whose variation with delay encodes coupling between autoionizing-states, dark-state lifetimes, and non-perturbative effects. Both our measurements and \emph{ab initio} simulations of the angled four-wave-mixing signal show a double-peak structure in delay dependence, in excellent agreement with each other. We attribute the minimum at the center of the signal to the rapid Rabi cycling, driven by the IR pulse, between dark states and the $3s^{-1}4p$ resonance, which results in the destructive interference in the final transition amplitude.</description>

      <title>Self-energy correction to the E1 transition amplitudes in hydrogen-like ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present calculations of the self-energy correction to the $E1$ transition amplitudes in hydrogen-like ions, performed to all orders in the nuclear binding strength parameter. Our results for the $1s$-$2p_{1/2}$ transition for the hydrogen isoelectronic sequence show that the perturbed-orbital part of the self-energy correction provides the dominant contribution, accounting for approximately 99\% of the total correction for this transition. Detailed calculations were performed for $ns$-$n'p$ and $np$-$n'd$ transitions in H-like caesium. We conclude that the perturbed-orbital part remains dominant also for other $ns$-$n'p$ transitions, whereas for the $np$-$n'd$ matrix elements this dominance no longer holds. Consequently, the self-energy corrections for the $np$-$n'd$ one-electron matrix elements cannot be well reproduced by means of effective QED operators constructed for energy levels.</description>

      <title>Para- and diamagnetic contributions to magnetic shielding constants of relativistic hydrogenlike atoms in some low-lying discrete energy eigenstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present tabulated data for numerical calculations of relative para- and diamagentic contributions to the magnetic shielding constant ($\sigma$) of the Dirac one-electron atoms with a pointlike, spinless and motionless nuclei of charge $Ze$. Exploiting the analytical formulas for the diamagnetic ($\sigma_{d}$) and paramagnetic ($\sigma_{p}$) terms of $\sigma$, valid for an arbitrary discrete energy state, recently derived by us with the aid of the Gordon decomposition technique, we have found the numerical values of $\sigma_{d}/\sigma$ and $\sigma_{p}/\sigma$ for the ground state and for the first two sets of excited states (i.e.: $2s_{1/2}$, $2p_{1/2}$, $2p_{3/2}$, $3s_{1/2}$, $3p_{1/2}$, $3p_{3/2}$, $3d_{3/2}$, and $3d_{5/2}$) of the relativistic hydrogenic ions with the nuclear charge number from the range $1 \leqslant Z \leqslant 137$. The comparisons of our results with those reported by other authors for some atomic states are also presented. We also compile here the numerical values of the total magnetic shielding constants for the ground state $1s_{1/2}$ and for each state belonging to the first set of excited states of selected hydrogenlike ions, obtained with the use of three different values of the fine-structure constant, i.e.: $\alpha^{-1}=137.035 \: 999 \: 139$ (from CODATA 2014), $\alpha^{-1}=137.035 \: 999 \: 084$ (from CODATA 2018) and $\alpha^{-1}=137.035 \: 999 \: 177$ (from CODATA 2024).</description>

      <title>Hanle Effect for Lifetime Analysis: Li-like Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate lifetime measurements of excited states of highly charged ions (HCIs) are essential for advancing diagnostics in both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, especially in the X-ray regime. The Hanle effect, which utilizes external magnetic fields to modify photon scattering patterns, provides a powerful technique for these measurements. Previously, this method has been successfully employed for He-like ions. Here, we present a theoretical study of the prospects of the Hanle effect for lifetime determinations of Li-like ions. Our results highlight the potential for plasma diagnostics and X-ray spectral analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio calculation of low energy scattering of electrons (muons) off hydrogen (muonic hydrogen) are performed on the basis of Faddeev-Merkuriev (FM) equations. The explicit contribution of induced dipole interaction in the asymptotic behavior of the wave function components has been incorporated into FM formalism. Elastic and inelastic cross sections have been calculated with high energy resolution in the vicinity of $n=2,3$ exited states thresholds of respective atoms. The Gailitis-Dumburg oscillations are discovered in some of calculated cross sections.</description>

      <title>Field-induced quantum interference of inelastic scattering in ultracold atomic collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: xploiting quantum interference remains a significant challenge in ultracold inelastic scattering. In this work, we propose a method to enable detectable quantum interference within the two-body loss rate resulting from various inelastic scattering channels. Our approach utilizes a ``ring-coupling" configuration, achieved by combining external radio-frequency and static electric fields during ultracold atomic collisions. We conduct close-coupling calculations for $^7$Li-$^{41}$K collisions at ultracold limit to validate our proposal. The results show that the interference profile displayed in two-body loss rate is unable to be observed with unoptimized external field parameters. Particularly, our findings demonstrate that the two-body loss rate coefficient exhibits distinct constructive and destructive interference patterns near the magnetically induced $p$-wave resonance in the incoming channel near which a rf-induced scattering resonance exists. These interference patterns become increasingly pronounced with greater intensities of the external fields. This work opens a new avenue for controlling inelastic scattering processes in ultracold collisions.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Discovery of Casimir-Polder forces: Repulsion in the Ground State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general-purpose algorithm for automatic production of a structure that induces a desired Casimir-Polder force. As a demonstration of the capability and wide applicability of the method, we use it to develop a geometry that leads to a repulsive Casimir-Polder force on a ground-state atom. The results turn out to be reminiscent of the ring-like geometries previously used to induce repulsion, but with some new features and -- importantly -- discovered completely independently of any input from the user. This represents a powerful new paradigm in the study of atom-surface forces -- instead of the user testing various geometries against a desired figure of merit, the goal can be specified and then an appropriate geometry created automatically.</description>

      <title>Fano resonance in XUV generated by helium with few-cycle intense laser pulses and its classical analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We integrate numerically the Schr\"odinger equation for the model helium atom irradiated by intense few-cycle laser pulse and find the emitted XUV spectra. They demonstrate resonant peaks at the frequencies of transitions from the doubly-excited autoionizing states (AISs) to the ground state. We study the properties of these peaks depending on the laser pulse duration and find that the decay of the AISs due to photoionization by the laser field affects them. Moreover, we consider the classical system of two coupled oscillators and find that both the quantum (the atom with AIS in the field) and the classical (the coupled oscillators with friction) systems demonstrate Fano-like resonant peak described by an essentially complex asymmetry parameter. We find a remarkable similarity in the behavior of these systems and conclude that the classical system of coupled oscillators with friction is an analogy of the AIS having an extra decay channel in addition to the autoionization one.</description>

      <title>The non-relativistic expansion of Dirac-Coulomb energy and the non-retarded Breit interaction correction up to $\alpha^8$order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relativistic corrections for the Dirac-Coulomb system are derived through the method of non-relativistic expansion. By expanding the large and small components of the Dirac wave function and the energy eigenvalues in terms of the square of the fine-structure constant $\alpha^2$, we obtain iterative equations for calculating the higher-order relativistic corrections of Coulomb systems. For a single-electron system, the operator results of the iterative equations are consistent with those in the literature Ref[J.Phys.B,At.Mol.Opt.Phys.{\bf 56} 045001]. Using these iterative equations, we numerically calculate the relativistic corrections up to the order of $\alpha^{20}$ for the hydrogen atom, which converge rapidly to the analytical results of the hydrogen atom. For the two-electron Dirac-Coulomb system, we also present iterative equations for calculating high-order energy corrections, as well as numerical energy corrections of ground state up to the order of $\alpha^8$. This work also presents the non-relativistic expansion form of non-retarded Breit interaction correction. The $\alpha^4$ order correction to the Dirac Coulomb energy and non-retarded Breit interaction corresponds precisely to the $\alpha^4$ order relativistic correction. Higher-order expansion terms contribute at even powers of $\alpha$, which represent the contributions from all Coulomb photons and single transverse photons under the non-retarded approximation.</description>

      <title>Dark state transport between unitary Fermi superfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of dark states is an important concept in quantum sciences, but its compatibility with strong interparticle interactions -- for example, in a quantum degenerate gas -- is hardly explored. Here, we realize a dark state in one of the spins of a two-component, resonantly interacting Fermi gas using a $\Lambda$ system within the $D_2$ transitions of $^6$Li at high magnetic field. The dark state is created in a micrometer-sized region within a one-dimensional channel connecting two superfluid reservoirs. The particle transport between the reservoirs is used as a probe. We observe that atoms are transported in the dark state and the superfluid-assisted fast current is preserved. If the dark state resonant condition is not met, the transport is suppressed by the spontaneous emission. We also uncover an asymmetry in the transport timescale across the two-photon resonance, which is absent in the non-interacting regime and diminished at higher temperatures. This work raises questions on the interplay of dark states with interparticle interactions and opens up perspectives for optical manipulation of fermionic pairing.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity universal gates in the $^{171}$Yb ground state nuclear spin qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arrays of optically trapped neutral atoms are a promising architecture for the realization of quantum computers. In order to run increasingly complex algorithms, it is advantageous to demonstrate high-fidelity and flexible gates between long-lived and highly coherent qubit states. In this work, we demonstrate a universal high-fidelity gate-set with individually controlled and parallel application of single-qubit gates and two-qubit gates operating on the ground-state nuclear spin qubit in arrays of tweezer-trapped $^{171}$Yb atoms. We utilize the long lifetime, flexible control, and high physical fidelity of our system to characterize native gates using single and two-qubit Clifford and symmetric subspace randomized benchmarking circuits with more than 200 CZ gates applied to one or two pairs of atoms. We measure our two-qubit entangling gate fidelity to be 99.72(3)% (99.40(3)%) with (without) post-selection. In addition, we introduce a simple and optimized method for calibration of multi-parameter quantum gates. These results represent important milestones towards executing complex and general quantum computation with neutral atoms.</description>
