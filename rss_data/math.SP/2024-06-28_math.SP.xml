      <title>Weak Coupling and Spectral Instability for Neumann Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an abstract criterion on spectral instability of nonnegative selfadjoint extensions of a symmetric operator and apply this to self-adjoint Neumann Laplacians on bounded Lipschitz domains, intervals, and graphs. Our results can be viewed as variants of the classical weak coupling phenomenon for Schr\"odinger operators in $L^2(\mathbb R^n)$ for $n=1,2$.</description>

      <title>Schur Stability of Matrix Segment via Bialternate Product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, the problem of robust Schur stability of $n\times n$ dimensional matrix segments by using the bialternate product of matrices is considered. It is shown that the problem can be reduced to the existence of negative eigenvalues of two of three specially constructed matrices and the existence of eigenvalues belonging to the interval $[1,\infty)$ of the third matrix. A necessary and sufficient condition is given for the convex combinations of two stable matrices with rank one difference to be robust Schur stable. It is shown that the robust stability of the convex hull of a finite number of matrices whose two-by-two differences are of rank $1$ is equivalent to the robust stability of the segments formed by these matrices. Examples of applying the obtained results are given.</description>

      <title>Uniform exponential mixing for congruence covers of convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.00825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski dense convex cocompact subgroup contained in an arithmetic lattice of $\operatorname{SO}(n, 1)^{\circ}$. We prove uniform exponential mixing of the geodesic flow for congruence covers of the hyperbolic manifold $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}^n$ avoiding finitely many prime ideals. This extends the work of Oh-Winter who proved the result for the $n = 2$ case. Following their approach, we use Dolgopyat's method for the proof of exponential mixing of the geodesic flow. We do this uniformly over congruence covers by establishing uniform spectral bounds for the congruence transfer operators associated to the geodesic flow. This requires another key ingredient which is the expander machinery due to Bourgain-Gamburd-Sarnak extended by Golsefidy-Varj\'{u}.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing of frame flows for convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.14551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to establish exponential mixing of frame flows for convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds of arbitrary dimension with respect to the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure. Some immediate applications include an asymptotic formula for matrix coefficients with an exponential error term as well as the exponential equidistribution of holonomy of closed geodesics. The main technical result is a spectral bound on transfer operators twisted by holonomy, which we obtain by building on Dolgopyat's method.</description>

      <title>Uniform convergence of solutions to stochastic hybrid models of gene regulatory networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper by Kurasov, L\"uck, Mugnolo and Wolf, a hybrid gene regulatory network was proposed to model gene expression dynamics by using a stochastic system of coupled partial differential equations. This approach approximates protein counts in cells by modelling them as distributions. In a follow-up paper, the existence and strong convergence of the solutions to equilibrium was proven. In this paper, we make use of a recent convergence theorem for stochastic, irreducible semigroups that contain partial integral operators. In particular, we improve upon their results by showing that the convergence rate is independent of the initial distribution of proteins, therefore proving that the solutions converge not only strongly but even uniformly to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of two-dimensional half-space semi-Dirac semi-metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with the semi-Dirac operator in a half-space arising in the description of quasiparticles in quantum mechanics as well as in semi-metals materials and related structures. It completely shows the self-adjointness, computes the square and the spectrum of the operator. We also set up sufficient conditions for the existence of the point and discrete spectrum by including some appropriate potentials in the problem and study the spectral stability properties for perturbed operators.</description>
