      <title>REALM: Recursive Relevance Modeling for LLM-based Document Re-Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in document re-ranking, a key component in modern Information Retrieval (IR) systems. However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations, including ranking uncertainty, unstable top-k recovery, and high token cost due to token-intensive prompting. To effectively address these limitations, we propose REALM, an uncertainty-aware re-ranking framework that models LLM-derived relevance as Gaussian distributions and refines them through recursive Bayesian updates. By explicitly capturing uncertainty and minimizing redundant queries, REALM achieves better rankings more efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that our REALM surpasses state-of-the-art re-rankers while significantly reducing token usage and latency, promoting it as the next-generation re-ranker for modern IR systems.</description>

      <title>DenseRec: Revisiting Dense Content Embeddings for Sequential Transformer-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based sequential recommenders, such as SASRec or BERT4Rec, typically rely solely on learned item ID embeddings, making them vulnerable to the item cold-start problem, particularly in environments with dynamic item catalogs. While dense content embeddings from pre-trained models offer potential solutions, direct integration into transformer-based recommenders has consistently underperformed compared to ID-only approaches. We revisit this integration challenge and propose DenseRec, a simple yet effective method that introduces a dual-path embedding approach. DenseRec learns a linear projection from the dense embedding space into the ID embedding space during training, enabling seamless generalization to previously unseen items without requiring specialized embedding models or complex infrastructure. In experiments on three real-world datasets, we find DenseRec to consistently outperform an ID-only SASRec baseline, even without additional hyperparameter tuning and while using compact embedding models. Our analysis suggests improvements primarily arise from better sequence representations in the presence of unseen items, positioning DenseRec as a practical and robust solution for cold-start sequential recommendation.</description>

      <title>Extracting Information from Scientific Literature via Visual Table Question Answering Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores three approaches to processing table data in scientific papers to enhance extractive question answering and develop a software tool for the systematic review process. The methods evaluated include: (1) Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for extracting information from documents, (2) Pre-trained models for document visual question answering, and (3) Table detection and structure recognition to extract and merge key information from tables with textual content to answer extractive questions. In exploratory experiments, we augmented ten sample test documents containing tables and relevant content against RF- EMF-related scientific papers with seven predefined extractive question-answer pairs. The results indicate that approaches preserving table structure outperform the others, particularly in representing and organizing table content. Accurately recognizing specific notations and symbols within the documents emerged as a critical factor for improved results. Our study concludes that preserving the structural integrity of tables is essential for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of extractive question answering in scientific documents.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attacks on LLM-based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.</description>

      <title>Taming the One-Epoch Phenomenon in Online Recommendation System by Two-stage Contrastive ID Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ID-based embeddings are widely used in web-scale online recommendation systems. However, their susceptibility to overfitting, particularly due to the long-tail nature of data distributions, often limits training to a single epoch, a phenomenon known as the "one-epoch problem." This challenge has driven research efforts to optimize performance within the first epoch by enhancing convergence speed or feature sparsity. In this study, we introduce a novel two-stage training strategy that incorporates a pre-training phase using a minimal model with contrastive loss, enabling broader data coverage for the embedding system. Our offline experiments demonstrate that multi-epoch training during the pre-training phase does not lead to overfitting, and the resulting embeddings improve online generalization when fine-tuned for more complex downstream recommendation tasks. We deployed the proposed system in live traffic at Pinterest, achieving significant site-wide engagement gains.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Latent-Space Compression using Game-Theoretic Techniques for Transformer-Based Vector Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector similarity search plays a pivotal role in modern information retrieval systems, especially when powered by transformer-based embeddings. However, the scalability and efficiency of such systems are often hindered by the high dimensionality of latent representations. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic framework for optimizing latent-space compression to enhance both the efficiency and semantic utility of vector search. By modeling the compression strategy as a zero-sum game between retrieval accuracy and storage efficiency, we derive a latent transformation that preserves semantic similarity while reducing redundancy. We benchmark our method against FAISS, a widely-used vector search library, and demonstrate that our approach achieves a significantly higher average similarity (0.9981 vs. 0.5517) and utility (0.8873 vs. 0.5194), albeit with a modest increase in query time. This trade-off highlights the practical value of game-theoretic latent compression in high-utility, transformer-based search applications. The proposed system can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM pipelines to yield more semantically accurate and computationally efficient retrieval.</description>

      <title>Post-fusion monolithic hybrid recommender system for suggesting relevant movies to users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommendation systems have become the fundamental services to facilitate users information access. Generally, recommendation system works by filtering historical behaviors to understand and learn users preferences. With the growth of online information, recommendations have become of crucial importance in information filtering to prevent the information overload problem. In this study, we considered hybrid post-fusion of two approaches of collaborative filtering, by using sequences of watched movies and considering the related movies rating. After considering both techniques and applying the weights matrix, the recommendations would be modified to correspond to the users preference as needed. We discussed that various weights would be set based on use cases. For instance, in cases where we have the rating for most classes, we will assign a higher weight to the rating matrix and in case where the rating is unavailable for the majority of cases, the higher weights might be assigned to the sequential dataset. An extensive discussion is made in the context of this paper. Sequential type of the watched movies was used in conjunction of the rating as especially that model might be inadequate in distinguishing users long-term preference and that does not account for the rating of the watched movies and thus that model along might not suffice. Extensive discussion was made regarding the literature and methodological approach to solve the problem.</description>

      <title>LLM-Enhanced Linear Autoencoders for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to enrich the semantic representation of textual item information in recommender systems. However, existing linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich textual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of LLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous knowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase optimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item correlation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns an item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling semantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is optimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L3AE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three benchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20.

      <title>PCR-CA: Parallel Codebook Representations with Contrastive Alignment for Multiple-Category App Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern app store recommender systems struggle with multiple-category apps, as traditional taxonomies fail to capture overlapping semantics, leading to suboptimal personalization. We propose PCR-CA (Parallel Codebook Representations with Contrastive Alignment), an end-to-end framework for improved CTR prediction. PCR-CA first extracts compact multimodal embeddings from app text, then introduces a Parallel Codebook VQ-AE module that learns discrete semantic representations across multiple codebooks in parallel -- unlike hierarchical residual quantization (RQ-VAE). This design enables independent encoding of diverse aspects (e.g., gameplay, art style), better modeling multiple-category semantics. To bridge semantic and collaborative signals, we employ a contrastive alignment loss at both the user and item levels, enhancing representation learning for long-tail items. Additionally, a dual-attention fusion mechanism combines ID-based and semantic features to capture user interests, especially for long-tail apps. Experiments on a large-scale dataset show PCR-CA achieves a +0.76% AUC improvement over strong baselines, with +2.15% AUC gains for long-tail apps. Online A/B testing further validates our approach, showing a +10.52% lift in CTR and a +16.30% improvement in CVR, demonstrating PCR-CA's effectiveness in real-world deployment. The new framework has now been fully deployed on the Microsoft Store.</description>

      <title>An Ontology-Driven Graph RAG for Legal Norms: A Hierarchical, Temporal, and Deterministic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00039v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the legal domain face a critical challenge: standard, flat-text retrieval is blind to the hierarchical, diachronic, and causal structure of law, leading to anachronistic and unreliable answers. This paper introduces an ontology-driven Graph RAG framework designed to overcome these limitations. We ground our knowledge graph in a formal, LRMoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal Works from their versioned Expressions. We model temporal states as efficient aggregations that reuse the versioned expressions (CTVs) of unchanged components, and we reify legislative events as first-class Action nodes to make causality explicit and queryable. This structured backbone enables a unified, planner-guided query strategy that applies explicit policies to deterministically resolve complex requests for (i) point-in-time retrieval, (ii) hierarchical impact analysis, and (iii) auditable provenance reconstruction. Through a case study on the Brazilian Constitution, we demonstrate how this approach provides a verifiable, temporally-correct substrate for LLMs, enabling higher-order analytical capabilities while drastically reducing the risk of factual errors. The result is a practical framework for building more trustworthy and explainable legal AI systems.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Agents for Competitive Landscape Mapping in Drug Asset Due Diligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing. Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal, unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research (65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the competitive analysis.</description>

      <title>ST-Raptor: LLM-Powered Semi-Structured Table Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g., financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells). These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First, methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism: forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of 764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.</description>
