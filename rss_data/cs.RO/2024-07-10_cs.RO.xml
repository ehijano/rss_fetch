      <title>Anchor-Oriented Localized Voronoi Partitioning for GPS-denied Multi-Robot Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-robot coverage is crucial in numerous applications, including environmental monitoring, search and rescue operations, and precision agriculture. In modern applications, a multi-robot team must collaboratively explore unknown spatial fields in GPS-denied and extreme environments where global localization is unavailable. Coverage algorithms typically assume that the robot positions and the coverage environment are defined in a global reference frame. However, coordinating robot motion and ensuring coverage of the shared convex workspace without global localization is challenging. This paper proposes a novel anchor-oriented coverage (AOC) approach to generate dynamic localized Voronoi partitions based around a common anchor position. We further propose a consensus-based coordination algorithm that achieves agreement on the coverage workspace around the anchor in the robots' relative frames of reference. Through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed anchor-oriented approach using localized Voronoi partitioning performs as well as the state-of-the-art coverage controller using GPS.</description>

      <title>An Open-source Hardware/Software Architecture and Supporting Simulation Environment to Perform Human FPV Flight Demonstrations for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), mainly quadcopters, are nowadays ubiquitous in research on aerial autonomy, including serving as scaled-down models for much larger aircraft such as vertical-take-off-and-lift vehicles for urban air mobility. Among the various research use cases, first-person-view RC flight experiments allow for collecting data on how human pilots fly such aircraft, which could then be used to compare, contrast, validate, or train autonomous flight agents. While this could be uniquely beneficial, especially for studying UAV operation in contextually complex and safety-critical environments such as in human-UAV shared spaces, the lack of inexpensive and open-source hardware/software platforms that offer this capability along with low-level access to the underlying control software and data remains limited. To address this gap and significantly reduce barriers to human-guided autonomy research with UAVs, this paper presents an open-source software architecture implemented with an inexpensive in-house built quadcopter platform based on the F450 Quadcopter Frame. This setup uses two cameras to provide a dual-view FPV and an open-source flight controller, Pixhawk. The underlying software architecture, developed using the Python-based Kivy library, allows logging telemetry, GPS, control inputs, and camera frame data in a synchronized manner on the ground station computer. Since costs (time) and weather constraints typically limit numbers of physical outdoor flight experiments, this paper also presents a unique AirSim/Unreal Engine based simulation environment and graphical user interface aka digital twin, that provides a Hardware In The Loop setup via the Pixhawk flight controller. We demonstrate the usability and reliability of the overall framework through a set of diverse physical FPV flight experiments and corresponding flight tests in the digital twin.</description>

      <title>Self-deployable contracting-cord metamaterials with tunable mechanical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in active materials and fabrication techniques have enabled the production of cyclically self-deployable metamaterials with an expanded functionality space. However, designing metamaterials that possess continuously tunable mechanical properties after self-deployment remains a challenge, notwithstanding its importance. Inspired by push puppets, we introduce an efficient design strategy to create reversibly self-deployable metamaterials with continuously tunable post-deployment stiffness and damping. Our metamaterial comprises contracting actuators threaded through beads with matching conical concavo-convex interfaces in networked chains. The slack network conforms to arbitrary shapes, but when actuated, it self-assembles into a preprogrammed configuration with beads gathered together. Further contraction of the actuators can dynamically tune the assembly's mechanical properties through the beads' particle jamming, while maintaining the overall structure with minimal change. We show that, after deployment, such metamaterials exhibit pronounced tunability in bending-dominated configurations: they can become more than 35 times stiffer and change their damping capability by over 50%. Through systematic analysis, we find that the beads'conical angle can introduce geometric nonlinearity, which has a major effect on the self-deployability and tunability of the metamaterial. Our work provides routes towards reversibly self-deployable, lightweight, and tunable metamaterials, with potential applications in soft robotics, reconfigurable architectures, and space engineering.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analysis of Multi-Line Orders in Multi-Tote Storage and Retrieval Autonomous Mobile Robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As warehouses are emphasizing space utilization and the ability to handle multi-line orders, multi-tote storage and retrieval (MTSR) autonomous mobile robot systems, where robots directly retrieve totes from high shelves, are becoming increasingly popular. This paper presents a novel shared-token, multi-class, semi-open queueing network model to account for multi-line orders with general distribution forms in MTSR systems. The numerical results obtained from solving the SOQN model are validated against discrete-event simulation, with most key performance metrics demonstrating high accuracy. In our experimental setting, results indicate a 12.5% reduction in the minimum number of robots needed to satisfy a specific order arrival rate using the closest retrieval sequence policy compared with the random policy. Increasing the number of tote buffer positions on a robot can greatly reduce the number of robots required in the warehouse.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Robotic System Models Through Property Inheritance from Petri Net Meta-models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the analysis of robotic system models using the Robotic System Hierarchic Petri Net (RSHPN) meta-model, proposing streamlined methods by focusing on significant system fragments and inheriting properties from the meta-model. Our research demonstrates that it is feasible to: 1) effectively analyze complex robotic systems expressed using RSHPN, and 2) enable models to inherit properties from the meta-model. This approach significantly simplifies the analysis process, reduces design time, and ensures the safety and reliability of the systems. These aspects are crucial for robots operating in human environments. Our results suggest that Petri nets could be further explored as a useful tool for the formal description and in-depth analysis of the properties of robotic systems.</description>

      <title>How Much Progress Did I Make? An Unexplored Human Feedback Signal for Teaching Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the expressiveness of human teaching is vital for both improving robots' learning from humans and the human-teaching-robot experience. In this work, we characterize and test a little-used teaching signal: \textit{progress}, designed to represent the completion percentage of a task. We conducted two online studies with 76 crowd-sourced participants and one public space study with 40 non-expert participants to validate the capability of this progress signal. We find that progress indicates whether the task is successfully performed, reflects the degree of task completion, identifies unproductive but harmless behaviors, and is likely to be more consistent across participants. Furthermore, our results show that giving progress does not require extra workload and time. An additional contribution of our work is a dataset of 40 non-expert demonstrations from the public space study through an ice cream topping-adding task, which we observe to be multi-policy and sub-optimal, with sub-optimality not only from teleoperation errors but also from exploratory actions and attempts. The dataset is available at \url{https://github.com/TeachingwithProgress/Non-Expert\_Demonstrations}.</description>

      <title>Learning a Distributed Hierarchical Locomotion Controller for Embodied Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a distributed hierarchical locomotion control strategy for whole-body cooperation and demonstrate the potential for migration into large numbers of agents. Our method utilizes a hierarchical structure to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. By incorporating spatiotemporal continuity features, we establish the sequential logic necessary for causal inference and cooperative behaviour in sequential tasks, thereby facilitating efficient and coordinated control strategies. Through training within this framework, we demonstrate enhanced adaptability and cooperation, leading to superior performance in task completion compared to the original methods. Moreover, we construct a set of environments as the benchmark for embodied cooperation.</description>

      <title>Insect-Scale Tailless Robot with Flapping Wings: A Simple Structure and Drive for Yaw Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insect-scale micro-aerial vehicles, especially, lightweight, flapping-wing robots, are becoming increasingly important for safe motion sensing in spatially constrained environments such as living spaces. However, yaw control using flapping wings is fundamentally more difficult than using rotating wings. In this study, an insect-scale, tailless robot with four paired tilted flapping wings (weighing 1.52 g) to enable yaw control was fabricated. It benefits from the simplicity of a directly driven wing actuator with no transmission and a lift control signal; however, it still has an offset in the lift force. Therefore, an adaptive controller was designed to alleviate the offset. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed controller outperforms the linear quadratic integral controller. Finally, in a tethered and controlled demonstration flight, the yaw drift was suppressed by the wing-tilting arrangement and the proposed controller. The simple structure drive system demonstrates the potential for future controlled flights of battery-powered, tailless, flapping-wing robots weighing less than 10 grams.</description>

      <title>Visual-Geometry GP-based Navigable Space for Autonomous Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unknown environments is challenging and demands the consideration of both geometric and semantic information in order to parse the navigability of the environment. In this work, we propose a novel space modeling framework, Visual-Geometry Sparse Gaussian Process (VG-SGP), that simultaneously considers semantics and geometry of the scene. Our proposed approach can overcome the limitation of visual planners that fail to recognize geometry associated with the semantic and the geometric planners that completely overlook the semantic information which is very critical in real-world navigation. The proposed method leverages dual Sparse Gaussian Processes in an integrated manner; the first is trained to forecast geometrically navigable spaces while the second predicts the semantically navigable areas. This integrated model is able to pinpoint the overlapping (geometric and semantic) navigable space. The simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the ability of the proposed VG-SGP model, coupled with our innovative navigation strategy, outperforms models solely reliant on visual or geometric navigation algorithms, highlighting a superior adaptive behavior.</description>

      <title>HiLMa-Res: A General Hierarchical Framework via Residual RL for Combining Quadrupedal Locomotion and Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents HiLMa-Res, a hierarchical framework leveraging reinforcement learning to tackle manipulation tasks while performing continuous locomotion using quadrupedal robots. Unlike most previous efforts that focus on solving a specific task, HiLMa-Res is designed to be general for various loco-manipulation tasks that require quadrupedal robots to maintain sustained mobility. The novel design of this framework tackles the challenges of integrating continuous locomotion control and manipulation using legs. It develops an operational space locomotion controller that can track arbitrary robot end-effector (toe) trajectories while walking at different velocities. This controller is designed to be general to different downstream tasks, and therefore, can be utilized in high-level manipulation planning policy to address specific tasks. To demonstrate the versatility of this framework, we utilize HiLMa-Res to tackle several challenging loco-manipulation tasks using a quadrupedal robot in the real world. These tasks span from leveraging state-based policy to vision-based policy, from training purely from the simulation data to learning from real-world data. In these tasks, HiLMa-Res shows better performance than other methods.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Battery Disassembly: The Design and Implementation of a Battery Disassembly Autonomous Mobile Manipulator Robot(BEAM-1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient disassembly of end-of-life electric vehicle batteries(EOL-EVBs) is crucial for green manufacturing and sustainable development. The current pre-programmed disassembly conducted by the Autonomous Mobile Manipulator Robot(AMMR) struggles to meet the disassembly requirements in dynamic environments, complex scenarios, and unstructured processes. In this paper, we propose a Battery Disassembly AMMR(BEAM-1) system based on NeuralSymbolic AI. It detects the environmental state by leveraging a combination of multi-sensors and neural predicates and then translates this information into a quasi-symbolic space. In real-time, it identifies the optimal sequence of action primitives through LLM-heuristic tree search, ensuring high-precision execution of these primitives. Additionally, it employs positional speculative sampling using intuitive networks and achieves the disassembly of various bolt types with a meticulously designed end-effector. Importantly, BEAM-1 is a continuously learning embodied intelligence system capable of subjective reasoning like a human, and possessing intuition. A large number of real scene experiments have proved that it can autonomously perceive, decide, and execute to complete the continuous disassembly of bolts in multiple, multi-category, and complex situations, with a success rate of 98.78%. This research attempts to use NeuroSymbolic AI to give robots real autonomous reasoning, planning, and learning capabilities. BEAM-1 realizes the revolution of battery disassembly. Its framework can be easily ported to any robotic system to realize different application scenarios, which provides a ground-breaking idea for the design and implementation of future embodied intelligent robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Meta-Learning of Vehicle Yaw Rate Dynamics via Conditional Neural Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory planners of autonomous vehicles usually rely on physical models to predict the vehicle behavior. However, despite their suitability, physical models have some shortcomings. On the one hand, simple models suffer from larger model errors and more restrictive assumptions. On the other hand, complex models are computationally more demanding and depend on environmental and operational parameters. In each case, the drawbacks can be associated to a certain degree to the physical modeling of the yaw rate dynamics. Therefore, this paper investigates the yaw rate prediction based on conditional neural processes (CNP), a data-driven meta-learning approach, to simultaneously achieve low errors, adequate complexity and robustness to varying parameters. Thus, physical models can be enhanced in a targeted manner to provide accurate and computationally efficient predictions to enable safe planning in autonomous vehicles. High fidelity simulations for a variety of driving scenarios and different types of cars show that CNP makes it possible to employ and transfer knowledge about the yaw rate based on current driving dynamics in a human-like manner, yielding robustness against changing environmental and operational conditions.</description>

      <title>Collision and Obstacle Avoidance for Industrial Autonomous Vehicles -- Simulation and Experimentation Based on a Cooperative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the challenges of Industry 4.0, is to determine and optimize the flow of data, products and materials in manufacturing companies. To realize these challenges, many solutions have been defined such as the utilization of automated guided vehicles (AGVs). However, being guided is a handicap for these vehicles to fully meet the requirements of Industry 4.0 in terms of adaptability and flexibility: the autonomy of vehicles cannot be reduced to predetermined trajectories. Therefore, it is necessary to develop their autonomy. This will be possible by designing new generations of industrial autonomous vehicles (IAVs), in the form of intelligent and cooperative autonomous mobile robots.In the field of road transport, research is very active to make the car autonomous. Many algorithms, solving problematic traffic situations similar to those that can occur in an industrial environment, can be transposed in the industrial field and therefore for IAVs. The technologies standardized in dedicated bodies (e.g., ETSI TC ITS), such as those concerning the exchange of messages between vehicles to increase their awareness or their ability to cooperate, can also be transposed to the industrial context. The deployment of intelligent autonomous vehicle fleets raises several challenges: acceptability by employees, vehicle location, traffic fluidity, vehicle perception of changing environments (dynamic), vehicle-infrastructure cooperation, or vehicles heterogeneity. In this context, developing the autonomy of IAVs requires a relevant working method. The identification of reusable or adaptable algorithms to the various problems raised by the increase in the autonomy of IAVs is not sufficient, it is also necessary to be able to model, to simulate, to test and to experiment with the proposed solutions. Simulation is essential since it allows both to adapt and to validate the algorithms, but also to design and to prepare the experiments.To improve the autonomy of a fleet, we consider the approach relying on a collective intelligence to make the behaviours of vehicles adaptive. In this chapter, we will focus on a class of problems faced by IAVs related to collision and obstacle avoidance. Among these problems, we are particularly interested when two vehicles need to cross an intersection at the same time, known as a deadlock situation. But also, when obstacles are present in the aisles and need to be avoided by the vehicles safely.</description>

      <title>Toychain: A Simple Blockchain for Research in Swarm Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical report describes the implementation of Toychain: a simple, lightweight blockchain implemented in Python, designed for ease of deployment and practicality in robotics research. It can be integrated with various software and simulation tools used in robotics (we have integrated it with ARGoS, Gazebo, and ROS2), and also be deployed on real robots capable of Wi-Fi communications. The Toychain package supports the deployment of smart contracts written in Python (computer programs that can be executed by and synchronized across a distributed network). The nodes in the blockchain can execute smart contract functions by broadcasting transactions, which update the state of the blockchain upon agreement by all other nodes. The conditions for this agreement are established by a consensus protocol. The Toychain package allows for custom implementations of the consensus protocol, which can be useful for research or meeting specific application requirements. Currently, Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Authority are implemented.</description>

      <title>Towards a Robotic Intrusion Prevention System: Combining Security and Safety in Cognitive Social Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social Robots need to be safe and reliable to share their space with humans. This paper reports on the first results of a research project that aims to create more safe and reliable, intelligent autonomous robots by investigating the implications and interactions between cybersecurity and safety. We propose creating a robotic intrusion prevention system (RIPS) that follows a novel approach to detect and mitigate intrusions in cognitive social robot systems and other cyber-physical systems. The RIPS detects threats at the robotic communication level and enables mitigation of the cyber-physical threats by using System Modes to define what part of the robotic system reduces or limits its functionality while the system is compromised. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by applying it to a cognitive architecture running in a real social robot that preserves the privacy and safety of humans while facing several cyber attack situations.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Online Mapping and Behavior Prediction via Direct BEV Feature Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding road geometry is a critical component of the autonomous vehicle (AV) stack. While high-definition (HD) maps can readily provide such information, they suffer from high labeling and maintenance costs. Accordingly, many recent works have proposed methods for estimating HD maps online from sensor data. The vast majority of recent approaches encode multi-camera observations into an intermediate representation, e.g., a bird's eye view (BEV) grid, and produce vector map elements via a decoder. While this architecture is performant, it decimates much of the information encoded in the intermediate representation, preventing downstream tasks (e.g., behavior prediction) from leveraging them. In this work, we propose exposing the rich internal features of online map estimation methods and show how they enable more tightly integrating online mapping with trajectory forecasting. In doing so, we find that directly accessing internal BEV features yields up to 73% faster inference speeds and up to 29% more accurate predictions on the real-world nuScenes dataset.</description>

      <title>Exploring Unstructured Environments using Minimal Sensing on Cooperative Nano-Drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances have improved autonomous navigation and mapping under payload constraints, but current multi-robot inspection algorithms are unsuitable for nano-drones due to their need for heavy sensors and high computational resources. To address these challenges, we introduce ExploreBug, a novel hybrid frontier range bug algorithm designed to handle limited sensing capabilities for a swarm of nano-drones. This system includes three primary components: a mapping subsystem, an exploration subsystem, and a navigation subsystem. Additionally, an intra-swarm collision avoidance system is integrated to prevent collisions between drones. We validate the efficacy of our approach through extensive simulations and real-world exploration experiments involving up to seven drones in simulations and three in real-world settings, across various obstacle configurations and with a maximum navigation speed of 0.75 m/s. Our tests demonstrate that the algorithm efficiently completes exploration tasks, even with minimal sensing, across different swarm sizes and obstacle densities. Furthermore, our frontier allocation heuristic ensures an equal distribution of explored areas and paths traveled by each drone in the swarm. We publicly release the source code of the proposed system to foster further developments in mapping and exploration using autonomous nano drones.</description>

      <title>Pretraining-finetuning Framework for Efficient Co-design: A Case Study on Quadruped Robot Parkour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nature, animals with exceptional locomotion abilities, such as cougars, often possess asymmetric fore and hind legs, with their powerful hind legs acting as reservoirs of energy for leaps. This observation inspired us: could optimize the leg length of quadruped robots endow them with similar locomotive capabilities? In this paper, we propose an approach that co-optimizes the mechanical structure and control policy to boost the locomotive prowess of quadruped robots. Specifically, we introduce a novel pretraining-finetuning framework, which not only guarantees optimal control strategies for each mechanical candidate but also ensures time efficiency. Additionally, we have devised an innovative training method for our pretraining network, integrating spatial domain randomization with regularization methods, markedly improving the network's generalizability. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed pretraining-finetuning framework significantly enhances the overall co-design performance with less time consumption. Moreover, the co-design strategy substantially exceeds the conventional method of independently optimizing control strategies, further improving the robot's locomotive performance and providing an innovative approach to enhancing the extreme parkour capabilities of quadruped robots.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Perception and Navigation for Mobile Robots: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the fast and unstoppable evolution of robotics and artificial intelligence, effective autonomous navigation in real-world scenarios has become one of the most pressing challenges in the literature. However, demanding requirements, such as real-time operation, energy and computational efficiency, robustness, and reliability, make most current solutions unsuitable for real-world challenges. Thus, researchers are forced to seek innovative approaches, such as bio-inspired solutions. Indeed, animals have the intrinsic ability to efficiently perceive, understand, and navigate their unstructured surroundings. To do so, they exploit self-motion cues, proprioception, and visual flow in a cognitive process to map their environment and locate themselves within it. Computational neuroscientists aim to answer ''how'' and ''why'' such cognitive processes occur in the brain, to design novel neuromorphic sensors and methods that imitate biological processing. This survey aims to comprehensively review the application of brain-inspired strategies to autonomous navigation, considering: neuromorphic perception and asynchronous event processing, energy-efficient and adaptive learning, or the imitation of the working principles of brain areas that play a crucial role in navigation such as the hippocampus or the entorhinal cortex.</description>

      <title>Heuristic Predictive Control for Multi-Robot Flocking in Congested Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-robot flocking possesses extraordinary advantages over a single-robot system in diverse domains, but it is challenging to ensure safe and optimal performance in congested environments. Hence, this paper is focused on the investigation of distributed optimal flocking control for multiple robots in crowded environments. A heuristic predictive control solution is proposed based on a Gibbs Random Field (GRF), in which bio-inspired potential functions are used to characterize robot-robot and robot-environment interactions. The optimal solution is obtained by maximizing a posteriori joint distribution of the GRF in a certain future time instant. A gradient-based heuristic solution is developed, which could significantly speed up the computation of the optimal control. Mathematical analysis is also conducted to show the validity of the heuristic solution. Multiple collision risk levels are designed to improve the collision avoidance performance of robots in dynamic environments. The proposed heuristic predictive control is evaluated comprehensively from multiple perspectives based on different metrics in a challenging simulation environment. The competence of the proposed algorithm is validated via the comparison with the non-heuristic predictive control and two existing popular flocking control methods. Real-life experiments are also performed using four quadrotor UAVs to further demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed design.</description>

      <title>A Neurosymbolic Approach to Adaptive Feature Extraction in SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous robots, autonomous vehicles, and humans wearing mixed-reality headsets require accurate and reliable tracking services for safety-critical applications in dynamically changing real-world environments. However, the existing tracking approaches, such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), do not adapt well to environmental changes and boundary conditions despite extensive manual tuning. On the other hand, while deep learning-based approaches can better adapt to environmental changes, they typically demand substantial data for training and often lack flexibility in adapting to new domains. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging the neurosymbolic program synthesis approach to construct adaptable SLAM pipelines that integrate the domain knowledge from traditional SLAM approaches while leveraging data to learn complex relationships. While the approach can synthesize end-to-end SLAM pipelines, we focus on synthesizing the feature extraction module. We first devise a domain-specific language (DSL) that can encapsulate domain knowledge on the important attributes for feature extraction and the real-world performance of various feature extractors. Our neurosymbolic architecture then undertakes adaptive feature extraction, optimizing parameters via learning while employing symbolic reasoning to select the most suitable feature extractor. Our evaluations demonstrate that our approach, neurosymbolic Feature EXtraction (nFEX), yields higher-quality features. It also reduces the pose error observed for the state-of-the-art baseline feature extractors ORB and SIFT by up to 90% and up to 66%, respectively, thereby enhancing the system's efficiency and adaptability to novel environments.</description>

      <title>Intercepting Unauthorized Aerial Robots in Controlled Airspace Using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in controlled airspace presents significant risks, including potential collisions, disruptions to air traffic, and security threats. Ensuring the safe and efficient operation of airspace, particularly in urban environments and near critical infrastructure, necessitates effective methods to intercept unauthorized or non-cooperative UAVs. This work addresses the critical need for robust, adaptive systems capable of managing such threats through the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL). We present a novel approach utilizing RL to train fixed-wing UAV pursuer agents for intercepting dynamic evader targets. Our methodology explores both model-based and model-free RL algorithms, specifically DreamerV3, Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). The training and evaluation of these algorithms were conducted under diverse scenarios, including unseen evasion strategies and environmental perturbations. Our approach leverages high-fidelity flight dynamics simulations to create realistic training environments. This research underscores the importance of developing intelligent, adaptive control systems for UAV interception, significantly contributing to the advancement of secure and efficient airspace management. It demonstrates the potential of RL to train systems capable of autonomously achieving these critical tasks.</description>

      <title>FE-GUT: Factor Graph Optimization hybrid with Extended Kalman Filter for tightly coupled GNSS/UWB Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise positioning and navigation information has been increasingly important with the development of the consumer electronics market. Due to some deficits of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), such as susceptible to interferences, integrating of GNSS with additional alternative sensors is a promising approach to overcome the performance limitations of GNSS-based localization systems. Ultra-Wideband (UWB) can be used to enhance GNSS in constructing an integrated localization system. However, most low-cost UWB devices lack a hardware-level time synchronization feature, which necessitates the estimation and compensation of the time-offset in the tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration. Given the flexibility of probabilistic graphical models, the time-offset can be modeled as an invariant constant in the discretization of the continuous model. This work proposes a novel architecture in which Factor Graph Optimization (FGO) is hybrid with Extend Kalman Filter (EKF) for tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration with online Temporal calibration (FE-GUT). FGO is utilized to precisely estimate the time-offset, while EKF provides initailization for the new factors and performs time-offset compensation. Simulation-based experiments validate the integrated localization performance of FE-GUT. In a four-wheeled robot scenario, the results demonstrate that, compared to EKF, FE-GUT can improve horizontal and vertical localization accuracy by 58.59\% and 34.80\%, respectively, while the time-offset estimation accuracy is improved by 76.80\%.

      <title>A Unified Approach to Multi-task Legged Navigation: Temporal Logic Meets Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the problem of hopping robot navigation planning to achieve simultaneous goal-directed and environment exploration tasks. We consider a scenario in which the robot has mandatory goal-directed tasks defined using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specifications as well as optional exploration tasks represented using a reward function. Additionally, there exists uncertainty in the robot dynamics which results in motion perturbation. We first propose an abstraction of 3D hopping robot dynamics which enables high-level planning and a neural-network-based optimization for low-level control. We then introduce a Multi-task Product IMDP (MT-PIMDP) model of the system and tasks. We propose a unified control policy synthesis algorithm which enables both task-directed goal-reaching behaviors as well as task-agnostic exploration to learn perturbations and reward. We provide a formal proof of the trade-off induced by prioritizing either LTL or RL actions. We demonstrate our methods with simulation case studies in a 2D world navigation environment.</description>

      <title>Towards Open-World Mobile Manipulation in Homes: Lessons from the Neurips 2023 HomeRobot Open Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to develop robots that can effectively serve as versatile and capable home assistants, it is crucial for them to reliably perceive and interact with a wide variety of objects across diverse environments. To this end, we proposed Open Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation as a key benchmark task for robotics: finding any object in a novel environment and placing it on any receptacle surface within that environment. We organized a NeurIPS 2023 competition featuring both simulation and real-world components to evaluate solutions to this task. Our baselines on the most challenging version of this task, using real perception in simulation, achieved only an 0.8% success rate; by the end of the competition, the best participants achieved an 10.8\% success rate, a 13x improvement. We observed that the most successful teams employed a variety of methods, yet two common threads emerged among the best solutions: enhancing error detection and recovery, and improving the integration of perception with decision-making processes. In this paper, we detail the results and methodologies used, both in simulation and real-world settings. We discuss the lessons learned and their implications for future research. Additionally, we compare performance in real and simulated environments, emphasizing the necessity for robust generalization to novel settings.</description>

      <title>A Starter's Kit for Concentric Tube Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concentric Tube Robots (CTRs) have garnered significant interest within the surgical robotics community because of their flexibility, dexterity, and ease of miniaturization. However, mastering the unique kinematics and design principles of CTRs can be challenging for newcomers to the field. In this paper, we present an educational kit aimed at lowering the barriers to entry into concentric tube robot research. Our goal is to provide accessible learning resources for CTRs, bridging the knowledge gap between traditional robotic arms and these specialized devices. The proposed kit includes (1) An open-source design and assembly instructions for an economical (cost of materials $\approx$ 700 USD) modular CTR; (2) A set of self-study materials to learn the basics of CTR modeling and control, including automatically-graded assignments. To evaluate the effectiveness of our educational kit, we conducted a human subjects study involving first-year graduate students in engineering. Over a four-week period, participants -- none of whom had any prior knowledge of concentric tube robots -- successfully built their first CTR using the provided materials, implemented the robot's kinematics in MATLAB, and conducted a tip-tracking experiment with an optical tracking device. Our findings suggest that the proposed kit facilitates learning and hands-on experience with CTRs, and furthermore, it has the potential to help early-stage graduate students get rapidly started with CTR research. By disseminating these resources, we hope to broaden participation in concentric tube robot research to a wider a more diverse group of researchers.</description>

      <title>RoboCAS: A Benchmark for Robotic Manipulation in Complex Object Arrangement Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models hold significant potential for enabling robots to perform long-horizon general manipulation tasks. However, the simplicity of tasks and the uniformity of environments in existing benchmarks restrict their effective deployment in complex scenarios. To address this limitation, this paper introduces the \textit{RoboCAS} benchmark, the first benchmark specifically designed for complex object arrangement scenarios in robotic manipulation. This benchmark employs flexible and concise scripted policies to efficiently collect a diverse array of demonstrations, showcasing scattered, orderly, and stacked object arrangements within a highly realistic physical simulation environment. It includes complex processes such as target retrieval, obstacle clearance, and robot manipulation, testing agents' abilities to perform long-horizon planning for spatial reasoning and predicting chain reactions under ambiguous instructions. Extensive experiments on multiple baseline models reveal their limitations in managing complex object arrangement scenarios, underscoring the urgent need for intelligent agents capable of performing long-horizon operations in practical deployments and providing valuable insights for future research directions.

      <title>Hyperion - A fast, versatile symbolic Gaussian Belief Propagation framework for Continuous-Time SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-Time Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (CTSLAM) has become a promising approach for fusing asynchronous and multi-modal sensor suites. Unlike discrete-time SLAM, which estimates poses discretely, CTSLAM uses continuous-time motion parametrizations, facilitating the integration of a variety of sensors such as rolling-shutter cameras, event cameras and Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). However, CTSLAM approaches remain computationally demanding and are conventionally posed as centralized Non-Linear Least Squares (NLLS) optimizations. Targeting these limitations, we not only present the fastest SymForce-based [Martiros et al., RSS 2022] B- and Z-Spline implementations achieving speedups between 2.43x and 110.31x over Sommer et al. [CVPR 2020] but also implement a novel continuous-time Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) framework, coined Hyperion, which targets decentralized probabilistic inference across agents. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in motion tracking and localization settings, complemented by empirical ablation studies.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Safety in Autonomous Driving: Integrating Latent State Diffusion Model for End-to-End Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of autonomous driving, ensuring safety during motion planning and navigation is becoming more and more important. However, most end-to-end planning methods suffer from a lack of safety. This research addresses the safety issue in the control optimization problem of autonomous driving, formulated as Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs). We propose a novel, model-based approach for policy optimization, utilizing a conditional Value-at-Risk based Soft Actor Critic to manage constraints in complex, high-dimensional state spaces effectively. Our method introduces a worst-case actor to guide safe exploration, ensuring rigorous adherence to safety requirements even in unpredictable scenarios. The policy optimization employs the Augmented Lagrangian method and leverages latent diffusion models to predict and simulate future trajectories. This dual approach not only aids in navigating environments safely but also refines the policy's performance by integrating distribution modeling to account for environmental uncertainties. Empirical evaluations conducted in both simulated and real environment demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of safety, efficiency, and decision-making capabilities.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Resilient Projected Push-Pull (RP3) algorithm designed for distributed optimization in multi-agent cyber-physical systems with directed communication graphs and the presence of malicious agents. Our algorithm leverages stochastic inter-agent trust values and gradient tracking to achieve geometric convergence rates in expectation even in adversarial environments. We introduce growing constraint sets to limit the impact of the malicious agents without compromising the geometric convergence rate of the algorithm. We prove that RP3 converges to the nominal optimal solution almost surely and in the $r$-th mean for any $r\geq 1$, provided the step sizes are sufficiently small and the constraint sets are appropriately chosen. We validate our approach with numerical studies on average consensus and multi-robot target tracking problems, demonstrating that RP3 effectively mitigates the impact of malicious agents and achieves the desired geometric convergence.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Causality of End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Deep learning-based models are widely deployed in autonomous driving areas, especially the increasingly noticed end-to-end solutions. However, the black-box property of these models raises concerns about their trustworthiness and safety for autonomous driving, and how to debug the causality has become a pressing concern. Despite some existing research on the explainability of autonomous driving, there is currently no systematic solution to help researchers debug and identify the key factors that lead to the final predicted action of end-to-end autonomous driving. In this work, we propose a comprehensive approach to explore and analyze the causality of end-to-end autonomous driving. First, we validate the essential information that the final planning depends on by using controlled variables and counterfactual interventions for qualitative analysis. Then, we quantitatively assess the factors influencing model decisions by visualizing and statistically analyzing the response of key model inputs. Finally, based on the comprehensive study of the multi-factorial end-to-end autonomous driving system, we have developed a strong baseline and a tool for exploring causality in the close-loop simulator CARLA. It leverages the essential input sources to obtain a well-designed model, resulting in highly competitive capabilities. As far as we know, our work is the first to unveil the mystery of end-to-end autonomous driving and turn the black box into a white one. Thorough close-loop experiments demonstrate that our method can be applied to end-to-end autonomous driving solutions for causality debugging.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is crucial for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and serves as a foundation for various applications that bridge cyberspace and the physical world. Recently, the emergence of Multi-modal Large Models (MLMs) and World Models (WMs) have attracted significant attention due to their remarkable perception, interaction, and reasoning capabilities, making them a promising architecture for the brain of embodied agents. However, there is no comprehensive survey for Embodied AI in the era of MLMs. In this survey, we give a comprehensive exploration of the latest advancements in Embodied AI. Our analysis firstly navigates through the forefront of representative works of embodied robots and simulators, to fully understand the research focuses and their limitations. Then, we analyze four main research targets: 1) embodied perception, 2) embodied interaction, 3) embodied agent, and 4) sim-to-real adaptation, covering the state-of-the-art methods, essential paradigms, and comprehensive datasets. Additionally, we explore the complexities of MLMs in virtual and real embodied agents, highlighting their significance in facilitating interactions in dynamic digital and physical environments. Finally, we summarize the challenges and limitations of embodied AI and discuss their potential future directions. We hope this survey will serve as a foundational reference for the research community and inspire continued innovation.

      <title>Less is More: Efficient Brain-Inspired Learning for Autonomous Driving Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately and safely predicting the trajectories of surrounding vehicles is essential for fully realizing autonomous driving (AD). This paper presents the Human-Like Trajectory Prediction model (HLTP++), which emulates human cognitive processes to improve trajectory prediction in AD. HLTP++ incorporates a novel teacher-student knowledge distillation framework. The "teacher" model equipped with an adaptive visual sector, mimics the dynamic allocation of attention human drivers exhibit based on factors like spatial orientation, proximity, and driving speed. On the other hand, the "student" model focuses on real-time interaction and human decision-making, drawing parallels to the human memory storage mechanism. Furthermore, we improve the model's efficiency by introducing a new Fourier Adaptive Spike Neural Network (FA-SNN), allowing for faster and more precise predictions with fewer parameters. Evaluated using the NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD benchmarks, HLTP++ demonstrates superior performance compared to existing models, which reduces the predicted trajectory error with over 11% on the NGSIM dataset and 25% on the HighD datasets. Moreover, HLTP++ demonstrates strong adaptability in challenging environments with incomplete input data. This marks a significant stride in the journey towards fully AD systems.</description>

      <title>MAVIS: Multi-Camera Augmented Visual-Inertial SLAM using SE2(3) Based Exact IMU Pre-integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08142v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel optimization-based Visual-Inertial SLAM system designed for multiple partially overlapped camera systems, named MAVIS. Our framework fully exploits the benefits of wide field-of-view from multi-camera systems, and the metric scale measurements provided by an inertial measurement unit (IMU). We introduce an improved IMU pre-integration formulation based on the exponential function of an automorphism of SE_2(3), which can effectively enhance tracking performance under fast rotational motion and extended integration time. Furthermore, we extend conventional front-end tracking and back-end optimization module designed for monocular or stereo setup towards multi-camera systems, and introduce implementation details that contribute to the performance of our system in challenging scenarios. The practical validity of our approach is supported by our experiments on public datasets. Our MAVIS won the first place in all the vision-IMU tracks (single and multi-session SLAM) on Hilti SLAM Challenge 2023 with 1.7 times the score compared to the second place.</description>

      <title>Learning Vision-Based Bipedal Locomotion for Challenging Terrain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for bipedal locomotion has recently demonstrated robust gaits over moderate terrains using only proprioceptive sensing. However, such blind controllers will fail in environments where robots must anticipate and adapt to local terrain, which requires visual perception. In this paper, we propose a fully-learned system that allows bipedal robots to react to local terrain while maintaining commanded travel speed and direction. Our approach first trains a controller in simulation using a heightmap expressed in the robot's local frame. Next, data is collected in simulation to train a heightmap predictor, whose input is the history of depth images and robot states. We demonstrate that with appropriate domain randomization, this approach allows for successful sim-to-real transfer with no explicit pose estimation and no fine-tuning using real-world data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of sim-to-real learning for vision-based bipedal locomotion over challenging terrains.</description>

      <title>UAVs and Birds: Enhancing Short-Range Navigation through Budgerigar Flight Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study delves into the flight behaviors of Budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) to gain insights into their flight trajectories and movements. Using 3D reconstruction from stereo video camera recordings, we closely examine the velocity and acceleration patterns during three flight motion takeoff, flying and landing. The findings not only contribute to our understanding of bird behaviors but also hold significant implications for the advancement of algorithms in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The research aims to bridge the gap between biological principles observed in birds and the application of these insights in developing more efficient and autonomous UAVs. In the context of the increasing use of drones, this study focuses on the biologically inspired principles drawn from bird behaviors, particularly during takeoff, flying and landing flight, to enhance UAV capabilities. The dataset created for this research sheds light on Budgerigars' takeoff, flying, and landing techniques, emphasizing their ability to control speed across different situations and surfaces. The study underscores the potential of incorporating these principles into UAV algorithms, addressing challenges related to short-range navigation, takeoff, flying, and landing.</description>

      <title>Working Backwards: Learning to Place by Picking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present placing via picking (PvP), a method to autonomously collect real-world demonstrations for a family of placing tasks in which objects must be manipulated to specific, contact-constrained locations. With PvP, we approach the collection of robotic object placement demonstrations by reversing the grasping process and exploiting the inherent symmetry of the pick and place problems. Specifically, we obtain placing demonstrations from a set of grasp sequences of objects initially located at their target placement locations. Our system can collect hundreds of demonstrations in contact-constrained environments without human intervention using two modules: compliant control for grasping and tactile regrasping. We train a policy directly from visual observations through behavioural cloning, using the autonomously-collected demonstrations. By doing so, the policy can generalize to object placement scenarios outside of the training environment without privileged information (e.g., placing a plate picked up from a table). We validate our approach in home robot scenarios that include dishwasher loading and table setting. Our approach yields robotic placing policies that outperform policies trained with kinesthetic teaching, both in terms of success rate and data efficiency, while requiring no human supervision.</description>

      <title>HiER: Highlight Experience Replay for Boosting Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Even though reinforcement-learning-based algorithms achieved superhuman performance in many domains, the field of robotics poses significant challenges as the state and action spaces are continuous, and the reward function is predominantly sparse. Furthermore, on many occasions, the agent is devoid of access to any form of demonstration. Inspired by human learning, in this work, we propose a method named highlight experience replay (HiER) that creates a secondary highlight replay buffer for the most relevant experiences. For the weights update, the transitions are sampled from both the standard and the highlight experience replay buffer. It can be applied with or without the techniques of hindsight experience replay (HER) and prioritized experience replay (PER). Our method significantly improves the performance of the state-of-the-art, validated on 8 tasks of three robotic benchmarks. Furthermore, to exploit the full potential of HiER, we propose HiER+ in which HiER is enhanced with an arbitrary data collection curriculum learning method. Our implementation, the qualitative results, and a video presentation are available on the project site: http://www.danielhorvath.eu/hier/.</description>

      <title>Are Large Language Models Aligned with People's Social Intuitions for Human-Robot Interactions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in robotics, especially for high-level action planning. Meanwhile, many robotics applications involve human supervisors or collaborators. Hence, it is crucial for LLMs to generate socially acceptable actions that align with people's preferences and values. In this work, we test whether LLMs capture people's intuitions about behavior judgments and communication preferences in human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios. For evaluation, we reproduce three HRI user studies, comparing the output of LLMs with that of real participants. We find that GPT-4 strongly outperforms other models, generating answers that correlate strongly with users' answers in two studies $\unicode{x2014}$ the first study dealing with selecting the most appropriate communicative act for a robot in various situations ($r_s$ = 0.82), and the second with judging the desirability, intentionality, and surprisingness of behavior ($r_s$ = 0.83). However, for the last study, testing whether people judge the behavior of robots and humans differently, no model achieves strong correlations. Moreover, we show that vision models fail to capture the essence of video stimuli and that LLMs tend to rate different communicative acts and behavior desirability higher than people.</description>

      <title>Perceive With Confidence: Statistical Safety Assurances for Navigation with Learning-Based Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid advances in perception have enabled large pre-trained models to be used out of the box for transforming high-dimensional, noisy, and partial observations of the world into rich occupancy representations. However, the reliability of these models and consequently their safe integration onto robots remains unknown when deployed in environments unseen during training. In this work, we address this challenge by rigorously quantifying the uncertainty of pre-trained perception systems for object detection via a novel calibration technique based on conformal prediction. Crucially, this procedure guarantees robustness to distribution shifts in states when perceptual outputs are used in conjunction with a planner. As a result, the calibrated perception system can be used in combination with any safe planner to provide an end-to-end statistical assurance on safety in unseen environments. We evaluate the resulting approach, Perceive with Confidence (PwC), in simulation and on hardware where a quadruped robot navigates through previously unseen indoor, static environments. These experiments validate the safety assurances for obstacle avoidance provided by PwC and demonstrate up to $40\%$ improvements in empirical safety compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>CARL: Congestion-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Imitation-based Perturbations in Mixed Traffic Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human-driven vehicles (HVs) exhibit complex and diverse behaviors. Accurately modeling such behavior is crucial for validating Robot Vehicles (RVs) in simulation and realizing the potential of mixed traffic control. However, existing approaches like parameterized models and data-driven techniques struggle to capture the full complexity and diversity. To address this, in this work, we introduce CARL, a hybrid approach that combines imitation learning for close proximity car-following and probabilistic sampling for larger headways. We also propose two classes of RL-based RVs: a safety RV focused on maximizing safety and an efficiency RV focused on maximizing efficiency. Our experiments show that the safety RV increases Time-to-Collision above the critical 4-second threshold and reduces Deceleration Rate to Avoid a Crash by up to 80%, while the efficiency RV achieves improvements in throughput of up to 49%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of CARL in enhancing both safety and efficiency in mixed traffic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alongside optimization-based planners, sampling-based approaches are often used in trajectory planning for autonomous driving due to their simplicity. Model predictive path integral control is a framework that builds upon optimization principles while incorporating stochastic sampling of input trajectories. This paper investigates several sampling approaches for trajectory generation. In this context, normalizing flows originating from the field of variational inference are considered for the generation of sampling distributions, as they model transformations of simple to more complex distributions. Accordingly, learning-based normalizing flow models are trained for a more efficient exploration of the input domain for the task at hand. The developed algorithm and the proposed sampling distributions are evaluated in two simulation scenarios.</description>

      <title>From LLMs to Actions: Latent Codes as Bridges in Hierarchical Robot Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hierarchical control for robotics has long been plagued by the need to have a well defined interface layer to communicate between high-level task planners and low-level policies. With the advent of LLMs, language has been emerging as a prospective interface layer. However, this has several limitations. Not all tasks can be decomposed into steps that are easily expressible in natural language (e.g. performing a dance routine). Further, it makes end-to-end finetuning on embodied data challenging due to domain shift and catastrophic forgetting. We introduce our method -- Learnable Latent Codes as Bridges (LCB) -- as an alternate architecture to overcome these limitations. \method~uses a learnable latent code to act as a bridge between LLMs and low-level policies. This enables LLMs to flexibly communicate goals in the task plan without being entirely constrained by language limitations. Additionally, it enables end-to-end finetuning without destroying the embedding space of word tokens learned during pre-training. Through experiments on Language Table and Calvin, two common language based benchmarks for embodied agents, we find that \method~outperforms baselines (including those w/ GPT-4V) that leverage pure language as the interface layer on tasks that require reasoning and multi-step behaviors.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Sparse Rewards for Goal-Reaching Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world robot learning problems, such as pick-and-place or arriving at a destination, can be seen as a problem of reaching a goal state as soon as possible. These problems, when formulated as episodic reinforcement learning tasks, can easily be specified to align well with our intended goal: -1 reward every time step with termination upon reaching the goal state, called minimum-time tasks. Despite this simplicity, such formulations are often overlooked in favor of dense rewards due to their perceived difficulty and lack of informativeness. Our studies contrast the two reward paradigms, revealing that the minimum-time task specification not only facilitates learning higher-quality policies but can also surpass dense-reward-based policies on their own performance metrics. Crucially, we also identify the goal-hit rate of the initial policy as a robust early indicator for learning success in such sparse feedback settings. Finally, using four distinct real-robotic platforms, we show that it is possible to learn pixel-based policies from scratch within two to three hours using constant negative rewards.</description>

Abstract: We evaluate the use of software interpretation to push High Level Synthesis of application-specific accelerators toward a higher level of abstraction. Our methodology is supported by a formal power consumption model that computes the power consumption of accelerator components, accurately predicting the power consumption on new designs from prior optimization estimations. We demonstrate how our approach simplifies the re-use of power optimizations across distinct designs, by leveraging the higher level of design abstraction, using two accelerators representative of the robotics domain, implemented through the Bambu High Level Synthesis tool. Results support the research hypothesis, achieving predictions accurate within +/- 1%.</description>

      <title>Real-time Holistic Robot Pose Estimation with Unknown States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating robot pose from RGB images is a crucial problem in computer vision and robotics. While previous methods have achieved promising performance, most of them presume full knowledge of robot internal states, e.g. ground-truth robot joint angles. However, this assumption is not always valid in practical situations. In real-world applications such as multi-robot collaboration or human-robot interaction, the robot joint states might not be shared or could be unreliable. On the other hand, existing approaches that estimate robot pose without joint state priors suffer from heavy computation burdens and thus cannot support real-time applications. This work introduces an efficient framework for real-time robot pose estimation from RGB images without requiring known robot states. Our method estimates camera-to-robot rotation, robot state parameters, keypoint locations, and root depth, employing a neural network module for each task to facilitate learning and sim-to-real transfer. Notably, it achieves inference in a single feed-forward pass without iterative optimization. Our approach offers a 12-time speed increase with state-of-the-art accuracy, enabling real-time holistic robot pose estimation for the first time.

      <title>Path Planning for a Cooperative Navigation Aid Vehicle to Assist Multiple Agents Sequentially</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers planning a path for a single underwater cooperative navigation aid (CNA) vehicle to sequentially aid a set of N agents to minimize average navigation uncertainty. Both the CNA and agents are modeled as constant-velocity vehicles. The agents travel along known nominal trajectories and the CNA plans a path to sequentially intercept them. Navigation aiding is modeled by a scalar discrete time Kalman filter. During path planning, the CNA considers surfacing to reduce its own navigation uncertainty. A greedy planning algorithm is proposed that uses a heuristic to schedule agents to the CNA that is based on the optimal time-to-aid, the overall navigation uncertainty reduction, and the transit time. The approach is compared to an optimal (exhaustive enumeration) algorithm through a Monte Carlo experiment with randomized agent trajectories and initial navigation uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Batch Estimation of a Steady, Uniform, Flow-Field from Ground Velocity and Heading Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents three batch estimation methods that use noisy ground velocity and heading measurements from a vehicle executing a circular orbit (or similar large heading change maneuver) to estimate the speed and direction of a steady, uniform, flow-field. The methods are based on a simple kinematic model of the vehicle's motion and use curve-fitting or nonlinear least-square optimization. A Monte Carlo simulation with randomized flow conditions is used to evaluate the batch estimation methods while varying the measurement noise of the data and the interval of unique heading traversed during the maneuver. The methods are also compared using experimental data obtained with a Bluefin-21 unmanned underwater vehicle performing a series of circular orbit maneuvers over a five hour period in a tide-driven flow.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning Study of Motion Transformer-based Trajectory Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trajectory planning in autonomous driving is highly dependent on predicting the emergent behavior of other road users. Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model. Furthermore, the study aims to provide insights into possible trade-offs between computational time and performance to support effective transfers into the real world.</description>

      <title>Collision Avoidance Metric for 3D Camera Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D cameras have emerged as a critical source of information for applications in robotics and autonomous driving. These cameras provide robots with the ability to capture and utilize point clouds, enabling them to navigate their surroundings and avoid collisions with other objects. However, current standard camera evaluation metrics often fail to consider the specific application context. These metrics typically focus on measures like Chamfer distance (CD) or Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), which may not directly translate to performance in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel metric for point cloud evaluation, specifically designed to assess the suitability of 3D cameras for the critical task of collision avoidance. This metric incorporates application-specific considerations and provides a more accurate measure of a camera's effectiveness in ensuring safe robot navigation. The source code is available at https://github.com/intrinsic-ai/collision-avoidance-metric.</description>
