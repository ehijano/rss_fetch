      <title>Modeling of Nitric Oxide Infrared radiative flux in lower thermosphere: a machine learning perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitric Oxide (NO) significantly impacts energy distribution and chemical processes in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). During geomagnetic storms, a substantial influx of energy in the thermosphere leads to an increase in NO infrared emissions. Accurately predicting the radiative flux of Nitric Oxide is crucial for understanding the thermospheric energy budget, particularly during extreme space weather events. With advancements in computational techniques, machine learning (ML) has become a highly effective tool for space weather forecasting. This effort becomes even more worthwhile considering the availability of two decades of continuous NO infrared emissions measurement by TIMED/SABER along with several other key thermospheric variables. We present the scheme of development of an ML-based predictive model for Nitric Oxide Infrared Radiative Flux (NOIRF). Various ML algorithms have been tested for better predictive ability, and an optimized model (NOEMLM) has been developed for the study of NOIRF. This model is able to extract the underlying relationships between the input features and effectively predict the NOIRF. The NOEMLM predictions have very good agreements with SABER observation during quiet time as well as geomagnetic storms. In comparison with the existing TIEGCM model, NOEMLM has very good performance, especially during extreme space weather conditions. The results of this study suggest that utilizing geomagnetic and space weather indices with ML/AI can serve as superior parameters for studying the upper atmosphere, as compared to focusing on specific species having complex chemical processes and associated uncertainties in constituents. ML techniques can effectively carry out the analysis with greater ease than traditional chemical studies.</description>

      <title>NeuralODEs for VLEO simulations: Introducing thermoNET for Thermosphere Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel neural architecture termed thermoNET, designed to represent thermospheric density in satellite orbital propagation using a reduced amount of differentiable computations. Due to the appearance of a neural network on the right-hand side of the equations of motion, the resulting satellite dynamics is governed by a NeuralODE, a neural Ordinary Differential Equation, characterized by its fully differentiable nature, allowing the derivation of variational equations (hence of the state transition matrix) and facilitating its use in connection to advanced numerical techniques such as Taylor-based numerical propagation and differential algebraic techniques. Efficient training of the network parameters occurs through two distinct approaches. In the first approach, the network undergoes training independently of spacecraft dynamics, engaging in a pure regression task against ground truth models, including JB-08 and NRLMSISE-00. In the second paradigm, network parameters are learned based on observed dynamics, adapting through ODE sensitivities. In both cases, the outcome is a flexible, compact model of the thermosphere density greatly enhancing numerical propagation efficiency while maintaining accuracy in the orbital predictions.</description>

      <title>Three-stage Acceleration of Solar Energetic Particles Detected by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) drive powerful shocks and thereby accelerate solar energetic particles (SEPs) as they propagate from the corona into interplanetary space. Here we present the processes of three-stage particle acceleration by a CME-driven shock detected by the in situ spacecraft--Parker Solar Probe (PSP) on 2022 August 27. The onset of SEPs is produced by a fast CME with a speed of 1284 km/s when it propagates to $\sim$2.85 Rs. The second stage of particle acceleration occurs when the fast CME catches up and interacts with a preceding slow one in interplanetary space at $\sim$40 Rs ($\sim$0.19 au). The CME interaction is accompanied by an intense interplanetary type II radio enhancement. Such direct measurement of particle acceleration during interplanetary CME interaction/radio enhancement is rarely recorded in previous studies. The third stage of energetic storm particles is associated with the CME-driven shock passage of the PSP at $\sim$0.38 au. Obviously, harder particle spectra are found in the latter two stages than the first one, which can arise from a stronger shock produced by the CME interaction and the enriched seed particles inside the preceding CME.</description>

      <title>Embedded coherent structures from MHD to sub-ion scales in turbulent solar wind at 0.17 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10478v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study intermittent coherent structures in solar wind magnetic turbulence from MHD to kinetic plasma scales using Parker Solar Probe data during its first perihelion (at 0.17 au), when the satellite was in the Alfv\'enic slow wind of 340 km/s. The coherent structures are energetic events localized in time and covering wide range of scales. We detect them using Morlet wavelets. For the first time, we apply a multi-scale analyses in physical space to study these structures. At MHD scales within the inertial range, times scales $\tau \in (1, 10^{2} )$ s, we find (i) current sheets including switchback boundaries and (ii) Alfv\'en vortices. Within these events, there are embedded structures at smaller scales: typically Alfv\'en vortices at ion scales, $\tau \in (0.08, 1)$ s, and a compressible vortices at sub-ion scales, $\tau \in (8,80)$ ms. The number of coherent structures grows toward smaller scales: we observe about $\sim 200$ events during 5 h time interval at MHD scales, $\sim 10^{3}$ events ai ion scales and $\sim 10^{4}$ events at sub-ion scales. In general, there are multiple structures of ion and sub-ion scales embedded within one MHD structure. There are also examples of ion and sub-ion scales structures outside of MHD structures. To quantify the relative importance of different type of structures, we do a statistical comparison of the observed structures with the expectations of models of the current sheets and vortices. This comparison is based on amplitude anisotropy of magnetic fluctuations within the structures. The results show the dominance of Alfv\'en vortices at all scales in contrast to the widespread view of dominance of current sheets. This means that Alfv\'en vortices are important building blocs of solar wind turbulence.</description>
