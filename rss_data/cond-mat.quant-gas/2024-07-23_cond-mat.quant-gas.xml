      <title>Dynamical Transition of Quantum Vortex-Pair Annihilation in a Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the elementary mechanism for the dissipation of vortex energy in quantum liquids is one central issue in quantum hydrodynamics, such as quantum turbulence in systems ranging from neutron stars to atomic condensates. In a two-dimensional (2D) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) at zero temperature, besides the vortex drift-out process from the boundary, vortex-antivortex pair can annihilate in the bulk, but controversy remains on the number of vortices involved in the annihilation process. We find there exists a dynamical transition from four-body to three-body vortex annihilation processes with the time evolution in a boundary-less uniform quasi-2D BEC. Such dynamical transition depends on the initial vortex pair density, and occurs when the sound waves generated in the vortex annihilation process surpass a critical energy. With the confinement along the third direction is relaxed in a quasi-2D BEC, the critical sound wave energy decreases due to the 3D vortex line curve and reconnection, shifting the dynamical transition to the early time. Our work reveals an elementary mechanism for the dissipation of vortex energy that may help understand exotic matter and dynamics in quantum liquids.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase and multipartite entanglement of Rydberg atom chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of geometric phase (GP) and geometric entanglement (GE), a multipartite entanglement measure, across quantum phase transitions in Rydberg atom chains. Using density matrix renormalization group calculations and finite-size scaling analysis, we characterize the critical properties of transitions between disordered and ordered phases. Both quantities exhibit characteristic scaling near transition points, with the disorder to $Z_2$ ordered phase transition showing behavior consistent with the Ising universality class, while the disorder to $Z_3$ phase transition displays distinct critical properties. We demonstrate that GP and GE serve as sensitive probes of quantum criticality, providing consistent critical parameters and scaling behavior. A unifying description of these geometric quantities from a quantum geometry perspective is explored, and an interferometric setup for their potential measurement is discussed. Our results provide insights into the interplay between geometric phase and multipartite entanglement near quantum phase transitions in Rydberg atom systems, revealing how these quantities reflect the underlying critical behavior in these complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Topological floating phase of dipolar bosons in an optical ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold dipolar hard-core bosons in optical ladders provide exciting possibilities for the quantum simulation of anisotropic XXZ spin ladders. We show that introducing a tilt along the rungs results in a rich phase diagram at unit filling. In particular, for a sufficiently strong dipolar strength, the interplay between the long-range tail of the dipolar interactions and the tilting leads to the emergence of a quantum floating phase, a critical phase with incommensurate density-density correlations. Interestingly, the study of the entanglement spectrum, reveals that the floating phase is topological, constituting an intermediate gapless stage in the melting of a crystal into a gapped topological Haldane phase. This novel scenario for topological floating phases in dipolar XXZ ladders can be investigated in on-going experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-local quench spectroscopy of fermionic excitations in 1D quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elementary excitations of quantum spin systems have generally the nature of weakly interacting bosonic quasi-particles, generated by local operators acting on the ground state. Nonetheless in one spatial dimension the nature of the quasiparticles can change radically, since many relevant one-dimensional $S=1/2$ Hamiltonians can be exactly mapped onto models of spinless fermions with local hopping and interactions. Due to the non-local nature of the spin-to-fermion mapping, observing directly the fermionic quasiparticle excitations is impossible using local probes, which are at the basis of all the forms of spectroscopy (such as neutron scattering) traditionally available in condensed matter physics. Here we show theoretically that \emph{quench spectroscopy} for synthetic quantum matter -- which probes the excitation spectrum of a system by monitoring the nonequilibrium dynamics of its correlation functions -- can reconstruct accurately the dispersion relation of fermionic quasiparticles in spin chains. This possibility relies on the ability of quantum simulation experiments to measure non-local spin-spin correlation functions, corresponding to elementary fermionic correlation functions. Our analysis is based on new exact results for the quench dynamics of quantum spin chains; and it opens the path to probe arbitrary quasiparticle excitations in synthetic quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Interacting Bosons on the Sawtooth Lattice with a Flat Band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems are expected to relax to a thermal state over time, with some exceptions such as systems with atypical eigenstates. In this study, we investigate the effect of the existence of spatially localized eigenstates on the relaxation dynamics of interacting bosons loaded into a one-dimensional sawtooth lattice, which exhibits a flat band in the single-particle spectrum by tuning the hopping rates. Using the time-evolving block decimation algorithm, we simulate the time evolution of the local density profile based on the Bose-Hubbard model with different initial conditions. Our results show the presence of the flat band leads to a significant slowing down of relaxation for weak interactions. Even for strong interaction, when the initial state includes an isolated localized single-particle eigenstate in the superposition, remnants of the initial bias in the density profile persist for a long time. This particular relaxation dynamics can be tested using ultracold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spin transport in a one-dimensional finite-length wire connected to fermionic leads. The interacting wire is described by the sine-Gordon model while the leads are either noninteracting or interacting Luttinger liquids. We calculate the spin current driven by a spin bias by solving numerically the classical equation of motion, and we find that the cosine term in the sine-Gordon model gives rise to an oscillating spin current when the spin bias exceeds its critical value. We discuss the results in connection with transport experiments with ultracold atoms.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we prove that the quantum critical point in the ground state of quantum many-body systems, can also govern the universal dynamical behavior when the systems are driven far from equilibrium, which can be captured by the evolution of the quantum geometry of the systems. By investigating quantum quench dynamics in quadratic fermionic models, we prove that the quantum volume of these systems typically grows linearly over time, with a growth velocity demonstrating universal behavior: its first derivative over the control parameter exhibits a discontinuity at the quantum critical point, with an universal jump value that is independent of specific models, but is crucially determined by the system dimension. This result reveals universal dynamical properties of non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems</description>

      <title>Anomalous Casimir effect in an expanding ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Casimir effect is a macroscopic evidence of the quantum nature of the vacuum. On a ring, it leads to a finite size correction to the vacuum energy. In this work, we show that this vacuum's energy and pressure acquire additional, sizable corrections, when the ring's radius is increased fast enough, an experimentally accessible model of an expanding universe. This effect is distinct from the dynamical Casimir effect: it is a manifestation of the conformal anomaly, originating from the spacetime curvature induced by the increase of the ring's radius. This anomalous dynamical Casimir effect is measurable through the work necessary to increase the ring size, which becomes non-monotonous in time.</description>

      <title>Observation of Universal Expansion Anisotropy from Cold Atoms to Hot Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropy has been ubiquitously observed in high-energy proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus (heavy-ion) collisions, shaking the early belief that those anisotropies must stem from utterly strong interactions. This work reports a study of anisotropic expansion of cold $^{6}$Li Fermi gases, initially trapped in an anisotropic potential, as a function of the interaction strength that can be readily tuned by an external magnetic field. It is found that the expansion anisotropy builds up quickly at small interaction strength, without the need of utterly strong interactions. A universal behavior of the expansion anisotropy is quantitatively observed between cold-atom and heavy-ion systems, despite their vast differences in physics. This universality will potentially unify a variety of disciplines in nature, from the weakly interacting dilute systems of gases to the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Emergent Spacetime Supersymmetry with Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the zoo of emergent symmetries in quantum many-body physics, the previously unrealized emergent spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) is particularly intriguing. Although it was known that spacetime SUSY could emerge at the (1+1)d tricritical Ising transition, an experimental realization is still absent. In this letter, we propose to realize the tricritical Ising transition with Rydberg atom arrays, taking advantage of the reconfigurability of these systems. In such systems, the spacetime SUSY manifests itself in the respective correlation functions of a bosonic mode and its fermionic partner. However, the correlation function of the fermionic mode inevitably involves a string operator, making direct measurement challenging in the conventional setting. Here, we utilize the analog--digital hybrid nature of the Rydberg atom arrays, which can simulate a physical Hamiltonian and perform a digital quantum circuit on the same platform, to measure the correlation function of the fermionic mode. This hybridized protocol provides an experimentally feasible way to reveal the hidden structure of the spacetime SUSY that emerges at the tricritical Ising transition.</description>

Abstract: We show that the delocalization-localization transition in a quantum-many body (QMB) systems is a compelling quantum resource for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity in parameter estimation. We exploit the vulnerability of a near-transition QMB state against the parameter shift for devising efficient sensing tools. In this realm the main focus of this work is to identify, propose and analyze experimentally relevant quantum observables for precision measurement. Taking a QMB system as a Fermi lattice under quasi-periodic modulation that supports an energy-independent delocalization-localization transition, we suggest operator-based adiabatic and dynamical quantum sensors endowed with considerable quantum advantages.</description>

      <title>Spectra of correlators in the relaxation time approximation of kinetic theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relaxation time approximation (RTA) of the kinetic Boltzmann equation is likely the simplest window into the microscopic properties of collective real-time transport. Within this framework, we analytically compute all retarded two-point Green's functions of the energy-momentum tensor and a conserved $U(1)$ current in thermal states with classical massless particles (a `CFT') at non-zero density, and in the absence and presence of broken translational symmetry. This is done in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. RTA allows a full explicit analysis of the analytic structure of different correlators (poles versus branch cuts) and the transport properties that they imply (the thermoelectric conductivities, and the hydrodynamic, quasihydrodynamic and gapped mode dispersion relations). Our inherently weakly coupled analysis thereby also enables a direct comparison with previously known strongly coupled results in holographic CFTs dual to the Einstein-Maxwell-axion theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal effective interactions are inherent to non-relativistic quantum many-body systems, but their systematic resummation poses a significant challenge known as the ``vertex problem" in many-body perturbation theory. We introduce a renormalization scheme based on a projection-based renormalization condition that selectively resums the most essential nonlocal contributions to the effective interaction vertex, avoiding the computational complexity of the full vertex function. This enables us to derive a renormalized Feynman diagrammatic series with large parameters canceled by counter-diagrams, efficiently generated using a perturbative expansion of the parquet equations and computed using a diagrammatic Monte Carlo algorithm. Applying our approach to a 3D Yukawa Fermi liquid, we demonstrate that the renormalized perturbation theory remains predictive even in the strongly correlated regime and uncover significant sign cancellations between different channels contributing to the scattering amplitude. Our work establishes a novel framework for investigating strong correlations in quantum many-body systems, offering a systematic approach to explore nonlocal theories for challenging systems like the electron liquid in material science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a class of three-band non-Abelian topological insulators in three dimensions which carry a single bulk Hopf index protected by spatiotemporal ($\mathcal{PT}$) inversion symmetry. These phases may also host subdimensional topological invariants given by the Euler characteristic class, resulting in real Hopf-Euler insulators. Such systems naturally realize helical nodal structures in the 3D Brillouin zone, providing a physical manifestation of the linking number described by the Hopf invariant. We show that, by opening a gap between the valence bands of these systems, one finds a fully-gapped `flag' phase, which displays a three-band multi-gap Pontryagin invariant. Unlike the previously reported $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric four-band real Hopf insulator, which hosts a $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$ invariant, these phases are not unitarily equivalent to two copies of a complex two-band Hopf insulator. We show that these uncharted phases can be obtained through dimensional extension of two-dimensional Euler insulators, and that they support (1) an optical bulk integrated circular shift effect quantized by the Hopf invariant, (2) quantum-geometric breathing in the real space Wannier functions, and (3) surface Euler topology on boundaries. Consequently, our findings pave a way for novel experimental realizations of real-space quantum-geometry, as these systems may be directly simulated by utilizing synthethic dimensions in metamaterials or ultracold atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out of equilibrium, the action-reaction symmetry of the interactions is often broken, leading to the emergence of various collective phenomena with no equilibrium counterparts. Although ubiquitous in classical active systems, implementing such non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state systems has remained challenging, as the known quantum schemes require precise control over the system on a single-site level. Here, we propose a novel dissipation-engineering protocol to induce non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state platforms with light, which we expect to be achievable with state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Focusing on magnetic metals for concreteness, we show microscopically that a light injection that introduces the decay channel to a virtually excited state gives rise to non-reciprocal interactions between localized spins. One can even realize a situation where spin A tries to align with spin B but the B tries the opposite, resulting in a chase-and-runaway dynamics. Applying our scheme to layered ferromagnets, we show that a non-reciprocal phase transition from a static to a many-body time-dependent chiral phase emerges. Our work paves the way to bring solid-state systems to the realm of non-reciprocal science, providing yet another possibility to control quantum matter with light.</description>

      <title>Clustering of conditional mutual information and quantum Markov structure at arbitrary temperatures</title>

Abstract: Recent investigations have unveiled exotic quantum phases that elude characterization by simple bipartite correlation functions. In these phases, long-range entanglement arising from tripartite correlations plays a central role. Consequently, the study of multipartite correlations has become a focal point in modern physics. In these, Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) is one of the most well-established information-theoretic measures, adept at encapsulating the essence of various exotic phases, including topologically ordered ones. Within the realm of quantum many-body physics, it has been a long-sought goal to establish a quantum analog to the Hammersley-Clifford theorem that bridges the two concepts of the Gibbs state and the Markov network. This theorem posits that the correlation length of CMI remains short-range across all thermal equilibrium quantum phases. In this work, we demonstrate that CMI exhibits exponential decay concerning distance, with its correlation length increasing polynomially with the inverse temperature. While this clustering theorem has previously been established for high temperatures devoid of thermal phase transitions, it has remained elusive at low temperatures, where genuine long-range entanglement is corroborated to exist by the quantum topological order. Our findings unveil that, even at low temperatures, a broad class of tripartite entanglement cannot manifest in the long-range regime. To achieve the proof, we establish a comprehensive formalism for analyzing the locality of effective Hamiltonians on subsystems, commonly known as the `entanglement Hamiltonian' or `Hamiltonian of mean force.' As one outcome of our analyses, we enhance the prior clustering theorem concerning bipartite entanglement. In essence, this means that we investigate genuine bipartite entanglement that extends beyond the limitations of the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) class.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) at a putative quantum critical point signalling the onset of superradiance, in a set-up involving cavity quantum electrodynamics. Although the finiteness of the cavity, being bounded by reflecting mirrors, endows the cavity photons with an effective mass, they become massless at the continuous phase transition point. We consider the matter part coming from the fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice near half-filling, featuring doped Dirac cones at two sets of inequivalent valleys. This choice is dictated by the presence of a fermion-boson interaction vertex which can give rise to Landau damping of the critical bosons, eventually leading to an NFL phase for the fermions. To set up the quantum effective action, we identify the hot spots of the generically anisotropic (trigonally-warped) Fermi surfaces, which are the set of points having parallel/antiparallel tangent vectors. The cavity photons act as charge density wave (CDW) order parameters, connecting pairs of hot spots belonging to the Fermi surface of a single valley. With these ingredients, we have set upon identifying NFL phases, using the tools of dimensional regularization and renormalization-group-flow equations. Our final results indicate that stable NFL phases exist in the low-energy limit, for the projections of the flows along the CDW coupling constant.</description>
