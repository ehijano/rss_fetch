      <title>Emissions-Robust Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study portfolio choice when firm-level emissions intensities are measured with error. We introduce a scope-specific penalty operator that rescales asset payoffs as a smooth function of revenue-normalized emissions intensity. Under payoff homogeneity, unit-scale invariance, mixture linearity, and a curvature semigroup axiom, the operator is unique and has the closed form $P^{(m)}_j(r,\lambda)=\bigl(1-\lambda/\lambda_{\max,j}\bigr)^m r$. Combining this operator with norm- and moment-constrained ambiguity sets yields robust mean--variance and CVaR programs with exact linear and second-order cone reformulations and economically interpretable dual variables. In a U.S. large-cap equity universe with monthly rebalancing and uniform transaction costs, the resulting strategy reduces average Scope~1 emissions intensity by roughly 92\% relative to equal weight while exhibiting no statistically detectable reduction in the Sharpe ratio under block-bootstrap inference and no statistically detectable change in average returns under HAC inference. We report the return--emissions Pareto frontier, sensitivity to robustness and turnover constraints, and uncertainty propagation from multiple imputation of emissions disclosures.</description>

      <title>Universal basic income in a financial equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal basic income (UBI) is a tax scheme that uniformly redistributes aggregate income amongst the entire population of an economy. We prove the existence of an equilibrium in a model that implements universal basic income. The economic agents choose the proportion of their time to work and earn wages that can be used towards consumption and investment in a financial market with a traded stock and annuity. A proportion of the earned wages is uniformly distributed amongst all agents, leading to interconnectedness of the agents' decision problems, which are already dependent on one another through the financial market. The decision problems are further entangled by Nash perceptions of labor; the agents respond to the labor choices of others and act upon their perceived income in their decision problems. The equilibrium is constructed and proven to exist using a backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) approach for a BSDE system with a quadratic structure that decouples. We analyze the effects of a universal basic income policy on labor market participation, the stock market, and welfare. While universal basic income policies affect labor market participation and welfare monotonically, its effects on the stock market are nontrivial and nonmonotone.</description>

      <title>A Three--Dimensional Efficient Surface for Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical mean-variance framework characterizes portfolio risk solely through return variance and the covariance matrix, implicitly assuming that all relevant sources of risk are captured by second moments. In modern financial markets, however, shocks often propagate through complex networks of interconnections, giving rise to systemic and spillover risks that variance alone does not reflect.
  This paper develops a unified portfolio optimization framework that incorporates connectedness risk alongside expected return and variance. Using a quadratic measure of network spillovers derived from a connectedness matrix, we formulate a three-objective optimization problem and characterize the resulting three-dimensional efficient surface. We establish existence, uniqueness, and continuity of optimal portfolios under mild regularity conditions and derive closed-form solutions when short-selling is allowed. The trade-off between variance and connectedness is shown to be strictly monotone except in degenerate cases, yielding a well-defined risk-risk frontier.
  Under simultaneous diagonalizability of the covariance and connectedness matrices, we prove a three-fund separation theorem: all efficient portfolios can be expressed as affine combinations of a minimum-variance portfolio, a minimum-connectedness portfolio, and the tangency portfolio. The framework clarifies how network-based risk alters classical diversification results and provides a transparent theoretical foundation for incorporating systemic connectedness into portfolio choice.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Factor Models: Generating High-Dimensional Returns with Factor Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06566v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial scenario simulation is essential for risk management and portfolio optimization, yet it remains challenging especially in high-dimensional and small data settings common in finance. We propose a diffusion factor model that integrates latent factor structure into generative diffusion processes, bridging econometrics with modern generative AI to address the challenges of the curse of dimensionality and data scarcity in financial simulation. By exploiting the low-dimensional factor structure inherent in asset returns, we decompose the score function--a key component in diffusion models--using time-varying orthogonal projections, and this decomposition is incorporated into the design of neural network architectures. We derive rigorous statistical guarantees, establishing nonasymptotic error bounds for both score estimation at O(d^{5/2} n^{-2/(k+5)}) and generated distribution at O(d^{5/4} n^{-1/2(k+5)}), primarily driven by the intrinsic factor dimension k rather than the number of assets d, surpassing the dimension-dependent limits in the classical nonparametric statistics literature and making the framework viable for markets with thousands of assets. Numerical studies confirm superior performance in latent subspace recovery under small data regimes. Empirical analysis demonstrates the economic significance of our framework in constructing mean-variance optimal portfolios and factor portfolios. This work presents the first theoretical integration of factor structure with diffusion models, offering a principled approach for high-dimensional financial simulation with limited data. Our code is available at https://github.com/xymmmm00/diffusion_factor_model.</description>
