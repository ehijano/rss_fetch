      <title>Multi-Sensor Fusion for Extended Object Tracking Exploiting Active and Passive Radio Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable and robust positioning of radio devices remains a challenging task due to multipath propagation, hardware impairments, and interference from other radio transmitters. A frequently overlooked but critical factor is the agent itself, e.g., the user carrying the device, which potentially obstructs line-of-sight (LOS) links to the base stations (anchors). This paper addresses the problem of accurate positioning in scenarios where LOS links are partially blocked by the agent. The agent is modeled as an extended object (EO) that scatters, attenuates, and blocks radio signals. We propose a Bayesian method that fuses ``active'' measurements (between device and anchors) with ``passive'' multistatic radar-type measurements (between anchors, reflected by the EO). To handle measurement origin uncertainty, we introduce an multi-sensor and multiple-measurement probabilistic data association (PDA) algorithm that jointly fuses all EO-related measurements. Furthermore, we develop an EO model tailored to agents such as human users, accounting for multiple reflections scattered off the body surface, and propose a simplified variant for low-complexity implementation. Evaluation on both synthetic and real radio measurements demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional PDA methods based on point target assumptions, particularly during and after obstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) conditions.</description>

      <title>Sensor placement for sparse force reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study proposes a Gram-matrix-based sensor placement strategy for sparse force reconstruction in the frequency domain. A modal decomposition of the Gram matrix reveals that its structure is dominated by a few modes near the target frequency, and that each modal contribution reflects the spatial correlation of the corresponding mode shape. This suggests that placing sensors near nodal regions where spatial correlation is low can reduce coherence in the frequency response function (FRF) matrix and improve force reconstruction accuracy. To translate the physical insight into a practical design framework, a greedy algorithm is proposed to select sensor locations that minimize the off-diagonal energy of the Gram matrix. Numerical simulations and experimental validations demonstrate that the proposed method yields robust and accurate force estimation, outperforming heuristic sensor layouts.</description>

      <title>A Low-Cost Open-Source BLE-Based Asian Hornet Tracking System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) poses a serious threat to ecosystems and beekeeping. Locating nests is essential, but usually involves time-consuming manual triangulation. We present a low-cost, open-source tracking system based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The system consists of a lightweight BLE tag and a software-defined radio (SDR) receiver implemented in GNU Radio. By bypassing the BLE stack, we embed a custom pseudo-noise (PN) sequence in the uncoded PHY for correlation-based detection. Using a Yagi antenna and PlutoSDR, the receiver performs digital beam sweeping to determine the tag's direction. Field tests show reliable angular resolution at 50m and a communication range up to 360m. While our modulation increases receiver complexity, it enables future improvements such as multichannel spreading and tag identification. The design is fully open-source and provides a scalable framework for hornet tracking and related applications in environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Approximate Message Passing for Multi-Preamble Detection in OTFS Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses the problem of multiple preamble detection in random access systems based on orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) signaling. This challenge is formulated as a structured sparse recovery problem in the complex domain. To tackle it, the authors propose a new approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm that enforces double sparsity: the sparse selection of preambles and the inherent sparsity of OTFS signals in the delay-Doppler domain. From an algorithmic standpoint, the non-separable complex sparsity constraint necessitates a careful derivation and leads to the design of a novel AMP denoiser. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves robust detection performance and delivers significant gains over state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Joint Frequency-Space Sparse Reconstruction for DOA Estimation under Coherent Sources and Amplitude-Phase Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a joint frequency-space sparse reconstruction method for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, which effectively addresses the issues arising from the existence of coherent sources and array amplitude-phase errors. Specifically, by using an auxiliary source with known angles, we first construct the real steering vectors (RSVs) based on the spectral peaks of received signals in the frequency domain, which serve as a complete basis matrix for compensation for amplitude-phase errors. Then, we leverage the spectral sparsity of snapshot data in the frequency domain and the spatial sparsity of incident directions to perform the DOA estimation according to the sparse reconstruction method. The proposed method does not require iterative optimization, hence exhibiting low computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DOA estimation method achieves higher estimation accuracy for coherent sources as compared to various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Robust MIMO Semantic Communication with Imperfect CSI via Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemComm) has emerged as a new communication paradigm. To enhance efficiency, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology has been further integrated into SemComm systems. However, existing MIMO SemComm systems assume perfect channel matrix estimation for channel-adaptive joint source-channel coding, which is impractical due to hardware and pilot overhead constraints. In this paper, we propose a semantic image transmission system with channel matrix and channel noise adaptation, named HANA-JSCC, to cope with channel estimation errors in MIMO systems. We propose a channel matrix adaptor that collaborates with the channel codec to adapt to misaligned channel state information, thereby mitigating the impact of estimation errors. Since the relationship between the estimated channel matrix and true channel matrix is ill-posed (one-to-many), we further introduce a two-stage training strategy with knowledge distillation to overcome the convergence difficulties caused by the ill-posed problem. Comparing with the state-of-the-art benchmarks, HANA-JSCC achieves $0.40\sim0.54$dB higher average performance across various noise and estimation error levels in various datasets.</description>

      <title>Constellation Shaping for OFDM-ISAC Systems: From Theoretical Bounds to Practical Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) promises new use cases for mobile communication systems by reusing the communication signal for radar-like sensing. However, sensing and communications (S&amp;C) impose conflicting requirements on the modulation format, resulting in a tradeoff between their corresponding performance. This paper investigates constellation shaping as a means to simultaneously improve S&amp;C performance in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC systems. We begin by deriving how the transmit symbols affect detection performance and derive theoretical lower and upper bounds on the maximum achievable information rate under a given sensing constraint. Using an autoencoder-based optimization, we investigate geometric, probabilistic, and joint constellation shaping, where joint shaping combines both approaches, employing both optimal maximum a-posteriori decoding and practical bit-metric decoding. Our results show that constellation shaping enables a flexible trade-off between S&amp;C, can approach the derived upper bound, and significantly outperforms conventional modulation formats. Motivated by its practical implementation feasibility, we review probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) and propose a generalization tailored to ISAC. For this generalization, we propose a low-complexity log-likelihood ratio computation with negligible rate loss. We demonstrate that combining conventional and generalized PAS enables a flexible and low-complexity tradeoff between S&amp;C, closely approaching the performance of joint constellation shaping.</description>

      <title>Reliable Clutter Suppression for Slow-Moving Weak Target Radar Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable slow-moving weak target detection in complicated environments is challenging due to the masking effects from the surrounding strong reflectors. The traditional Moving Target Indication (MTI) may suppress the echoes from not only the static interference objects (IOs), but also the desired slow-moving weak target. According to the low-rank and sparse properties of the range-velocity maps across different radar scans, a novel clutter suppression scheme based on the Go decomposition (Godec) framework is proposed in this paper. The simulation results show that with the existence of masking effects, the target detection scheme based on Godec clutter suppression can reliably detect the slow-moving weak target, compared to the traditional MTI-based scheme. Besides, the time consumption comparison is conducted, demonstrating that the proposed solution is one that sacrifices time complexity in exchange for enhanced reliability. Additionally, the tradeoffs among the number of false alarm cells, the detection probability and the iteration times for convergence have been revealed, guiding parameter settings of the proposed solution in practical applications. Experiment validation is also conducted to verify the proposed solution, providing further insight into the scenarios where the solution is most applicable.</description>

      <title>Relative Localization of UAV Swarms in GNSS-Denied Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative localization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) denied environments is essential for emergency rescue and battlefield reconnaissance. Existing methods suffer from significant localization errors among UAVs due to packet loss and high computational complexity in large swarms. This paper proposes a clustering-based framework where the UAVs simultaneously use communication signals for channel estimation and ranging. Firstly, the spectral clustering is utilized to divide the UAV swarm into different sub-clusters, where matrix completion and multidimensional scaling yield high-precision relative coordinates. Subsequently, a global map is created by the inter-cluster anchor fusion. A case study of UAV integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) system is presented, where the Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) is adopted for ranging and communication. Experimental results show that the proposed method reduces localization errors in large swarms and loss of range information. It also explores the impact of signal parameters on communication and localization, highlighting the interplay between communication and localization performance.</description>

      <title>BiND: A Neural Discriminator-Decoder for Accurate Bimanual Trajectory Prediction in Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding bimanual hand movements from intracortical recordings remains a critical challenge for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), due to overlapping neural representations and nonlinear interlimb interactions. We introduce BiND (Bimanual Neural Discriminator-Decoder), a two-stage model that first classifies motion type (unimanual left, unimanual right, or bimanual) and then uses specialized GRU-based decoders, augmented with a trial-relative time index, to predict continuous 2D hand velocities. We benchmark BiND against six state-of-the-art models (SVR, XGBoost, FNN, CNN, Transformer, GRU) on a publicly available 13-session intracortical dataset from a tetraplegic patient. BiND achieves a mean $R^2$ of 0.76 ($\pm$0.01) for unimanual and 0.69 ($\pm$0.03) for bimanual trajectory prediction, surpassing the next-best model (GRU) by 2% in both tasks. It also demonstrates greater robustness to session variability than all other benchmarked models, with accuracy improvements of up to 4% compared to GRU in cross-session analyses. This highlights the effectiveness of task-aware discrimination and temporal modeling in enhancing bimanual decoding.</description>

      <title>Sparse Autoencoder Neural Operators: Model Recovery in Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to similar representations across architectures, the representational properties of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs, lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery, improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.</description>

      <title>Spiking Neural Network Decoders of Finger Forces from High-Density Intramuscular Microelectrode Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Restoring naturalistic finger control in assistive technologies requires the continuous decoding of motor intent with high accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Here, we present a spike-based decoding framework that integrates spiking neural networks (SNNs) with motor unit activity extracted from high-density intramuscular microelectrode arrays. We demonstrate simultaneous and proportional decoding of individual finger forces from motor unit spike trains during isometric contractions at 15% of maximum voluntary contraction using SNNs. We systematically evaluated alternative SNN decoder configurations and compared two possible input modalities: physiologically grounded motor unit spike trains and spike-encoded intramuscular EMG signals. Through this comparison, we quantified trade-offs between decoding accuracy, memory footprint, and robustness to input errors. The results showed that shallow SNNs can reliably decode finger-level motor intent with competitive accuracy and minimal latency, while operating with reduced memory requirements and without the need for external preprocessing buffers. This work provides a practical blueprint for integrating SNNs into finger-level force decoding systems, demonstrating how the choice of input representation can be strategically tailored to meet application-specific requirements for accuracy, robustness, and memory efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This brief, aimed at practitioners, offers an analysis of the effect of sampling-time jitter, i. e., the error produced by execution-time inaccuracies. We propose reinterpreting jitter-afflicted linear time-invariant systems through equivalent jitter-free analogs. By constructing a perceived system that absorbs the effects of timing perturbations into its dynamics, we find an affine scaling of jitter. We examine both measurement and implementation scenarios, demonstrating that the presence of jitter effectively scales the system matrices. Moreover, we observe that, in the Laplace domain, jitter can be interpreted as a frequency scaling.</description>

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of accurate positioning in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) environments, with a focus on indoor public safety scenarios where NLoS bias severely impacts localization performance. We explore Diffraction MultiPath Components (MPC) as a critical mechanism for Outdoor-to-Indoor (O2I) signal propagation and its role in positioning. The proposed system comprises outdoor Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) transmitters and indoor receivers that require localization. To facilitate diffraction-based positioning, we develop a method to isolate diffraction MPCs at indoor receivers and validate its effectiveness using a ray-tracing-generated dataset, which we have made publicly available. Our evaluation across the FR1, FR2, and FR3 frequency bands within the 5G/6G spectrum confirms the viability of diffraction-based positioning techniques for next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Physical-Layer Authentication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven Physical-Layer Authentication (PLA), which focuses on achieving endogenous security and intelligent identity authentication, has attracted considerable interest. When compared with Discriminative AI (DAI), Generative AI (GAI) offers several advantages, such as fingerprint data augmentation, fingerprint denoising and reconstruction, and protection against adversarial attacks. Inspired by these innovations, this paper provides a systematic exploration of GAI's integration into PLA frameworks. We commence with a review of representative authentication techniques, emphasizing PLA's inherent strengths. Following this, we revisit four typical GAI models and contrast the limitations of DAI with the potential of GAI in addressing PLA challenges, including insufficient fingerprint data, environment noises and inferences, perturbations in fingerprint data, and complex tasks. Specifically, we delve into providing GAI-enhanced methods for PLA across the fingerprint collection, model training, and performance optimization phases in detail. Moreover, we present a case study that combines fingerprint extrapolation and Generative Diffusion Model (GDM) to illustrate the superiority of GAI in bolstering the reliability of PLA. Additionally, we outline potential future research directions for GAI-based PLA.</description>

      <title>Doubly-Dispersive Continuous MIMO Systems: Channel Modeling and Beamforming Design</title>

Abstract: We address the modeling and optimal beamforming (BF) design for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems operating over doubly-dispersive (DD) channels. First, a comprehensive DD continuous MIMO (DDC MIMO) channel model that incorporates CAPAs at both the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) is derived, which is used to obtain explicit input-output (I/O) relations for various waveforms well suited to integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) and robust to DD channels, namely orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). Then, functional optimization problems are formulated for the design of TX and RX BF matrices that maximize received power, in which novel low-complexity, closed-form solutions are obtained via the calculus of variations (CoV) method, yielding expressions closely related to the classical matched filter commonly used in conventional MIMO systems. Simulation results confirm that the proposed TX/RX BF designs with CAPAs provide significant performance and computational complexity gains over conventional MIMO systems in DD channels.</description>

      <title>Affine-Doppler Division Multiplexing for High-Mobility Wireless Communications Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) has been regarded as a candidate integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) waveform owing to its superior communication performance, outperforming the Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space (OTFS) that has been researched for a longer time. However, since the above two waveforms are incompatible with each other, the state-of-the-art methods well-designed for OTFS may not be directly applicable to AFDM. This paper introduces a new orthogonal multicarrier waveform, namely Affine-Doppler Division Multiplexing (ADDM), which can provide a generic framework and subsume the existing OTFS and AFDM as a particular case. ADDM modulating information symbols in the Affine-Doppler (A-D) domain based on a two-dimensional (2D) transform can enjoy both excellent unambiguous Doppler and Doppler resolution, which is the same as AFDM but outperforms OTFS. Moreover, benefiting from the 2D transform, the symbols block of ADDM in the A-D domain undergoes a 2D cyclic shift produced by the delay and the Doppler of the channel, similar to the 2D cyclic shift in the delay-Doppler domain of cyclic prefix (CP)-OTFS. This offers a potential to directly apply the state-of-the-art methods well-designed for OTFS and AFDM to ADDM. Numerical results show that ADDM achieves comparable BER performance with AFDM but outperforms OTFS in high-mobility scenarios.</description>

      <title>Breaking the TDD Flow for Over-the-Air Phase Synchronization in Distributed Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase synchronization between distributed antenna arrays requires measurements that break the standard time-division duplex (TDD) operation. We present a feasibility study on implementing such synchronization and analyze its impact on the quality of service. Considering two antenna arrays with independent local oscillators (LOs), we propose a modified TDD flow to accommodate the transmission of phase synchronization signals, formulate the phase estimation and compensation problem, and derive the achievable downlink spectral efficiency (SE). Numerical results show that frequent re-estimation of the interarray phase disparity is essential for maximizing SE in systems with low-quality LOs. Furthermore, applying a Kalman filter for phase tracking substantially improves the SE, especially if phase estimation errors are large compared to LOs phase drifts.</description>

      <title>MultiGen: Child-Friendly Multilingual Speech Generator with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative speech models have demonstrated significant potential in improving human-machine interactions, offering valuable real-world applications such as language learning for children. However, achieving high-quality, child-friendly speech generation remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages across diverse languages and cultural contexts. In this paper, we propose MultiGen, a multilingual speech generation model with child-friendly interaction, leveraging LLM architecture for speech generation tailored for low-resource languages. We propose to integrate age-appropriate multilingual speech generation using LLM architectures, which can be used to facilitate young children's communication with AI systems through culturally relevant context in three low-resource languages: Singaporean accent Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. Experimental results from both objective metrics and subjective evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MultiGen compared to baseline methods.</description>
