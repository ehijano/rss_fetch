      <title>Compound Mutations in the Abl1 Kinase Cause Inhibitor Resistance by Shifting DFG Flip Mechanisms and Relative State Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of most proteins are central to their function. Protein tyrosine kinases such as Abl1 undergo significant conformational changes that modulate their activity in response to different stimuli. These conformational changes constitute a conserved mechanism for self-regulation that dramatically impacts kinases' affinities for inhibitors. Few studies have attempted to extensively sample the pathways and elucidate the mechanisms that underlie kinase inactivation. Seeking to bridge this knowledge gap, we present a thorough analysis of the ``DFG flip'' inactivation pathway in Abl1 kinase. By leveraging the power of the Weighted Ensemble methodology, which accelerates sampling without the use of biasing forces, we have comprehensively simulated DFG flip events in Abl1 and its inhibitor-resistant variants, revealing a rugged landscape punctuated by potentially druggable intermediate states. Through our strategy, we successfully simulated dozens of uncorrelated DFG flip events distributed along two principal pathways, identified the molecular mechanisms that govern them, and measured their relative probabilities. Further, we show that the compound Glu255Lys/Val Thr315Ile Abl1 variants owe their inhibitor resistance phenotype to an increase in the free energy barrier associated with completing the DFG flip. This barrier stabilizes Abl1 variants in conformations that can lead to loss of binding for Type-II inhibitors such as Imatinib or Ponatinib. Finally, we contrast our Abl1 observations with the relative state distributions and propensity for undergoing a DFG flip of evolutionarily-related protein tyrosine kinases with diverging Type-II inhibitor binding affinities. Altogether, we expect that our work will be of significant importance for protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor discovery.</description>

      <title>Rapid Sensing of Heat Stress using Machine Learning of Micrographs of Red Blood Cells Dispersed in Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An imbalance between bodily heat production and heat dissipation leads to heat stress in organisms. In addition to diminished animal well-being, heat stress is detrimental to the poultry industry as poultry entails fast growth and high yield, resulting in greater metabolic activity and higher body heat production. When stressed, cells overexpress heat shock proteins (such as HSP70, a well-established intracellular stress indicator) and may undergo changes in their mechanical properties. Liquid crystals (LCs, fluids with orientational order) have been recently employed to rapidly characterize changes in mechanical properties of cells enabling a means of optically reporting the presence of disease in organisms. In this work, we explore the difference in the expression of HSP70 to a change in the LC response pattern via the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The machine-learning (ML) models were trained on hundreds of such LC-response micrographs of chicken red blood cells with and without heat stress. Trained models exhibited remarkable accuracy of up to 99% on detecting the presence of heat stress in unseen microscope samples. We also show that crosslinking the chicken and human RBCs using glutaraldehyde in order to simulate a diseased cell was an efficient strategy for planning, building, training, and evaluating ML models. Overall, our efforts build towards the rapid detection of disease in organisms, which is accompanied by a distinct change in the mechanical properties of cells. We aim to eventuate CNN-enabled LC-sensors can rapidly report the presence of disease in scenarios where human judgment could be prohibitively difficult or slow.</description>

      <title>Maximum Caliber Infers Effective Coupling and Response from Spiking Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characterization of network and biophysical properties from neural spiking activity is an important goal in neuroscience. A framework that provides unbiased inference on causal synaptic interaction and single neural properties has been missing. Here we applied the stochastic dynamics extension of Maximum Entropy -- the Maximum Caliber Principle -- to infer the transition rates of network states. Effective synaptic coupling strength and neuronal response functions for various network motifs can then be computed. The inferred minimal model also enables leading-order reconstruction of inter-spike interval distribution. Our method is tested with numerical simulated spiking networks and applied to data from salamander retina.</description>

      <title>Differential geometry, a possible avenue for thermal ablation in oncology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a model for hyperthermia therapies based on heat diffusion in a biological tissue containing a topological defect. Biological tissues behave like active liquid crystals with the presence of topological defects which are likely to anchor tumors during the metastatic phase of cancer evolution and the therapy challenge is to destroy the cancer cells without damaging surrounding healthy tissues. The defect creates an effective non-Euclidean geometry for low-energy excitations, modifying the bio-heat equation. Applications to protocols of thermal ablation for various biological tissues (liver, prostate, and skin) is analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <title>The two-thirds power law derived from an higher-derivative action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-thirds power law is a link between angular speed $\omega$ and curvature $\kappa$ observed in voluntary human movements: $\omega$ is proportional to $\kappa^{2/3}$. Squared jerk is known to be a Lagrangian leading to the latter law. We propose that a broader class of higher-derivative Lagrangians leads to the two-thirds power law and we perform the Hamiltonian analysis leading to action-angle variables through Ostrogradski's procedure. In this framework, squared jerk appears as an action variable and its minimization may be related to power expenditure minimization during motion. The identified higher-derivative Lagrangians are therefore natural candidates for cost functions, i.e. movement functions that are targeted to be minimal when one individual performs a voluntary movement.</description>

      <title>A review of active matter reviews</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past years, the amount of research on active matter has grown extremely rapidly, a fact that is reflected in particular by the existence of more than 600 review articles on this topic. Moreover, the field has become very diverse, ranging from theoretical studies of the statistical mechanics of active particles to applied work on medical applications of microrobots and from biological systems to artificial swimmers. This makes it very difficult to get an overview over the field as a whole. Here, we provide such an overview in the form of a metareview article that surveys the existing review articles on active matter. Thereby, this article provides an introduction to the various subdisciplines of active matter science and constitutes a useful starting point for finding literature about a specific topic.</description>

      <title>Micro-mechanical response and power-law exponents from the longitudinal fluctuations of F-actin solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the local fluctuations of filamentous actin (F-actin), with focus on the skeletal thin filament, using single-particle optical trapping interferometry. This experimental technique allows us to detect the Brownian motion of a tracer bead immersed in a complex fluid with nanometric resolution at the microsecond time-scale. The mean square displacement, loss modulus, and velocity autocorrelation function (VAF) of the trapped microprobes in the fluid follow power-law behaviors, whose exponents can be determined in the short-time/high-frequency regime along several decades. We obtain 7/8 subdiffusive power-law exponents for polystyrene depleted microtracers at low optical trapping forces. Microrheologically, the elastic modulus of these suspensions is observed to be constant up to the limit of high frequencies, confirming the origin of this subdiffusive exponent on the local longitudinal fluctuations of the polymers. Deviations from this value are measured and discussed in relation to the characteristic lengths scales of these F-actin networks and probes' properties, and also in connection with the different power-law exponents detected in the VAFs. Finally, we observe that the thin filament, composed by tropomyosin (Tm) and troponin (Tn) coupled to F-actin in the presence of Ca$^{2+}$, returns exponent values less dispersed than F-actin alone, which we interpret as a micro-measurement of the filament stabilization.</description>

      <title>Noise robustness and metabolic load determine the principles of central dogma regulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The processes of gene expression are inherently stochastic, even for essential genes required for growth. How does the cell maximize fitness in light of noise? To answer this question, we build a mathematical model to explore the trade-off between metabolic load and growth robustness. The model predicts novel principles of central dogma regulation: Optimal protein expression levels for many genes are in vast overabundance. Essential genes are transcribed above a lower limit of one message per cell cycle. Gene expression is achieved by load balancing between transcription and translation. We present evidence that each of these novel regulatory principles is observed. These results reveal that robustness and metabolic load determine the global regulatory principles that govern central dogma function, and these principles have broad implications for cellular function.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocity permits edge states and strong localization in stochastic topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological phases exhibit edge responses that are robust against deformations and defects. Such phases have recently been realized in stochastic systems, which model a large class of biological and chemical phenomena. However, general theoretical principles are lacking for these systems, such as the relation between the bulk topological invariant and observed edge responses, i.e. the celebrated bulk-edge correspondence. We show that contrary to established topological phases, stochastic systems require non-reciprocal (or non-Hermitian) transitions to have edge responses, which holds across all dimensions and geometries. For both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states, we demonstrate that stochastic edge responses grow dramatically with non-reciprocity while the quantum version plateaus. Having established the necessity and importance of non-reciprocity for stochastic edge states, we point out fundamental theoretical and physical consequences of this result. Lastly, we present a novel mechanism by which non-reciprocity engenders robust edge currents in stochastic systems. Our work establishes the crucial role of non-reciprocal interactions in permitting robust responses in active and living matter.</description>

      <title>How do correlations shape the landscape of information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a few common models on how correlations affect information. The main model considered is the Shannon mutual information $I(S:R_1,\cdots, R_i)$ over distributions with marginals $P_{S,R_i}$ fixed for each $i$, with the analogy in which $S$ is the stimulus and $R_i$'s are neurons. We work out basic models in details, using algebro-geometric tools to write down discriminants that separate distributions with distinct qualitative behaviours in the probability simplex into toric chambers and evaluate the volumes of them algebraically. As a byproduct, we provide direct translation between a decomposition of mutual information inspired by a series expansion and one from partial information decomposition (PID) problems, characterising the synergistic terms of the former. We hope this paper serves for communication between communities especially mathematics and theoretical neuroscience on the topic.

      <title>Waves, patterns and bifurcations: a tutorial review on the vertebrate segmentation clock</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proper vertebrae formation relies on a tissue-wide oscillator called the segmentation clock. Individual cellular oscillators in the presomitic mesoderm are modulated by intercellular coupling and external signals, leading to the propagation of oscillatory waves of genetic expression eventually stabilizing into a static pattern. Here, we review 4 decades of biophysical models of this process, starting from the pioneering Clock and Wavefront model by Cooke and Zeeman, and the reaction-diffusion model by Meinhardt. We discuss how modern descriptions followed advances in molecular description and visualization of the process, reviewing phase models, delayed models, systems-level, and finally geometric models. We connect models to high-level aspects of embryonic development from embryonic scaling to wave propagation, up to reconstructed stem cell systems. We provide new analytical calculations and insights into classical and recent models, leading us to propose a geometric description of somitogenesis organized along two primary waves of differentiation.</description>

      <title>Furutsu-Novikov--like cross-correlation--response relations for systems driven by shot noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic system that is driven by an intensity-modulated Poisson process with intensity $\Lambda(t)=\lambda(t)+\varepsilon\nu(t)$. We derive an exact relation between the input-output cross-correlation in the spontaneous state ($\varepsilon=0$) and the linear response to the modulation ($\varepsilon&gt;0$). This can be regarded as a variant of the Furutsu-Novikov theorem for the case of shot noise. As we show, the relation is still valid in the presence of additional independent noise. Furthermore, we derive an extension to Cox-process input, i.e. to colored shot noise. We discuss applications to particle detection and to neuroscience. Using the new relation, we obtain a fluctuation-response-relation for a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron. We also show how the new relation can be used in a remote control problem in a recurrent neural network. The relations are numerically tested for both stationary and non-stationary dynamics. Lastly, extensions to marked Poisson processes and to higher-order statistics are presented.</description>
