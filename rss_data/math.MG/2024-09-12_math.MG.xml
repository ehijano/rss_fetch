      <title>On reduced spherical bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis consists of five papers about reduced spherical convex bodies and in particular spherical bodies of constant width on the $d$-dimensional sphere $S^d$. In paper I we present some facts describing the shape of reduced bodies of thickness under $\frac{\pi}{2}$ on $S^2$. We also consider reduced bodies of thickness at least $\frac{\pi}{2}$, which appear to be of constant width. Paper II focuses on bodies of constant width on $S^d$. We present the properties of these bodies and in particular we discuss conections between notions of constant width and of constant diameter. In paper III we estimate the diameter of a reduced convex body. The main theme of paper IV is estimating the radius of the smallest disk that covers a reduced convex body on $S^2$. The result of paper V is showing that every spherical reduced polygon $V$ is contained in a disk of radius equal to the thickness of this body centered at a boundary point of $V$.</description>

      <title>Compactness of Sequences of Warped Product Length Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If we consider a sequence of warped product length spaces, what conditions on the sequence of warping functions implies compactness of the sequence of distance functions? In particular, we want to know when a subsequence converges to a well defined metric space on the same manifold with the same topology. What conditions on the sequence of warping functions implies Lipschitz bounds for the sequence of distance functions and/or the limiting distance function? In this paper we give answers to both of these questions as well as many examples which elucidate the theorems and show that our hypotheses are necessary.</description>

      <title>Variations on a theme of empty polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, an empty polytope has vertices in $S$ but contains no other point of $S$. Empty polytopes are closely related to so-called Helly numbers, which extend Helly's theorem to more general point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We improve bounds on the number of vertices in empty polytopes in exponential lattices, arithmetic congruence sets, and 2-syndetic sets.
  We also study hollow polytopes, which have vertices in $S$ and no points of $S$ in their interior. We obtain bounds on the number of vertices in hollow polytopes under certain conditions, such as the vertices being in general position.
  Finally, we obtain relatively tight asymptotic bounds for polytopes which do not contain lattice segments of large length.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet metric measure spaces: spectrum, irreducibility, and small deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of irreducible ultracontractive Dirichlet metric measure spaces, we demonstrate the discreteness of the Laplacian spectrum and the corresponding diffusion's irreducibility in connected open sets, without assuming regularity of the boundary. This general result can be applied to study various questions, including those related to small deviations of the diffusion and generalized heat content. Our examples include Riemannian and sub-Riemannian manifolds, as well as non-smooth and fractal spaces.</description>

      <title>Comparison Results for Gromov-Wasserstein and Gromov-Monge Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kantorovich formulation of optimal transport distance between probability measures on a metric space, Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distances comprise a family of metrics on the space of isomorphism classes of metric measure spaces. In previous work, the authors introduced a variant of this construction which was inspired by the original Monge formulation of optimal transport; elements of the resulting family are referred to Gromov-Monge (GM) distances. These GM distances, and related ideas, have since become a subject of interest from both theoretical and applications-oriented perspectives. In this note, we establish several theoretical properties of GM distances, focusing on comparisons between GM and GW distances. In particular, we show that GM and GW distances are equal for non-atomic metric measure spaces. We also consider variants of GM distance, such as a Monge version of Sturm's $L_p$-transportion distance, and give precise comparisons to GW distance. Finally, we establish bi-H\"{o}lder equivalence between GM distance and an isometry-invariant Monge optimal transport distance between Euclidean metric measure spaces that has been utilized in shape and image analysis applications.</description>

      <title>Partial reflections and globally linked pairs in rigid graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $d$-dimensional framework is a pair $(G,p)$, where $G$ is a graph and $p$ maps the vertices of $G$ to points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The edges of $G$ are mapped to the corresponding line segments. A graph $G$ is said to be globally rigid in $\mathbb{R}^d$ if every generic $d$-dimensional framework $(G,p)$ is determined, up to congruence, by its edge lengths. A finer property is global linkedness: we say that a vertex pair $\{u,v\}$ of $G$ is globally linked in $G$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ if in every generic $d$-dimensional framework $(G,p)$ the distance of $u$ and $v$ is uniquely determined by the edge lengths.
  In this paper we investigate globally linked pairs in graphs in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We give several characterizations of those rigid graphs $G$ in which a pair $\{u,v\}$ is globally linked if and only if there exist $d+1$ internally disjoint paths from $u$ to $v$ in $G$. We call these graphs $d$-joined. Among others, we show that $G$ is $d$-joined if and only if for each pair of generic frameworks of $G$ with the same edge lengths, one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of partial reflections along hyperplanes determined by $d$-separators of $G$. We also show that the family of $d$-joined graphs is closed under edge addition, as well as under gluing along $d$ or more vertices. As a key ingredient to our main results, we prove that rigid graphs in $\mathbb{R}^d$ contain no crossing $d$-separators.
  Our results give rise to new families of graphs for which global linkedness (and global rigidity) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be tested in polynomial time.</description>
