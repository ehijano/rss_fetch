      <title>Generalized Pinching-Antenna Systems: A Tutorial on Principles, Design Strategies, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems have emerged as a novel and transformative flexible-antenna architecture for next-generation wireless networks. They offer unprecedented flexibility and spatial reconfigurability by enabling dynamic positioning and activation of radiating elements along a signal-guiding medium (e.g., dielectric waveguides), which is not possible with conventional fixed antenna systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of generalized pinching antenna systems, which retain the core principle of creating localized radiation points on demand, but can be physically realized in a variety of settings. These include implementations based on dielectric waveguides, leaky coaxial cables, surface-wave guiding structures, and other types of media, employing different feeding methods and activation mechanisms (e.g., mechanical, electronic, or hybrid). Despite differences in their physical realizations, they all share the same inherent ability to form, reposition, or deactivate radiation sites as needed, enabling user-centric and dynamic coverage. We first describe the underlying physical mechanisms of representative generalized pinching-antenna realizations and their associated wireless channel models, highlighting their unique propagation and reconfigurability characteristics compared with conventional antennas. Then, we review several representative pinching-antenna system architectures, ranging from single- to multiple-waveguide configurations, and discuss advanced design strategies tailored to these flexible deployments. Furthermore, we examine their integration with emerging wireless technologies to enable synergistic, user-centric solutions. Finally, we identify key open research challenges and outline future directions, charting a pathway toward the practical deployment of generalized pinching antennas in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Integrated Massive Communication and Target Localization in 6G Cell-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an initial investigation into the combination of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and massive communication, both of which are largely regarded as key scenarios in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Specifically, we consider a cell-free network comprising a large number of users, multiple targets, and distributed base stations (BSs). In each time slot, a random subset of users becomes active, transmitting pilot signals that can be scattered by the targets before reaching the BSs. Unlike conventional massive random access schemes, where the primary objectives are device activity detection and channel estimation, our framework also enables target localization by leveraging the multipath propagation effects introduced by the targets. However, due to the intricate dependency between user channels and target locations, characterizing the posterior distribution required for minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation presents significant computational challenges. To handle this problem, we propose a hybrid message passing-based framework that incorporates multiple approximations to mitigate computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high-accuracy device activity detection, channel estimation, and target localization simultaneously, validating the feasibility of embedding localization functionality into massive communication systems for future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication: Towards Multifunctional Perceptive Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capacity-maximization design philosophy has driven the growth of wireless networks for decades. However, with the slowdown in recent data traffic demand, the mobile industry can no longer rely solely on communication services to sustain development. In response, Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) has emerged as a transformative solution, embedding sensing capabilities into communication networks to enable multifunctional wireless systems. This paradigm shift expands the role of networks from sole data transmission to versatile platforms supporting diverse applications. In this review, we provide a bird's-eye view of ISAC for new researchers, highlighting key challenges, opportunities, and application scenarios to guide future exploration in this field.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the error rate performance and low-complexity receiver design for zero-padded affine frequency division multiplexing (ZP-AFDM) systems. By exploiting the unique ZP-aided lower triangular structure of the time domain (TD) channel matrix, we propose {a novel low-complexity} minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector and {a} maximum ratio combining-based TD (MRC-TD) detector. Furthermore, the theoretical bit error rate (BER) {performance} of both MMSE and maximum likelihood detectors {is} analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate {that} the proposed detectors can achieve identical BER performance to that of {the conventional MMSE detector based on matrix inversion} while {enjoying significantly reduced complexity.}</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication with Tri-Hybrid Beamforming Across Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beamforming with a sufficient number of antennas is one of the most significant technologies for both Multi-user (MU) Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO) communication and MIMO radar sensing in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems. However, its performance suffers from limited Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) in conventional hybrid beamforming systems. To overcome this, we propose an Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Antenna (ERA)-aided ISAC system, where transmit ERAs dynamically adjust their radiation patterns to enhance system DoFs and improve overall performance. Specifically, we design a tri-hybrid beamforming optimization framework combining digital, analog, and Electromagnetic (EM) beamforming to jointly maximize communication rate and sensing Signal-to-Clutter-plus-Noise Ratio (SCNR). Furthermore, an integrated Fractional Programming (FP) and Manifold Optimization (MO) approach is developed to transform the problem into tractable subproblems with closed-form updates. Simulation results verify that the proposed ERA-ISAC system achieves almost 10 dB Sensing and Communication (S&amp;C) performance gain compared to its conventional hybrid beamforming counterparts with Omnidirectional Antenna (OA).</description>

      <title>Bridging Theory and Practice in Reconfigurable Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antennas, including those based on liquid, mechanical, and pixel-based technologies, are poised to significantly enhance next-generation wireless systems by adaptively optimizing their radiation characteristics. Many theoretical analyses assumed near-instant reconfiguration, perfect channel knowledge, static or slowly varying propagation environments, and ideal material properties that rarely hold in practice. In this article, we dissect these common assumptions and contrast them with the realities of finite actuation time, limited and imperfect channel state information, rapidly changing fading conditions, electromagnetic coupling, and mechanical constraints. Through illustrative examples and simulations, we demonstrate how ignoring these factors can lead to overestimated gains in capacity, coverage, etc.. We then propose modeling refinements, experimental validation methods, and emerging control algorithms that better account for real-world constraints. Our findings highlight that, while reconfigurable antennas remain highly promising for B5G/6G and Internet of things (IoT) applications, their full potential can only be realized by incorporating practical considerations into system design and performance evaluation.</description>

      <title>A Scalable MVDR Beamforming Algorithm That is Linear in the Number of Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamforming technique is widely applied in array systems to mitigate interference. However, applying MVDR to large arrays is computationally challenging; its computational complexity scales cubically with the number of antenna elements. In this paper, we introduce a scalable MVDR beamforming method tailored for massive arrays. Our approach, which is specific to scenarios where the signal of interest is below the noise floor (e.g.,~GPS), leverages the Sherman-Morrison formula, low-rank Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) approximations, and algebraic manipulation. Using our approach, we reduce the computational complexity from cubic to linear in the number of antennas. We evaluate the proposed method through simulations, comparing its computational efficiency and beamforming accuracy with the conventional MVDR approach. Our method significantly reduces the computational load while maintaining high beamforming accuracy for large-scale arrays. This solution holds promise for real-time applications of MVDR beamforming in fields like radar, sonar, and wireless communications, where massive antenna arrays are proliferating.</description>

      <title>Joint Channel and CFO Estimation From Beam-Swept Synchronization Signal Under Strong Inter-Cell Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complete awareness of the wireless environment, crucial for future intelligent networks, requires sensing all transmitted signals, not just the strongest. A fundamental barrier is estimating the target signal when it is buried under strong co-channel interference from other transmitters, a failure of which renders the signal unusable. This work proposes a maximum likelihood (ML)-based cross-preamble estimation framework that exploits carrier frequency offset (CFO) constancy across beam-swept synchronization signals (SS), coherently aggregating information across multiple observations to reinforce the desired signal against overwhelming interference. Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) analysis and simulation demonstrate reliable estimation even when the signal is over a thousand times weaker than the interference. A low-altitude radio-map case study further verifies the framework's practical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Decoding in the presence of ISI without interleaving ORBGRAND AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter symbol interference (ISI), which occurs in a wide variety of channels, is a result of time dispersion. It can be mitigated by equalization which results in noise coloring. For such colored noise, we propose a decoder called Ordered Reliability Bit Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (ORBGRANDAI) which is inspired by the development of approximate independence in statistical physics. By foregoing interleaving, ORBGRAND-AI can deliver the same, or lower, block error rate (BLER) for the same amount of energy per information bit in an ISI channel as a state-of-the-art soft input decoder, such as Cyclic Redundancy Check Assisted-Successive Cancellation List (CA-SCL) decoding, with an interleaver. To assess the decoding performance of ORBGRAND-AI, we consider delay tap models and their associated colored noise. In particular, we examine a two-tap dicode ISI channel as well as an ISI channel derived from data from RFView, a physics-informed modeling and simulation tool. We investigate the dicode and RFView channel under a variety of imperfect channel state information assumptions and show that a second order autoregressive model adequately represents the RFView channel effect.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed autoencoder for DSC-MRI Perfusion post-processing: application to glioma grading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DSC-MRI perfusion is a medical imaging technique for diagnosing and prognosing brain tumors and strokes. Its analysis relies on mathematical deconvolution, but noise or motion artifacts in a clinical environment can disrupt this process, leading to incorrect estimate of perfusion parameters. Although deep learning approaches have shown promising results, their calibration typically rely on third-party deconvolution algorithms to generate reference outputs and are bound to reproduce their limitations.
  To adress this problem, we propose a physics-informed autoencoder that leverages an analytical model to decode the perfusion parameters and guide the learning of the encoding network. This autoencoder is trained in a self-supervised fashion without any third-party software and its performance is evaluated on a database with glioma patients. Our method shows reliable results for glioma grading in accordance with other well-known deconvolution algorithms despite a lower computation time. It also achieved competitive performance even in the presence of high noise which is critical in a medical environment.</description>

      <title>Millimeter Wave Inverse Pinhole Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) radars are popular for perception in vision-denied contexts due to their compact size. This paper explores emerging use-cases that involve static mount or momentarily-static compact radars, for example, a hovering drone. The key challenge with static compact radars is that their limited form-factor also limits their angular resolution. This paper presents Umbra, a mmWave high resolution imaging system, that introduces the concept of rotating mmWave "inverse pinholes" for angular resolution enhancement. We present the imaging system model, design, and evaluation of mmWave inverse pinholes. The inverse pinhole is attractive for its lightweight nature, which enables low-power rotation, upgrading static-mount radars. We also show how propellers in aerial vehicles act as natural inverse pinholes and can enjoy the benefits of high-resolution imaging even while they are momentarily static, e.g., hovering. Our evaluation shows Umbra resolving up to 2.5$^{\circ}$ with just a single antenna, a 5$\times$ improvement compared to 14$^{\circ}$ from a compact mmWave radar baseline.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Non-Diffracting Beams for Resilient Near-Field Millimeter-Wave Communications A Quantitative Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non diffracting (ND) beams are often cited as a promising solution to mitigate blockage in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. However, a quantitative answer to the fundamental question, under what specific conditions do ND beams actually outperform conventional pencil beams, has remained elusive, especially in the emerging context of near-field communications. This paper provides the first systematic answer by mapping the performance advantage regimes of ND beams for blockage-resilient near-field links. We propose a unified holographic generator that synthesizes various structured beams (e.g., Bessel, Mathieu) under the physical constraints of a planar phased array, ensuring a fair comparison against a boresight baseline with identical EIRP and aperture. Through extensive, unbiased Monte Carlo simulations, we construct advantage regime maps that delineate the specific regions where ND beams offer a tangible link-level gain. Our key finding is that the advantage of ND beams is a powerful but conditional near field phenomenon. While offering a positive average gain, its performance is highly variable, with a 60-70% probability of outperforming the baseline in its optimal range. Crucially, this performance is strongly modulated by the obstacle's geometry, revealing a significant weakness against large blockers. These findings provide not just a practical roadmap for judiciously employing ND beams but also a clear motivation for future work in environment-aware, adaptively shaped structured beams.</description>

      <title>TRI-DEP: A Trimodal Comparative Study for Depression Detection Using Speech, Text, and EEG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust, reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG, speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.</description>

      <title>VERITAS: Verifying the Performance of AI-native Transceiver Actions in Base-Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native receivers prove significant performance improvement in high noise regimes and can potentially reduce communication overhead compared to the traditional receiver. However, their performance highly depends on the representativeness of the training dataset. A major issue is the uncertainty of whether the training dataset covers all test environments and waveform configurations, and thus, whether the trained model is robust in practical deployment conditions. To this end, we propose a joint measurement-recovery framework for AI-native transceivers post deployment, called VERITAS, that continuously looks for distribution shifts in the received signals and triggers finite re-training spurts. VERITAS monitors the wireless channel using 5G pilots fed to an auxiliary neural network that detects out-of-distribution channel profile, transmitter speed, and delay spread. As soon as such a change is detected, a traditional (reference) receiver is activated, which runs for a period of time in parallel to the AI-native receiver. Finally, VERTIAS compares the bit probabilities of the AI-native and the reference receivers for the same received data inputs, and decides whether or not a retraining process needs to be initiated. Our evaluations reveal that VERITAS can detect changes in the channel profile, transmitter speed, and delay spread with 99%, 97%, and 69% accuracies, respectively, followed by timely initiation of retraining for 86%, 93.3%, and 94.8% of inputs in channel profile, transmitter speed, and delay spread test sets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Fluid Antenna System for Wireless Communications: Design, Modeling, Algorithm, Fabrication, and Experiment</title>

Abstract: This paper presents the concept, design, channel modeling, beamforming algorithm development, prototype fabrication, and experimental measurement of an electromagnetically reconfigurable fluid antenna system (ER-FAS), in which each FAS array element features electromagnetic (EM) reconfigurability. Unlike most existing FAS works that investigate spatial reconfigurability by adjusting the position and/or orientation of array elements, the proposed ER-FAS enables direct control over the EM characteristics of each element, allowing for dynamic radiation pattern reconfigurability. Specifically, a novel ER-FAS architecture leveraging software-controlled fluidics is proposed, and corresponding wireless channel models are established. Based on this ER-FAS channel model, a low-complexity greedy beamforming algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the analog phase shift and the radiation state of each array element. The accuracy of the ER-FAS channel model and the effectiveness of the beamforming algorithm are validated through (i) full-wave EM simulations and (ii) numerical spectral efficiency evaluations. These results confirm that the proposed ER-FAS significantly enhances spectral efficiency in both near-field and far-field scenarios compared to conventional antenna arrays. To further validate this design, we fabricate prototypes for both the ER-FAS element and array, using Galinstan liquid metal alloy, fluid silver paste, and software-controlled fluidic channels. The simulation results are experimentally validated through prototype measurements conducted in an anechoic chamber. Additionally, several indoor communication experiments using a pair of software-defined radios demonstrate the superior received power and bit error rate performance of the ER-FAS prototype.</description>

      <title>EM-Based Channel Estimation for mMIMO LEO SATCOM Under Imperfect Doppler Compensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output low-Earth-orbit communication channels are highly time-varying due to severe Doppler shifts and propagation delays. While satellite-mobility-induced Doppler shifts can be compensated using known ephemeris data, those caused by user mobility require accurate user positioning information; the absence of such information contributes to amplified channel aging in conventional channel estimators. To address this challenge, we propose a data-aided channel estimator based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, combined with a discrete Legendre polynomial basis expansion model (DLP-BEM), to estimate the channel under imperfect Doppler compensation. The EM algorithm iteratively exploits hidden data symbols for improved channel estimation, while DLP-BEM regularizes the process by projecting the channel estimate onto a lower-dimensional subspace that mitigates estimation errors. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over existing methods in terms of normalized mean square error and symbol error rate.</description>

      <title>Attention-Aided MMSE for OFDM Channel Estimation: Learning Linear Filters with Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), accurate channel estimation is crucial. Classical signal processing based approaches, such as minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation, often require second-order statistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural networks based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often suffer from high inference complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE (A-MMSE), a novel model-based DNN framework that learns the optimal MMSE filter via the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE estimates the channel through a single linear operation for channel estimation, eliminating nonlinear activations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To enhance the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention encoder, designed to effectively capture the channel correlation structure. Additionally, a rank-adaptive extension of the proposed A-MMSE allows flexible trade-offs between complexity and channel estimation accuracy. Extensive simulations with 3GPP TDL channel models demonstrate that the proposed A-MMSE consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In particular, the A-MMSE and its rank-adaptive extension establish a new frontier in the performance-complexity trade-off, providing a powerful yet highly efficient solution for practical channel estimation</description>

      <title>SIM-Enabled Hybrid Digital-Wave Beamforming for Fronthaul-Constrained Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the dense deployment of access points (APs) in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems presents significant challenges, per-AP coverage can be expanded using large-scale antenna arrays (LAAs). However, this approach incurs high implementation costs and substantial fronthaul demands due to the need for dedicated RF chains for all antennas. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid beamforming framework that integrates wave-domain beamforming via stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) with conventional digital processing. By dynamically manipulating electromagnetic waves, SIM-equipped APs enhance beamforming gains while significantly reducing RF chain requirements. We formulate a joint optimization problem for digital and wave-domain beamforming along with fronthaul compression to maximize the weighted sum-rate for both uplink and downlink transmission under finite-capacity fronthaul constraints. Given the high dimensionality and non-convexity of the problem, we develop alternating optimization-based algorithms that iteratively optimize digital and wave-domain variables. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid schemes outperform conventional hybrid schemes, that rely on randomly set wave-domain beamformers or restrict digital beamforming to simple power control. Moreover, the proposed scheme employing sufficiently deep SIMs achieves near fully-digital performance with fewer RF chains in the high signal-to-noise ratios regime.</description>

      <title>Model-Driven Deep Learning Enhanced Joint Beamforming and Mode Switching for RDARS-Aided MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable distributed antenna and reflecting surface (RDARS) is a promising architecture for future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. In particular, the dynamic working mode configuration for the RDARS-aided system brings an extra selection gain compared to the existing reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided system and distributed antenna system (DAS). In this paper, we consider the RDARS-aided downlink multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system and aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) by jointly optimizing the beamforming matrices at the based station (BS) and RDARS, as well as mode switching matrix at RDARS. The optimization problem is challenging to be solved due to the non-convex objective function and mixed integer binary constraint. To this end, a penalty term-based weight minimum mean square error (PWM) algorithm is proposed by integrating the majorization-minimization (MM) and weight minimum mean square error (WMMSE) methods. To further escape the local optimum point in the PWM algorithm, a model-driven DL method is integrated into this algorithm, where the key variables related to the convergence of PWM algorithm are trained to accelerate the convergence speed and improve the system performance. Simulation results are provided to show that the PWM-based beamforming network (PWM-BFNet) can reduce the number of iterations by half and achieve performance improvements of 26.53% and 103.2% at the scenarios of high total transmit power and a large number of RDARS transmit elements (TEs), respectively.</description>

      <title>NEFT: A Unified Transformer Framework for Efficient Near-Field CSI Feedback in XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, operating in the near-field region due to their massive antenna arrays, are key enablers of next-generation wireless communications but face significant challenges in channel state information (CSI) feedback. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool by learning compact CSI representations for feedback. However, existing methods struggle to capture the intricate structure of near-field CSI and incur prohibitive computational overhead on practical mobile devices.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose the Near-Field Efficient Feedback Transformer (NEFT) family for accurate and efficient near-field CSI feedback across diverse hardware platforms. Built on a hierarchical Vision Transformer backbone, NEFT is extended with lightweight variants to meet various deployment constraints: NEFT-Compact applies multi-level knowledge distillation (KD) to reduce complexity while maintaining accuracy, whereas NEFT-Hybrid and NEFT-Edge address encoder- and edge-constrained scenarios via attention-free encoding and KD.
  Extensive simulations show that NEFT achieves a 15--21 dB improvement in normalized mean-squared error (NMSE) over state-of-the-art methods, while NEFT-Compact and NEFT-Edge reduce total FLOPs by 25--36% with negligible accuracy loss. Moreover, NEFT-Hybrid reduces encoder-side complexity by up to 64%, enabling deployment in highly asymmetric device scenarios. These results establish NEFT as a practical and scalable solution for near-field CSI feedback in XL-MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Secure ISAC: Ambiguity Function Engineering for Impairing Unauthorized Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) brings along unprecedented vulnerabilities to authorized sensing, necessitating the development of secure solutions. Sensing parameters are embedded within the target-reflected signal leaked to unauthorized passive radar sensing eavesdroppers (Eve), implying that they can silently extract sensory information without prior knowledge of the information data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a sensing-secure ISAC framework that ensures secure target detection and estimation for the legitimate system, while obfuscating unauthorized sensing without requiring any prior knowledge of Eve. By introducing artificial imperfections into the ambiguity function (AF) of ISAC signals, we introduce artificial targets into Eve's range profile which increase its range estimation ambiguity. In contrast, the legitimate sensing receiver (Alice) can suppress these AF artifacts using mismatched filtering, albeit at the expense of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss. Employing an OFDM signal, a structured subcarrier power allocation scheme is designed to shape the secure autocorrelation function (ACF), inserting periodic peaks to mislead Eve's range estimation and degrade target detection performance. To quantify the sensing security, we introduce peak sidelobe level (PSL) and integrated sidelobe level (ISL) as key performance metrics. Then, we analyze the three-way trade-offs between communication, legitimate sensing, and sensing security, highlighting the impact of the proposed sensing-secure ISAC signaling on system performance. We formulate a convex optimization problem to maximize ISAC performance while guaranteeing a certain sensing security level. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed sensing-secure ISAC signaling, demonstrating its ability to degrade Eve's target estimation while preserving Alice's performance.</description>

Abstract: When to apply wavelet analysis to real-time temporal signals, where the future cannot be accessed, it is essential to base all the steps in the signal processing pipeline on computational mechanisms that are truly time-causal.
  This paper describes how a time-causal wavelet analysis can be performed based on concepts developed in the area of temporal scale-space theory, originating from a complete classification of temporal smoothing kernels that guarantee non-creation of new structures from finer to coarser temporal scale levels. By necessity, convolution with truncated exponential kernels in cascade constitutes the only permissable class of kernels, as well as their temporal derivatives as a natural complement to fulfil the admissibility conditions of wavelet representations. For a particular way of choosing the time constants in the resulting infinite convolution of truncated exponential kernels, to ensure temporal scale covariance and thus self-similarity over temporal scales, we describe how mother wavelets can be chosen as temporal derivatives of the resulting time-causal limit kernel.
  By developing connections between wavelet theory and scale-space theory, we characterize and quantify how the continuous scaling properties transfer to the discrete implementation, demonstrating how the proposed time-causal wavelet representation can reflect the duration of locally dominant temporal structures in the input signals.
  We propose that this notion of time-causal wavelet analysis could be a valuable tool for signal processing tasks, where streams of signals are to be processed in real time, specifically for signals that may contain local variations over a rich span of temporal scales, or more generally for analysing physical or biophysical temporal phenomena, where a fully time-causal analysis is called for to be physically realistic.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Rank-$1$ Regularization for Iterative Inversion of Ill-Conditioned MIMO Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15334v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While iterative matrix inversion methods excel in computational efficiency, memory optimization, and support for parallel and distributed computing when managing large matrices, their limitations are also evident in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels. These methods encounter challenges related to slow convergence and diminished accuracy, especially in ill-conditioned scenarios, hindering their application in future MIMO networks such as extra-large aperture array. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel matrix regularization method termed symmetric rank-$1$ regularization (SR-$1$R). The proposed method functions by augmenting the channel matrix with a symmetric rank-$1$ matrix, with the primary goal of minimizing the condition number of the resultant regularized matrix. This significantly improves the matrix condition, enabling fast and accurate iterative inversion of the regularized matrix. Then, the inverse of the original channel matrix is obtained by applying the Sherman-Morrison transform on the outcome of iterative inversions. Our eigenvalue analysis unveils the best channel condition that can be achieved by an optimized SR-$1$R matrix. Moreover, a power iteration-assisted (PIA) approach is proposed to find the optimum SR-$1$R matrix without need of eigenvalue decomposition. The proposed approach exhibits logarithmic algorithm-depth in parallel computing for MIMO precoding. Finally, computer simulations demonstrate that SR-$1$R has the potential to reduce the required iteration by up to $35\%$ while achieving the performance of regularized zero-forcing.</description>

      <title>A Survey and Future Outlook on Indoor Location Fingerprinting Privacy Preservation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pervasive integration of Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) arises from the limitations of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in indoor environments, leading to the widespread adoption of Location-Based Services (LBS) in places such as shopping malls, airports, hospitals, museums, corporate campuses, and smart buildings. Specifically, indoor location fingerprinting (ILF) systems employ diverse signal fingerprints from user devices, enabling precise location identification by Location Service Providers (LSP). Despite its broad applications across various domains, ILF introduces a notable privacy risk, as both LSP and potential adversaries inherently have access to this sensitive information, compromising users' privacy. Consequently, concerns regarding privacy vulnerabilities in this context necessitate a focused exploration of privacy-preserving mechanisms. In response to these concerns, this survey presents a comprehensive review of Indoor Location Fingerprinting Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms (ILFPPM) based on cryptographic, anonymization, differential privacy (DP), and federated learning (FL) techniques. We also propose a distinctive and novel grouping of privacy vulnerabilities, adversary models, privacy attacks, and evaluation metrics specific to ILF systems. Given the identified limitations and research gaps in this survey, we highlight numerous prospective opportunities for future investigation, aiming to motivate researchers interested in advancing ILF systems. This survey constitutes a valuable reference for researchers and provides a clear overview for those beyond this specific research domain. To further help the researchers, we have created an online resource repository, which can be found at \href{https://github.com/amir-ftlz/ilfppm}{https://github.com/amir-ftlz/ilfppm}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN)-based algorithms are emerging as an important tool for many physical and MAC layer functions in future wireless communication systems, including for large multi-antenna channels. However, training such models typically requires a large dataset of high-dimensional channel measurements, which are very difficult and expensive to obtain. This paper introduces a novel method for generating synthetic wireless channel data using diffusion-based models to produce user-specific channels that accurately reflect real-world wireless environments. Our approach employs a conditional denoising diffusion implicit model (cDDIM) framework, effectively capturing the relationship between user location and multi-antenna channel characteristics. We generate synthetic high fidelity channel samples using user positions as conditional inputs, creating larger augmented datasets to overcome measurement scarcity. The utility of this method is demonstrated through its efficacy in training various downstream tasks such as channel compression and beam alignment. Our diffusion-based augmentation approach achieves over a 1-2 dB gain in NMSE for channel compression, and an 11dB SNR boost in beamforming compared to prior methods, such as noise addition or the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs).</description>

      <title>BlueME: Robust Underwater Robot-to-Robot Communication Using Compact Magnetoelectric Antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09241v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design, development, and experimental validation of BlueME, a compact magnetoelectric (ME) antenna array system for underwater robot-to-robot communication. BlueME employs ME antennas operating at their natural mechanical resonance frequency to efficiently transmit and receive very-low-frequency (VLF) electromagnetic signals underwater. We outline the design, simulation, fabrication, and integration of the proposed system on low-power embedded platforms, focusing on portable and scalable applications. For performance evaluation, we deployed BlueME on an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in open-water field trials. Ocean trials demonstrate that BlueME maintains reliable signal transmission at distances beyond 700 meters while consuming only 10 watts of power. Field trials show that the system operates effectively in challenging underwater conditions such as turbidity, obstacles, and multipath interference -- conditions that generally affect acoustics and optics. Our analysis also examines the impact of complete submersion on system performance and identifies key deployment considerations. This work represents the first practical underwater deployment of ME antennas outside the laboratory and implements the largest VLF ME array system to date. BlueME demonstrates significant potential for marine robotics and automation in multi-robot cooperative systems and remote sensor networks.</description>

Abstract: Foundation models are reshaping EEG analysis, yet an important problem of EEG tokenization remains a challenge. This paper presents TFM-Tokenizer, a novel tokenization framework that learns a vocabulary of time-frequency motifs from single-channel EEG signals and encodes them into discrete tokens. We propose a dual-path architecture with time-frequency masking to capture robust motif representations, and it is model-agnostic, supporting both lightweight transformers and existing foundation models for downstream tasks. Our study demonstrates three key benefits: Accuracy: Experiments on four diverse EEG benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains across both single- and multi-dataset pretraining settings, achieving up to 17% improvement in Cohen's Kappa over strong baselines. Generalization: Moreover, as a plug-and-play component, it consistently boosts the performance of diverse foundation models, including BIOT and LaBraM. Scalability: By operating at the single-channel level rather than relying on the strict 10-20 EEG system, our method has the potential to be device-agnostic. Experiments on ear-EEG sleep staging, which differs from the pretraining data in signal format, channel configuration, recording device, and task, show that our tokenizer outperforms baselines by 14%. A comprehensive token analysis reveals strong class-discriminative, frequency-aware, and consistent structure, enabling improved representation quality and interpretability.
