      <title>NPGPT: Natural Product-Like Compound Generation with GPT-based Chemical Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural products are substances produced by organisms in nature and often possess biological activity and structural diversity. Drug development based on natural products has been common for many years. However, the intricate structures of these compounds present challenges in terms of structure determination and synthesis, particularly compared to the efficiency of high-throughput screening of synthetic compounds. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have been applied to the generation of molecules. In this study, we trained chemical language models on a natural product dataset and generated natural product-like compounds. The results showed that the distribution of the compounds generated was similar to that of natural products. We also evaluated the effectiveness of the generated compounds as drug candidates. Our method can be used to explore the vast chemical space and reduce the time and cost of drug discovery of natural products.</description>

      <title>OpenMS WebApps: Building User-Friendly Solutions for MS Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) is an indispensable analytical technique in proteomics, metabolomics, and other life sciences. While OpenMS provides advanced open-source software for MS data analysis, its complexity can be challenging for non-experts. To address this, we have developed OpenMS WebApps, a framework for creating user-friendly MS web applications based on the Streamlit Python package. OpenMS WebApps simplifies MS data analysis through an intuitive graphical user interface, interactive result visualizations, and support for both local and online execution. Key features include workspaces management, automatic generation of input widgets, and parallel execution of tools resulting in highperformance and ready-to-use solutions for online and local deployment. This framework benefits both researchers and developers: scientists can focus on their research without the burden of complex software setups, and developers can rapidly create and distribute custom WebApps with novel algorithms. Several applications built on the OpenMS WebApps template demonstrate its utility across diverse MS-related fields, enhancing the OpenMS eco-system for developers and a wider range of users. Furthermore, it integrates seamlessly with third-party software, extending benefits to developers beyond the OpenMS community.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Power of Gradient Guidance for Structure-Based Molecule Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure-based molecule optimization (SBMO) aims to optimize molecules with both continuous coordinates and discrete types against protein targets. A promising direction is to exert gradient guidance on generative models given its remarkable success in images, but it is challenging to guide discrete data and risks inconsistencies between modalities. To this end, we leverage a continuous and differentiable space derived through Bayesian inference, presenting Molecule Joint Optimization (MolJO), the first gradient-based SBMO framework that facilitates joint guidance signals across different modalities while preserving SE(3)-equivariance. We introduce a novel backward correction strategy that optimizes within a sliding window of the past histories, allowing for a seamless trade-off between explore-and-exploit during optimization. Our proposed MolJO achieves state-of-the-art performance on CrossDocked2020 benchmark (Success Rate 51.3% , Vina Dock -9.05 and SA 0.78), more than 4x improvement in Success Rate compared to the gradient-based counterpart, and 2x "Me-Better" Ratio as much as 3D baselines. Furthermore, we extend MolJO to a wide range of optimization settings, including multi-objective optimization and challenging tasks in drug design such as R-group optimization and scaffold hopping, further underscoring its versatility and potential.</description>

      <title>Energy-based generative models for monoclonal antibodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the approval of the first antibody drug in 1986, a total of 162 antibodies have been approved for a wide range of therapeutic areas, including cancer, autoimmune, infectious, or cardiovascular diseases. Despite advances in biotechnology that accelerated the development of antibody drugs, the drug discovery process for this modality remains lengthy and costly, requiring multiple rounds of optimizations before a drug candidate can progress to preclinical and clinical trials. This multi-optimization problem involves increasing the affinity of the antibody to the target antigen while refining additional biophysical properties that are essential to drug development such as solubility, thermostability or aggregation propensity. Additionally, antibodies that resemble natural human antibodies are particularly desirable, as they are likely to offer improved profiles in terms of safety, efficacy, and reduced immunogenicity, further supporting their therapeutic potential. In this article, we explore the use of energy-based generative models to optimize a candidate monoclonal antibody. We identify tradeoffs when optimizing for multiple properties, concentrating on solubility, humanness and affinity and use the generative model we develop to generate candidate antibodies that lie on an optimal Pareto front that satisfies these constraints.</description>

      <title>Integrating Secondary Structures Information into Triangular Spatial Relationships (TSR) for Advanced Protein Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein structures represent the key to deciphering biological functions. The more detailed form of similarity among these proteins is sometimes overlooked by the conventional structural comparison methods. In contrast, further advanced methods, such as Triangular Spatial Relationship (TSR), have been demonstrated to make finer differentiations. Still, the classical implementation of TSR does not provide for the integration of secondary structure information, which is important for a more detailed understanding of the folding pattern of a protein. To overcome these limitations, we developed the SSE-TSR approach. The proposed method integrates secondary structure elements (SSEs) into TSR-based protein representations. This allows an enriched representation of protein structures by considering 18 different combinations of helix, strand, and coil arrangements. Our results show that using SSEs improves the accuracy and reliability of protein classification to varying degrees. We worked with two large protein datasets of 9.2K and 7.8K samples, respectively. We applied the SSE-TSR approach and used a neural network model for classification. Interestingly, introducing SSEs improved performance statistics for Dataset 1, with accuracy moving from 96.0% to 98.3%. For Dataset 2, where the performance statistics were already good, further small improvements were found with the introduction of SSE, giving an accuracy of 99.5% compared to 99.4%. These results show that SSE integration can dramatically improve TSR key discrimination, with significant benefits in datasets with low initial accuracies and only incremental gains in those with high baseline performance. Thus, SSE-TSR is a powerful bioinformatics tool that improves protein classification and understanding of protein function and interaction.</description>
