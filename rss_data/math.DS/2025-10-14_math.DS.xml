      <title>Determining codimension of Bogdanov-Takens and Bautin bifurcations via simplest normal form computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In solving real-world problems, determining the codimension of Bogdanov-Takens (BT) and Bautin (generalized Hopf) bifurcations can be very challenging, even for simple two-dimensional dynamical systems. This difficulty becomes particularly evident when the number of system parameters exceeds the codimension of the bifurcations. Such challenges are closely linked to analyzing complex dynamics, such as the bifurcation of multiple limit cycles and homoclinic/heteroclinic bifurcations. In this paper, we use two population systems to demonstrate a systematic approach for determining the conditions that define the codimension of BT and Bautin bifurcations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to study the fractional-order system with Caputo derivative associated to single Stokes pulse.

      <title>Human-Wildlife interactions in a tropical forest context: modeling, analysis and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anthropisation and excessive hunting in tropical forests threaten biodiversity, ecosystem maintenance and human food security. In this article, we focus on the issue of coexistence between humans and wildlife in an anthropised environment. Assuming that the human population moves between its residential area and the surrounding forest to hunt, we study a resource-consumer model with consumer migration. A comprehensive analysis of the system is carried out using classical theory and monotone systems theory. We show that the possibilities for long-term coexistence between human populations and wildlife populations are determined by hunting rate thresholds. Depending on the level of anthropisation and the hunting rate, the system may converge towards a limit cycle or a co-existence equilibrium. However, the conditions for coexistence become more difficult as anthropisation increases. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Universal Analog Computation: Fra\"iss\'e limits of dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog computation is an alternative to digital computation, that has recently re-gained prominence, since it includes neural networks. Further important examples are cellular automata and differential analyzers. While analog computers offer many advantages, they lack a notion of universality akin to universal digital computers. Since analog computers are best formalized as dynamical systems, we review scattered results on universal dynamical systems, identifying four senses of universality and connecting to coalgebra and domain theory. For nondeterministic systems, we construct a universal system as a Fra\"iss\'e limit. It not only is universal in many of the identified senses, it also is unique in additionally being homogeneous. For deterministic systems, a universal system cannot exist, but we provide a simple method for constructing subclasses of deterministic systems with a universal and homogeneous system. This way, we introduce sofic proshifts: those systems that are limits of sofic shifts. In fact, their universal and homogeneous system even is a limit of shifts of finite type and has the shadowing property.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Bicycle Unitracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the geometry of bicycle tracks. We model bicycle as an oriented segment of a fixed length that is moving in the Euclidean plane so that the trajectory of the rear point is tangent to the segment at all times. The trajectories of front and back points of the segment are called bicycle tracks, and one asks if it is possible that the front track is contained in the rear track (other than when they are straight lines). Such curves are called unitracks or unicycle tracks. In 2002 D.Finn proposed a construction of unitracks that are obtained as a union of a sequence of curves. Numerical evidence suggested that these curves behave expansively and that various numerical characteristics of the curves grow quickly in the sequence. In this paper we prove that the curves that form a unitrack in Finn's construction cannot remain graphs of functions, unless they are straight lines. We conclude that the horizontal amplitude of the curves has a linear growth rate between 1 and 2.</description>

      <title>Robustly transitive maps with critical points and large dimensional central spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given any triplet of positive integers $n \geq 2$, $m$ and $k$ such that $n=m+k$, we exhibit a $C^1$ robustly transitive endomorphism of $\mathbb{T}^n$ with persistent critical points in the isotopy class of $F \times Id$, where $F$ is an expanding map of $\mathbb{T}^m$ and $Id$ is the identity of $\mathbb{T}^k$. Furthermore, if $k$ is small, the map is not only in the isotopy class but in fact a perturbation of $F \times Id$.</description>

      <title>Invariant sets for the wind-tree model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the wind-tree model, a $\mathbb{Z}^2$ - periodic billiard. In the case when the underlying compact translation surface lies on a periodic orbit of the Teichm\"uller geodesic flow, and at least one of the two homology classes defining the $\mathbb{Z}^2$ - cover is unstable for the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle, we prove that every orbit closure of the billiard has Hausdorff dimension strictly smaller than 2. The proof relies on a construction of explicit invariant functions, which along the way gives a new proof of non-ergodicity and non-transitivity of the wind-tree model for all parameters and almost all directions, as first shown by Fr\c{a}czek and Ulcigrai (2014).</description>

      <title>On Sets of Periodic Orbit Lengths in Finitely Presented Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the sets of natural numbers $n$ for which certain dynamical systems $(X,f)$ on a compact metric space $X$ have a periodic point of (least) period $n$. Interest in this question dates back to Sharkovskii's theorem for continuous maps on intervals of the real line, but it also ties to checkable conditions for Krieger's embedding theorem for symbolic dynamical systems. Given a system for which the logarithmic derivative of the Artin-Mazur zeta function is rational, we use the Skolem-Mahler-Lech theorem to classify for which $n$ the system has a periodic point of (not necessarily least) period $n$. Moreover, we build on work on finitely presented (FP) systems and their relationship to symbolic dynamics to classify the set of least periods, that is periodic orbit lengths, for arbitrary FP systems, extending a known classification for shifts of finite type. We also provide several constructions to realize any such least period sets.</description>

      <title>A topology for Engel expansions: evaluation and digit coding maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a topological framework for Engel expansions that treats both directions of the correspondence between points of $(0,1]$ and nondecreasing digit sequences. We endow the sequence space with the product topology to study the evaluation map, and we fix a nonterminating digit algorithm to study the digit coding map. We also record the correspondence between cylinder sets and fundamental intervals, and give an application to Baire category results for functions of the digits.</description>

      <title>Topological weak containment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build on work of Elek and Zucker and develop a topological analogue of the theory of weak containment. We show that definitions in terms of local patterns, containment in ultra(co)products, and continuous model theory are all equivalent, just as in ergodic theory. And, for actions on Cantor space, we show these are all equivalent to approximate conjugacy.
  Restricting our attention to Cantor space, we connect this theory to questions about generic actions. We show how the shape of the space of weak equivalence classes reflects the geometry of the acting group. And, we show that, for $\mathbb{Z}^2$, there is no smallest limit of finite actions.</description>

      <title>Periodic solutions in a tumor-immune competition system with time-delay and chemotherapy effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to analyze the dynamics of the system of time-delay differential equations (DDEs) \begin{equation*} \begin{split} \dot{T}(t)&amp;=T(t) f(t,T(t))-\gamma E(t)T(t),\\ \dot{E}(t)&amp;=\sigma+ \frac{pE(t)T(t-\tau_1)}{g+a T(t-\tau_1)}-\frac{mE(t)T(t-\tau_2)}{g+a T(t-\tau_2)}-\eta E(t), \end{split} \end{equation*} where $T=T(t)$ and $E=E(t)$ represent the concentrations of tumor and effector cells at the time $t$. The coefficients $\sigma$, $\mu$, $\gamma$, and $\eta$ are all positive, and $f(t, T)$ represents the relative growth rate of tumor cells, corresponding to a generalized logistic growth function that describes periodic time chemotherapeutic effects. The parameter $\tau_1 \in \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ is the response time delay of the immune system (mediated by effector cells) to an invasion of tumor cells, while $\tau_2 \in \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ represents the time delay of tumor cells in response to the appearance of effector cells.</description>

      <title>Fibration Symmetries and Cluster Synchronization in Multi-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on recent advances in fibration symmetry theory, we investigate how structural symmetries influence synchronization in systems with higher-order interactions (HOI). Using bipartite graph representations, we identify a node partition in fibres, based on equivalent incidence relations in hypergraphs. We study how identical nodes with an isomorphic input set can synchronize due to structural properties under our specific model assumptions, examining the dynamical model of Kuramoto with higher-order interactions and frustration parameters. Recent works established for directed hypergraphs that balanced partitions characterize robust synchrony, invariant under all admissible dynamics, whereas our contribution isolates the case of Kuramoto dynamics and shows that synchrony under homogeneous initial conditions and natural frequencies necessarily coincides with the fibration partition. As a conclusion, let us examine situations that require adjustments to the hypergraph topology to handle redundancy or to align with a target cluster configuration, especially in the presence of noise or incomplete information. These considerations open up new questions for future investigations. Our methodology combines theoretical modeling and simulations with applications to real-world data topologies, highlighting how representational choices and local input equivalence influence synchronization behavior.</description>

      <title>Extreme events and impact statistics for unipotent actions on the space of lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends a recent extreme value law for horocycle flows on the space of two-dimensional lattices, due to Kirsebom and Mallahi-Karai, to the simplest examples of rank-$k$ unipotent actions on the space of $n$-dimensional lattices. We analyse the problem in terms of the hitting time and impact statistics for the unipotent action with respect to a shrinking surface of section, following the strategy of Pollicott and the first named author in the case of hyperbolic surfaces. If $k=n-1$, the limit law is given by directional statistics of Euclidean lattices, whilst for $k&lt;n-1$ we observe new distributions for which we derive precise tail asymptotics.</description>

      <title>On the Piecewise Linear Perturbations of the Doubling Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the 2007 work by M.~Misiurewicz and A.~Rodrigues [Double Standard Maps, M. Misiurewicz, A. Rodrigues, Communications in Mathematical Physics], we consider a family of circle maps that are perturbations of the doubling map on the circle by a piecewise linear map. We call this the \textit{piecewise linear perturbation of the doubling map} (PLPDM) and it is given by the formula,
  $f_{a,b}(x)= \displaystyle \bigl(2x+a+\dfrac{b}{2} S(x) \bigr) // 1 \quad {\text {for }} x, a, b \in [0,1] $, where $y // 1$ means $y \mod 1$ (or simply, the fractional part of $y$) and $S(x)$ is the piecewise linear approximation of $\sin 2\pi(x-1/4)$. The map $S(x)$ is called the straight sine map. Define the hyperbolic set, $\mathcal{H}= \{ (a,b) \in \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} \times [0,1] : f_{a,b} \text{ has an attracting cycle} \}$. Tongues are defined as the components of $\mathcal{H}$ that touch the ceiling $\{b=1\}$ in a non degenerate interval. Any other component is referred to as an Eye. We show the uniqueness of the attracting cycle of $f_{a,b}$ for $(a,b) \in \mathcal{H}$. We then define \textit{type} and prove the existence of the tongues of all types. We also show how combinatorics of the attracting orbit determines if the component is a tongue or an eye. We show that $f_{a,b}$ is conjugate to the doubling map if $(a,b) \notin \overline{\mathcal{H}}$. Some experimental proof of the existence of eyes in the parameter space corresponding to different combinatorics will be shown.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give lower bounds in terms of~$n,$ for the number of limit cycles of polynomial vector fields of degree~$n,$ having any prescribed invariant algebraic curve. By applying them when the ovals of this curve are also algebraic limit cycles we obtain a new recurrent property for the Hilbert numbers. Finally, we apply our results to two important families of models: Kolmogorov systems and a general family of systems appearing in Game Theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hausdorff measure and Hausdorff dimension are useful tools to describe fractals. This paper investigates the bounds on the $d\log_32$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the $d$-fold Cartesian product of the $1/3$ Cantor set, $\mathcal C^d$. By applying known theorems on the Hausdorff measure of fractals satisfying the strong open set condition and generalizing what has been done on $\mathcal C^2$, we compute stricter upper and lower bounds for the Hausdorff measure of $\mathcal C^d$ for several small integers $d$.</description>

Abstract: Given a flag variety $X$ defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ and a point $x$ in $X(\mathbb{R})$, we study approximations to $x$ by points $v$ in $X(\mathbb{Q})$, and show that, with an appropriate rescaling, those approximations equidistribute when $x$ is chosen randomly according to a Lebesgue measure on $X(\mathbb{R})$, or when $x$ is defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ and satisfies some non-degeneracy condition.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Public Goods Game in Dynamical Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolutionary mechanisms of cooperative behavior represent a fundamental topic in complex systems and evolutionary dynamics. Although recent advances have introduced real-world stochasticity in nonlinear public goods game (PGG), such stochasticity remains static, neglecting its origin in the external environment as well as the coevolution of system stochasticity and cooperative behavior driven by environmental dynamics. In this work, we introduce a dynamic environment feedback mechanism into the stochastic nonlinear PGG framework, establishing a coevolutionary model that couples environmental states and individual cooperative strategies. Our results demonstrate that the interplay among environment feedback, nonlinear effects, and stochasticity can drive the system toward a wide variety of steady-state structures, including full defection, full cooperation, stable coexistence, and periodic limit cycles. Further analysis reveals that asymmetric nonlinear parameters and environment feedback rates exert significant regulatory effects on cooperation levels and system dynamics. This study not only enriches the theoretical framework of evolutionary game theory, but also provides a foundation for the management of ecological systems and the design of cooperative mechanisms in society.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new quasi-isometry invariant for finitely generated groups and show that every group with this property admits a subshift which is effectively closed by patterns and that cannot be realized as the topological factor of any subshift of finite type. We provide several examples of groups with the property, such as amenable groups, multi-ended groups, generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups, fundamental groups of surfaces, and cocompact Fuchsian groups.</description>

      <title>On the Mather stability theorem for smooth maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [MaII] Mather proved that a smooth proper infinitesimally stable map is stable. This result is the key component of the Mather stability theorem [MaV], which can be reformulated as follows: a smooth proper map $f: M\to N$ is stable if and only if it is infinitesimally stable if and only if it satisfies the Mather normal crossing condition. The latter condition, roughly speaking, means that all map germs of $f$ are stable and $f$ maps the singular strata of $f$ to $N$ in a mutually transversal manner. In this note we adapt a short argument from the book by Golubitsky and Guillemin to derive the Mather stability theorem presented in [MaV] from the theorem in [MaII].</description>

      <title>Prime-powered images and irreducible polynomials in dynamical semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G=\langle x^d+c_1,\dots,x^d+c_s\rangle$ be a semigroup generated under composition for some $c_1,\dots,c_s\in\mathbb{Z}$ and some $d\geq2$. Then we prove that, outside of an exceptional one-parameter family, $G$ contains a large and explicit subset of irreducible polynomials if and only if it contains at least one irreducible polynomial. In particular, this conclusion holds when $G$ is generated by at least $s\geq3$ polynomials when $d$ is odd and at least $s\geq5$ polynomials when $d$ is even. To do this, we prove a classification result for prime powered iterates under $f(x)=x^d+c$ when $c\in\mathbb{Z}$ is nonzero. Namely, if $f^n(\alpha)=y^p$ for some $n\geq4$, some $\alpha,y\in\mathbb{Z}$, and some prime $p|d$, then $\alpha$ and $y^p$ are necessarily preperiodic and periodic points for $f$ respectively. Moreover, we note that $n=4$ is the smallest possible iterate for which one may make this conclusion.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically large free semigroups in Zariski dense discrete subgroups of Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected algebraic semisimple real Lie group with finite center and no compact factors, and let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski dense discrete subgroup of $G$. We show that $\Gamma$ contains free, finitely generated subsemigroups whose critical exponents are arbitrarily close to that of $\Gamma$. Furthermore, these subsemigroups are Zariski dense in $G$ and $P$-Anosov in the sense of Kassel--Potrie. This shows that no gap phenomenon holds for critical exponents of discrete subsemigroups of Lie groups, which in contrast with Leuzinger's critical exponent gap theorem for infinite covolume discrete subgroups of Lie groups with Kazhdan's property (T), proven in 2003.
  As an important step towards our construction, we introduce and study properties of a particular type of loxodromic element, which we call an $\epsilon$-contracting element, and construct our free subsemigroups in such a way that all of their elements are either $\epsilon$-contracting or $2\epsilon$-contracting. One of the main novelties in this approach is that it enables us to study the action of $G$ on its Furstenberg boundary $G/P$ intrinsically, in the sense that we do not embed $G/P$ into a product of projective spaces associated to the proximal irreducible algebraic Tits representations of $G$.
  This definition is inspired by the notion of $\epsilon$-proximal elements, which plays a prominent role in the seminal works of Abels--Margulis--Soifer on the actions of linear groups on projective spaces and of Benoist on algebraic and asymptotic properties of discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups. We hope this perspective will lead to further developments in the study of discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups and provide simpler proofs of results currently in the literature.</description>

      <title>Tempological Control of Network Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback control is an effective strategy for stabilizing a desired state and has been widely adopted in maintaining the stability of systems such as flying birds and power grids. By default, this framework requires continuous control input to offset deviations from the desired state, which can be invasive and cost a considerable amount of energy. Here, we introduce tempological (temporal + topological) control -- a novel, noninvasive strategy that harnesses the inherent flexibility of time-varying networks to control the dynamics of a general nonlinear system. By strategically switching network topology on-the-fly based on the current states of the nodes, we show how it is possible to drive a system to a desired state or even stabilize otherwise unstable states, all in the absence of external forcing. We demonstrate the utility of our approach using networks of Kuramoto and Stuart-Landau oscillators, achieving synchronization out of sets of unsynchronizable networks. Finally, we develop a statistical theory that explains why tempological control will almost always succeed in the limit of large and diverse temporal networks, with diversity of network configurations overcoming the deficiencies of any snapshot in isolation.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing the Staking Rate, Dynamically Distributed Inflation and Delay Induced Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamically distributed inflation is a common mechanism used to guide a blockchain's staking rate towards a desired equilibrium between network security and token liquidity.
  However, the high sensitivity of the annual percentage yield to changes in the staking rate, coupled with the inherent feedback delays in staker responses, can induce undesirable oscillations around this equilibrium.
  This paper investigates this instability phenomenon. We analyze the dynamics of inflation-based reward systems and propose a novel distribution model designed to stabilize the staking rate. Our solution effectively dampens oscillations, stabilizing the yield within a target staking range.</description>

      <title>Area Law for the entanglement entropy of free fermions in nonrandom ergodic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with the asymptotic behavior of one of the widely used characteristics of correlations in large quantum systems. The correlations are known as quantum entanglement, the characteristic is called the entanglement entropy, and as large systems we consider an ideal gas of spinless lattice fermions. The system is determined by its one-body Hamiltonian. As shown in \cite{EPS}, if the Hamiltonian is an ergodic finite difference operator with exponentially decaying spectral projection, then the asymptotic form of the entanglement entropy is the so-called Area Law. However, the only one-body Hamiltonian for which this spectral condition is verified is the $d$-dimensional discrete Schr\"odinger operators with random potential. In the present paper, we prove that the same asymptotic form of the entanglement entropy holds for a wide class of Schr\"odinger operators whose potentials are ergodic but nonrandom. We start with the quasiperiodic and limit periodic operators, and then pass to the interesting and highly non-trivial case of the potentials generated by subshifts of finite type. They arose in the theory of dynamical systems in the study of non-random chaotic phenomena. As it turns out, obtaining the asymptotics of the entanglement entropy of free fermions requires a quite involved spectral analysis of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator. Specifically, we prove for this class two important and interesting in itself spectral properties, known as exponential dynamic localisation in expectation and the exponential decay of the eigenfunction correlator, implying the Area Law for the entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of a Bioeconomic Crop-Energy System with Energy Reinvestment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an optimal control model for allocating agricultural crop residues between bioenergy production and soil fertility restoration. The system captures a novel circular feedback: a fraction of cumulative energy output is reinvested into soil productivity, linking energy use with ecological regeneration. The dynamics are governed by a nonlinear three-state system describing soil fertility, residue biomass, and accumulated energy, with a single control representing the proportion of biomass diverted to energy. The objective is to maximize a discounted net benefit that accounts for energy revenue, soil value, and operational costs. We apply the Pontryagin Maximum Principle in current-value form to derive necessary optimality conditions and characterize the structure of optimal controls. Numerical simulations based on direct optimization reveal interior and switching regimes, and show how planning horizon and reinvestment efficiency influence optimal strategies. The results highlight the strategic role of energy reinvestment in achieving sustainable residue management.</description>

      <title>Robust Closed-Form Control for MIMO Nonlinear Systems under Conflicting Time-Varying Hard and Soft Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel robust closed-form control law to handle time-varying hard and soft constraints in uncertain high-relative-degree nonlinear MIMO systems. These constraints represent spatiotemporal specifications in mechanical systems' operational space, with hard constraints ensuring safety-critical requirements and soft constraints encoding performance or task objectives. Initially, all constraints are consolidated into two separate scalar time-varying hard and soft constraint functions, whose positive level sets define feasible regions. A closed-form control law is developed to enforce these constraints using appropriately designed reciprocal barriers and nonlinear transformation functions. When conflicts between hard and soft constraints arise, the control law prioritizes hard constraints by virtually relaxing soft constraints via a dynamic relaxation law. Notably, the proposed control law maintains low complexity by avoiding approximation schemes for coping with system uncertainties. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Marked Poincar\'e rigidity near hyperbolic metrics and injectivity of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian in dimension 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact manifold without boundary equipped with a Riemannian metric $g$ of negative curvature. In this paper, we introduce the marked Poincar\'e determinant (MPD), a homothety invariant of $g$ depending on differentiable periodic data of its geodesic flow. The MPD associates to each free homotopy class of closed curves in $M$ a number which measures the unstable volume expansion of the geodesic flow along the associated closed geodesic. We prove a local MPD rigidity result in dimension 3: if $g$ is sufficiently close to a hyperbolic metric $g_0$ and both metrics have the same MPD, then they are homothetic. As a by-product of our proof, we show the Lichnerowicz Laplacian of $g_0$ is injective on the space of trace-free divergence-free symmetric 2-tensors, which, to our knowledge, is the first result of its kind in negative curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semitoric systems are a special type of 4-dimensional integrable system where one of the functions is the moment map of a Hamiltonian $S^1$-action. These systems were classified by Pelayo and V{\~u} Ng\d{o}c, but there are not many explicit examples. Recently, Le Floch and Palmer introduced semitoric transition families in which a singular point transitions between elliptic-elliptic type and focus-focus type as the parameter varies. In this paper, we construct semitoric transition families on pentagon spaces by interpolating two semitoric systems of toric type. More specifically, we show that there exists a unique singular point that changes from elliptic-elliptic type to focus-focus type and back to elliptic-elliptic type as the parameter varies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the integral simplicial volume of cyclic covers of manifolds that fiber over the circle with fiber given by an $n$-dimensional torus. By studying the integral filling volume -- an invariant introduced by Frigerio and the first author -- for the monodromy, we establish both lower and upper bounds for the limit of the integral simplicial volume of these covers, normalized by the degree of the covering. These bounds are expressed in terms of the action of the monodromy on the real homology of the fiber.
  As applications, we establish a close connection between the topological entropy and the integral filling volume of self-homeomorphisms of $n$-dimensional tori, we find new examples for which the Delta-complexity and the integral simplicial volume are not equivalent, and we prove the nonvanishing of the filling volume for Anosov self-diffeomorphisms of infranilmanifolds.</description>

Abstract: We resolve a long-standing open question on the relationship between measure-theoretic dynamical complexity and symbolic complexity by establishing the exact word complexity at which measure-theoretic strong mixing manifests:
  For every superlinear $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$, i.e. $f(q)/q \to \infty$, there exists a subshift admitting a (strongly) mixing of all orders probability measure with word complexity $p$ such that $p(q)/f(q) \to 0$.
  For a subshift with word complexity $p$ which is non-superlinear, i.e. $\liminf p(q)/q &lt; \infty$, every ergodic probability measure is partially rigid.</description>

      <title>Eventual Conjugacy of Free Inert $G$-SFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The action of a finite group $G$ on a subshift of finite type $X$ is called free, if every point has trivial stabilizer, and it is called inert, if the induced action on the dimension group of $X$ is trivial. We show that any two free inert actions of a finite group $G$ on an SFT are conjugate by an automorphism of any sufficiently high power of the shift space. This partially answers a question posed by Fiebig. As a consequence we obtain that every two free elements of the stabilized automorphism group of a full shift are conjugate in this group. In addition, we generalize a result of Boyle, Carlsen and Eilers concerning the flow equivalence of $G$-SFTs.</description>

Abstract: For the each of the five Euclidean rings of complex quadratic integers, we consider a complex continued fraction algorithm with digits in the ring. We show for each algorithm that the maximal digit obeys a Fr\'echet distribution. We use this to find a limiting distribution for cusp excursions on Bianchi orbifolds associated with the aforementioned rings of quadratic integers.</description>

      <title>Outer billiards of symplectically self-polar convex bodies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that $C^1$-smooth strictly convex Radon norms in $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be characterized by the property that the outer billiard map, which corresponds to the unit ball of the norm, has an invariant curve consisting of 4-periodic orbits. In higher dimensions, Radon norms are necessarily Euclidean. However, we show in this paper that the property of existence of an invariant curve of 4-periodic orbits allows a higher-dimensional extension to the class of symplectically self-polar convex bodies. Moreover, this class of convex bodies provides the first non-trivial examples of invariant hypersurfaces for outer billiard map. This is in contrast with conventional Birkhoff billiards in higher dimensions, where it was proved by Berger and Gruber that only ellipsoids have caustics. It is not known, however, if non-trivial invariant hypersurfaces can exist for higher-dimensional Birkhoff billiards.</description>

      <title>Fractal tiles induced by tent maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present article, we deal with geometrical objects induced by the tent maps associated with special Pisot numbers that we call tent-tiles. They are compact subsets of the one-, two-, or three-dimensional Euclidean space, depending on the particular special Pisot number. Most of the tent-tiles have a fractal shape and we study the Hausdorff dimension of their boundary. Furthermore, we are concerned with tilings induced by tent-tiles. It turns out that tent-tiles give rise to two types of lattice tilings. In order to obtain these results we establish and exploit connections between tent-tiles and Rauzy fractals induced by substitutions and automorphisms of the free group.</description>

      <title>A geometric formulation of GENERIC stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a coordinate-invariant geometric formulation of the GENERIC stochastic differential equation, unifying reversible Hamiltonian and irreversible dissipative dynamics within a differential-geometric framework. Our construction builds on the classical GENERIC or metriplectic formalism, extending it to manifolds by introducing a degenerate Poisson structure, a degenerate co-metric, and a volume form satisfying a unimodularity condition. The resulting equation preserves a particular Boltzmann-type measure, ensures almost-sure conservation of energy, and reduces to the deterministic GENERIC/metriplectic formulation in the zero-noise limit. This geometrization separates system-specific quantities from the ambient space, clarifies the roles of the underlying structures, and provides a foundation for analytic and numerical methods, as well as future extensions to quantum and coarse-grained systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show ergodicity of (asymmetric) lemon billiards, billiard tables that are the intersection of two circles of which one contains the centers of both. These do not satisfy the Wojtkowski criteria for hyperbolicity, but we establish \emph{uniform} expansion of vectors in an invariant cone family and alignment of singularity curves. Both of these are difficult, and the approach to the latter seems new. Together, these properties imply ergodicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use iterations of skinning maps on Teichm\"uller spaces to study circle packings and develop a renormalization theory for circle packings whose nerves satisfy certain subdivision rules. We characterize when the skinning map has bounded image. Under the corresponding condition, we prove that the renormalization operator $\mathfrak{R}$ is uniformly contracting. This allows us to give complete answers for the existence and moduli problems for such circle packings. The exponential contraction of $\mathfrak{R}^n$ means that despite the non-rigidity of such circle packings, they are geometrically inflexible. As an application, we show that any geometrically finite Kleinian circle packing is combinatorially rigid.</description>

      <title>Closed Orbits of Dynamically Convex Reeb Flows: Towards the HZ- and Multiplicity Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the multiplicity problem for prime closed orbits of dynamically convex Reeb flows on the boundary of a star-shaped domain in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. The first of our two main results asserts that such a flow has at least $n$ prime closed Reeb orbits, improving the previously known lower bound by a factor of two and settling a long-standing open question. The second main theorem is that when, in addition, the domain is centrally symmetric and the Reeb flow is non-degenerate, the flow has either exactly $n$ or infinitely many prime closed orbits. This is a higher-dimensional contact variant of Franks' celebrated $2$-or-infinity theorem and, viewed from the symplectic dynamics perspective, settles a particular case of the contact Hofer-Zehnder conjecture. The proofs are based on several auxiliary results of independent interest on the structure of the filtered symplectic homology and the properties of closed orbits.</description>

      <title>Once bitten, twice shy: A modeling framework for incorporating heterogeneous mosquito biting into transmission models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The risk of mosquito-borne disease outbreaks is tightly linked to the frequency at which mosquitoes feed on blood, also known as the biting rate. However, standard models of mosquito-borne disease transmission inherently assume that mosquitoes bite only once per reproductive cycle -- an assumption commonly violated in nature. Drivers of multiple biting also affect the mosquito gonotrophic cycle duration (GCD), the quantity customarily used to estimate biting rates. Here, we present a novel framework for incorporating more complex mosquito biting behaviors into transmission models, accounting for heterogeneity and linkages between mosquito biting rates and multiple biting. We provide general formulas for the basic offspring number, $\mathcal{N}_0$, and basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_0$, threshold measures for mosquito population and pathogen transmission persistence, respectively. To exhibit its flexibility, we expand on specific models derived from the framework that arise from empirical, phenomenological, or mechanistic modeling perspectives. Using the gonotrophic cycle duration as a standard quantity to make comparisons among the models, we show that assumptions about the biting process strongly affect the relationship between GCD and $\mathcal{R}_0$. While under the standard assumption of one bite per reproductive cycle, $\mathcal{R}_0$ is an increasing linear function of the inverse of the GCD, alternative models of the biting process can exhibit saturating or concave relationships. Critically, from a mechanistic perspective, decreases in the GCD can lead to substantial decreases in $\mathcal{R}_0$. This work highlights the importance of incorporating the behavioral dynamics of mosquitoes into transmission models and provides a method for evaluating how individual-level interventions against mosquito biting scale up to determine population-level mosquito-borne disease risk.</description>

      <title>On novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional non-conservative systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional systems including two well-known systems describing the three-wave-interaction problem and some well-known chaotic systems, namely, the Chen, L\"u, and Qi systems. We show that all of these systems can be described in a Hamiltonian framework in which the Poisson matrix $\mathcal{J}$ is supplemented by a resistance matrix $\mathcal{R}$. While such resistive-Hamiltonian systems are manifestly non-conservative, we construct higher-degree Poisson matrices via the Jordan product as $\mathcal{N} = \mathcal{J} \mathcal{R} + \mathcal{R} \mathcal{J}$, thereby leading to new bi-Hamiltonian systems. Finally, we discuss conformal Hamiltonian dynamics on Poisson manifolds and demonstrate that by appropriately choosing the underlying parameters, the reduced three-wave-interaction model as well as the Chen and L\"u systems can be described in this manner where the concomitant non-conservative part of the dynamics is described with the aid of the Euler vector field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A geometric interpretation of the equinoctial elements is given with a connection to orthogonal rotations and attitude dynamics in Euclidean 3-space. An identification is made between the equinoctial elements and classic Rodrigues parameters. A new set of equinoctial elements are developed using the modified Rodrigues parameters, thereby removing the coordinate singularity for retrograde equatorial orbits present in previous versions of these elements. A low-thrust trajectory optimization problem is set up using the new elements to numerically verify convergence for the two-point boundary problem, as compared to their predecessors.</description>

      <title>A dynamical approach to studying the Lee-Yang zeros for the Potts Model on the Cayley Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $Z_n(z,t)$ denote the partition function of the $q$-state Potts Model on the rooted binary Cayley tree of depth~$n$. Here, $z = {\rm e}^{-h/T}$ and $t = {\rm e}^{-J/T}$ with $h$ denoting an externally applied magnetic field, $T$ the temperature, and $J$ a coupling constant. One can interpret $z$ as a ``magnetic field-like'' variable and $t$ as a ``temperature-like'' variable. Physical values $h \in \mathbb{R}$, $T &gt; 0$, and $J \in \mathbb{R}$ correspond to $t \in (0,\infty)$ and $z \in (0,\infty)$. For any fixed $t_0 \in (0,\infty)$ and fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we consider the complex zeros of $Z_n(z,t_0)$ and how they accumulate on the ray $(0,\infty)$ of physical values for $z$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. In the ferromagnetic case ($J &gt; 0$ or equivalently $t \in (0,1)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to at most one point on $(0,\infty)$ which we describe using explicit formulae. In the antiferromagnetic case $(J &lt; 0$ or equivalently $t \in (1,\infty)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to finitely many points of $(0,\infty)$, which we again describe with explicit formulae. The same results hold for the unrooted Cayley tree of branching number two.
  These results are proved by adapting a renormalization procedure that was previously used in the case of the Ising model on the Cayley Tree by M\"uller-Hartmann and Zittartz (1974 and 1977), Barata and Marchetti (1997), and Barata and Goldbaum (2001). We then use methods from complex dynamics and, more specifically, the active/passive dichotomy for iteration of a marked point, along with detailed analysis of the renormalization mappings, to prove the main results.</description>

      <title>On simultaneously preperiodic points for one-parameter families of polynomials in characteristic $p$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a field $L$ of characteristic $p$, a polynomial $f \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p[x]$ and $\alpha, \beta \in L$, let $\mathrm{Prep}(f;\alpha,\beta)$ be the set of all $\lambda \in \overline{L}$ such that both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are preperiodic under the action of $f_{\lambda}(x) := f(x) + \lambda$. Ghioca and Hsia proved that for certain families of polynomials, this set is infinite if and only if $f(\alpha)=f(\beta)$ or $\alpha, \beta \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$. Building on their work, we determine when $\mathrm{Prep}(f;\alpha,\beta)$ is infinite for most of the remaining binomial cases that were left open. Specifically, let $f(x)=c_1 x^{d_1} + c_2 x^{d_2} \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p[x]$, where $c_i \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p^*$, $1 \le d_1 &lt; d_2$ and $d_i=p^{\ell_i}s_i$ with $\ell_i \ge 0$ and $p \nmid s_i$. We prove that if $p^{\ell_2}(s_2-1) &lt; p^{\ell_1}(s_1-1)$, then $\mathrm{Prep}(f;\alpha,\beta)$ is infinite if and only if $f(\alpha)=f(\beta)$ or $\alpha, \beta \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$. The key idea of the proof is to use the parameters $\lambda_{\overline{\alpha}} := \overline{\alpha} - f(\overline{\alpha})$ associated to suitable elements $\overline{\alpha} \in \overline{L}$ satisfying $f(\overline{\alpha})=f(\alpha)$. As an application, we extend the work of Asgarli and Ghioca on the colliding orbits problem to binomials satisfying $s_2&gt;1$ and $p^{\ell_2}(s_2-1) &lt; p^{\ell_1}(s_1-1)$.</description>

      <title>Overlapping Schwarz Scheme for Linear-Quadratic Programs in Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an optimize-then-discretize framework for solving linear-quadratic optimal control problems (OCP) governed by time-inhomogeneous ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Our method employs a modified overlapping Schwarz decomposition based on the Pontryagin Minimum Principle, partitioning the temporal domain into overlapping intervals and independently solving Hamiltonian systems in continuous time. We demonstrate that the convergence is ensured by appropriately updating the boundary conditions of the individual Hamiltonian dynamics. The cornerstone of our analysis is to prove that the exponential decay of sensitivity (EDS) exhibited in discrete-time OCPs carries over to the continuous-time setting. Unlike the discretize-then-optimize approach, our method can flexibly incorporate different numerical integration methods for solving the resulting Hamiltonian two-point boundary-value subproblems, including adaptive-time integrators. A numerical experiment on a linear-quadratic OCP illustrates the practicality of our approach in broad scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of Markov shifts (part I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove central limit theorems, Berry-Esseen type theorems, almost sure invariance principles, large deviations and Livsic type regularity for partial sums of the form $S_n=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}f_j(...,X_{j-1},X_j,X_{j+1},...)$, where $(X_j)$ is an inhomogeneous Markov chain satisfying some mixing assumptions and $f_j$ is a sequence of sufficiently regular functions. Even though the case of non-stationary chains and time dependent functions $f_j$ is more challenging, our results seem to be new already for stationary Markov chains. They also seem to be new for non-stationary Bernoulli shifts (that is when $(X_j)$ are independent but not identically distributed). This paper is the first one in a series of two papers. In \cite{Work} we will prove local limit theorems including developing the related reduction theory in the sense of \cite{DolgHaf LLT, DS}.</description>
