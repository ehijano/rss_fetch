      <title>Uncharted Waters: Selling a New Product Robustly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When introducing a novel product, a seller sets a price and decides how much information to provide to a buyer, who may incur a search cost to discover an outside option. The buyer knows the outside option distribution; the seller knows only its mean and bounds. Seeking "robustness," the seller evaluates strategies based on guaranteed profits, balancing search deterrence against surplus extraction. Providing information can deter search and boost demand but requires offering the buyer a higher payoff via a lower price. Results help explain the variations in information provision among new products and suggest that lower search costs can raise prices and lead to noisier information, potentially harming consumers.</description>

      <title>Screening with damages and ordeals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A welfare-maximizing designer allocates two kinds of goods using two wasteful screening instruments: ordeals, which enter agents' utilities additively, and damages, which harm agents in proportion to their values for the goods. If agents have common valuations for one of the goods, damages always lead to Pareto-dominated mechanisms: any allocation using damages can also be implemented with ordeals alone, while also leaving greater rents to inframarginal types. However, using damages can be optimal when agents' valuations for both goods are heterogeneous: with multidimensional types, the two devices differ in how they sort agents into available options, with the optimal sorting sometimes requiring the use of damages. I nevertheless identify distributional conditions under which using damages is not optimal. In those cases, the optimal mechanism produces an efficient allocation by posting "market-clearing" ordeals for each type of good.</description>

      <title>Inequality in the Age of Pseudonymity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inequality measures such as the Gini coefficient are used to inform and motivate policymaking, and are increasingly applied to digital platforms. We analyze how measures fare in pseudonymous settings, as common to internet-based or blockchain-based platforms. One key challenge that arises is the ability of actors to create multiple fake identities under fictitious false names, also known as ``Sybils.'' While some actors may do so to preserve their privacy, we show that this can inadvertently distort inequality metrics. As we show, when using inequality measures that satisfy literature's canonical set of desired properties, the presence of Sybils in an economy implies that it is impossible to properly measure the economy's inequality. Then, we present several classes of Sybil-proof measures that satisfy relaxed versions of the aforementioned desired properties, and, by fully characterizing them, we prove that the structure imposed restricts their ability to assess inequality at a fine-grained level. In addition, we prove that popular inequality metrics, including the famous Gini coefficient, are vulnerable to Sybil manipulations, and examine the dynamics that result in the creation of Sybils, whether in pseudonymous settings or traditional ones.</description>

      <title>Information Sufficiency and the Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:1802.04595v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a formal framework for analyzing information sufficiency in cooperative decision-making. Unlike models of incomplete information, we consider settings where agents may lack conceptual access to some cooperative opportunities. Using Gentzen-style sequent calculus, we define a syntactic criterion, called $\textsf{C}_i$-acceptability, to determine when a proposed distribution is justifiable given limited structural information. We show that, under a mild assumption that each coalition's potential is known to at least one member, the set of unanimously accepted payoffs coincides with the core. This reinterprets the core not as a predictive solution, but as the boundary of what can be justified under minimal information. Moreover, our results offer a new perspective on Debreu-Scarf's theorem: while the core converges to the competitive equilibrium in replicated markets, this convergence obscures a key asymmetry. Competitive equilibrium requires only local information--preferences and prices--regardless of market size, whereas reaching the core entails increasing informational demands that may ultimately exceed any agent's cognitive capacity.</description>

      <title>Implementation with Uncertain Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a full implementation problem with a state unknown to the designer but known to agents, where agents have uncertain evidence privately drawn from state-dependent distributions. Stochastic evidence enables ``perfect deceptions,'' where agents' reports can mimic the evidence distribution of a false state, making differentiation impossible for any mechanism. This yields our main result: a necessary and sufficient condition, No Perfect Deceptions (NPD), for implementation in (mixed-strategy) Bayesian Nash equilibria. The solution requires novel techniques like belief elicitation via competing scoring rules, and an endogenous ``test allocation'' using the evidence structure. For informationally small agents (McLean and Postlewaite (2002)), a generalized condition (GNPD) is sufficient. Our mechanisms work for two or more agents, avoid integer/modulo games, and use limited liability transfers that vanish in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Network Threshold Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new lens for studying threshold games played on networks when the thresholds are heterogeneous. These are games where agents have two possible actions, and prefer action 1 if and only if enough of their neighbours choose action 1. We propose a transformation of the network that `absorbs' the heterogeneity in thresholds into the network. This allows us to characterise equilibria in terms of the k-core -- a well-studied measure of network cohesiveness -- of the transformed network. Our model is also the direct analogy to the workhorse model of Ballester et al. (2006) when actions are 0 or 1. Further, our binary action version exhibits a remarkable stability property. When agents have linear-quadratic preferences, the k-core of the transformed network characterises the unique subgame perfect equilibrium of a sequential move version of the game -- no matter what order agents move in.</description>

      <title>Split the Yield, Share the Risk: Pricing, Hedging and Fixed rates in DeFi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first formal treatment of \emph{yield tokenization}, a mechanism that decomposes yield-bearing assets into principal and yield components to facilitate risk transfer and price discovery in decentralized finance (DeFi). We propose a model that characterizes yield token dynamics using stochastic differential equations. We derive a no-arbitrage pricing framework for yield tokens, enabling their use in hedging future yield volatility and managing interest rate risk in decentralized lending pools. Taking DeFi lending as our focus, we show how both borrowers and lenders can use yield tokens to achieve optimal hedging outcomes and mitigate exposure to adversarial interest rate manipulation. Furthermore, we design automated market makers (AMMs) that incorporate a menu of bonding curves to aggregate liquidity from participants with heterogeneous risk preferences. This leads to an efficient and incentive-compatible mechanism for trading yield tokens and yield futures. Building on these foundations, we propose a modular \textit{fixed-rate} lending protocol that synthesizes on-chain yield token markets and lending pools, enabling robust interest rate discovery and enhancing capital efficiency. Our work provides the theoretical underpinnings for risk management and fixed-income infrastructure in DeFi, offering practical mechanisms for stable and sustainable yield markets.</description>
