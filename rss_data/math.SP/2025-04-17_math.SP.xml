      <title>Spectral Multiplicity Bounds for Jacobi Operators on Star-Like Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral multiplicity of Jacobi operators on star-like graphs with $m$ branches. Recently, it was established that the multiplicity of the singular continuous spectrum is at most $m$. Building on these developments and using tools from the theory of generalized eigenfunction expansions, we improve this bound by showing that the singular continuous spectrum has multiplicity at most $m-1$. We also show that this bound is sharp, namely, we construct operators with purely singular continuous spectrum of multiplicity $m-1$.</description>

      <title>Some Remarks On Krein--von Neumann Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey various properties of Krein--von Neumann extensions $S_K$ and the reduced Krein--von Neumann operator $\hatt S_K$ in connection with a strictly positive (symmetric) operator $S$ with nonzero deficiency indices. In particular, we focus on the resolvents of $S_K$ and $\hatt S_K$ and of the trace ideal properties of the resolvent of $\hatt S_K$, and make some comparisons with the corresponding properties of the resolvent of the Friedrichs extension $S_F$. We also recall a parametrization of all nonnegative self-adjoint extensions of $S$ and various Krein-type resolvent formulas for any two relatively prime self-adjoint extensions of $S$, utilizing a Donoghue-type $M$-operator (i.e., an energy parameter dependent Dirichlet-to-Neumann-type map).</description>

      <title>On positive Jacobi matrices with compact inverses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider positive Jacobi matrices $J$ with compact inverses and consequently with purely discrete spectra. A number of properties of the corresponding sequence of orthogonal polynomials is studied including the convergence of their zeros, the vague convergence of the zero counting measures and of the Christoffel--Darboux kernels on the diagonal. Particularly, if the inverse of $J$ belongs to some Schatten class, we identify the asymptotic behaviour of the sequence of orthogonal polynomials and express it in terms of its regularized characteristic function. In the even more special case when the inverse of $J$ belongs to the trace class we derive various formulas for the orthogonality measure, eigenvectors of $J$ as well as for the functions of the second kind and related objects. These general results are given a more explicit form in the case when $-J$ is a generator of a Birth--Death process. Among others we provide a formula for the trace of the inverse of $J$. We illustrate our results by introducing and studying a modification of $q$-Laguerre polynomials corresponding to a determinate moment problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07873v2 Announce Type: replace

      <title>Shuffled Linear Regression via Spectral Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shuffled linear regression (SLR) seeks to estimate latent features through a linear transformation, complicated by unknown permutations in the measurement dimensions. This problem extends traditional least-squares (LS) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) approaches by jointly estimating the permutation, resulting in shuffled LS and shuffled LASSO formulations. Existing methods, constrained by the combinatorial complexity of permutation recovery, often address small-scale cases with limited measurements. In contrast, we focus on large-scale SLR, particularly suited for environments with abundant measurement samples. We propose a spectral matching method that efficiently resolves permutations by aligning spectral components of the measurement and feature covariances. Rigorous theoretical analyses demonstrate that our method achieves accurate estimates in both shuffled LS and shuffled LASSO settings, given a sufficient number of samples. Furthermore, we extend our approach to address simultaneous pose and correspondence estimation in image registration tasks. Experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world image registration scenarios show that our method outperforms existing algorithms in both estimation accuracy and registration performance.</description>
