      <title>Microscopic theory of quantum physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a microscopic framework in which quantum phenomena emerge from particle-particle interactions governed by Newton's second law of motion. Within this approach, stationary states and quantized energy spectra arise naturally for the particle in a box. The same dynamics reproduces interference fringes in the double-slit experiment. Finally, I derive the Schr\"odinger equation from the underlying principles.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Predictive Quantum Feedback: Extending Qubit Lifetimes Beyond the Wiseman-Milburn Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amplitude damping fundamentally limits qubit lifetimes by irreversibly leaking energy and information into the environment. Standard Wiseman--Milburn feedback offers only modest improvement because it acts on a single measured quadrature and its corrective drive is degraded by loop delay. We introduce a compact hybrid upgrade with two components: (i) a coherently coupled \emph{ancilla} qubit that receives the homodyne current and feeds back \emph{quantum-coherently} on the system, recovering information from \emph{both} field quadratures and intentionally engineered to decay much faster than the system; and (ii) a lightweight supervised predictor that forecasts the near-future homodyne current, phase-aligning the correction to overcome hardware latency. A Lindblad treatment yields closed-form effective decay rates: the ancilla suppresses the emission channel by a cooperativity factor, while the predictor further suppresses the residual decay in proportion to forecast quality. Using IBM-scale parameters (baseline \(T_1 = 50~\mu\mathrm{s}\)), numerical simulations surpass the W--M limit, achieving \(\sim 3\!-\!4\times\) longer \(T_1\) together with improved population retention and integrated energy. The method is modular and hardware-compatible: ancilla coupling and supervised prediction can be added to existing W--M loops to convert leaked information into a precise, time-advanced corrective drive. We also include a detailed, student-friendly derivation of the effective rates for both ancilla-assisted and prediction-enhanced feedback, making the impact of each design element analytically transparent.</description>

      <title>Skeleton of isometric Tensor Network States for Abelian String-Net Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct parametrized isometric tensor network states -- referred to as skeletons -- that allow us to explore phases of abelian topological order and can be efficiently implemented on quantum processors. We obtain stable finite correlation length deformations of string-net fixed points, which are constructed both by conserving virtual symmetries of the tensor and by imposing local isometry constraints. They connect distinct topological phases via a shared critical point, thereby providing analytically tractable examples of phase transitions beyond anyon condensation. By mapping such classes of 2D tensor networks to 1D stochastic automata with local update rules, we show that expectation values of generalized Pauli strings of arbitrary weight can be efficiently computed using classical methods. Therefore these skeletons not only serve as an organizing principle for abelian topological order but also provide a non-trivial testbed for quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Detection of many-body entanglement partitions in a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to detect entanglement partitions of multipartite quantum systems, by exploiting their inherent symmetries. Structures like genuinely multipartite entanglement, $m$-separability and entanglement depth are detected as very special cases. This formulation enables us to characterize all the entanglement partitions of all three- and four- partite states and witnesses with unitary and permutation symmetry. In particular, we find and parametrize a complete set of bound entangled states therein. For larger systems, we provide a large family of analytical witnesses detecting many-body states of arbitrary size where none of the parties is separable from the rest. This method relies on weak Schur sampling with projective measurements, and thus can be implemented in a quantum computer. Beyond physics, our results extend to the mathematical literature: we establish new inequalities between matrix immanants, and characterize the set of such inequalities for matrices of size three and four.</description>

      <title>Optimizing two-dimensional isometric tensor networks with quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for approximating the ground state of two-dimensional quantum systems using an isometric tensor network ansatz, which maps naturally to quantum circuits. Inspired by the density matrix renormalization group, we optimize tensors sequentially by diagonalizing a series of effective Hamiltonians. These are constructed using a tomography-inspired method on a qubit subset whose size depends only on the bond dimension. Our approach leverages quantum computers to enable accurate solutions without relying on approximate contractions, circumventing the exponential complexity faced by classical techniques. We demonstrate our method on the two-dimensional (2D) transverse-field Ising model, achieving ground-state optimization on up to 25 qubits with modest quantum overhead -- significantly less than standard solutions based on variational quantum eigensolvers. Overall, our results offer a path towards scalable variational quantum algorithms in both noisy and fault-tolerant regimes.</description>

      <title>Realizing Unitary $k$-designs with a Single Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a single-quench protocol that generates unitary $k$-designs with minimal control. A system first evolves under a random Hamiltonian $H_1$; at a switch time $t_s \geq t_{\mathrm{Th}}$ (the Thouless time), it is quenched to an independently drawn $H_2$ from the same ensemble and then evolves under $H_2$. This single quench breaks residual spectral correlations that prevent strictly time-independent chaotic dynamics from forming higher-order designs. The resulting ensemble approaches a unitary $k$-design using only a single control operation -- far simpler than Brownian schemes with continuously randomized couplings or protocols that apply random quenches at short time intervals. Beyond offering a direct route to Haar-like randomness, the protocol yields an operational, measurement-friendly definition of $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$ and provides a quantitative diagnostic of chaoticity. It further enables symmetry-resolved and open-system extensions, circuit-level single-quench analogs, and immediate applications to randomized measurements, benchmarking, and tomography.</description>

      <title>Trading athermality for nonstabiliserness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonstabiliserness is a fundamental resource for quantum advantage, capturing how much a quantum state breaks the symmetries that would make it classically simulable. Can nonstabiliserness be generated from stabiliser states simply by coupling them to a heat bath? We explore the thermodynamic limits of nonstabiliserness under minimal assumptions and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for when such a process can create it from an initial stabiliser state. This provides an analytic characterisation of the nonstabiliser states that are reachable in this way, together with quantitative bounds on their degree of nonstabiliserness. Our framework also identifies optimal regimes, specifying Hamiltonians that maximise nonstabiliserness generation and the critical temperatures at which it emerges.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Born Machines: Classical training of quantum generative models based on Fermion Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum generative learning is a promising application of quantum computers, but faces several trainability challenges, including the difficulty in experimental gradient estimations. For certain structured quantum generative models, however, expectation values of local observables can be efficiently computed on a classical computer, enabling fully classical training without quantum gradient evaluations. Although training is classically efficient, sampling from these circuits is still believed to be classically hard, so inference must be carried out on a quantum device, potentially yielding a computational advantage. In this work, we introduce Fermionic Born Machines as an example of such classically trainable quantum generative models. The model employs parameterized magic states and fermionic linear optical (FLO) transformations with learnable parameters. The training exploits a decomposition of the magic states into Gaussian operators, which permits efficient estimation of expectation values. Furthermore, the specific structure of the ansatz induces a loss landscape that exhibits favorable characteristics for optimization. The FLO circuits can be implemented, via fermion-to-qubit mappings, on qubit architectures to sample from the learned distribution during inference. Numerical experiments on systems up to 160 qubits demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and training framework.</description>

      <title>Halving the Cost of Controlled Time-Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is a promising application for quantum computing. Quantum simulation algorithms may require the ability to control the time evolution unitary. Naive techniques to control a unitary can substantially increase the required computational resources. A standard approach to controlling Trotterized time evolution doubles the number of single-qubit arbitrary rotations. Here, we describe a compilation scheme that does not increase the number of arbitrary rotations for symmetric Trotterizations, which applies to second-order and higher Suzuki-Trotter decompositions. This halves the number of arbitrary rotations required to implement controlled, Trotterized time evolution compared to the standard approach. Arbitrary rotations contribute significantly to resource estimates in a fault-tolerant architecture due to the number of required magic states. Therefore, arbitrary rotations dominate the $T$-cost of fault-tolerant implementations of quantum simulation. This construction reduces the number of arbitrary rotations for controlled Trotter evolution to that of uncontrolled Trotter evolution, thereby reducing the cost of fault-tolerant quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Linguistic Predictability and Search Complexity: How Linguistic Redundancy Constraints the Landscape of Classical and Quantum Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the quantitative relationship between linguistic regularities and computational search complexity through a hybrid classical-quantum framework applied to Renaissance Italian texts. Using four representative works from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries-Il Principe (Machiavelli), Il Cortegiano (Castiglione), I Ricordi (Guicciardini), and Orlando Furioso (Ariosto)-we construct character-based n-gram models under both a historically grounded 25-letter orthography and the full modern Italian alphabet. These models provide corpus-derived probabilistic baselines for evaluating substitution-cipher search processes. Combining classical hill climbing and simulated annealing with Grover-style quantum-inspired estimates and a QUBO annealing formulation, we quantify how the probability that a key produces a linguistically plausible decryption (pgood) relates to expected computational effort. Across cipher lengths from 200 to 1000 characters, empirical results confirm the predicted dependence of Grover oracle calls on 1/sqrt(pgood) and show that longer texts yield sharper score distributions and smaller feasible key regions. Overall, the findings establish a link between linguistic redundancy and search-space contraction, providing an empirical framework for comparing classical, quantum-inspired, and idealized quantum search dynamics under unified corpus-driven constraints.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Time Evolution from a Correlation-Efficient Quantum Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the correlation-efficient time-evolution (CETE) algorithm for simulating quantum many-body dynamics. CETE recasts each step of time evolution as a time-independent correlation problem: the ansatz begins from a mean-field single Slater determinant and is then correlated to capture the true time-evolved state. We derive this exact ansatz from a contraction of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation onto the space of two electrons. Unlike conventional evolution by sequential short-time propagators, which must both correlate and decorrelate the state as the degree of correlation fluctuates in time, CETE correlates only once. This substantially reduces circuit depth, extending accessible simulation times on near-term quantum devices. We demonstrate the approach by simulating the time evolution of the hydrogen molecule's electronic wavefunction, highlighting the potential for the CETE algorithm to simulate strongly correlated systems on near-term devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has traditionally centered around the discrete variable paradigm. A new direction is the inclusion of continuous variable modes and the consideration of a hybrid continuous-discrete approach to quantum computing. In this paper, we discuss some of the advantages of this modality, and lay out a number of potential applications that can make use of it; these include applications from physics, chemistry, and computer science. We also briefly overview some of the algorithmic and software considerations for this new paradigm.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum photonic routing using a coupled giant-atom-like array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a quantum routing mechanism utilizing a giant-atom-like array coupled to two one-dimensional waveguides. The giant-atom-like array is formed by a one-dimensional array of three-level-systems. In the regime of strong atom-waveguide coupling and weak inter-atomic interactions, this system functions as an efficient and directionally controllable single-photon router. Our analysis shows that the routing behavior is influenced by effective phase accumulation and interference effects, which can be adjusted by varying the number of coupling sites $N$, the photon energy $E$, and the inter-atomic coupling strength $J$. Importantly, we identify configurations that enable perfect photon transfer ($100 \%$ efficiency) over a wide range of energies and that provide dynamic control over the output channel. In addition, we investigate how the system responds to changes in its internal parameters, demonstrating the robustness and scalability of routing performance. These findings underscore the potential of this setup for implementation in reconfigurable and integrated quantum photonic networks.</description>

      <title>Postselected Entangled States by Photon Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Postselection is a non-deterministic mechanism to entangle subsystems, often used in weakly-excited systems. We here show how highly-excited ensembles of two-level emitters can be entangled by photon detection. A collective spin is formed, characterized by a squeezing parameter detected by far-field measurements. While decoherence is detrimental to this conditional entanglement, successive photon detections act as a purification process and restores the spin squeezing. Our work opens up new avenues for the generation of postselected entanglement in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Non-classical Properties of Entangled Coherent States via Post-Selected von Neumann Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study systematically investigates the modulation mechanism of post-selected weak measurement (WM) on the non-classical properties of entangled coherent states (ECSs). The primary goal is achieving controllable enhancement of quantum resources such as entanglement and squeezing, while minimising disturbance to the quantum state. We theoretically analyze the post-selected weak measurement process, and its effectiveness in amplifying the non-classical features of ECSs. The von Neumann measurement model is employed to analytically describe the weak-value amplification of the pointer state. It is demonstrated that a significant enhancement of squeezing can be achieved by tuning the measurement coupling strength. The joint Wigner function analysis in phase space further reveals that, as the coupling strength increases, the coherent structure of the state evolves from symmetric double peaks to multi-branch quantum interference fringes. The entanglement, quantified by the Hillery-Zubairy criterion, exhibits a pronounced increase with stronger coupling, while the quantum Fisher information indicates a systematic improvement in phase estimation precision. The results obtained establish a tunable weak measurement framework for precise manipulation of continuous-variable entangled states. This provides a feasible theoretical pathway for enhancing quantum metrology and measurement-based state engineering.</description>

      <title>Canonical quantization for Equilibrium Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a canonical quantization of Equilibrium Thermodynamics by applying Dirac's theory of constrained systems. Thermodynamic variables are treated as conjugate pairs of coordinates and momenta, allowing extensive and intensive quantities to be promoted to operators in a Hilbert space. The formalism is applied to the ideal gas, the van der Waals gas, and the photon gas, illustrating both first- and second-class quantization procedures. For the ideal gas, a Schr\"odinger-like equation emerges in which entropy plays the role of time, and the wave function acquires a phase determined by the internal energy. A pseudo-Hermitian framework restores Hermiticity of the temperature operator and establishes the equivalence among constraint realizations. The approach naturally leads to thermodynamic uncertainty relations and suggests extensions to quantum and topological phase transitions, as well as black-hole and non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectrotemporal encoding of optical quantum information is emerging as a powerful tool in quantum information technology. Processing of spectrotemporal information has recently been demonstrated in multi-mode quantum memories, based on extensions to memory protocols. We simulate one such process, the fractional Fourier transform, in a system based on a dual quantum memory composed of successive gradient echo memory and electromagnetically-induced transparency operations. We demonstrate the potential of electromagnetically-induced transparency systems for spectrotemporal processing.</description>

      <title>Entropic uncertainty under indefinite causal order and input-output direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropic uncertainty relations quantify the limits on the predictability of quantum measurements. When the measured system is correlated with a quantum memory, these limits are described by the memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relation (MA-EUR). We examine the behavior of MA-EUR when the memory qubit undergoes noisy dynamics implemented via high-order controlled processes, namely, the quantum switch and the quantum time-flip. We consider a setting in which the control qubit is the very system on which the measurements are performed, while the target qubit serves as a noisy quantum memory. Focusing on Pauli channels, we show that feeding them into the quantum switch and the quantum time-flip can significantly reduce the total entropic uncertainty as compared to their direct application. Our results reveal that indefinite causal order and input-output direction can serve as resources to mitigate the effects of noise in the context of MA-EUR and its applications.</description>

      <title>Semi-device-independent channel identification with communication matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We look into the task of differentiating between any two quantum channels and reconstructing them from the obtained measurement statistics with possibly limited information about the experimental set-up. We employ the communication matrix formalism where the measurement statistics of a prepare-and-measure scenario is represented as a stochastic communication matrix. In order to differentiate between any two quantum channels, the informational completeness of the set-up is both necessary and sufficient. On the other hand, if we want to uniquely characterize any quantum channel, in addition we also need to have a complete description of the set-up. We show that in many important cases we can deduce this information directly from the communication matrix of the set-up before applying the channel. Given that we trust the dimension of the system, we show that we can deduce the information completeness of the set-up directly from the rank of the communication matrix. Furthermore, we show that another quantity of the communication matrix, called the information storability, can be used to self-test the set-up (up to unitary or antiunitary freedom) for an important class of states and measurements. This provides us a semi-device-independent way to identify quantum channels from the prepare-and-measure statistics. Lastly, we consider scenarios where we might have some additional information about the channels or additional resources at our disposal which could help us relax some of the assumptions of the proposed scenario.</description>

      <title>Generating spatially separated correlated multiphoton states in nonlinear waveguide quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly correlated multi-photon states are indispensable resources for advanced quantum technologies, yet their deterministic generation remains challenging due to the inherent weak nonlinearity in most optical systems. Here, we propose a scalable architecture for producing correlated few-photon entangled states via cascaded inelastic scattering in a nonlinear waveguide. When a single photon scatters off a far detuned excited two-level emitter, it coherently converts into a propagating doublon, a bound photon pair with anomalous dispersion. This doublon can subsequently scatter off a downstream excited emitter to further convert into a triplon, and so on, thereby establishing a photon-number amplification cascade $|\cdot \rangle \!\! \rightarrow \!\! |\!\!: \rangle \!\! \rightarrow \! \! |\!\!\therefore \rangle \!\! \to \!\! ...$ Central to this process is the concept of a pseudo-giant atom, which we introduce here to capture the non-local scattering potential emergent from the wave functions of bound states. By implementing this scheme using a real giant atom with multiple engineered coupling points, we achieve unidirectional and full controllable photon conversion without backscattering. The resulting output state forms a programmable superposition of spatially and temporally isolated photon-number components, automatically sorted by their distinct group velocities. This work opens a new paradigm in quantum state engineering, enabling on-demand generation of complex multi-photon resources for quantum simulation, metrology, and scalable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Parallelizing Program Execution on Distributed Quantum Systems via Compiler/Hardware Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computers continue to improve and support larger, more complex computations, smart control hardware and compilers are needed to efficiently leverage the capabilities of these systems.
  This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the execution of quantum algorithms on distributed quantum systems. The proposed method involves the development of a hardware design that supports parallel instruction execution and a compiler that modifies the order of instructions to increase parallelism opportunities. The hardware design can be flexibly configured to facilitate parallel execution of instructions that have identical parameters. Furthermore, the compiler uses the underlying hardware constraints to intelligently reorder and decompose instructions to avoid dependencies.
  The compiler, hardware, and their combination are evaluated using a runtime calculator and a benchmark quantum algorithm set. The results demonstrate a significant speedup, achieving a maximum average speedup of 16.5x and a maximum single-benchmark speedup of 56.2x relative to a baseline, serial execution model. Furthermore, we show a speedup can be obtained across all benchmarks using any of the proposed hardware schemes, although the degree of speedup is largely dependent on the type of quantum algorithm. Taken together, the results of this paper represent a significant step towards realizing high-performance quantum computing systems.</description>

      <title>Compiler design for hardware specific decomposition optimizations, tailored to diamond NV centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in quantum algorithms as well as in control hardware designs are continuously being made. These quantum algorithms, expressed as quantum circuits, need to be translated to a set of instructions from a defined quantum instruction-set architecture (ISA), which are executed by the control hardware. These translations can be done by a compiler, targeting different qubit technologies. Specifically for diamond NV centers, no compiler exists to perform this translation. Therefore, in this paper we present a compiler designed for quantum computers utilizing diamond NV center specific instructions, such as direct carbon control and partial swaps, to reduce execution times and gate count. Additionally, our compiler adds on top of general compilers by allowing classical instructions to perform state tomography and measurement-based operations. The output of the compiler is tested in a diamond NV center specific simulator. Comparing a general compiler output with the diamond NV center specific output of our compiler while applying decoherence and depolarization noise showed reduced noise effects due to diamond specific decomposition. The compiler was also tested to perform state tomography and measurement-based operations, which showed to be functional. Our results show that we have successfully created a compiler with integrated classical and quantum instructions support, which can improve circuit execution fidelity by utilizing diamond specific optimizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many living organisms can exploit quantum mechanical effects to gain distinct biological advantages. In plants, photosynthesis uses quantum coherence to achieve near 100% efficiency in energy transfer. With advances in experimental techniques, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy can reveal dynamic processes such as coherence and coupling within a system, and it plays an important role in studying energy transfer in photosynthesis. On the theory side, methods such as the generalized Bloch-Redfield theory and the hierarchical equations of motion are used to model photosynthetic systems. Quantum simulation, as a high-efficiency and low-complexity approach, has also made progress across various platforms in the study of photosynthesis. In recent years, a series of studies has introduced quantum coherence into artificial systems to enhance energy transfer efficiency, laying the groundwork for the design of coherent devices with efficient energy transport. Birds can use the weak geomagnetic field and spin-dependent chemical reactions to detect direction. Theoretical frameworks for animal navigation include magnetite-based mechanisms, magnetoreceptor genes, and the radical-pair mechanism. Quantum simulations of navigation have also advanced on multiple platforms. Inspired by animal navigation, diverse quantum effects have been applied to improve sensing and to support navigation tasks. This paper presents a comprehensive review of progress on quantum coherence in photosynthesis and avian navigation, along with related theoretical methods, quantum simulation approaches, and research on quantum coherent devices.</description>

      <title>Robust Two-Qubit Geometric Phase Gates using Amplitude and Frequency Ramping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method for generating entanglement between trapped atomic ions based on adiabatically ramped state-dependent forces. By ramping both the amplitude of the state-dependent force and the motional mode frequencies, we realize an entangling operation that is robust to motional mode occupation and drifts in the mode frequencies. We measure Bell state fidelities above 0.99 across a broad range of ramp parameters and with motional occupations up to 10 phonons. This technique enables high-fidelity entangling operations without ground-state cooling, has a reduced calibration overhead, and is well suited for both quantum logic spectroscopy applications and scalable quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum speed-ups for solving semidefinite relaxations of polynomial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum algorithms for approximating Lasserre's hierarchy values for polynomial optimization. Let $f,g_1,\ldots,g_m$ be real polynomials in $n$ variables and $f^\star$ the infimum of $f$ over the semialgebraic set $S(g)=\{x: g_i(x)\ge 0\}$. Let $\lambda_k$ be the value of the order-$k$ Lasserre relaxation. Assume either (i) $f^\star=\lambda_k$ and the optimum is attained in the $\ell_1$-ball of radius $1/2$, or (ii) $S(g)$ lies in the simplex $\{x\ge 0: \sum_j x_j\le 1/2\}$, and the constraints define this simplex. After an appropriate coefficient rescaling, we give a quantum algorithm based on matrix multiplicative weights that approximates $\lambda_k$ to accuracy $\varepsilon&gt;0$ with runtime, for fixed $k$, \[ O(n^k\varepsilon^{-4}+n^{k/2}\varepsilon^{-5}),\qquad O\!\left(s_g\!\left[n^k\varepsilon^{-4}+\!\left(n^{k}+\!\sum_{i=1}^m n^{k-d_i}\right)^{1/2}\!\varepsilon^{-5}\right]\right), \] where $s_g$ bounds the sparsity of the coefficient-matching matrices associated with the constraints. Classical matrix multiplicative-weights methods scale as $O(n^{3k}\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon))$ even in the unconstrained case. As an example, we obtain an $O(n\varepsilon^{-4}+\sqrt{n}\varepsilon^{-5})$ quantum algorithm for portfolio optimization, improving over the classical $O(n^{\omega+1}\log(1/\varepsilon))$ bound with $\omega\approx2.373$.
  Our approach builds on and sharpens the analysis of Apeldoorn and Gily\'en for the SDPs arising in polynomial optimization. We also show how to implement the required block encodings without QRAM. Under the stated assumptions, our method achieves a super-quadratic speedup in the problem dimension for computing Lasserre relaxations.</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes on Information Scrambling, Quantum Chaos, and Haar-Random States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information scrambling, the process by which quantum information spreads and becomes effectively inaccessible, is central to modern quantum statistical physics and quantum chaos. These lecture notes provide an introduction to information scrambling from both static and dynamical perspectives. The spectral properties of reduced density matrices arising from Haar-random states are developed through the geometry of the unitary group and the universal results of random matrix theory. This geometric framework yields universal, model-independent predictions for entanglement and spectral statistics, capturing generic features of quantum chaos without reference to microscopic details. Dynamical diagnostics such as the spectral form factor and out-of-time-ordered correlators further reveal the onset of chaos in time-dependent evolution.
  The notes are aimed at advanced undergraduate and graduate students in physics, mathematics, and computer science who are interested in the connections between quantum chaos, information dynamics, and quantum computing. Concepts such as entanglement growth, Haar randomness, random-matrix statistics, and unitary t-designs are introduced through their realization in random quantum circuits and circuit complexity. The same mathematical framework also underpins modern quantum-device benchmarking, where approximate unitary designs and random circuits translate geometric ideas into quantitative tools for assessing fidelity, noise, and scrambling efficiency in real quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Explicit block-encoding for partial differential equation-constrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization, where an optimization problem is subject to PDE constraints, arises in various applications such as design, control, and inference. Solving such problems is computationally demanding because it requires repeatedly solving a PDE and using its solution within an optimization process. In this paper, we first propose a fully coherent quantum algorithm for solving PDE-constrained optimization problems. The proposed method combines a quantum PDE solver that prepares the solution vector as a quantum state, and a quantum optimizer that assumes oracle access to a quantized objective function. The central idea is the explicit construction of the oracle in a form of block-encoding for the objective function, which coherently uses the output of a quantum PDE solver. This enables us to avoid classical access to the full solution that requires quantum state tomography canceling out the potential quantum speedups. We also derive the overall computational complexity of the proposed method with respect to parameters for optimization and PDE simulation, where quantum speedup is inherited from the underlying quantum PDE solver. We numerically demonstrate the validity of the proposed method by applications, including a parameter calibration problem in the Black-Scholes equation and a material parameter design problem in the wave equation. This work presents the concept of composing quantum subroutines so that the weakness of one (i.e., prohibitive readout overhead) is neutralized by the strength of another (i.e., coherent oracle access), toward a bottleneck-free quantum algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dirac delta function potential is considered within the real Hilbert space approach for complex wave functions, as well as quaternionic wave functions. As has been previously determined, the real Hilbert space approach enables the possibility of self-interacting physical systems. The self-interaction precludes confining states, and also imposes non-stationary quantum states, both of them representing novel situations that cannot be observed in terms of quantum wave functions. These results remark the differences between quaternionic quantum mechanics ($\mathbbm H$QM) and complex quantum mechanics ($\mathbbm C$QM), and also establish a method of solving the wave equation that may be applied to a variety of different cases.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions with qubits and qumodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a hybrid qubit-qumode framework for simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions. In this approach, fermionic matter fields are represented by qubits, while U(1) gauge fields are encoded in continuous-variable bosonic modes whose canonical quadratures capture the electric and vector-potential components of the theory. To reconcile the non-compact phase space of the qumodes with the compact U(1) gauge symmetry, we introduce and compare two complementary constraint-enforcement strategies: (i) a squeezing-based projection that confines qumode states to the unit circle through an effective modification of the inner product, and (ii) a method that dynamically enforces compactness via a penalty Hamiltonian term. We construct the corresponding hybrid Hamiltonian, derive its decomposition into experimentally accessible qubit-qumode gates, and analyze its spectrum in the analytically tractable single-plaquette limit. The hybrid formulation reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route toward simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures. Ground-state preparation and convergence are demonstrated using a continuous-variable extension of the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) algorithm, establishing a general framework for hybrid discrete-continuous quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Coherent regime of Kapitza-Dirac effect with electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron matter waves coherently diffract when passing through a periodic structure of light formed by two interfering light waves. In this so-called Kapitza-Dirac effect, the electron momentum changes due to absorption and emission of photons via stimulated Compton scattering. Until now, the effect has only been observed with low energy electrons due to the small momentum of a visible photon compared to the momentum of high energy electron leading to diffraction angles of 10^(-4) rad or smaller. We report on the observation of the Kapitza-Dirac effect in a scanning electron microscope using high energy (20 keV and 30 keV) electrons with de-Broglie wavelengths of 9 pm and 7 pm, respectively. The photon sidebands in the electron transverse momentum spectrum are detected in the convergent beam diffraction geometry using spatial filtering. As the coupling strength between the electrons and the light field increases, the sideband populations exhibit coherent, reversible oscillations among diffraction orders. The effect can serve as a coherent electron beam-splitter or a phase-plate in various types of electron microscopes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Hamiltonian-aware Quantum Natural Gradient Descent for Variational Quantum Eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most promising algorithms for current quantum devices. It employs a classical optimizer to iteratively update the parameters of a variational quantum circuit in order to search for the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. The efficacy of VQEs largely depends on the optimizer employed. Recent studies suggest that Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (QNG) can achieve faster convergence than vanilla gradient descent (VG), but at the cost of additional quantum resources to estimate Fubini-Study metric tensor in each optimization step. The Fubini-Study metric tensor used in QNG is related to the entire quantum state space and does not incorporate information about the target Hamiltonian. To take advantage of the structure of the Hamiltonian and address the limitation of additional computational cost in QNG, we propose Hamiltonian-aware Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (H-QNG). In H-QNG, we propose to use the Riemannian pullback metric induced from the lower-dimensional subspace spanned by the Hamiltonian terms onto the parameter space. We show that H-QNG inherits the desirable features of both approaches: the low quantum computational cost of VG and the reparameterization-invariance of QNG. We also validate its performance through numerical experiments on molecular Hamiltonians, showing that H-QNG achieves faster convergence to chemical accuracy while requiring fewer quantum computational resources.</description>

      <title>Link prediction with swarms of chiral quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing protein-protein interaction networks is a central challenge in network medicine, often addressed using link prediction algorithms. Recent studies suggest that quantum walk-based approaches hold promise for this task. In this paper, we build on these algorithms by introducing chirality through the addition of random phases in the Hamiltonian generators. The resulting additional degrees of freedom enable a more diverse exploration of the network, which we exploit by employing a swarm of chiral quantum walks. Thus, we enhance the predictive power of quantum walks on complex networks. Indeed, compared to a non-chiral algorithm, the chiral version exhibits greater robustness, making its performance less dependent on the optimal evolution time--a critical hyperparameter of the non-chiral model. This improvement arises from complementary dynamics introduced by chirality within the swarm. By analyzing multiple phase-sampling strategies, we identify configurations that achieve a practical trade-off: retaining the high predictive accuracy of the non-chiral algorithm at its optimal time while gaining the robustness typical of chirality. Our findings highlight the versatility of chiral quantum walks and their potential to outperform both classical and non-chiral quantum methods in realistic scenarios, including comparisons between successive versions of evolving databases.</description>

      <title>Perturbative nonlinear J-matrix method of scattering in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a perturbative formulation for a nonlinear extension of the J-matrix method of scattering in two dimensions. That is, we obtain the scattering matrix for the time-independent nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in two dimensions with circular symmetry. The formulation relies on the linearization of products of orthogonal polynomials and on the utilization of the tools of the J-matrix method. Gauss quadrature integral approximation is instrumental in the numerical implementation of the approach. We present the theory for a general \psi ^{2n + 1} nonlinearity, where n is a natural number, and obtain results for the cubic and quintic nonlinearities, \psi ^3 and \psi ^5. At certain value(s) of the energy, we observe the occurrence of bifurcation with two stable solutions. This curious and interesting phenomenon is a clear signature and manifestation of the underlying nonlinearity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose quantum-mechanical systems in which the number of spatial dimensions is promoted to a dynamical quantum variable. As a consequence, the effective dimension depends on the physical state of the system. Interestingly, systems of this form exhibit enhanced symmetries compared to their fixed-dimensional counterparts. As an explicit example, we analyze a harmonic oscillator for which the spatial dimension is represented by a quantum operator. By evaluating the corresponding partition function, we uncover a temperature-dependent effective dimension. Our framework opens a new avenue for constructing physical systems, from gravity to condensed matter, where the very notion of dimensionality becomes quantum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherence is an inherently quantum property that deeply affects microscopic processes, including thermalization phenomena. A striking example is the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), in which a system can exhibit anomalous relaxation, thermalizing faster from a state initially farther from equilibrium than from one closer. Here, we experimentally investigate the genuine QME and observe how the dynamics of a spin-1/2 system interacting with a heat sink can be sped-up to equilibrium. Furthermore, we apply the QME in a quantum Otto refrigerator, thereby increasing its cooling power. This proof-of-concept experiment unveils new practical paths for improving quantum thermal tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a technique for performing quantum detector tomography (QDT) of phase insensitive quantum detectors using gradient descent-based optimization to learn the positive operator-valued measure (POVM) that best describes the data collected using the detector under study. We numerically benchmark our method against constrained convex optimization (CCO) and show that it reaches higher or comparable reconstruction fidelity in much less time even in the presence of noise and limited probe state resources. We also present a possible extension of our approach to the phase sensitive case via a parametrization of POVMs on the complex Stiefel manifold which enables gradient based optimization restricted to this manifold.</description>

      <title>Logical Operators and Derived Automorphisms of Tile Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently introduced tile codes are a promising alternative to surface codes, combining two-dimensional locality with higher encoding efficiency. While surface codes are well understood in terms of their logical operators and boundary behavior, much less is known about tile codes. In this work, we establish a natural and precise description of their logical operator space. We prove that, under mild assumptions, any tile code admits a canonical symplectic basis of logical operators supported along lattice boundaries, which can be generated efficiently by a simple cellular automaton with the number of update rules only depending on the non-locality of the tile code. Further, we develop algebraic and algebro-geometric frameworks for tile codes, by resolving them by translationally invariant Pauli stabilizer models and showing that they arise as derived sections of a Koszul complex on $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$. Finally, we introduce the concept of derived automorphisms for quantum codes. These are automorphism-like operations that can exist even for codes that do not have symmetries. We explain how derived automorphisms can be implemented for tile codes in a low-overhead and fault-tolerant manner by extending the lattice on one side and shrinking it on the other. While this operation is trivial for the surface code, it induces a product of logical CNOT gates on the encoded information. Our results provide new structural insights into tile codes and lay the groundwork for tile codes as building blocks for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Measuring Reactive-Load Impedance with Transmission-Line Resonators Beyond the Perturbative Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an analytic framework to extract circuit parameters and loss tangent from superconducting transmission-line resonators terminated by reactive loads, extending analysis beyond the perturbative regime. The formulation yields closed-form relations between resonant frequency, participation ratio, and internal quality factor, removing the need for full-wave simulations. We validate the framework through circuit simulations, finite-element modeling, and experimental measurements of van der Waals parallel-plate capacitors, using it to extract the dielectric constant and loss tangent of hexagonal boron nitride. Statistical analysis across multiple reference resonators, together with multimode self-calibration, demonstrates consistent and reproducible extraction of both capacitance and loss tangent in close agreement with literature values. In addition to parameter extraction, the analytic relations provide practical design guidelines for maximizing energy participation ratio in the load and improving the precision of resonator-based material metrology.</description>

      <title>PAC global optimization for VQE in low-curvature geometric regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give noise-robust, Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) guarantees of global $\varepsilon$-optimality for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver under explicit geometric conditions. For periodic ansatzes with bounded generators -- yielding a globally Lipschitz cost landscape on a toroidal parameter space -- we assume that the low-energy region containing the global minimum is a Morse--Bott submanifold whose normal Hessian has rank $r = O(\log p)$ for $p$ parameters, and which satisfies polynomial fiber regularity with respect to coordinate-aligned, embedded flats. This low-curvature-dimensional structure serves as a model for regimes in which only a small number of directions control energy variation, and is consistent with mechanisms such as strong parameter tying together with locality in specific multiscale and tied shallow architectures.
  Under this assumption, the sample complexity required to find an $\varepsilon$-optimal region with confidence $1-\delta$ scales with the curvature dimension $r$ rather than the ambient dimension $p$. With probability at least $1-\delta$, the algorithm outputs a region in which all points are $\varepsilon$-optimal, and at least one lies within a bounded neighborhood of the global minimum. The resulting complexity is quasi-polynomial in $p$ and $\varepsilon^{-1}$ and logarithmic in $\delta^{-1}$. This identifies a geometric regime in which high-probability global optimization remains feasible despite shot noise.</description>

      <title>Divide-et-impera Heuristic-based Randomized Search for the Qubit Routing Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the DIRSH algorithm for the Qubit Routing Problem (QRP), using a heuristic-guided randomized divide-and-conquer strategy. The method splits the circuit into chunks and optimizes each one with a stochastic selection of gates and swaps. It balances global search, via restarts and adaptive tuning of bandit parameters with depth-sensitive local pruning. Tested on RevLib benchmarks mapped to the 20-qubit IBMQ Tokyo topology, DIRSH outperformed three LightSABRE variants across different time budgets, achieving shorter depths and fewer swaps. These results confirm that combining chunk-based decomposition with bandit-driven heuristics is effective for routing quantum circuits on NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Using the Schmidt Decomposition to Determine Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information theory is a rapidly growing area of math and physics that combines two independent theories, quantum mechanics and information theory. Quantum entanglement is a concept that was first proposed in the EPR paradox. In quantum mechanics, particles can be in superposition, meaning they are in multiple different states at once. It is not until the particle is measured that it is forced into a single state. However, it is possible that particles can be tied to other particles, meaning that the measurement of one particle will determine the measurement of the other particle. Entanglement is at the very core of quantum information theory. It is one of the core pieces that allows for the massive increase in computing power. For this paper, we decided to focus on demonstrating the mathematical method (the Schmidt decomposition) for determining if a system is entangled, and a demonstration of quantum entanglement's use (quantum teleportation) as well as a quick look at how to extend the uses of the Schmidt decomposition.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation with Resolution Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method called resolution refinement that allows one to bootstrap eigenstate preparation on a quantum computer. We first prepare an eigenstate of a low-resolution Hamiltonian using any method of choice. The eigenstate is then lifted to higher resolution and adiabatically evolved to produce the corresponding eigenstate of a higher-fidelity Hamiltonian. We give examples of resolution refinement applied to both single-particle basis states as well as a spatial lattice grid. For basis refinement, we compute few-body ground states of the Busch model for interacting particles in a harmonic trap in one dimension. For lattice refinement, we compute Hartree-Fock nuclear states for a central Woods-Saxon potential in three dimensions, and we compute bound states and continuum states in a multi-species Hubbard model of fermions in one dimension. In all cases, the method is efficient and requires an adiabatic evolution time comparable to the inverse of the energy gap in the physical spectrum.</description>

      <title>From Random Determinants to the Ground State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate quantum many-body calculations often depend on reliable reference states or good human-designed ans\"atze, yet these sources of knowledge can become unreliable in hard problems like strongly correlated systems. We introduce the Trimmed Configuration Interaction (TrimCI) method, a prior-knowledge-free algorithm that builds accurate ground states directly from random Slater determinants. TrimCI iteratively expands the variational space and trims away unimportant states, allowing a random initial core to self-refine into an accurate approximation of exact ground state. Across challenging benchmarks, TrimCI achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with strikingly efficiency gains of several orders of magnitude. For [4Fe-4S] cluster, it matches recent quantum computing results with $10^6$-fold fewer determinants and CPU-hours. For the nitrogenase P-cluster, it matches selected-CI accuracy using $10^5$-fold fewer determinants. For $8\times8$ Hubbard model, it recovers over $99\%$ of the ground-state energy using only $10^{-28}$ of the Hilbert space. In some regimes, TrimCI attains orders-of-magnitude higher accuracy than AFQMC method. These results demonstrate that high-accuracy many-body ground states can be discovered directly from random determinants, establishing TrimCI as a prior-knowledge-free, accurate and highly efficient framework for quantum many-body systems. The compact explicit wavefunctions it produces further enable direct and rapid evaluation of observables.</description>

      <title>Squeezing-Enhanced Photon-Number Measurements for GKP State Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an architecture for the generation of GKP states in which quadrature squeezing operations are used to control the average photon number statistics of probabilistic photon number measurements on Gaussian resource states. Specifically, we present an architecture employing a teleportation-based squeezing protocol and polynomial-gate applications integrated into a time-multiplexed multi-mode cluster state to generate cat states with high amplitudes, which are consequently used to generate GKP states with high quadrature effective squeezing. Compared to our previous work, in addition to using squeezing as a resource, the present architecture reduces damping and noise by minimizing the number of homodyne measurements required in GKP state generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these improvements - including dynamic input-state resetting and an improved breeding algorithm - by achieving a fault-tolerance threshold of 11.5 dB cluster squeezing using the RHG surface code for error correction, without requiring active switching or photon-number resource states.</description>

      <title>Optimization of High-Fidelity Single-Qubit Gates for Fluxoniums Using Single-Flux Quantum Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a gradient-based method to construct memory-efficient, high-fidelity, single-qubit gates for fluxonium qubits. These gates are constructed using a sequence of single-flux quantum (SFQ) pulses that are sent to the qubit through either capacitive or inductive coupling. The schedule of SFQ pulses is constructed with an on-ramp and an off-ramp applied prior to and after a pulse train, where the pulses are spaced at intervals equal to the qubit period. We reduce the optimization problem to the scheduling of a fixed number of SFQ pulses in the on-ramp and solve it by relaxing the discretization constraint of the SFQ clock as an intermediate step, allowing the use of the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno optimizer. Using this approach, gate fidelities of 99.99 % can be achieved for inductive coupling and 99.9 % for capacitive coupling, with leakage being the main source of coherent errors for both approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09121v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale conductors are interesting for thermoelectrics because of their particular spectral features connecting separated heat and particle currents. Multiterminal devices in the quantum regime benefit from phase-coherent phenomena, which turns the thermoelectric effect nonlocal, and from tunable single-particle interactions. This way one can define quantum thermocouples which convert an injected heat current into useful power in an isothermal conductor, or work as refrigerators. Additionally, efficient heat management devices can be defined. We review recent theoretical and experimental progress in the research of multiterminal thermal and thermoelectric quantum transport leading to proposals of autonomous quantum heat engines and thermal devices.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we consider specific scenarios of matter-gravity interaction based on the source theory to clarify the issue regarding the Gravitationally Induced Entanglement (GIE) protocol, which posits that the detection of quantum entanglement induced by a pure gravitational effect serves as a probe of quantum gravity. Thus, the GIE protocol implies that classical gravity cannot produce or mediate quantum entanglement, to which a recent paper \cite{Aziz:2025ypo} shows the opposite. In all three scenarios of matter-gravity interactions, including mini-superspace, semiclassical gravity, and stochastic gravity approaches, our results agree with the GIE protocol and its implications. More precisely, we show that the mesoscopic quantum bodies with their parities of mass quadrupoles interacting via Newtonian gravity can get entangled only if the parity of the gravitational tidal field sourced by the quantum body is also quantized. We also point out a possible loophole that could seemingly violate the GIE protocol due to the truncation of higher-order terms in the perturbative expansion by orders of the Newton constant.</description>

      <title>Study of Quantum Confinement inside a Viral Capsid</title>

Abstract: Classical computational methods, such as molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, have long been the standard for modeling viral structure and function. However, these approaches may overlook crucial quantum phenomena that operate at the nanoscale, particularly within the highly-compacted genetic material of the viral capsid. The confined, high-density environment of genetic material within the capsid strongly suggests that quantum confinement effects play a significant, yet unexplored, role in viral processes. This study introduces a novel quantum approach using Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics (SQM) to investigate the quantum confinement effects on viruses. In this paper, the viral capsid environment is modeled using the Pariacoto virus, a model system well-suited for this analysis due to its specific structural properties. The findings reveal that quantum effects are not merely marginal but essential for understanding key processes inside the capsid, providing new insights beyond the scope of classical physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metamorphosis: Programmable Emergence and the Breakdown of Bulk-Edge Dichotomy in Multiscale Systems</title>

Abstract: Multiscale synergy -- the interplay of a system's distinct characteristic length, time, and energy scales -- is becoming a unifying thread across many contemporary branches of science. Ranging from moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials and cold atoms to DNA-templated superlattices and nested photonic networks, multiscale synergy produces behaviors not obtainable at any single scale alone. Yet a general framework that programs cross-scale interplay to steer spectra, transport, and topology has been missing. Here, we elevate multiscale synergy from a byproduct to a general design principle for emergent phenomena. Specifically, we introduce a scale-programmable framework for hierarchically nested lattices (HNLs) that can host quantum metamorphosis (QuMorph) -- a continuous evolution between system-dependent features governed by a dimensionless tunable parameter $\alpha$ (the relative hopping). To exemplify, we show an HNL, in which as $\alpha$ changes, the spectrum metamorphoses from integer quantum Hall-like to anomalous quantum Hall-like, passing through a cocoon regime with proliferating mini-gaps. This multiscale mixing yields multiple novel phenomena, including hybrid edge-bulk states, scale-dependent topology, topologically embedded flat bands, and isolated edge bands. We propose a feasible photonic implementation using commercially available coupled-resonator arrays, outline spatial-spectral signatures to map QuMorph, and explore applications for multi-timescale nonlinear optics. Our work establishes a scalable and programmable paradigm for engineering multiscale emergent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible defects in generalized Ising models via strange correlator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defects associated with non-invertible symmetries have attracted significant attention in recent years. Among them, Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality defects have been investigated in both classical statistical systems and quantum Hamiltonian models. Aasen et al. analyzed duality defects in the 2D Ising model and in statistical models built from fusion categories, while Koide et al. later constructed a duality defect in 4D lattice gauge theory. In this work, we extend these developments by providing a systematic construction of KW duality defects/KW defects for a broad class of models formulated within the chain complex framework. Our construction employs the strange correlator, an overlap between a topologically ordered state and a product state, to realize these KW defects.</description>

      <title>Screw-dislocation-engineered quantum dot: geometry-tunable nonlinear optics, orbital qubit addressability, and torsion metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a single electron confined in a uniform-torsion medium, a continuum model of a screw dislocation density, in a perpendicular magnetic field, and in the presence of an Aharonov--Bohm flux. Torsion alone produces radial confinement without any \textit{ad hoc} potential, while the Aharonov--Bohm phase breaks the usual $m\leftrightarrow -m$ symmetry. From the exact spectrum and wave functions, we find: (i) a torsion-controlled optical transition whose energy blue-shifts from $\sim 6.8$ to $\sim 15.5$~meV and whose saturation intensity varies by an order of magnitude, enabling geometry-programmable optical switching; (ii) an Aharonov--Bohm-tunable ``angular pseudospin'' formed by the $m=\pm1$ states, with flux-controlled level splitting and asymmetric oscillator strengths that allow selective optical addressability; and (iii) an approximately linear torsion dependence of the transition energy that enables nanoscale torsion metrology with an estimated resolution of $\sim 10^{5}~\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. In this context, ``torsion'' refers to the experimentally relevant continuum limit of a uniform density of parallel screw dislocations, i.e., a crystal with finite torsion but vanishing curvature, which can, in practice, be engineered and probed in twisted nanowires and strained semiconductor heterostructures. We also show how torsion provides \textit{in situ} control of emitter--cavity detuning and light--matter coupling in cavity QED, in direct analogy with strain tuning of semiconductor quantum dots in nanocavities, but here arising from a purely geometric/topological parameter.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of entanglement asymmetry for space-inversion symmetry of free fermions on honeycomb lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement asymmetry for the space-inversion symmetry of free fermions on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with an on-site energy imbalance between the two sublattices. We show that the entanglement asymmetry of a local subsystem exhibits nonanalytic dependence on the energy imbalance, due to the presence of Dirac points in the Brillouin zone. We also study the quench dynamics from the ground state into the inversion-symmetric point at which the energy imbalance vanishes. Under certain conditions on the subsystem geometry, the entanglement asymmetry relaxes to a finite value after the quench, revealing that the inversion-symmetry breaking in the initial ground state can persist even under the symmetric dynamics. We attribute the absence of symmetry restoration to the presence of a flat energy dispersion (flat band) in a specific direction.</description>

      <title>Current-driven switching of topological spin chirality in a van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic topology is central to modern quantum magnet, where spin chirality governs exotic spin winding, real-space Berry phase, and topological Hall effect. A key unresolved challenge is how to electrically switch topological spin chirality and its associated gauge flux, an essential requirement for manipulating its topological quantum properties. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the concept of current-switching spin chirality. We identify the new vdW antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2 as an ideal platform, hosting a topological 3Q state with a minimum chirality cell, an ultrahigh skyrmion density, a non-centrosymmetric geometry, and a strong Berry curvature. Using a Co1/3TaS2/Pt heterostructure, we achieve the nonvolatile and reversible switching by current via current-driven spin-orbit torque based on Pts spin Hall effect. Beyond this conventional route, we further discover intrinsic self-torque-induced chirality switching within Co1/3TaS2, driven purely by current, without a magnetic field, and with high energy efficiency. These complementary pathways establish a unified framework for electrically creating and controlling spin chirality. Our results demonstrate a practical route toward chiral spintronics. They can be naturally generalised to other skyrmion systems, offering new opportunities in symmetry control, topological manipulation, and spin-chirality-based quantum functionalities.</description>

      <title>Empirical Quantum Advantage in Constrained Optimization from Encoded Unitary Designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Constraint-Enhanced Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (CE-QAOA), a shallow, constraint-aware ansatz that operates inside the one-hot product space of size [n]^m, where m is the number of blocks and each block is initialized with an n-qubit W_n state. We give an ancilla-free, depth-optimal encoder that prepares a W_n state using n-1 two-qubit rotations per block, and a two-local XY mixer restricted to the same block of n qubits with a constant spectral gap. Algorithmically, we wrap constant-depth sampling with a deterministic classical checker to obtain a polynomial-time hybrid quantum-classical solver (PHQC) that returns the best observed feasible solution in O(S n^2) time, where S is the number of shots. We obtain two advantages. First, when CE-QAOA fixes r &gt;= 1 locations different from the start city, we achieve a Theta(n^r) reduction in shot complexity even against a classical sampler that draws uniformly from the feasible set. Second, against a classical baseline restricted to raw bitstring sampling, we show an exp(Theta(n^2)) separation in the minimax sense. In noiseless circuit simulations of TSP instances ranging from 4 to 10 locations from the QOPTLib benchmark library, we recover the global optimum at depth p = 1 using polynomial shot budgets and coarse parameter grids defined by the problem sizes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Model of Black Hole Evaporation with Controlled Causal Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend a four-qubit quantum circuit model of black hole evaporation that enforces semi-causality, a condition that allows information to enter a black hole but strictly forbids any information from escaping from the interior to outside through the horizon. In this work, we introduce a controlled violation of this principle by inserting a parametric controlled-unitary gate that enables a tunable leakage of quantum information from the black hole interior to the exterior, while preserving global unitarity. By varying the deformation parameter, we study the evolution of entanglement entropy, mutual information, and entanglement negativity throughout the evaporation process. While the semi-causal case yields a Page-like entropy curve with vanishing late-time correlations, we find that even small violations of semi-causality produce a non-zero residual entropy and persistent negativity across the horizon. These features mimic quantum-gravity-induced effects such as remnant formation and horizon permeability, suggesting that minimal deviations from classical causality can leave long-lived imprints on black hole information dynamics.</description>

Abstract: As is intrinsic to the fundamental goal of quantum computing, classical simulation of quantum algorithms is notoriously demanding in resource requirements. Nonetheless, simulation is critical to the success of the field and a requirement for algorithm development and validation, as well as hardware design. GPU-acceleration has become standard practice for simulation, and due to the exponential scaling inherent in classical methods, multi-GPU simulation can be required to achieve representative system sizes. In this case, inter-GPU communications can bottleneck performance. In this work, we present the introduction of MPI into the QED-C Application-Oriented Benchmarks to facilitate benchmarking on HPC systems. We review the advances in interconnect technology and the APIs for multi-GPU communication. We benchmark using a variety of interconnect paths, including the recent NVIDIA Grace Blackwell NVL72 architecture that represents the first product to expand high-bandwidth GPU-specialized interconnects across multiple nodes. We show that while improvements to GPU architecture have led to speedups of over 4.5X across the last few generations of GPUs, advances in interconnect performance have had a larger impact with over 16X performance improvements in time to solution for multi-GPU simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider spin chains with a finite range Hamiltonian. For reasons of simplicity, the chain is taken to be infinitely long. A ground state is said to be a unique gapped ground state if its GNS Hamiltonian has a unique ground state, separated by a gap from the rest of the spectrum. By combining some powerful techniques developed in the last years, we prove that each unique gapped ground state is short-range entangled: It can be mapped into a product state by a finite time evolution map generated by a Hamiltonian with exponentially quasi-local interaction terms. This claim makes precise the common belief that one-dimensional gapped systems are topologically trivial in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Static Laboratory-Frame Polarization of a Trapped Molecular Ion for CP-Violation Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today's most sensitive experiments for detecting CP-violating permanent electric dipole moments (EDM) rely on molecular spectroscopy. The high sensitivity arises from large internal electric fields that interact with the constituents of the molecule. For molecular ions it has long been assumed that experiments with static polarization from dc electric fields are infeasible, as the ion's charge would either shift it to a field free region or eject it from the trap. This constraint appears to make single ion quantum-logic clocks, among the most precise measurement devices available, incompatible with EDM measurements. Here, we demonstrate that, under typical trapping conditions, heavy molecular ions with small $\Omega/\Lambda$-doubling can be polarized by a static electric field while remaining confined in the Paul trap. This effect arises from a cancellation between the electrostatic force and the trap's ponderomotive force, resulting in an equilibrium position where the ion experiences a dc electric field component. Dynamic decoupling allows to implement co-magnetometry schemes in a single molecule and provides long interrogation times. This will allow the operation of a quantum-logic molecular radio-frequency clock in static electric fields, providing sensitivity to EDMs. Working with only a few ions and non-destructive detection techniques opens the door to the use of highly sensitive, rare, and radioactive molecular species as well as quantum-enhanced metrology schemes to achieve unprecedented levels of accuracy and precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical exponents characterize the divergent scaling of thermodynamic quantities near phase transitions and allow for the classification of physical systems into universality classes. While quantum gases thermalizing by interparticle interactions fall into the XY model universality class, the ideal Bose gas has been predicted to form a distinct universality class whose signatures have not yet been revealed experimentally. Here, we report the observation of critical scaling in a two-dimensional quantum gas of essentially noninteracting photons, which thermalize by radiative contact to a reservoir of molecules inside a microcavity. By measuring the spatial correlations near the condensation transition, we determine the critical exponent for the correlation length to be $\nu = 0.52(3)$. Our results constitute a first experimental test of the long-standing scaling predictions for the Bose gas universality class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1911.01823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A variant of the von Neumann-Wigner Interpretation is proposed. It does not make use of the familiar language of wave functions and observers. Instead it pictures the state of the physical world as a vector in a Fock space and, therefore not, literally, a function of any spacetime coordinates. And, rather than segregating consciousness into individual points of view (each carrying with it a sense of its proper time), this model proposes only unitary states of consciousness, Q(t), where t represents a fiducial time with respect to which both the state of the physical world and the state of consciousness evolve. States in our world's Fock space are classified as either 'admissible' (meaning they correspond to definite states of consciousness) or 'inadmissible' (meaning they do not). The evolution of the state vector of the world is such as to always keep it restricted to 'admissible' states. Consciousness is treated rather like what Chalmers has called an "m-property." We try to show that problems with the quantum Zeno effect do not arise from this model. The measurement of degenerate states is also discussed, as is the EPR paradox. Finally, it is suggested that the universe is far more likely to contain conscious observers than not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose efficient classical algorithms which (strongly) simulate the action of bosonic linear optics circuits applied to superpositions of Gaussian states. Our approach relies on an augmented covariance matrix formalism to keep track of relative phases between individual terms in a linear combination. This yields an exact simulation algorithm whose runtime is polynomial in the number of modes and the size of the circuit, and quadratic in the number of terms in the superposition. We also present a faster approximate randomized algorithm whose runtime is linear in this number. Our main building blocks are a formula for the triple overlap of three Gaussian states and a fast algorithm for estimating the norm of a superposition of Gaussian states up to a multiplicative error. Our construction borrows from earlier work on simulating quantum circuits in finite-dimensional settings, including, in particular, fermionic linear optics with non-Gaussian initial states and Clifford computations with non-stabilizer initial states. It provides algorithmic access to a practically relevant family of non-Gaussian bosonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Lindbladian reverse engineering for general non-equilibrium steady states: A scalable null-space approach</title>

Abstract: The study of open system dynamics is of paramount importance both from its fundamental aspects as well as from its potential applications in quantum technologies. In the simpler and most commonly studied case, the dynamics of the system can be described by a Lindblad master equation. However, identifying the Lindbladian that leads to general non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) is usually a non-trivial and challenging task. Here we introduce a method for reconstructing the corresponding Lindbaldian master equation given any target NESS, i.e., a \textit{Lindbladian Reverse Engineering} ($\mathcal{L}$RE) approach. The method maps the reconstruction task to a simple linear problem. Specifically, to the diagonalization of a correlation matrix whose elements are NESS observables and whose size scales linearly (at most quadratically) with the number of terms in the Hamiltonian (Lindblad jump operator) ansatz. The kernel (null-space) of the correlation matrix corresponds to Lindbladian solutions. Moreover, the map defines an iff condition for $\mathcal{L}$RE, which works as both a necessary and a sufficient condition; thus, it not only defines, if possible, Lindbladian evolutions leading to the target NESS, but also determines the feasibility of such evolutions in a proposed setup. We illustrate the method in different systems, ranging from bosonic Gaussian systems, dissipative-driven collective spins and random local spin models.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Quantum State Tomography for Structured Quantum States in One Dimension</title>

Abstract: While quantum state tomography (QST) remains the gold standard for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices, it requires an exponentially large number of measurements and classical computational resources for generic quantum many-body systems, making it impractical even for intermediate-size quantum devices. Fortunately, many physical quantum states often exhibit certain low-dimensional structures that enable the development of efficient QST. A notable example is the class of states represented by matrix product operators (MPOs) with a finite matrix/bond dimension, which include most physical states in one dimension and where the number of independent parameters describing the states only grows linearly with the number of qubits. Whether a sample efficient quantum state tomography protocol, where the number of required state copies scales only linearly as the number of parameters describing the state, exists for a generic MPO state still remains an important open question.
  In this paper, we answer this fundamental question affirmatively by using a class of informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (IC-POVMs) -- including symmetric IC-POVMs (SIC-POVMs) and spherical $t$-designs -- focusing on sample complexity while not accounting for the implementation complexity of the measurement settings. For SIC-POVMs and (approximate) spherical 2-designs, we show that the number of state copies to guarantee bounded recovery error of an MPO state with a constrained least-squares estimator depends on the probability distribution of the MPO under the POVM but scales only linearly with $n$ when the distribution is approximately uniform. For spherical $t$-designs with $t\geq 3$, we prove that only a number of state copies proportional to the number of independent parameters in the MPO is sufficient for a guaranteed recovery of any state represented by an MPO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how a machine based on deep learning algorithms learns Krylov spread complexity in quantum systems with N x N random Hamiltonians drawn from the Gaussian unitary ensemble. Using thermofield double states as initial conditions, we demonstrate that a convolutional neural network-based algorithm successfully learns the Krylov spread complexity across all timescales, including the late-time plateaus where states appear nearly featureless and random. Performance strongly depends on the basis choice, performing well with the energy eigenbasis or the Krylov basis but failing in the original basis of the random Hamiltonian. The algorithm also effectively distinguishes temperature-dependent features of thermofield double states. Furthermore, we show that the system time variable of state predicted by deep learning is an irrelevant quantity, reinforcing that the Krylov spread complexity well captures the essential features of the quantum state, even at late times.</description>

      <title>Extracting the spin excitation spectrum of a fermionic system using a quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding low-energy excitations in fermionic systems is crucial for their characterization. They determine the response of the system to external weak perturbations, its dynamical correlation functions, and provide mechanisms for the emergence of exotic phases of matter. In this work, we study the spin excitation spectra of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model using a digital quantum processor. Introducing a protocol that is naturally suited for simulation on quantum computers, we recover the retarded spin Green's function from the time evolution of simple observables after a specific quantum quench. We exploit the robustness of the protocol to perturbations of the initial state to minimize the quantum resources required for the initial state preparation, and to allocate the majority of them to a Trotterized time-dynamics simulation. This, combined with the intrinsic resilience to noise of the protocol, allows us to accurately reconstruct the spin excitation spectrum for large instances of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model without making use of expensive error mitigation techniques, using up to 30 qubits of an IBM Heron r2 device.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm Cage in Bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cage is a unique localization phenomenon that confines all possible excitations. This confinement leads to fully flat spectra in momentum space, which are typically accompanied with the degeneracy with various types. Classifying the degeneracy type is crucial for studying the dynamical properties of the non-Hermitian AB cage, but the methods for such classification and their physical connections remain not very clear. Here, we construct a non-Hermitian AB cage in a bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) system with various types of degenerate flat bands (DFBs). Using the transfer matrix, we demonstrate the localization mechanism for the formation of AB cage and derive the minimal polynomial in mathematics for classifying the degeneracy types of DFBs, thus providing comprehensive understanding of the correspondence among the degeneracy type of DFBs, the minimal polynomial, and the transfer matrix. With such correspondence, we propose a scheme to realize highly degenerate flat bands.</description>

Abstract: We propose a digital-controlled conveyor-belt shuttling method for silicon-based quantum processors, addressing the scalability challenges of conventional analog sinusoidal implementations. By placing a switch matrix and low-pass filters in a cryogenic environment, our approach synthesizes near-sinusoidal waveforms from a limited number of DC voltage levels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fidelity comparable to analog methods while significantly reducing wiring overhead and power dissipation. Moreover, the design offers robustness against device-level variations, enabling large-scale integration of high-fidelity spin shuttling for quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Kerr-enhanced optomechanical entanglement generation via reservoir design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource in quantum technologies, enabling advancements in quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum precision measurement. Here, we propose a method to enhance optomechanical entanglement by introducing an optical Kerr nonlinear medium and a squeezed vacuum reservoir of the optomechanical cavity. By performing the displacement and squeezing transformations, the system can be reduced to a standard linearized optomechanical system with normalized driving detuning and linearized-coupling strength, in which the optical and mechanical modes are, respectively, coupled to an optical vacuum bath and a mechanical heat bath. We focus on the entanglement generation in the single stable regime of the system. By evaluating the steady-state logarithm negativity, we find that the optomechanical entanglement can be enhanced within a wide range of the Kerr constant. In addition, the Kerr nonlinearity can extend the stable region, enabling considerable entanglement generation in the blue-sideband parameter region. We also investigate the dependence of the entanglement generation on the average thermal phonon occupation of the mechanical bath and the optical driving amplitude. It is found that the presence of the Kerr nonlinearity allows the generation of optomechanical entanglement even when the thermal phonon occupation of the mechanical bath is as high as 3000. Our findings will provide valuable insights into enhancing fragile quantum resources in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Kernpiler: Compiler Optimization for Quantum Hamiltonian Simulation with Partial Trotterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises transformative impacts in simulating Hamiltonian dynamics, essential for studying physical systems inaccessible by classical computing. However, existing compilation techniques for Hamiltonian simulation, in particular the commonly used Trotter formulas struggle to provide gate counts feasible on current quantum computers for beyond-classical simulations. We propose partial Trotterization, where sets of non-commuting Hamiltonian terms are directly compiled allowing for less error per Trotter step and therefore a reduction of Trotter steps overall. Furthermore, a suite of novel optimizations are introduced which complement the new partial Trotterization technique, including reinforcement learning for complex unitary decompositions and high level Hamiltonian analysis for unitary reduction. We demonstrate with numerical simulations across spin and fermionic Hamiltonians that compared to state of the art methods such as Qiskit's Rustiq and Qiskit's Paulievolutiongate, our novel compiler presents up to 10x gate and depth count reductions.</description>

      <title>Discrete time crystal for periodic-field sensing with quantum-enhanced precision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensing periodic-fields using quantum sensors has been an active field of research. In many of these scenarios, the quantum state of the probe is flipped regularly by the application of $\pi$-pulses to accumulate information about the target periodic-field. The emergence of a discrete time crystalline phase, as a nonequilibrium phase of matter, naturally provides oscillations in a many-body system with an inherent controllable frequency. They benefit from long coherence time and robustness against imperfections, which makes them excellent potential quantum sensors. In this paper, through theoretical and numerical analysis, we show that a disorder-free discrete time crystal probe can reach the ultimate achievable precision for sensing a periodic-field. As the amplitude of the periodic-field increases, the discrete time crystalline order diminishes, and the performance of the probe decreases remarkably. Nevertheless, the obtained quantum enhancement in the discrete time crystal phase, which is experimentally accessible using standard projective measurements, shows robustness against different imperfections and dephasing noise in the protocol. Finally, we propose the implementation of our protocol in ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a quantum Markov chain algorithm for many-body systems that utilizes a special phase of matter known as the Many-Body Localized (MBL) phase. We show how the properties of the MBL phase enable one to address the conditions for ergodicity and sampling from distributions of quantum states. We demonstrate how to exploit the thermalized-to-localized transition to tune the acceptance rate of the Markov chain, and apply the algorithm to solve a range of combinatorial optimization problems of quadratic order and higher. The algorithm can be implemented on any QPU capable of simulating the Floquet dynamics of a 1D Ising chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, providing a practical way of sampling from thermal distributions of Hamiltonians that cannot be natively implemented on the quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Magic Resources of Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the computational complexity of quantum states is a central challenge in quantum many-body physics. In qubit systems, fermionic Gaussian states can be efficiently simulated on classical computers and hence can be employed as a natural baseline for evaluating quantum complexity. In this work, we develop a framework for quantifying fermionic magic resources, also referred to as fermionic non-Gaussianity, which constitutes an essential resource for universal quantum computation. We leverage the algebraic structure of the fermionic commutant to define the fermionic antiflatness (FAF)-an efficiently computable and experimentally accessible measure of non-Gaussianity, with a clear physical interpretation in terms of Majorana fermion correlation functions. Studying systems in equilibrium, we show that FAF detects phase transitions, reveals universal features of critical points, and uncovers special solvable points in many-body systems. Extending the analysis to out-of-equilibrium settings, we demonstrate that fermionic magic resources become more abundant in highly excited eigenstates of many-body systems. We further investigate the growth and saturation of FAF under ergodic many-body dynamics, highlighting the roles of conservation laws and locality in constraining the increase of non-Gaussianity during unitary evolution. This work provides a framework for probing quantum many-body complexity from the perspective of fermionic Gaussian states and opens up new directions for investigating fermionic magic resources in many-body systems. Our results establish fermionic non-Gaussianity, alongside entanglement and non-stabilizerness, as a resource relevant not only to foundational studies but also to experimental platforms aiming to achieve quantum advantage.</description>

Abstract: Resource theories play a crucial role in characterizing states and properties essential for quantum information processing. A significant challenge is protecting resources from errors. We explore strategies for correcting quantum resources. We show that resource preserving operations in resource theory define a gauge freedom on code spaces, which allows for recovery strategies that can correct the resource while changing non-essential properties. This allows decoding to be simplified. The results are applicable to various resource theories and we provide an application to quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>From Linear Differential Equations to Unitaries: A Moment-Matching Dilation Framework with Near-Optimal Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum speed-ups for dynamical simulation usually demand unitary time-evolution, whereas the large ODE/PDE systems encountered in realistic physical models are generically non-unitary. We present a universal moment-fulfilling dilation that embeds any linear, non-Hermitian flow $\dot x = L x$ with $L=-iH+K$ into a strictly unitary evolution on an enlarged Hilbert space: \[
  ( (l| \otimes I )
  \mathcal T e^{-i \int ( I_A\otimes H +i F\otimes K) dt}
  ( |r) \otimes I )
  = \mathcal T e^{\int L dt}, \] provided the triple $( F, (l|, |r) )$ satisfies the compact moment identities $(l| F^{k}|r) =1$ for all $k\ge 0$ in the ancilla space. This algebraic criterion recovers both \emph{Schr\"odingerization} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 230602 (2024)] and the linear-combination-of-Hamiltonians (LCHS) scheme [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 150603 (2023)], while also unveiling whole families of new dilations built from differential, integral, pseudo-differential, and difference generators. Each family comes with a continuous tuning parameter \emph{and} is closed under similarity transformations that leave the moments invariant, giving rise to an overwhelming landscape of design space that allows quantum dilations to be co-optimized for specific applications, algorithms, and hardware.
  As concrete demonstrations, we prove that a simple finite-difference dilation in a finite interval attains near-optimal oracle complexity. Numerical experiments on Maxwell viscoelastic wave propagation confirm the accuracy and robustness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Cooling of Planar Motion in a Penning Trap Ion Crystal to Sub-Millikelvin Temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional planar ion crystals in a Penning trap are a platform for quantum information science experiments. However, the low-frequency planar modes of these crystals are not efficiently cooled by laser cooling, which can limit the utility of the drumhead modes for quantum information processing. Recently, it has been shown that nonlinear mode coupling can enhance the cooling of the low-frequency planar modes. Here, we demonstrate in numerical simulations that this coupling can be dynamically tuned by adiabatically changing the rotation frequency of the ion crystal during experiments. Furthermore, we show that this technique can, in addition, produce lower temperatures for the low-frequency planar modes via an adiabatic cooling process. This result allows cooling of the planar modes to sub-millikelvin temperatures, resulting in improved spectral resolution of the drumhead modes at experimentally relevant rotation frequencies, which is crucial for quantum information processing applications.</description>

Abstract: Majorana zero mode (MZM) exhibits inherent resilience to local parametric fluctuations, due to the topological protection mechanism in the non-Abelian braiding statistics of the anyonic quasiparticles. In this paper, we construct the braiding operations between an arbitrary pair in three MZMs under the theoretical framework of universal quantum control. Largely detuned driving fields on the mediator, a local defect of lattice, enable indirect and tunable exchange interaction between arbitrary two MZMs. The braiding operations can then emerge through the time evolution along the universal nonadiabatic passages, whose robustness against driving-field errors and quasiparticle poisoning can be substantially enhanced by the rapid modulation over the passage-dependent global phase. Moreover, a chiral transfer for population on MZMs along the universal passage can be perfectly demonstrated in both clockwise and counterclockwise manners without eliminating the mediator defect. Our protocol is linear scalable and provides an avenue towards the universal quantum control over MZMs, which is fundamental and essential for topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hamiltonian for a quantum state with finite entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the following task: how for a given quantum state $\rho$ to find a grounded Hamiltonian $H$ satisfying the condition $\mathrm{Tr} H\rho\leq E_0&lt;+\infty$ in such a way that the von Neumann entropy of the Gibbs state $\gamma_H(E)$ corresponding to a given energy $E&gt;0$ be as small as possible. We show that for any mixed state $\rho$ with finite entropy and any $E&gt;0$ there exists a solution $H(\rho,E_0,E)$ of the above problem (unique in the non-degenerate case) which we call optimal Hamiltonian for the state $\rho$. Explicit expressions for $H(\rho,E_0,E)$, $\gamma_{H(\rho,E_0,E)}(E)$ and $S(\gamma_{H(\rho,E_0,E)}(E))$ are obtained. Analytical properties of the function $E\mapsto S(\gamma_{H(\rho,E_0,E)}(E))$ are explored. Several examples are considered. A basic application of the above task is briefly described (with the intention to give a detailed description in a separate article). As an example, a new semicontinuity bound for the entanglement of formation is obtained.</description>

      <title>Efficient bidirectional quantum frequency conversion between telecom and visible bands using programmable III-V nanophotonic waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) is essential for interfacing quantum systems operating at different wavelengths and for realizing scalable quantum networks. Despite extensive progress, achieving QFC with simultaneous high efficiency, low pump power, minimal noise, broad bandwidth, and pump-wavelength flexibility remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate efficient, low-noise, and bidirectional QFC between the telecom (1550-nm) and visible (780-nm) bands using unpoled indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) $\chi^{(2)}$ nanophotonic waveguides, eliminating the need for a long-wavelength pump. Leveraging the large nonlinear susceptibility of InGaP together with programmable modal-phase-matching control, we obtain record-low pump power (20 mW) -- an order of magnitude lower than that in previous demonstrations using integrated thin-film waveguides -- and record-high loss-inclusive normalized conversion efficiency among non-resonant QFC implementations. The platform maintains quantum coherence and entanglement of input photons with noise well below the single-photon level. These results mark a significant advance in integrated nonlinear photonics for high-performance QFC, facilitating the development of versatile and scalable quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum data encoding (QDE) enables faster com-putations than classical algorithms through superposition and en-tanglement. Circuit cutting and knitting are effective techniques for ameliorating current noisy quantum processing unit (QPUs) errors via a divide-and-conquer approach that splits quantum circuits into subcircuits and recombines them using classical postprocessing. Unfortunately, the existing QDE frameworks fail to consider quantum hardware limitations, such as the topology of the chip. Designing a computation model that supports the algorithm level of quantum computation and optimizes non-all-to-all connected quantum circuit simulations remains underde-veloped. In this study, we introduce shardQ, a method that leverages the SparseCut algorithm with matrix product state (MPS) compilation and a global knitting technique to mitigate the quantum error rates. This method elucidates the optimal trade-off between the computational time and error rate for quantum encoding with a theoretical proof, evidenced by an ablation analysis using an IBM Heron-type QPUs with 15% error reduction. This study also presents the results of quantum image encoding readiness. The proposed model advances the current quantum computation towards the fault-tolerant regime as QDE is the input of grand unified quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Beyond critical coupling: optimal design considerations for spontaneous four-wave mixing in microring resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a self-contained analytical model for biphoton generation in microring resonators. Encompassing both all-pass and add-drop geometries, identical and distinct pump and biphoton coupling coefficients, and continuous-wave and pulsed pumping, our interaction-picture-based approach reveals time-frequency biphoton correlations while also predicting absolute generation rates. Under continuous-wave excitation, we find critical coupling of both the pump and biphoton to maximize the rate of single photons extracted from the microring, whereas critical coupling of the pump but overcoupling of the biphoton maximize the two-photon rate. Under pulsed pumping, overcoupling of both pump and biphoton (to different degrees) maximizes photon extraction probabilities, albeit under a tradeoff with spectral factorability that we quantify via parameter scans over a range of coupler pairings. As a whole, our formalism should prove valuable for the practical design of integrated photon sources, merging a flexible and intuitive biphoton-centric depiction with quantitative predictions closely tied to experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Based Quantum Computation Using the Spin-1 XXZ Model with Uniaxial Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the ground state of a spin-1 XXZ chain with uniaxial anisotropies, single-ion anisotropy $D$ and Ising-like anisotropy $J$, within the Haldane phase can serve as a resource state for measurement-based quantum computation implementing single-qubit gates. The gate fidelity of both elementary rotation gates and general single-qubit unitary gates composed of rotations about the $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-axes is evaluated, and is found to exceed 0.99 when $D$ or $J$ is appropriately tuned. Furthermore, we derive an analytic expression for the rotation-gate fidelity under the assumption that the state lies within the $\mathbb Z_2\times\mathbb Z_2$-protected Haldane phase, showing that it is determined by the post-measurement spin-spin correlation function and the failure probability. The observed enhancement of gate fidelity in the spin-1 XXZ chain originates from the strengthening of antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations near the AFM phase, which effectively suppresses failure states.</description>

      <title>Verified Implementation of GRAPE Pulse Optimization for Quantum Gates with Hardware-Representative Noise Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gate fidelity in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers remains the primary bottleneck limiting practical quantum computation, constrained by decoherence and control noise. Quantum optimal control (QOC) techniques, such as the gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) algorithm, offer a powerful approach to designing noise-robust pulses that actively mitigate these effects. However, most QOC implementations operate in idealized simulation environments that fail to capture the real-time parameter drift inherent to physical quantum hardware, creating a critical ``sim-to-real'' gap. In this work, I present QubitPulseOpt, an open-source, rigorously-tested Python framework designed to bridge this gap through hardware-representative optimal control. The framework demonstrates API connectivity to IQM's Garnet quantum processor (20-qubit superconducting device) and implements a workflow that constructs a high-fidelity ``digital twin'' using hardware-representative parameters. Using this simulation framework, I demonstrate that GRAPE-optimized pulses achieve a simulated gate error reduction of 77$\times$ compared to standard Gaussian pulses. The framework's reliability is ensured through a 864-test verification suite (74\% code coverage) and adherence to NASA JPL Power-of-10 safety-critical coding standards, establishing a new paradigm for trustworthy quantum control software. All results are from verified GRAPE optimizations with full provenance documentation.</description>

      <title>A Global Spacetime Optimization Approach to the Real-Space Time-Dependent Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) in real space is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of many-electron quantum systems, with applications ranging from quantum chemistry to condensed matter physics and materials science. However, solving the TDSE for complex fermionic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the need to capture the time-evolving many-body correlations, while the antisymmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions complicates the function space in which these solutions must be represented. We propose a general-purpose neural network framework for solving the real-space TDSE, Fermionic Antisymmetric Spatio-Temporal Network, which treats time as an explicit input alongside spatial coordinates, enabling a unified spatiotemporal representation of complex, antisymmetric wavefunctions for fermionic systems. This approach formulates the TDSE as a global optimization problem, avoiding step-by-step propagation and supporting highly parallelizable training. The method is demonstrated on four benchmark problems: a 1D harmonic oscillator, interacting fermions in a time-dependent harmonic trap, 3D hydrogen orbital dynamics, and a laser-driven H$_2$ molecule, achieving excellent agreement with reference solutions across all cases. These results confirm our method's scalability, accuracy, and flexibility across various dimensions and interaction regimes, while demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate long-time dynamics in complex systems. Our framework offers a highly expressive alternative to traditional basis-dependent or mean-field methods, opening new possibilities for ab initio simulations of time-dependent quantum systems, with applications in quantum dynamics, molecular control, and ultrafast spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Taming Barren Plateaus in Arbitrary Parameterized Quantum Circuits without Sacrificing Expressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have enabled a wide range of applications on near-term quantum devices. However, existing PQC architectures face several challenges, among which the ``barren plateaus" phenomenon is particularly prominent. In such cases, the loss function concentrates exponentially with increasing system size, thereby hindering effective parameter optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a general and hardware-efficient method for eliminating barren plateaus in an arbitrary PQC. Specifically, our approach achieves this by inserting a layer of easily implementable quantum channels into the original PQC, each channel requiring only one ancilla qubit and four additional gates, yielding a modified PQC (MPQC) that is provably at least as expressive as the original PQC and, under mild assumptions, is guaranteed to be free from barren plateaus. Furthermore, by appropriately adjusting the structure of MPQCs, we rigorously prove that any parameter in the original PQC can be made trainable. Importantly, the absence of barren plateaus in MPQCs is robust against realistic noise, making our approach directly applicable to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Numerically, we demonstrate the practicality of our method by modifying a commonly used PQC for thermal-state preparation. The results show that {barren plateaus are effectively eliminated} in this class of circuits with up to 100 qubits and 2400 layers, whereas the original ansatz suffers from severe gradient vanishing.</description>

Abstract: In tensor-network analysis of quantum many-body systems, it is of crucial importance to employ a tensor network with a spatial structure suitable for representing the state of interest. In the previous work [Hikihara et al., Phys. Rev. Research 5, 013031 (2023)], we proposed a structural optimization algorithm for tree-tensor networks. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the Rainbow-chain model, which has a product state of singlet pairs between spins separated by various distances as an approximate ground state. We then demonstrate that the algorithm can successfully visualize the spatial pattern of spin-singlet pairs in the ground state.</description>

      <title>Analysis of quasi-planar defects using the Thomas--Fermi--von Weizs\"acker model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of the electron density and relative energy with respect to a perfect crystal of a class of volume defects that are compactly contained along one direction while being of infinite extent along the other two using the Thomas--Fermi--von Weizs\"acker (TFW) model. We take advantage of prior work on the thermodynamic limit and stability estimates in the TFW setting, and specialize it to the case of quasi-planar defects. In particular, we prove that the relative energy of the defective crystal with respect to a perfect crystal is finite, and in fact conforms to a well-posed minimization problem. In order to show the existence of the minimization problem, we modify the TFW theory for thin films and establish convergence of the electronic fields due to the perturbation caused by the quasi-planar defect. We also show that perturbations to both the density and electrostatic potential due to the presence of the quasi-planar defect decay exponentially away from the defect, in agreement with the known locality property of the TFW model. We use these results to infer bounds on the generalized stacking fault energy, in particular the finiteness of this energy, and discuss its implications for numerical calculations. We conclude with a brief presentation of numerical results on the (non-convex) Thomas-Fermi-von Weizs\"acker-Dirac (TFWD) model that includes the Dirac exchange in the universal functional, and discuss its implications for future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a one-dimensional electronic nanodevice inspired in recently fabricated semiconductor-superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator (SE-SC-FMI) hybrid heterostructures, and investigate its zero-temperature transport properties. While previous related studies have primarily focused on the potential for generating topological superconductors hosting Majorana fermions, we propose an alternative application: using these hybrids to explore controllable quantum phase transitions (QPTs) detectable through transport measurements. Our study highlights two key differences from existing devices: first, the length of the FMI layer is shorter than that of the SE-SC heterostructure, introducing an inhomogeneous Zeeman interaction with significant effects on the induced Andreev bound states (ABS). Second, we focus on semiconductor nanowires with minimal or no Rashba spin-orbit interaction, allowing for the induction of spin-polarized ABS and high-spin quantum ground states. We show that the device can be tuned across spin- and fermion parity-changing QPTs by adjusting the FMI layer length orange and/or by applying a global backgate voltage, with zero-energy crossings of subgap ABS as signatures of these transitions. Our findings suggest that these effects are experimentally accessible and offer a robust platform for studying quantum phase transitions in hybrid nanowires.</description>

Abstract: This perspective explores various quantum models of consciousness from the viewpoint of quantum information science, offering potential ideas and insights. The models under consideration can be categorized into three distinct groups based on the level at which quantum mechanics might operate within the brain: those suggesting that consciousness arises from electron delocalization within microtubules inside neurons, those proposing it emerges from the electromagnetic field surrounding the entire neural network, and those positing it originates from the interactions between individual neurons governed by neurotransmitter molecules. Our focus is particularly on the Posner model of cognition, for which we provide preliminary calculations on the preservation of entanglement of phosphate molecules within the geometric structure of Posner clusters. These findings provide valuable insights into how quantum information theory can enhance our understanding of brain functions.</description>

      <title>Poincare invariant interaction between two Dirac particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spinning electron-electron interaction is described in classical terms by means of two possible classical interactions: The instantaneous Coulomb interaction between the charge centers of both particles and the Poincar\'e invariant interaction developed in a previous work. The numerical integrations are performed with several Mathematica notebooks that are available for the interested readers in the reference Section. One difference of these interactions is that the Poincar\'e invariant interaction does not satisfy the action-reaction principle in the synchronous description and, therefore, there is no conservation of the mechanical linear momentum. It is the total linear momentum of the system what is conserved.
  In this synchronous description the interaction is not mediated by the retarded fields but is described in terms of the instantaneous positions, velocities and accelerations of the center of charge of both particles. In the Poincar\'e invariant description the net binding force that holds linked two Dirac particles is stronger than in the Coulomb case, thus forming a stable spin 1 system of 2 Dirac particles. This bosonic state of spin 1 does not correspond to a Cooper pair because the separation between the centers of mass of the Dirac particles is below Compton's wavelength, smaller than the correlation distance of the Cooper pair. Since the Poincar\'e invariant interaction is relativistically invariant it can be used for analyzing high energy scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Matching Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Simulations in (2+1)-dimensional U(1) Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At finite lattice spacing, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian predictions differ due to discretization effects. In the Hamiltonian limit, i.e. at vanishing temporal lattice spacing $a_t$, the path integral approach in the Lagrangian formalism reproduces the results of the Hamiltonian theory. In this work, we numerically calculate the Hamiltonian limit of a U$(1)$ gauge theory in $(2+1)$ dimensions. This is achieved by Monte Carlo simulations in the Lagrangian formalism with lattices that are anisotropic in the time direction. For each ensemble, we determine the ratio between the temporal and spatial scale with the static quark potential and extrapolate to $a_t \to 0$. Our results are compared with the data from Hamiltonian simulations at small volumes, showing agreement within $&lt;2\sigma$. These results can be used to match the two formalisms.</description>

      <title>Critical Non-Hermitian Edge Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We unveil a unique critical phenomenon of topological edge modes in non-Hermitian systems, dubbed the critical non-Hermitian edge modes (CNHEM). Specifically, in the thermodynamic limit, the eigenvectors of edge modes jump discontinuously under infinitesimal on-site staggered perturbations. The CNHEM arises from the competition between the introduced on-site staggered potentials and size-dependent non-reciprocal coupling between edge modes, and are closely connected to the exceptional point (EP). As the system size increases, the coupling between edge modes decreases while the non-reciprocity is enhanced, causing the
  eigenvectors to gradually collapse toward the EP. However, when the on-site potentials dominate, this weakened coupling assists the eigenvectors to stay away from the EP. Such a critical phenomenon is absent in Hermitian systems, where the coupling between edge modes is reciprocal.</description>

      <title>Emergence of an Epsilon-Near-Zero Medium from Microscopic Atomic Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that an effective near-zero refractive index can emerge from collective light scattering in a discrete atomic lattice, using essentially exact microscopic simulations. In a 25-layer array, cooperative response leads to over a thirtyfold increase in the effective optical wavelength within the medium, almost eliminating optical phase accumulation, with potential applications in spectroscopy and optical manipulation of quantum emitters. Crucially, the near-zero refractive index arises from first-principles microscopic theory, rather than being imposed through continuous phenomenological effective-medium model - providing conceptually important insight into the emergence of macroscopic electromagnetism from atomic-scale interactions.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Properties of Single Crystal Calcium Tungstate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This investigation employed microwave whispering gallery mode (WGM) analysis to characterize the dielectric properties of a cylindrical, single-crystal sample of calcium tungstate (CaWO$_4$). Through investigation of quasi-transverse\hyp{}magnetic and quasi-transverse\hyp{}electric mode families, we can assess loss mechanisms and relative permittivity from room temperature down to cryogenic conditions. We report the biaxial permittivity values of $\epsilon_{||} = 9.029 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.761 \pm 0.01$ at $295$ K, and $\epsilon_{||} = 8.797 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.442 \pm 0.01$ at $4$ K. Components are denoted with respect to the c\hyp{}axis of the crystal unit cell. The parallel component agrees well with the published literature at MHz frequencies; however, the perpendicular component is $4.8$\% lower. The WGM technique offers greater precision, with accuracy limited primarily by the uncertainty in the crystal's dimensions. WGMs also serve as sensitive probes of lattice dynamics, enabling monitoring of temperature-dependent loss mechanisms. At room temperature, the measured loss tangents were $\tan\delta_{||}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (4.1 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{-5}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (3.64 \pm 0.92) \times 10^{-5}$. Upon cooling to 4 K, the loss tangents improved by approximately two orders of magnitude, reaching $\tan\delta_{||}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (1.56 \pm 0.52) \times 10^{-7}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (2.05 \pm 0.79) \times 10^{-7}$. These cryogenic values are higher than those reported in prior studies, likely due to a magnetic loss channel associated with an unidentified paramagnetic spin ensemble. These findings have implications for the use of CaWO$_4$ in applications such as spin-based quantum systems and cryogenic bolometry, highlighting the potential of WGMs for novel sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Wigner representation enables the exact derivation of the atom interferometer phase, unlike the path integral approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact expression for the phase of an atomic interferometer located in a non-inertial reference frame (platform) moving along an arbitrary trajectory and with an orientation that changes arbitrarily over time is obtained. This expression takes into account precisely gravitational, Coriolis, centrifugal, and gravity-gradient forces, which arise during the rotation of the gravity source at a permanent rate. To achieve this result, we utilized the equations for the atomic density matrix in the Wigner representation. Starting from the exact formula, we derived three new terms in the well-known limit of small rotation angles and short interrogation time, which are attributed to the rotation and translational motion of the platform.</description>

      <title>Topological Orders from Reflection Positive Frustration-free Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a framework with reflection positivity as the first principle for establishing the boundary theory of topologically ordered quantum spin systems. For any reflection positive frustration-free Hamiltonian, We proved that the local topological quantum order (LTQO) condition of ground states on a disk holds if and only if the ground state on the sphere is non-degenerate. Furthermore, we show that the Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction produces the boundary local net of operator algebras from the local ground states.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Neon Thin Film Growth with an NbTiN Superconducting Resonator Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrons levitating above the surface of solid neon have recently emerged as a promising platform for high-quality qubits. The morphology and uniformity of the neon growth in these systems is crucial for qubit performance in a scalable architecture. Here we report on the controlled growth and characterization of thin solid neon films using multiplexed superconducting microwave resonators. By monitoring changes in the resonant frequency and internal quality factor ($Q_i$) of an array of frequency multiplexed quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators, we quantify the spatial uniformity of the film. A pulsed gas deposition protocol near the neon triple point results in repeatable film formation, generating measurable shifts in frequency and variations in $Q_i$ across the resonator array. Notably, introducing a post-deposition anneal at 12 K for one hour improves the film homogeneity, as shown by the reduced resonator-to-resonator variance in frequency and $Q_i$, consistent with enhanced wetting. These results demonstrate resonator-based metrology as an in-situ tool for characterising neon film growth, directly supporting the development of electron on inert quantum solid qubit platforms.</description>

      <title>Variations on a Theme of Krylov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spread complexity uses the distribution of support of a time-evolving state in the Krylov basis to quantify dispersal across accessible dimensions of a Hilbert space. Here, we describe how variations in initial conditions, the Hamiltonian, and the dimension of the Hilbert space affect spread complexity and Krylov basis structure. We introduce Koherence, the entropy of coherence between perturbed and unperturbed Krylov bases, which can, e.g., quantify dynamical amplification of differences in initial conditions in chaos. To illustrate, we show that dynamics on SL(2,R), SU(2), and Heisenberg-Weyl group manifolds, often used as paradigmatic settings for contrasting chaotic and integrable (semi-)classical behavior, display distinctively different responses to variations of the initial state or Hamiltonian. We then describe a lattice model that displays linear growth of spread complexity, saturating for bounded lattices and continuing forever in a thermodynamic limit. The latter example illustrates a breakdown of continuum/classical effective descriptions of complexity growth in bounded quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Synchronizing microwave cQED limit-cycle oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-sustained oscillators play a central role in the stabilization and synchronization of complex dynamical systems. A number of different physical systems are currently being investigated to clarify the importance of such active components in the quantum realm. Here we explore the properties of a driven dissipative electron-photon hybrid system based on superconducting microwave resonators coupled resonantly to a voltage-biased double quantum dot (DQD). First, we establish a Hopf bifurcation at a critical value of the electron-photon coupling, beyond which an effective negative friction sustains steady limit-cycle oscillations of individual resonators. Second, we show that two such limit-cycle resonators coupled via the same voltage-biased DQD synchronize for small enough frequency detuning. A nonlinear photon Keldysh action is derived by perturbation theory in the effective circuit fine-structure constant, and the limit-cycle dynamics is analyzed in terms of resulting saddle-point, and Fokker-Planck equations. In the Markovian limit of infinite bias voltage, these results are shown to agree well with the solution of a corresponding Lindblad master equation for the DQD resonator system.</description>
