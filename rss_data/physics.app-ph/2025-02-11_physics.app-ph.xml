      <title>Scintillation response of Ga2O3 excited by laser accelerated ultra-high dose rate proton beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temporal and spectral profile of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 excited by ultra-high dose rate proton beam has been investigated. The unique short bright and broad spectra characteristics of laser-accelerated protons were utilized to investigate the scintillation response difference under different dose rate. Our results indicate that for sufficiently high dose rate delivered, the average decay time of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 decreases by a factor of two. The overlap of carriers generated by high dose rate protons enhances the nonradiative recombination like Auger recombination and exciton-exciton annihilation which shortens the decay time significantly. The study opens up new avenues for investigating the luminescent properties of other scintillator materials using laser-accelerated high dose rate proton beams.</description>

      <title>Room-scale magnetoquasistatic wireless power transfer using a cavity-based multimode resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoquasistatic wireless power transfer can be used to charge and power electronic devices such as smartphones and small home appliances. However, existing coil-based transmitters, which are composed of wire conductors, have a limited range. Here we show that multimode quasistatic cavity resonance can provide room-scale wireless power transfer. The approach uses multidirectional, widely distributed currents on conductive surfaces that are placed around the target volume. It generates multiple, mutually unique, three-dimensional magnetic field patterns, where each pattern is attributed to different eigenmodes of a single room-scale resonator. Using these modes together, a power delivery efficiency exceeding 37.1% can be achieved throughout a 3 m * 3 m * 2 m test room. With this approach, power exceeding 50 W could potentially be delivered to mobile receivers in accordance with safety guidelines.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Leakage Magnetic Field in Wireless Power Transfer using Halbach Array-Based Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless power transfer has the potential to seamlessly power electronic systems, such as electric vehicles, industrial robots, and mobile devices. However, the leakage magnetic field is a critical bottleneck that limits the transferable power level, and heavy ferromagnetic shields are needed for transferring large amounts of power. In this paper, we propose a ferrite-less coil design that generates an asymmetric magnetic field pattern focused on one side of the resonator, which effectively reduces the leakage magnetic field. The key to enabling the asymmetric field pattern is a coil winding strategy inspired by the Halbach array, a permanent magnet arrangement, which is then tailored for wireless power using an evolutionary strategy algorithm. Numerical analyses and simulations demonstrated that the proposed coil structure delivers the same amount of power as spiral coils, while achieving an 86.6% reduction in magnetic field intensity at a plane located 75 mm away from the resonator pair and a power efficiency of 96.0%. We verified our approach by measuring the power efficiency and magnetic field intensity of a test wireless power system operating at 6.78 MHz. These findings indicate that our approach can efficiently deliver over 50 times more power without increasing magnetic field exposure, making it a promising solution for high-power wireless power transfer applications.</description>

      <title>Modeling of High-Sensitivity SAW Magnetic Field Sensors with Au-SiO2 Phononic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of magnetic field sensors with high sensitivity is crucial for accurate detection of magnetic fields. In this context, we present a theoretical model of a highly sensitive surface acoustic wave (SAW) magnetic field sensor that utilizes phononic crystal (PnC) structures composed of Au pillars embedded within a SiO2 guiding layer. We study rectangular and triangular PnCs and assess their potential for application in thin-film magnetic field sensors. In our design, the PnC is integrated into the SiO2 guiding layer, preserving the continuous magnetostrictive layer and maximizing its interaction with the SAW. The sensor achieves nearly two orders of magnitude higher sensitivity compared to a continuous delay line of similar dimensions and an eight-fold improvement over the previous sensor design with PnCs composed of FeCoSiB pillars. The enhanced sensitivity is attributed to resonance effects within the PnC leading to an increased interaction between the SAW and the continuous FeCoSiB layer covering the PnC. Our results highlight the significant potential of incorporating PnCs into the guiding layer of SAWs for future high performance magnetic field sensors.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable nonlinear optical computing device for retina-inspired computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical neural networks are at the forefront of computational innovation, utilizing photons as the primary carriers of information and employing optical components for computation. However, the fundamental nonlinear optical device in the neural networks is barely satisfied because of its high energy threshold and poor reconfigurability. This paper proposes and demonstrates an optical sigmoid-type nonlinear computation mode of Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) biased beneath the threshold. The device is programmable by simply adjusting the injection current. The device exhibits sigmoid-type nonlinear performance at a low input optical power ranging from merely 3-250 {\mu}W. The tuning sensitivity of the device to the programming current density can be as large as 15 {\mu}W*mm2/mA. Deep neural network architecture based on such device has been proposed and demonstrated by simulation on recognizing hand-writing digital dataset, and a 97.3% accuracy has been achieved. A step further, the nonlinear reconfigurability is found to be highly useful to enhance the adaptability of the networks, which is demonstrated by significantly improving the recognition accuracy by 41.76%, 19.2%, and 25.89% of low-contrast hand-writing digital images under high exposure, low exposure, and high random noise respectively.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of self-powered photodetector materials based on Ni-doped ZnO/p-Si heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, Ni-doped ZnO films were grown on a p-type silicon substrate via spray pyrolysis. The Ni dopant concentrations were varied by adjusting the weight ratio between Zinc Acetate Dehydrate (ZAD) and Nickel Chloride Hexahydrate (NCH), resulting in the ZnO, ZnO:Ni1%, and ZnO:Ni3% samples. Field-effect scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images revealed that Ni doping significantly reduced the nanostructure size from 326 nm (ZnO) to 146 nm (ZnO:Ni3%). Similarly, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis also shows the decrease of the crystallite size with increasing Ni doping, from 44 nm (ZnO) to 35 nm (ZnO:Ni3%). Current-voltage (I-V) measurements were conducted at a bias voltage of 0 and 5 V to examine electrical and self-powered photodetection properties. All samples demonstrate self-powered photodetector performance. At the bias of 0 V, the undoped ZnO exhibited a higher photo-to-dark-current ratio (162) as compared to ZnO:Ni1% (18) and ZnO:Ni3% (16). The ZnO:Ni3% samples displayed faster rise (0.4 s) and fall times (1.7 s) as compared to the pure ZnO (10.8 s for rise time and 9.1 s for fall time), highlighting their potential for applications requiring rapid photoresponse. The findings provide valuable insights into optimizing the performance of ZnO-based photodetectors through controlled Ni doping, enabling advancements in self-powered photodetection technology for energy-efficient optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>QUPERS: Quantum Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experimental demonstration of a recently predicted path interference phenomenon [Nanophotonics 7, 1687 (2018)]. A SERS process becomes resonant when both incident and the converted frequencies match with two plasmon resonances -- a condition which is hard to satisfy experimentally. Yet, presence of a quantum dot~(QD) coupled to the lower-energy plasmon mode has been predicted to introduce interference effect in the conversion paths and to bring the SERS process into resonance. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a 7-fold additional enhancement factor~(EF) {\it multiplying} the conventional SERS enhancement owing to the presence of QDs in addition to metal nanoparticles~(MNPs). We eliminate influence of alternative enhancement mechanisms and show that observed additional EF of 7 is solely because of the path interference~(Fano) effect taking place in the presence of the QDs. As the most significant evidence: we observe that when QD/MNP ratio exceeds $1$, EF starts to decrease. Two or more QDs sitting at different~(random) positions on a nanostar MNP surface starts to degrade the path interference effect. Even though the theoretically predicted maximum EFs of $\sim$100--1000 when QD is in the MNP hotspot are not always experimentally feasible in stochastic nature of large area SERS substrate, still, observation of a 7-fold overall increase in such a setting is significant for fabricating Raman-based sensor applications. More importantly, our scheme allows for designing selective SERS substrates. As the QD resonances can actively be shifted by external factors, such as by applying an electric field (Stark effect), it provides a previously-not-existing tool: active selective enhancement of Raman bands via an applied voltage.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional meta-optic azimuthal shear interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal shear interferometry is a versatile tool for analyzing wavefront asymmetries. However, conventional systems are bulky, alignment-sensitive, and prone to nonuniform shear. We present a broadband, compact, and robust meta-optics-based azimuthal shear interferometer in a common-path configuration, reducing the system size to the millimeter scale. Unlike conventional designs, the meta-optic azimuthal shear interferometer utilizes the localized wavefront modulation capabilities of meta-optics to achieve uniform azimuthal shear displacement independent of radial position, significantly enhancing accuracy and stability. Our approach eliminates the need for bulky optical components and precise multi-path alignment, making it more resilient to environmental disturbances. Its multifunctionality is demonstrated through applications in all-optical edge detection, differential interference contrast microscopy, and aberrated wavefront sensing. These results underscore its potential for real-time analog image processing, advanced optical imaging, and optical testing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the fabrication of 8-inch crack-free, dispersion-engineered Si$_3$N$_4$-SiO$_2$-Si wafers fully compatible with industrial foundry silicon photonics fabrication lines. By combining these wafers with a developed amorphous silicon (a-Si) hardmask etching technique, we achieve ultra-low-loss Si$_3$N$_4$ photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with intrinsic quality factors exceeding $25 \times 10^6$ using electron beam lithography and $24 \times 10^6$ using standard ultraviolet stepper photolithography. Frequency-comb generation is demonstrated on these high-quality Si$_3$N$_4$ PICs, corroborating the designed anomalous dispersion. These results establish the feasibility of mass-manufacturing high-performance, dispersion-engineered Si$_3$N$_4$ PICs using standard foundry-grade processes, opening new pathways for applications in optical communications, nonlinear optics, and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Temperature-insensitive fused-tapered fiber couplers based on negative thermal expansion material coating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new method based on negative thermal expansion material coating is proposed to realize temperature insensitive fiber coupler. By coating a layer of modified epoxy resin with a negative thermal expansion coefficient onto the coupling region of fiber coupler, a stable splitting ratio over a wide temperature range can be achieved. A finite-element model for simulating the influence of thermal fluctuations on fused-tapered fiber coupler's splitting ratio is built and verified via experimental test. Furthermore, using this model, the influence of the thickness, length, and thermal expansion coefficient of the coating material on the splitting ratio is studied. Through adjusting the parameters of the coating, the temperature stability of the fiber coupler splitting ratio can be improved by more than one order of magnitude and improved to 1.2*10-5/K. The temperature-insensitive fused-tapered fiber coupler can find important application in optical precision measurement under extreme temperature environment, such as inter-satellite laser interferometry and high-precision fiber gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Silica Aerogel Thin Film on Improving Solar Cell Efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silica aerogels are nanoporous materials with exceptional optical and physical properties, making them promising candidates to enhance solar cell efficiency as antireflective coatings. This study synthesized hydrophobic silica aerogel thin films under ambient conditions and characterized their porous structure, surface morphology, and optical performance. The films were deposited on monocrystalline silicon solar cells to assess their impact on photovoltaic properties. A two-step acid/base catalyzed sol-gel process was utilized, followed by solvent exchange and surface modification with trimethylchlorosilane. Structural analysis via SEM revealed successful deposition of crack-free films when aging occurred in an ethanol environment. The aerogel displayed considerable specific surface area (115 m2/g), porosity (77.92%), and surface roughness (55-78%) along with a low refractive index (1.05), benefiting light harvesting. Preliminary solar testing showed increased output voltage with a 0.2 mm aerogel coating versus a bare cell. Further IV measurements demonstrated enhanced charge transport and conversion efficiency for the treated cell. The antireflective and light-trapping effects of aerogel appear to improve photon absorption. This initial research validates the potential of ambient pressure-synthesized hydrophobic silica aerogels to increase the performance of silicon photovoltaics cost-effectively. Further optimization of film thickness and morphology could realize higher efficiency gains.</description>

      <title>The Ridge Integration Method and its Application to Molecular Sieving, Demonstrated for Gas Purification via Graphdiyne Membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eyring theory provides a convenient approximation to the rate of a chemical reaction, as it uses only local information evaluated near extremal points of a given potential energy surface. However, in cases of pronounced anharmonicity and particularly low-lying vibrational frequencies, deviations from the correct reaction rate can become substantial. Molecular Dynamics simulations, on the other hand, are very costly at higher levels of theory, and of limited use since molecular reactions are `rare' events and hence statistically less accessible. In this article, we present an alternative description for problems of gas separation and storage via two-dimensional materials such as porous graphene or flat metal-organic frameworks. Taking geometric advantage of the typical problem setting, our method is based on a statistical analysis of molecular trajectories near the so-called `ridge', a hypersurface which divides the reaction volume into a reactant and a product side. It allows for more realistic predictions of permeabilities and selectivities, e.g. derived from density functional theory, but without the considerable costs of a full molecular dynamics simulation on the corresponding Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface. We test our method on the example of methane separation from nitrogen and carbon dioxide via a graphdiyne membrane.</description>

      <title>Topological rainbow trapping and broadband piezoelectric energy harvesting of acoustic waves in gradient phononic crystals with coupled interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological phononic crystals (PCs) offer an innovative method for manipulating acoustic or elastic waves. In this study, we introduce the gradient PC structures with coupled interfaces, specifically designed to achieve topological rainbow trapping and broadband acoustic energy harvesting. By leveraging the geometric symmetry of PC unit cells, we merge two PCs with distinct topological phases to create coupled topological interfaces. Gradient modulation of structural parameters along the coupled interfaces induces rainbow trapping, where acoustic waves are spatially separated by frequency. The numerical and experimental results indicate that the acoustic waves of various frequencies are halted and magnified at distinct locations within the coupled interfaces. Compared to the bare harvester, the topological PC energy harvester markedly increases output power across a range of excitation frequencies, with a maximum amplification ratio of 91 observed in experiments. Furthermore, the topological rainbow trapping is robust against random structural disorders. The coupled interfaces exhibit broadband and multimodal capabilities, holding potential for various applications including selective filtering and enhanced sensing.</description>

      <title>Unbalanced CRLH Leaky-wave Antenna With Broadside Radiation Based On Spin Photonic Topological Insulator Featured Hexagonal Configuration In Armchair Arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15820v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new X-band leaky-wave antenna has been developed using spin photonic topological insulators. This antenna features a hexagonal unit cell arranged in an armchair configuration. This arrangement provides advantages over the zigzag configuration, particularly by offering a wider operational region and a more suitable pattern. To design the structure, a parametric study on the cell dimensions has been conducted, and another study has designed the transition region to couple the topological structure with the classical line. The proposed antenna has a low profile and illuminates two sides of the structure simultaneously. Additionally, it offers a 53-degree scanning range and a bandwidth of 2.7 GHz, making it a groundbreaking improvement over other leaky-wave antennas that utilize photonic topological insulators. The proposed antenna is an unbalanced CRLH leaky-wave antenna capable of radiating in both backward and forward directions. Notably, as it transitions through the broadside within its scanning range, there is no significant drop in performance, even in the presence of an open stop band. To the best of our knowledge, this characteristic is unique among unbalanced CRLH leaky-wave antennas.</description>

      <title>GHz-rate optical phase shift in light matter interaction-engineered, silicon-ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organic electro-optic materials have demonstrated promising performance in developing electro-optic phase shifters. Their integration with other silicon photonic processes, nanofabrication complexities, and durability remains to be developed. While the required poling step in electro-optic polymers limits their potential and utilization on a large scale, devices made of paraelectric nematic liquid crystals suffer from slow bandwidth. In ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, we report an additional GHz-fast phase shift that ultimately allows for significant second-order nonlinear optical coefficients related to the Pockels effect. It avoids poling issues and can pave the way for hybrid silicon-organic systems with CMOS-foundry compatibility. We report DC and AC modulation efficiencies of $\approx$~0.25 V$\cdot$mm (from liquid crystal orientation) and $\approx$~25.7 V$\cdot$mm (from Pockels effect), respectively, an on-chip insertion loss of $\approx$~2.6 dB, and an electro-optic bandwidth of $f_\text{-6dB}$&gt;4.18 GHz, employing improved light-matter interaction in a waveguide architecture that calls for only one lithography step.</description>

      <title>Disordered Optical Metasurfaces: Basics, Properties, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces are conventionally viewed as organized flat arrays of photonic or plasmonic nanoresonators, also called metaatoms. These metasurfaces are typically highly ordered and fabricated with precision using expensive tools. However, the inherent imperfections in large-scale nanophotonic devices, along with recent advances in bottom-up nanofabrication techniques and design strategies, have highlighted the potential benefits of incorporating disorder to achieve specific optical functionalities. This review offers an overview of the key theoretical, numerical, and experimental aspects related to the exploration of disordered optical metasurfaces. It introduces fundamental concepts of light scattering by disordered metasurfaces and outlines theoretical and numerical methodologies for analyzing their optical behavior. Various fabrication techniques are discussed, highlighting the types of disorder they deliver and their achievable precision level. The review also explores critical applications of disordered optical metasurfaces, such as light manipulation in thin film materials and the design of structural colors and visual appearances. Finally, the article offers perspectives on the burgeoning future research in this field. Disordered optical metasurfaces offer a promising alternative to their ordered counterparts, often delivering unique functionalities or enhanced performance. They present a particularly exciting opportunity in applications demanding large-scale implementation, such as sustainable renewable energy systems, as well as aesthetically vibrant coatings for luxury goods and architectural designs.</description>

      <title>Heat Generation in Spatially Confined Solids Through Electronic Light Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we study the optical heating of spatially dispersive solids due to electronic light scattering (ELS), a phenomenon driven by indirect optical transitions. In this process, a spatial heterogeneity generates an optical near-field photon with expanded momentum, leading to electron-photon momentum matching, followed by thermalization of the electron system promoting optical heating. We experimentally demonstrate this effect by melting spatially confined semiconductor (Si) and metal (Au) under continuous-wave laser pump within the transparency window. ELS is a dominant physical process in media with strong spatial dispersion, underlying a variety of thermo-optical applications.</description>

      <title>On the importance of Ni-Au-Ga interdiffusion in the formation of a Ni-Au / p-GaN ohmic contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ni-Au-Ga interdiffusion mechanisms taking place during rapid thermal annealing (RTA) under oxygen atmosphere of a Ni-Au/p-GaN contact are investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) coupled to energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). It is shown that oxygen-assisted, Ni diffusion to the top surface of the metallic contact through the formation of a nickel oxide (NiOx) is accompanied by Au diffusion down to the GaN surface, and by Ga out-diffusion through the GaN/metal interface. Electrical characterizations of the contact by Transmission Line Method (TLM) show that an ohmic contact is obtained as soon as a thin, Au-Ga interfacial layer is formed, even after complete diffusion of Ni or NiOx to the top surface of the contact. Our results clarify that the presence of Ni or NiOx at the interface is not the main origin of the ohmic-like behavior in such contacts. Auto-cleaning of the interface during the interdiffusion process may play a role, but TEM-EDX analysis evidences that the creation of Ga vacancies associated to the formation of a Ga-Au interfacial layer is crucial for reducing the Schottky barrier height, and maximizing the amount of current flowing through the contact.</description>

      <title>A Linear Quantum Coupler for Clean Bosonic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing with superconducting circuits relies on high-fidelity driven nonlinear processes. An ideal quantum nonlinearity would selectively activate desired coherent processes at high strength, without activating parasitic mixing products or introducing additional decoherence. The wide bandwidth of the Josephson nonlinearity makes this difficult, with undesired drive-induced transitions and decoherence limiting qubit readout, gates, couplers and amplifiers. Significant strides have been recently made into building better `quantum mixers', with promise being shown by Kerr-free three-wave mixers that suppress driven frequency shifts, and balanced quantum mixers that explicitly forbid a significant fraction of parasitic processes. We propose a novel mixer that combines both these strengths, with engineered selection rules that make it essentially linear (not just Kerr-free) when idle, and activate clean parametric processes even when driven at high strength. Further, its ideal Hamiltonian is simple to analyze analytically, and we show that this ideal behavior is first-order insensitive to dominant experimental imperfections. We expect this mixer to allow significant advances in high-Q control, readout, and amplification.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Inverse Design of Electromagnetic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse design enables automating the discovery and optimization of devices achieving performance significantly exceeding that of traditional human-engineered designs. However, existing methodologies to inverse design electromagnetic devices require computationally expensive and time-consuming full-wave electromagnetic simulation at each inverse design iteration or generation of large datasets for training neural-network surrogate models. This work introduces the Precomputed Numerical Green Function method, an approach for ultrafast electromagnetic inverse design. The static components of the design are incorporated into a numerical Green function obtained from a single fully parallelized precomputation step, reducing the cost of evaluating candidate designs during optimization to only being proportional to the size of the region under modification. A low-rank matrix update technique is introduced that further decreases the cost of the method to less than a second per iteration without any approximations or compromises in accuracy. The complete method is shown to have linear time complexity, reducing the total runtime for an inverse design by several orders of magnitude compared to using conventional Maxwell solvers. The design examples considered demonstrate speedups of up to 700x, lowering the design process from multiple days to weeks down to less than an hour. The approach stands to transform inverse design in electromagnetics.</description>

      <title>Scalable intensity-based photonic matrix-vector multiplication processor using single-wavelength time-division-multiplexed signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits provide a compact platform for ultrafast and energy-efficient matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) in the optical domain. Recently, schemes based on time-division multiplexing (TDM) have been proposed as scalable approaches for realizing large-scale photonic MVM processors. However, existing demonstrations rely on coherent detection or multiple wavelengths, both of which complicate their operations. In this work, we demonstrate a scalable TDM-based photonic MVM processor that uses only single-wavelength intensity-modulated optical signals, thereby avoiding coherent detection and enabling simplified operations. A 32-channel processor is fabricated on a Si-on-insulator (SOI) platform and used to experimentally perform convolution operations in a convolutional neural network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition, achieving a classification accuracy of 93.47% for 1500 images.</description>

      <title>Spatial-offset pump-probe imaging of nonradiative dynamics at optical resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonradiative photothermal (PT) and photoacoustic (PA) processes have found widespread applications in imaging, stimulation, and therapy. Mapping the generation and propagation of PA and PT waves with resolution is important to elucidate how these fields interact with biological systems. To this end, we introduce spatial offset pump-probe imaging (SOPPI). By spatially offsetting the pump beam and the probe beam, SOPPI can image simultaneously PA and PT wave propagation with nanosecond temporal resolution, micrometer spatial resolution, 65 MHz detection bandwidth, and a sensitivity of 9.9 Pa noise equivalent pressure. We first map the PA and PT evolution from a fiber emitter, and how the wave interacting with a mouse skull and brain slices. SOPPI imaging of PA waves from a tapered fiber with water as an absorber shows a wavelength-dependent generation, evanescent wave generated PA, and back-propagated acoustic Mach Cone. At last, a SOPPI-PACT is developed to reconstruct the pigment distribution inside a zebrafish larva with high precision and signal-to-noise ratio.</description>
