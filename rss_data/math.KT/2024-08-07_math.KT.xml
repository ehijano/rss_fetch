      <title>Groups acting amenably on their Higson corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate groups that act amenably on their Higson corona (also known as bi-exact groups) and we provide reformulations of this in relation to the stable Higson corona, nuclearity of crossed products and to positive type kernels. We further investigate implications of this in relation to the Baum-Connes conjecture, and prove that Gromov hyperbolic groups have isomorphic equivariant K-theories of their Gromov boundary and their stable Higson corona.</description>

      <title>Flagged Perturbations and Anchored Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we take advantage of a reinterpretation of differential modules admitting a flag structure as a special class of perturbations of complexes. We are thus able to leverage the machinery of homological perturbation theory to prove strong statements on the homological theory of differential modules admitting additional auxiliary gradings and having infinite homological dimension. One of the main takeaways of our results is that the category of differential modules is much more similar than expected to the category of chain complexes, and from the K-theoretic perspective such objects are largely indistinguishable. This intuition is made precise through the construction of so-called anchored resolutions, which are a distinguished class of projective flag resolutions that possess remarkably well-behaved uniqueness properties in the (flag-preserving) homotopy category. We apply this theory to prove an analogue of the Total Rank Conjecture for differential modules admitting a ZZ/2-grading in a large number of cases.</description>

      <title>Embedding groups into boundedly acyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the labeled Thompson groups and the twisted Brin--Thompson groups are boundedly acyclic. This allows us to prove several new embedding results for groups. First, every group of type $F_n$ embeds quasi-isometrically into a boundedly acyclic group of type $F_n$ that has no proper finite index subgroups. This improves a result of Bridson \cite{Br98} and a theorem of Fournier-Facio--L\"oh--Moraschini \cite[Theorem 2]{FFCM21}. Second, every group of type $F_n$ embeds quasi-isometrically into a $5$-uniformly perfect group of type $F_n$. Third, using Belk--Zaremsky's construction of twisted Brin--Thompson groups, we show that every finitely generated group embeds quasi-isometrically into a finitely generated boundedly acyclic simple group.</description>
