      <title>Some conditions for a good start in problem solving in elementary school. Primum non nocere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elementary school students sometimes exhibit deplorable behaviors when faced with arithmetic problems. These behaviors may result from certain teaching practices and could be mitigated by a few actions that are relatively easy to implement in the classroom. We propose four avenues focusing on the choice and formulation of problems and the clarification of elements of the didactical contract.</description>

      <title>On the Marinus-Ptolemy and Delisle-Euler conical maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine connections between the mathematics behind  methods of drawing geographical maps due, on the one hand to Marinos and Ptolemy (1st-2nd c. CE) and Delisle and Euler (18th century). A recent work by the first two authors of this article shows that these methods are the best among a collection of geographical maps we term ``conical''. This is an example of an instance where after practitioners and craftsmen (here, geographers) have used a certain tool during several centuries, mathematicians prove that this tool is indeed optimal. Many connections among geography, astronomy and geometry are highlighted.The fact that the Marinos-Ptolemy and the Delisle-Euler methods of drawing geographical maps share many non-trivial properties is an important instance of historical continuity in mathematics.</description>

      <title>The Ethical Turn in Mathematics Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article analyzes the emerging ethical turn in mathematics education, arguing that it is a nuanced extension of the sociopolitical turn. While sociopolitical studies of mathematics have highlighted systemic issues and group concerns (e.g., equity, diversity, exclusion), the newer scholarship on ethics in mathematics presents a sharpened focus on the individual responsibility of learners, teachers, and mathematicians by explicitly engaging with philosophical ethics. We analyze key themes of the discourse, including the tension between "doing good" and "preventing harm," and present various philosophical foundations from which scholars have engaged with ethics: Levinas, non-Western perspectives, and pragmatism. We show that the ethical turn holds significant implications for training teachers, including self-reflection, responsibility towards the Other, historical and philosophical awareness, the role of mathematics in society, individual flexibility, cultural sensitivity, and courage to navigate the complex reality of today's mathematics classrooms. The article is designed to also serve as an introduction to ethics in mathematics education.</description>

Abstract: Let $A_k=\{r(k-r): 1\leq r \leq k-1\}$. Erd\H os and Graham asked about the cardinality of the set of common elements. We answer this elementary question and apply our result to a sum-product type result.</description>

      <title>The sexy and formidable male body: men's height and weight are condition-dependent, sexually selected traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On average men are taller and more muscular than women, which confers on them advantages related to female choice and during physical competition with other men. Sexual size dimorphisms such as these come with vulnerabilities due to higher maintenance and developmental costs for the sex with the larger trait. These costs are in keeping with evolutionary theory that posits large, elaborate, sexually selected traits are signals of health and vitality because stressor exposure (e.g.\ early disease) will compromise them (e.g.\ shorter stature) more than other traits. We provide a large-scale test of this hypothesis for the human male and show that with cross-national and cross-generational improvements in living conditions, where environmental stressors recede, men's gains in height and weight are more than double those of women's, increasing sexual size dimorphism. Our study combines evolutionary biology with measures of human wellbeing, providing novel insights into how socio-ecological factors and sexual selection shape key physical traits.</description>

      <title>What is the Funniest Number? An investigation of numerical humor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a preliminary study of numerical humor, we propose the Perceived Specificity Hypothesis (PSH). The PSH states that, for nonnegative integers &lt; 100, the funniness of a number increases with its apparent precision. A survey of 68 individuals supports the veracity of this hypothesis and indicates that oddly specific numbers tend to be funniest. Our results motivate future study in this novel subfield.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Inequalities and Optimal Stability of Numerical Integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical integrator for $\dot{x}=f(x)$ is called \emph{stable} if, when applied to the 1D Dahlquist test equation $\dot{x}=\lambda x,\lambda\in\mathbb{C}$ with fixed timestep $h&gt;0$, the numerical solution remains bounded as the number of steps tends to infinity. It is well known that no explicit integrator may remain stable beyond certain limits in $\lambda$. Furthermore, these stability limits are only tight for certain specific integrators (different in each case), which may then be called `optimally stable'. Such optimal stability results are typically proven using sophisticated techniques from complex analysis, leading to rather abstruse proofs. In this article, we pursue an alternative approach, exploiting connections with the Bernstein and Markov brothers inequalities for polynomials. This simplifies the proofs greatly and offers a framework which unifies the diverse results that have been obtained.</description>

      <title>Mean Value Theorems and L'Hospital-Type Rules for Regulated Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of Cauchy's mean value theorem for regulated functions. Building on this, we extend both L'Hospital's rule and L'Hospital's monotone rule to quotients of regulated functions. We demonstrate that our extended L'Hospital's rule encompasses both the discrete case, known as the Stolz-Cesaro theorem, and the classical continuous case. In addition, we show that these extensions handle some problems that classical rules cannot address. Finally, we provide Lebesgue-Stieltjes versions of L'Hospital's rule and L'Hospital's monotone rule and compare them with our extensions.</description>
