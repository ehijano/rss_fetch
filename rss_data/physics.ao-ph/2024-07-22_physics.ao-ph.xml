      <title>Accurate Column Moist Static Energy Budget in Climate Models. Part 1: Conservation Equation Formulation, Methodology, and Primary Results Demonstrated Using GISS ModelE3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in computing the column moist static energy (MSE) budget in climate models. Residuals from such computations often match other major budget terms in magnitude, obscuring their contributions. This study introduces a methodology for accurately computing the column MSE budget in climate models, demonstrated using the GISS ModelE3. Multiple factors leading to significant residuals are identified, with the failure of the continuous calculus's chain rule upon discretization being the most critical. This failure causes the potential temperature equation to diverge from the enthalpy equation in discretized models. Consequently, in models using potential temperature as a prognostic variable, the MSE budget equation is fundamentally not upheld, requiring a tailored strategy to close the budget. This study introduces the ``process increment method'' for accurately computing the column MSE flux divergence. This method calculates the difference in the sum of column internal energy, geopotential, and latent heats before and after applying the dynamics scheme. Furthermore, the calculated column flux divergence is decomposed into its advective components. These computations enable precise MSE budget analysis. The most crucial finding is that vertical interpolation into pressure coordinates can introduce errors substantial enough to reverse the sign of vertical MSE advection in the warm pool regions. In ModelE3, accurately computed values show MSE import via vertical circulations, while values in pressure coordinates indicate export. This discrepancy may prompt a reevaluation of vertical advection as an exporting mechanism and underscores the importance of precise MSE budget calculations.</description>

      <title>Machine learning emulation of precipitation from km-scale regional climate simulations using a diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution climate simulations are very valuable for understanding climate change impacts and planning adaptation measures. This has motivated use of regional climate models at sufficiently fine resolution to capture important small-scale atmospheric processes, such as convective storms. However, these regional models have very high computational costs, limiting their applicability. We present CPMGEM, a novel application of a generative machine learning model, a diffusion model, to skilfully emulate precipitation simulations from such a high-resolution model over England and Wales at much lower cost. This emulator enables stochastic generation of high-resolution (8.8km), daily-mean precipitation samples conditioned on coarse-resolution (60km) weather states from a global climate model. The output is fine enough for use in applications such as flood inundation modelling. The emulator produces precipitation predictions with realistic intensities and spatial structures and captures most of the 21st century climate change signal. We show evidence that the emulator has skill for extreme events up to and including 1-in-100 year intensities. Potential applications include producing high-resolution precipitation predictions for large-ensemble climate simulations and downscaling different climate models and climate change scenarios to better sample uncertainty in climate changes at local-scale.</description>

      <title>Discrete element method model of soot aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soot is a component of atmospheric aerosols that affects climate by scattering and absorbing the sunlight. Soot particles are fractal aggregates composed of elemental carbon. In the atmosphere, the aggregates acquire coatings by condensation and coagulation, resulting in significant compaction of the aggregates that changes the direct climate forcing of soot. Currently, no models exist to rigorously describe the process of soot restructuring, reducing prediction accuracy of atmospheric aerosol models. We develop a discrete element method contact model to simulate restructuring of fractal soot aggregates, represented as assemblies of spheres joined by cohesion and by sintered necks. The model is parametrized based on atomic force spectroscopy data and is used to simulate soot restructuring, showing that the fraction of necks in aggregates determines the restructuring pathway. Aggregates with fewer necks undergo local compaction, while aggregates with nearly-full necking prefer global compaction. Additionally, full compaction occurs within tens of nanoseconds, orders of magnitude faster than the time scale of soot aging through condensation. An important implication is that in atmospheric soot aggregates, the rate of condensation determines how many necks are fractured simultaneously, affecting the restructuring pathway, e.g., producing highly compact, thinly-coated soot as observed in recent studies.</description>
