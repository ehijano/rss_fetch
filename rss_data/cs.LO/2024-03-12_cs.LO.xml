      <title>Expiring opacity problems in parametric timed automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information leakage can have dramatic consequences on the security of real-time systems. Timing leaks occur when an attacker is able to infer private behavior depending on timing information. In this work, we propose a definition of expiring timed opacity w.r.t. execution time, where a system is opaque whenever the attacker is unable to deduce the reachability of some private state solely based on the execution time; in addition, the secrecy is violated only when the private state was entered "recently", i.e., within a given time bound (or expiration date) prior to system completion. This has an interesting parallel with concrete applications, notably cache deducibility: it may be useless for the attacker to know the cache content too late after its observance. We study here expiring timed opacity problems in timed automata. We consider the set of time bounds (or expiration dates) for which a system is opaque and show when they can be effectively computed for timed automata. We then study the decidability of several parameterized problems, when not only the bounds, but also some internal timing constants become timing parameters of unknown constant values.</description>

      <title>Simulating Quantum Circuits by Model Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuit compilation comprises many computationally hard reasoning tasks that nonetheless lie inside #$\mathbf{P}$ and its decision counterpart in $\mathbf{PP}$. The classical simulation of general quantum circuits is a core example. We show for the first time that a strong simulation of universal quantum circuits can be efficiently tackled through weighted model counting by providing a linear encoding of Clifford+T circuits. To achieve this, we exploit the stabilizer formalism by Knill, Gottesmann, and Aaronson and the fact that stabilizer states form a basis for density operators. With an open-source simulator implementation, we demonstrate empirically that model counting often outperforms state-of-the-art simulation techniques based on the ZX calculus and decision diagrams. Our work paves the way to apply the existing array of powerful classical reasoning tools to realize efficient quantum circuit compilation; one of the obstacles on the road towards quantum supremacy.</description>

      <title>Perennial Semantic Data Terms of Use for Decentralized Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's digital landscape, the Web has become increasingly centralized, raising concerns about user privacy violations. Decentralized Web architectures, such as Solid, offer a promising solution by empowering users with better control over their data in their personal `Pods'. However, a significant challenge remains: users must navigate numerous applications to decide which application can be trusted with access to their data Pods. This often involves reading lengthy and complex Terms of Use agreements, a process that users often find daunting or simply ignore. This compromises user autonomy and impedes detection of data misuse. We propose a novel formal description of Data Terms of Use (DToU), along with a DToU reasoner. Users and applications specify their own parts of the DToU policy with local knowledge, covering permissions, requirements, prohibitions and obligations. Automated reasoning verifies compliance, and also derives policies for output data. This constitutes a ``perennial'' DToU language, where the policy authoring only occurs once, and we can conduct ongoing automated checks across users, applications and activity cycles. Our solution is built on Turtle, Notation 3 and RDF Surfaces, for the language and the reasoning engine. It ensures seamless integration with other semantic tools for enhanced interoperability. We have successfully integrated this language into the Solid framework, and conducted performance benchmark. We believe this work demonstrates a practicality of a perennial DToU language and the potential of a paradigm shift to how users interact with data and applications in a decentralized Web, offering both improved privacy and usability.</description>

      <title>On Enumerating Short Projected Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.12924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Propositional model enumeration, or All-SAT, is the task to record all models of a propositional formula. It is a key task in software and hardware verification, system engineering, and predicate abstraction, to mention a few. It also provides a means to convert a CNF formula into DNF, which is relevant in circuit design. While in some applications enumerating models multiple times causes no harm, in others avoiding repetitions is crucial. We therefore present two model enumeration algorithms, which adopt dual reasoning in order to shorten the found models. The first method enumerates pairwise contradicting models. Repetitions are avoided by the use of so-called blocking clauses, for which we provide a dual encoding. In our second approach we relax the uniqueness constraint. We present an adaptation of the standard conflict-driven clause learning procedure to support model enumeration without blocking clauses.Our procedures are expressed by means of a calculus and proofs of correctness are provided.</description>

      <title>Encodability Criteria for Quantum Based Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06068v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum based systems are a relatively new research area for that different modelling languages including process calculi are currently under development. Encodings are often used to compare process calculi. Quality criteria are used then to rule out trivial or meaningless encodings. In this new context of quantum based systems, it is necessary to analyse the applicability of these quality criteria and to potentially extend or adapt them. As a first step, we test the suitability of classical criteria for encodings between quantum based languages and discuss new criteria. Concretely, we present an encoding, from a language inspired by CQP into a language inspired by qCCS. We show that this encoding satisfies compositionality, name invariance (for channel and qubit names), operational correspondence, divergence reflection, success sensitiveness, and that it preserves the size of quantum registers. Then we show that there is no encoding from qCCS into CQP that is compositional, operationally corresponding, and success sensitive.</description>

      <title>On the Descriptive Complexity of Groups without Abelian Normal Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the descriptive complexity theory of finite groups by examining the power of the second Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's (Ann. Pure Appl. Log., 1989) heirarchy. This is a Spoiler-Duplicator game in which Spoiler can place up to two pebbles each round. While it trivially solves graph isomorphism, it may be nontrivial for finite groups, and other ternary relational structures. We first provide a novel generalization of Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) coloring, which we call 2-ary WL. We then show that the 2-ary WL is equivalent to the second Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's heirarchy.
  Our main result is that, in the pebble game characterization, only $O(1)$ pebbles and $O(1)$ rounds are sufficient to identify all groups without Abelian normal subgroups (a class of groups for which isomorphism testing is known to be in $\mathsf{P}$; Babai, Codenotti, &amp; Qiao, ICALP 2012). In particular, we show that within the first few rounds, Spoiler can force Duplicator to select an isomorphism between two such groups at each subsequent round. By Hella's results (\emph{ibid.}), this is equivalent to saying that these groups are identified by formulas in first-order logic with generalized 2-ary quantifiers, using only $O(1)$ variables and $O(1)$ quantifier depth.</description>

Abstract: We consider the two-pronged fork frame $F$ and the variety $\mathbf{Eq}(B_F)$ generated by its dual closure algebra $B_F$. We describe the finite projective algebras in $\mathbf{Eq}(B_F)$ and give a purely semantic proof that unification in $\mathbf{Eq}(B_F)$ is finitary and not unitary.</description>

      <title>Two-sided cartesian fibrations of synthetic $(\infty,1)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.00938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of Riehl-Shulman's synthetic $(\infty,1)$-category theory, we present a theory of two-sided cartesian fibrations. Central results are several characterizations of the two-sidedness condition \`{a} la Chevalley, Gray, Street, and Riehl-Verity, a two-sided Yoneda Lemma, as well as the proof of several closure properties.
  Along the way, we also define and investigate a notion of fibered or sliced fibration which is used later to develop the two-sided case in a modular fashion. We also briefly discuss discrete two-sided cartesian fibrations in this setting, corresponding to $(\infty,1)$-distributors.
  The systematics of our definitions and results closely follows Riehl-Verity's $\infty$-cosmos theory, but formulated internally to Riehl-Shulman's simplicial extension of homotopy type theory. All the constructions and proofs in this framework are by design invariant under homotopy equivalence. Semantically, the synthetic $(\infty,1)$-categories correspond to internal $(\infty,1)$-categories implemented as Rezk objects in an arbitrary given $(\infty,1)$-topos.</description>

      <title>SATformer: Transformer-Based UNSAT Core Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces SATformer, a novel Transformer-based approach for the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem. Rather than solving the problem directly, SATformer approaches the problem from the opposite direction by focusing on unsatisfiability. Specifically, it models clause interactions to identify any unsatisfiable sub-problems. Using a graph neural network, we convert clauses into clause embeddings and employ a hierarchical Transformer-based model to understand clause correlation. SATformer is trained through a multi-task learning approach, using the single-bit satisfiability result and the minimal unsatisfiable core (MUC) for UNSAT problems as clause supervision. As an end-to-end learning-based satisfiability classifier, the performance of SATformer surpasses that of NeuroSAT significantly. Furthermore, we integrate the clause predictions made by SATformer into modern heuristic-based SAT solvers and validate our approach with a logic equivalence checking task. Experimental results show that our SATformer can decrease the runtime of existing solvers by an average of 21.33%.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Reactive Strategies Resilient to Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19985v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare games under delayed control and delay games, two types of infinite games modelling asynchronicity in reactive synthesis. In games under delayed control both players suffer from partial informedness due to symmetrically delayed communication, while in delay games, the protagonist has to grant lookahead to the alter player. Our first main result, the interreducibility of the existence of sure winning strategies for the protagonist, allows to transfer known complexity results and bounds on the delay from delay games to games under delayed control, for which no such results had been known. We furthermore analyse existence of randomized strategies that win almost surely, where this correspondence between the two types of games breaks down. In this setting, some games surely won by the alter player in delay games can now be won almost surely by the protagonist in the corresponding game under delayed control, showing that it indeed makes a difference whether the protagonist has to grant lookahead or both players suffer from partial informedness. These results get even more pronounced when we finally address the quantitative goal of winning with a probability in $[0,1]$. We show that for any rational threshold $\theta \in [0,1]$ there is a game that can be won by the protagonist with exactly probability $\theta$ under delayed control, while being surely won by alter in the delay game setting. All these findings refine our original result that games under delayed control are not determined.</description>

      <title>On Alternating-Time Temporal Logic, Hyperproperties, and Strategy Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alternating-time temporal logic (ATL$^*$) is a well-established framework for formal reasoning about multi-agent systems. However, while ATL$^*$ can reason about the strategic ability of agents (e.g., some coalition $A$ can ensure that a goal is reached eventually), we cannot compare multiple strategic interactions, nor can we require multiple agents to follow the same strategy. For example, we cannot state that coalition $A$ can reach a goal sooner (or more often) than some other coalition $A'$. In this paper, we propose HyperATLS$^*_S$, an extension of ATL$^*$ in which we can (1) compare the outcome of multiple strategic interactions w.r.t. a hyperproperty, i.e., a property that refers to multiple paths at the same time, and (2) enforce that some agents share the same strategy. We show that HyperATL$^*_S$ is a rich specification language that captures important AI-related properties that were out of reach of existing logics. We prove that model checking of HyperATL$^*_S$ on concurrent game structures is decidable. We implement our model-checking algorithm in a tool we call HyMASMC and evaluate it on a range of benchmarks.</description>
