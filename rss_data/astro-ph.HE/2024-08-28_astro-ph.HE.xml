      <title>Optical and Radio Analysis of Systemically Classified Broad-lined Type Ic Supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a magnitude-limited sample of 36 Broad-lined Type Ic Supernovae (SNe Ic-BL) from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey, detected between March 2018 and August 2021. We present the light curves (LCs) for each of the SNe, and analyze the shape of the LCs to derive empirical parameters, along with the explosion epochs for every event. The sample has an average absolute peak magnitude in the r band of $M_r^{max}$ = -18.51 $\pm$ 0.15 mag. Using spectra obtained around peak light, we compute expansion velocities from the Fe II 5169 Angstrom line for each event with high enough signal-to-noise ratio spectra, and find an average value of $v_{ph}$ = 16,100 $\pm$ 1,100 km $s^{-1}$. We also compute bolometric LCs, study the blackbody temperature and radii evolution over time, and derive the explosion properties of the SNe. The explosion properties of the sample have average values of $M_{Ni}$ = $0.37_{-0.06}^{+0.08}$ solar masses, $M_{ej}$ = $2.45_{-0.41}^{+0.47}$ solar masses, and $E_K$= $4.02_{-1.00}^{+1.37} \times 10^{51}$ erg. Thirteen events have radio observations from the Very Large Array, with 8 detections and 5 non-detections. We find that the populations that have radio detections and radio non-detections are indistinct from one another with respect to their optically-inferred explosion properties, and there are no statistically significant correlations present between the events' radio luminosities and optically-inferred explosion properties. This provides evidence that the explosion properties derived from optical data alone cannot give inferences about the radio properties of SNe Ic-BL, and likely their relativistic jet formation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>New supernova remnant candidates in the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spite of their key role in galaxy evolution and several decades of observational efforts, the census of supernova remnants (SNRs) in our Galaxy remains incomplete. Theoretical predictions based on the local supernova rate estimate the expected number of SNRs in the Galaxy to be $\gtrsim$ 1000. By contrast, the number of detected SNRs amounts to about 300. High-resolution, wide-area radio surveys at low frequencies are ideal tools with which to find missing SNRs, given the prominence of these sources at low radio frequencies. We aim to find missing SNRs using proprietary data from the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) at 144~MHz. We used LoTSS total intensity maps of two Galactic regions, one with $39^\mathrm{o} &lt; l &lt; 66^\mathrm{o}$ and $|b|&lt; 2.5^\mathrm{o}$, and the other with $145^\mathrm{o} &lt; l &lt; 150^\mathrm{o}$ and $|b| &lt; 3^\mathrm{o}$, in addition to mid-infrared (MIR) data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) all-sky survey to search for SNR candidates. We report the discovery of 14 new SNR candidates selected on the basis of their morphology at 144 MHz and a lack of MIR emission. We also follow up on 24 previously reported SNR candidates, inferring their spectral index between the LoTSS frequency (144 MHz) and the frequency at which they were reported. The high resolution and sensitivity of LoTSS observations has resulted in the detection of 14 new SNR candidates. In order to unambiguously confirm the SNR nature of these candidates, follow-up X-ray observations are required with facilities such as eROSITA.</description>

      <title>A millimeter rebrightening in GRB 210702A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present X-ray to radio frequency observations of the bright long gamma-ray burst GRB 210702A. Our ALMA 97.5 GHz observations show a significant rebrightening by a factor of ~2 beginning at 8.2 days post-burst and rising to peak brightness at 18.1 days before declining again. This is the first such rebrightening seen in a millimeter afterglow light curve. A standard forward shock model in a stellar wind circumburst medium can explain most of our X-ray, optical and millimeter observations prior to the rebrightening, but significantly over-predicts the self-absorbed radio emission, and cannot explain the millimeter rebrightening. We investigate possible explanations for the millimeter rebrightening and find that energy injection or a reverse shock from a late-time shell collision are plausible causes. Similar to other bursts, our radio data may require alternative scenarios such as a thermal electron population or a structured jet to explain the data. Our observations demonstrate that millimeter light curves can exhibit some of the rich features more commonly seen in optical and X-ray afterglow light curves, motivating further millimeter wavelength studies of GRB afterglows.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of the extended cosmic-ray decreases observed with world-wide networks of neutron monitors and muon detectors; temporal variation of the rigidity spectrum and its implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the global analysis of two extended decreases of the galactic cosmic ray intensity observed by world-wide networks of ground-based detectors in 2012. This analysis is capable of separately deriving the cosmic ray density (or omnidirectional intensity) and anisotropy each as a function of time and rigidity. A simple diffusion model along the spiral field line between Earth and a cosmic-ray barrier indicates the long duration of these events resulting from about 190$^\circ$ eastern extension of a barrier such as an IP-shock followed by the sheath region and/or the corotating interaction region (CIR). It is suggested that the coronal mass ejection merging and compressing the preexisting CIR at its flank can produce such the extended barrier. The derived rigidity spectra of the density and anisotropy both vary in time during each event period. In particular we find that the temporal feature of the ``phantom Forbush decrease'' reported in an analyzed period is dependent on rigidity, looking quite different at different rigidities. From these rigidity spectra of the density and anisotropy, we derive the rigidity spectrum of the average parallel mean-free-path of pitch angle scattering along the spiral field line and infer the power spectrum of the magnetic fluctuation and its temporal variation. Possible physical cause of the strong rigidity dependence of the ``phantom Forbush decrease'' is also discussed. These results demonstrate the high-energy cosmic rays observed at Earth responding to remote space weather.</description>

      <title>The impact of dark matter on tidal signatures in neutron star mergers with Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If dark matter (DM) accumulates inside neutron stars (NS), it changes their internal structure and causes a shift of the tidal deformability from the value predicted by the dense-matter equation of state (EOS). In principle, this shift could be observable in the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. We investigate the effect of fermionic, non-interacting DM when observing a large number of GW events from DM-admixed BNSs with the precision of the proposed Einstein telescope (ET). Specifically, we study the impact on the recovery of the baryonic EOS and whether DM properties can be constrained. For this purpose, we create event catalogues of BNS mock events with DM fraction up to 1%, from which we reconstruct the posterior uncertainties with the Fisher matrix approach. Using this data, we perform joint Bayesian inference on the baryonic EOS, DM particle mass, and DM particle fraction in each event. Our results reveal that when falsely ignoring DM effects, the EOS posterior is biased towards softer EOSs, though the offset is rather small. Further, we find that within our assumptions of our DM model and population, ET will likely not be able to test the presence of DM in BNSs, even when combining many events and adding Cosmic Explorer (CE) to the next-generation detector network. Likewise, the potential constraints on the DM particle mass will remain weak because of degeneracies with the fraction and EOS.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent intrinsic time delay of gamma-ray bursts on testing Lorentz invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy photons of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) might be emitted at different intrinsic times with energy dependence at the source. In this letter, we expand the model from previous works on testing the Lorentz Invariance Violation (LV) with the observed GRB data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We reanalyze the previous data with the full Bayesian parameter estimation method and get consistent results by assuming that the time delays are due to an LV term and a constant intrinsic time delay term. Subsequently, we neglect the LV effect and only consider the intrinsic time delay effect. We assume a common intrinsic time delay term along with a source energy correlated time delay of high-energy photons. We find that the energy-dependent emission times can also explain the observed GRB data of high-energy photon events. Finally, we integrate these two physical mechanisms into a unified model to distinguish and evaluate their respective contributions using the observed GRB data.</description>

      <title>Response of a Relativistically Streaming Pulsar Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response tensor is derived for a relativistically streaming, strongly magnetized, one-dimensional J\"uttner distribution of electrons and positrons, referred to as a pulsar plasma. This is used to produce a general treatment of wave dispersion in a pulsar plasma. Specifically, relativistic streaming, the spread in Lorentz factors in a pulsar rest frame, and cyclotron resonances are taken into account. Approximations to the response tensor are derived by making approximations to relativistic plasma dispersion functions appearing in the general form of the response tensor. The cold-plasma limit, the highly relativistic limit, and limits related to cyclotron resonances are considered. The theory developed in this paper has applications to generalised Faraday rotation in pulsars and magnetars.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Population Synthesis with Magnetorotational Evolution Constraining the Decay of Magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a population synthesis model for normal radio pulsars in the Galaxy incorporating the latest developments in the field and the magnetorotational evolution processes. Our model considers spin-down with a force-free magnetosphere and the decay of the magnetic field strength and its inclination angle. The simulated pulsar population is fit to a large observation sample that covers the majority of radio surveys using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. We compare the distributions of four major observables: spin period (P), spin down rate($\dot{P}$), dispersion measure, and radio flux density using accurate high-dimensional Kolmogoro-Smirnov statistics. We test two B-field decay scenarios, an exponential model motivated by ohmic dissipation and a power-law model motivated by the Hall effect. The former clearly provides a better fit, and it can successfully reproduce the observed pulsar distributions with a decay timescale of $8.3_{-3.0}^{+3.9}$ Myr. The result suggests that significant B-field decay in aged pulsars and ohmic dissipation could be the dominant process.</description>

      <title>Distance estimation of gamma-ray emitting BL Lac objects from imaging observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct redshift determination of BL Lac objects is highly challenging as the emission in the optical and near-infrared (NIR) bands is largely dominated by the non-thermal emission from the relativistic jet that points very close to our line of sight. Therefore, their optical spectra often show no emission lines from the host galaxy. In this work, we aim to overcome this difficulty by attempting to detect the host galaxy and derive redshift constraints based on assumptions on the galaxy magnitude ("imaging redshifts"). Imaging redshifts are derived by obtaining deep optical images under good seeing conditions, so that it is possible to detect the host galaxy as weak extension of the point-like source. We then derive the imaging redshift by using the host galaxy as a standard candle using two different methods. We determine imaging redshift for 9 out of 17 blazars that we observed as part of this program. The redshift range of these targets is 0.28-0.60 and the two methods used to derive the redshift give very consistent results within the uncertainties. We also performed a detailed comparison of the imaging redshifts with those obtained by other methods, like direct spectroscopic constraints or looking for groups of galaxies close to the blazar. We show that the constraints from different methods are consistent and that for example in the case of J2156.0+1818, which is the most distant source for which we detect the host galaxy, combining the three constraints narrows down the redshift to $0.63&lt;z&lt;0.71$. This makes the source interesting for future studies of extragalactic background light in the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory era.</description>

      <title>Source Count Distribution of Fermi LAT Gamma-Ray Blazars Using Novel Nonparametric Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilized a sample from the Fermi-LAT 14-year Source Catalog by adjusting the flux detection threshold, enabling us to derive the intrinsic source count distribution $dN/dF_{25}$ of extragalactic blazars using nonparametric, unbinned methods developed by Efron and Petrosian and Lynden-Bell. Subsequently, we evaluated the contribution of blazars to the extragalactic gamma-ray background. Our findings are summarized as follows: (1) There is no significant correlation between flux and spectral index values among blazars and their subclasses FSRQs and BL Lacs. (2) The intrinsic differential distributions of flux values exhibit a broken-power-law form, with parameters that closely match previous findings. The intrinsic photon index distributions are well described by a Gaussian form for FSRQs and BL Lacs individually, while a dual-Gaussian model provides a more appropriate fit for blazars as a whole. (3) Blazars contribute 34.5\% to the extragalactic gamma-ray background and 16.8\% to the extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray background. When examined separately, FSRQs and BL Lacs contribute 19.6\% and 13\% to the extragalactic gamma-ray background, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This special issue of the Astroparticle Physics journal is dedicated to the memory of Thomas Korff Gaisser, the Martin A. Pomerantz Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of Delaware. Tom was one of the most prominent scientists in cosmic-ray and astroparticle physics, and also one of the founding editors of this very journal. A theoretical particle physicist by training, he dedicated his career to cosmic-ray physics. He worked on the phenomenology of high-energy particle interactions in the atmosphere, modeling extensive air showers, including the famous 'Gaisser-Hillas' function describing their longitudinal profile. A focus of his work were muon and neutrino fluxes resulting from cosmic-ray showers in the atmosphere, and their measurement with specialized experiments at the South Pole.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the central engine of core-collapse supernovae in the Local Universe: NS or BH?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical trigger powering supernovae following the core collapse of massive stars is believed to involve a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH), depending largely on progenitor mass. A potentially distinct signature is a long-duration gravitational wave (GW) burst from BH central engines by their ample energy reservoir $E_J$ in angular momentum, far more so than an NS can provide. A natural catalyst for this radiation is surrounding high-density matter in the form of a non-axisymmetric disk or torus. Here, we derive a detailed outlook on LVK probes of core-collapse supernovae CC-SNe during the present observational run O4 based on their event rate, an association with normal long GRBs and mass-scaling of GW170817B/GRB170817A. For BH central engines of mass $M$, GW170817B predicts a descending GW-chirp of energy ${\cal E}_{GW}\simeq 3.5\% M_\odot c^2 \left(M/M_0\right)$ at frequency $f_{GW}\lesssim 700\,{\rm Hz}\left(M_0/M\right)$, where $M_0\simeq 2.8\,M_\odot$. For a few tens of events per year well into the Local Universe within 50-100Mpc, probes at the detector-limited sensitivity are expected to break the degeneracy between their NS or BH central engines {by GW calorimetry.</description>

      <title>A multi-band study of pulsar glitches with Fermi-LAT and Parkes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar glitch is a phenomenon characterized by abrupt changes in the spin period over less than a minute. We present a comprehensive analysis of glitches in four gamma-ray pulsars by combining the timing observation data of \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (\textit{Fermi}-LAT) and Parkes 64 m radio telescope. The timing data of five pulsars, namely PSRs J1028$-$5819, J1420$-$6048, J1509$-$5850, J1709$-$4429 (B1706$-$44) and J1718$-$3825, spanning over 14 years of observations for each, are examined. A total of 12 glitches are identified in four pulsars, including a previously unreported glitch. That is, a new small glitch is identified for PSR J1718$-$3825 in MJD $\sim$ 59121(8), and the fractional glitch size was $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim 1.9(2) \times 10^{-9}$. For PSR J1420$-$6048, our investigation confirms the existence of two linear recovery terms during the evolution of $\dot{\nu}$ subsequent to glitches 4, 6 and 8, and identified an exponential recovery process in glitch 8, with $Q = 0.0131(5)$, $\tau_{\rm d} = 100(6)$ d. Regarding the fourth glitch of PSR J1709$-$4429, our analysis reveals the presence of two exponential recovery terms with healing parameters and decay time-scales $Q$1=0.0104(5), $\tau_{\rm d1}=72(4)$ d and $Q$2 = 0.006(1), $\tau_{\rm d2}=4.2(6)$ d, respectively. For the remaining previously reported glitches, we refine the glitch epochs and glitch observables through precise fitting of the timing residual data. We extensively discuss how multi-band data of glitches can help better characterize the glitch recoveries and constrain the underlying physics of glitch events. We demonstrate that the accumulation of observational data reveals the rich complexity of the glitch phenomenon, aiding in the search for a well-established interpretation.</description>

      <title>Fitting transients with discs (FitTeD): a public light curve and spectral fitting package based on evolving relativistic discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FitTeD, a public light curve and spectral fitting Python-package based on evolving relativistic discs. At its heart this package uses the solutions of the time dependent general relativistic disc equations to compute multi-band light curves and spectra. All relevant relativistic optics effects (Doppler and gravitational energy shifting, and gravitational lensing) are included. Additional, non-disc light curve and spectral components can be included to (for example) model the early time rise and decay of tidal disruption event light curves in optical-to-UV bands. Monte Carlo Markov Chain fitting procedures are included which return posterior distributions of black hole and disc parameters, allowing for the future automated processing of the large populations of transient sources discovered by (e.g.,) the Vera Rubin Observatory. As an explicit example, in this paper we model the multi-wavelength light curves of the tidal disruption event AT2019dsg, finding a good fit to the data, a black hole mass consistent with galactic scaling relationships, and a late-time disc Eddington ratio consistent with the observed launching of an outflow observed in radio bands.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound bounds and first-order phase transitions in compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study we employ three distinct physically motivated speed of sound bounds in order to construct hybrid models where the high density phase is described by the maximally stiff equation of state. In particular, we consider the bounds related to special relativity, relativistic kinetic theory and conformality. The low density hadronic phase is described by a state-of-the-art microscopic relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory. This work aims to access the effect of the different speed of sound constraints on the relevant parameter space of the key parameters of first-order phase transitions by utilising recent astronomical data. This involves a systematic analysis that also includes two distinct schemes for the construction of hybrid models, namely the Maxwell and Gibbs methods. Finally, a relevant discussion is conducted on the possible occurrence of a thermodynamic inconsistency that is related to the stability of the high density phase over hadronic matter at large densities.</description>

      <title>Sample of hydrogen-rich superluminous supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen-rich superluminous supernovae (SLSNe II) are rare. The exact mechanism producing their extreme light curve peaks is not understood. Analysis of single events and small samples suggest that CSM interaction is the main responsible for their features. However, other mechanisms can not be discarded. Large sample analysis can provide clarification. We aim to characterize the light curves of a sample of 107 SLSNe II to provide valuable information that can be used to validate theoretical models. We analyze the gri light curves of SLSNe II obtained through ZTF. We study peak absolute magnitudes and characteristic timescales. When possible we compute g-r colors, pseudo-bolometric light curves, and estimate lower limits for their total radiated energy. We also study the luminosity distribution of our sample and estimate the percentage of them that would be observable by the LSST. Finally, we compare our sample to other H-rich SNe and to H-poor SLSNe I. SLSNe II are heterogeneous. Their median peak absolute magnitude is -20.3 mag in optical bands. Their rise can take from two weeks to over three months, and their decline from twenty days to over a year. We found no significant correlations between peak magnitude and timescales. SLSNe II tend to show fainter peaks, longer declines and redder colors than SLSNe I. We present the largest sample of SLSNe II light curves to date, comprising of 107 events. Their diversity could be explained by considering different CSM morphologies. Although, theoretical analysis is needed to explore alternative scenarios. Other luminous transients, such as Active Galactic Nuclei, Tidal Disruption Events or SNe Ia-CSM, can easily become contaminants. Thus, good multi-wavelength light curve coverage becomes paramount. LSST could miss 30 percent of the ZTF events in the its footprint in gri bands. Redder bands become important to construct complete samples.</description>

      <title>An Eddington Limited Accretion Disk Wind in the narrow line Seyfert 1, PG 1448+273</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PG 1448+273 is a luminous, nearby ($z=0.0645$), narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy, which likely accretes close to the Eddington limit. Previous X-ray observations of PG 1448 with XMM-Newton in 2017 and NuSTAR in 2022 revealed the presence of an ultra fast outflow, as seen through its blueshifted iron K absorption profile, where the outflow velocity appeared to vary in the range $0.1-0.3c$. In this work, new X-ray observations of PG 1448 are presented, in the form of four simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations performed in July and August 2023. The X-ray spectra appeared at a similar flux in each observation, making it possible to analyze the mean 2023 X-ray spectrum at high signal to noise. A broad ($\sigma=1$ keV) and highly blue-shifted ($E=9.8\pm0.4$ keV) iron K absorption profile is revealed in the mean spectrum. The profile can be modeled by a fast, geometrically thick accretion disk wind, which reveals a maximum terminal velocity of $v_{\infty}=-0.43\pm0.03c$, one of the fastest known winds in a nearby AGN. As a result, the inferred mass outflow rate of the wind may reach a significant fraction of the Eddington accretion rate.</description>

      <title>AstroSat and Insight-HXMT observations of the long-period X-ray pulsar 4U 2206+54</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the timing and spectral studies of the accreting X-ray pulsar 4U 2206+54 using astrosat and hxmt observations taken in 2016 and 2020 respectively. X-ray pulsations from the system are detected by both missions. The astrosat discovered a significant periodic signal at $\sim 5619$ s in 2016 and hxmt found a pulsation period at $\sim 5291$ s in 2020. A comparison of its spin-period evolution with the present spin-period estimates shows that the neutron star in 4U 2206+54 now has recently undergoing a spin-up episode after attaining to its slow pulsations of ~5750~s around 2015 from its prolonged spin-down phase. The present average spin-up rate of the pulsar is found to be at $\sim1.2\times10^{-13}$ Hz~s$^{-1}$. The phase-averaged spectra of the pulsar in 1-60\kev could be explained with a high energy cutoff power-law continuum model, no evident line features are found with astrosat. The application of Comptonization models such as comptt and compmag to the phase averaged spectra of 4U 2206+54 reveal a hotter source photon region near the pulsar with an emission size extending to $\sim 2-2.8$~km. Using the quasi-spherical settling accretion theory, we explain the present spin-up and the possibility of strong magnetic field of the pulsar.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Constraining the Neutron Star Equation of State and Mass Distribution through Multimessenger Observations and Nuclear Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With ongoing advancements in nuclear theory and experimentation, together with a growing body of neutron star (NS) observations, a wealth of information on the equation of state (EOS) for matter at extreme densities has become accessible. Here, we utilize a hybrid EOS formulation that combines an empirical parameterization centered around the nuclear saturation density with a generic three-segment piecewise polytrope model at higher densities. We incorporate data derived from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), and from experiments such as PREX-II and CREX. Furthermore, we examine the influence of a total of 129 NS mass measurements up to April 2023, as well as simultaneous mass and radius measurements derived from the X-ray emission from surface hot spots on NSs. Additionally, we consider constraints on tidal properties inferred from the gravitational waves emitted by coalescing NS binaries. To integrate this extensive and varied array of constraints, we utilize a hierarchical Bayesian statistical framework to simultaneously deduce the EOS and the distribution of NS masses. We find that incorporating data from $\chi$EFT significantly tightens the constraints on the EOS of NSs near or below the nuclear saturation density. However, constraints derived from pQCD computations and nuclear experiments such as PREX-II and CREX have minimal impact.</description>

      <title>The compact object of HESS J1731-347 and its implication on neutron star matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of the possibility of a small, subsolar mass compact star, such as the recently reported central compact object of HESS J1731-347, on the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars. We have used a hybrid approach to the nuclear EOS developed recently where the matter around nuclear saturation density is described by a parametric expansion in terms of nuclear empirical parameters and represented in an agnostic way at higher density using piecewise polytropes. We have incorporated the inputs provided by the latest neutron skin measurement experiments from PREX-II and CREX, simultaneous mass-radius measurements of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, and the gravitational wave events GW170817 and GW190425. The main results of the study show the effect of HESS J1731-347 on the nuclear parameters and neutron star observables. Our analysis yields the slope of symmetry energy $L=45.71^{+38.18}_{-22.11}$ MeV, the radius of a $1.4 M_\odot$ star, $R_{1.4}=12.18^{+0.71}_{-0.88}$ km, and the maximum mass of a static star, $M_{\rm max}= 2.14^{+0.26}_{-0.17} M_\odot$ within $90\%$ confidence interval, respectively.</description>

      <title>Key Science Goals for the Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA): Update from the ngVLA Science Advisory Council (2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2017, the next generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) Science Advisory Council, together with the international astronomy community, developed a set of five Key Science Goals (KSGs) to inform, prioritize and refine the technical capabilities of a future radio telescope array for high angular resolution operation from 1.2 - 116 GHz with 10 times the sensitivity of the Jansky VLA and ALMA. The resulting KSGs, which require observations at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths that cannot be achieved by any other facility, represent a small subset of the broad range of astrophysical problems that the ngVLA will be able address. This document presents an update to the original ngVLA KSGs, taking account of new results and progress in the 7+ years since their initial presentation, again drawing on the expertise of the ngVLA Science Advisory Council and the broader community in the ngVLA Science Working Groups. As the design of the ngVLA has also matured substantially in this period, this document also briefly addresses initial expectations for ngVLA data products and processing that will be needed to achieve the KSGs. The original ngVLA KSGs endure as outstanding problems of high priority. In brief, they are: (1) Unveiling the Formation of Solar System Analogues; (2) Probing the Initial Conditions for Planetary Systems and Life with Astrochemistry; (3) Charting the Assembly, Structure, and Evolution of Galaxies from the First Billion Years to the Present; (4) Science at the Extremes: Pulsars as Laboratories for Fundamental Physics; (5) Understanding the Formation and Evolution of Stellar and Supermassive Black Holes in the Era of Multi-Messenger Astronomy.</description>

      <title>Deep Einstein@Home search for Continuous Gravitational Waves from the Central Compact Objects in the Supernova Remnants Vela Jr. and G347.3-0.5 using LIGO public data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a search for continuous nearly monochromatic gravitational waves from the central compact objects associated with the supernova remnants Vela Jr. and G347.3 using LIGO O2 and O3 public data. Over $10^{18}$ different waveforms are considered, covering signal frequencies between 20-1300 Hz (20-400 Hz) for G347.3-0.5 (Vela Jr) and a very broad range of frequency derivatives. Thousands of volunteers donating compute cycles through the computing project Einstein@Home have made this endeavour possible. Following the Einstein@Home search, we perform multi-stage follow-ups of over 5 million waveforms. The selection threshold is set so that a signal could be confirmed using the first half of the LIGO O3 data. We find no significant signal candidate for either targets. Based on this null result, for G347.3-0.5, we set the most constraining upper limits to date on the amplitude of gravitational wave signals, corresponding to deformations below $10^{-6}$ in a large part of the search band. At the frequency of best strain sensitivity, near $161$ Hz, we set 90\%\ confidence upper limits on the gravitational wave intrinsic amplitude of $h_0^{90\%}\approx 6.2\times10^{-26}$. Over most of the frequency range our upper limits are a factor of 10 smaller than the indirect age-based upper limit. For Vela Jr., near $163$ Hz, we set $h_0^{90\%}\approx 6.4\times10^{-26}$. Over most of the frequency range our upper limits are a factor of 15 smaller than the indirect age-based upper limit. The Vela Jr. upper limits presented here are slightly less constraining than the most recent upper limits of \cite{ligo_o3a_c_v} but they apply to a broader set of signals.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Collisionless Magnetic Reconnection in the High Ion $\beta$, Strong Guide Field Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In magnetic reconnection, the ion bulk outflow speed and ion heating have been shown to be set by the available reconnecting magnetic energy, i.e., the energy stored in the reconnecting magnetic field ($B_r$). However, recent simulations, observations, and theoretical works have shown that the released magnetic energy is inhibited by upstream ion plasma beta $\beta_{i}$ -- the relative ion thermal pressure normalized to magnetic pressure based on the reconnecting field -- for antiparallel magnetic field configurations. Using kinetic theory and hybrid particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate the effects of $\beta_{i}$ on guide field reconnection. While previous works have suggested that guide field reconnection is uninfluenced by $\beta_{i}$, we demonstrate that the reconnection process is modified and the outflow is reduced for sufficiently large $\beta_{i} &gt; B_g^2/(B_r^2 + B_g^2)$. We develop a theoretical framework that shows that this reduction is consistent with an enhanced exhaust pressure gradient, which reduces the outflow speed as $v_0 \propto 1/\sqrt{\beta_{i}}$. These results apply to systems in which guide field reconnection is embedded in hot plasmas, such as reconnection at the boundary of eddies in fully developed turbulence like the solar wind or the magnetosheath as well as downstream of shocks such as the heliosheath or the mergers of galaxy clusters.</description>

Abstract: Forbidden collisionally excited optical atomic transitions from high ionization potential (IP$\geq$54.8\,eV) ions, such as Ca$^{\mathrm{4+}}$, Ne$^{\mathrm{4+}}$, Fe$^{\mathrm{6+}}$, Fe$^{\mathrm{10+}}$, Fe$^{\mathrm{13+}}$, Ar$^{\mathrm{9+}}$, and S$^{\mathrm{11+}}$, are known as optical coronal lines (CLs). The spectral energy distribution (SED) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) typically extends to hundreds of electron volts and above, which should be able to produce such highly ionized gas. However, optical CLs are often not detected in AGN. Here we use photoionization calculations with the \textsc{Cloudy} spectral synthesis code to determine possible reasons for the rarity of these optical CLs. We calculate CL luminosities and equivalent widths from radiation pressure confined photoionized gas slabs exposed to an AGN continuum. We consider the role of dust, metallicity, and ionizing SED in the formation of optical CLs. We find that (1) dust reduces the strength of most CLs by $\sim$three orders of magnitude, primarily as a result of depletion of metals onto the dust grains. (2) In contrast to the CLs, the more widely observed lower IP optical lines such as [O\, III] 5007\,\AA, are less affected by depletion and some are actually enhanced in dusty gas. (3) In dustless gas many optical CLs become detectable, and are particularly strong for a hard ionizing SED. This implies that prominent CL emission likely originate in dustless gas. Our calculations also suggest optical CL emission is enhanced in galaxies with low mass black holes characterized by a harder radiation field and a low dust to metal ratio. The fact that optical CLs are not widely observed in the early universe with JWST may point to rapid dust formation at high redshift.</description>

      <title>TESS Shines Light on the Origin of the Ambiguous Nuclear Transient ASASSN-18el</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze high-cadence data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) of the ambiguous nuclear transient (ANT) ASASSN-18el. The optical changing-look phenomenon in ASASSN-18el has been argued to be due to either a drastic change in the accretion rate of the existing active galactic nucleus (AGN) or the result of a tidal disruption event (TDE). Throughout the TESS observations, short-timescale stochastic variability is seen, consistent with an AGN. We are able to fit the TESS light curve with a damped-random-walk (DRW) model and recover a rest-frame variability amplitude of $\hat{\sigma} = 0.93 \pm 0.02$ mJy and a rest-frame timescale of $\tau_{DRW} = 20^{+15}_{-6}$ days. We find that the estimated $\tau_{DRW}$ for ASASSN-18el is broadly consistent with an apparent relationship between the DRW timescale and central supermassive black hole mass. The large-amplitude stochastic variability of ASASSN-18el, particularly during late stages of the flare, suggests that the origin of this ANT is likely due to extreme AGN activity rather than a TDE.</description>

      <title>High-energy neutrinos from the vicinity of the supermassive black hole in NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive multi-messenger study of NGC 1068, the prototype Seyfert II galaxy recently associated with high-energy IceCube neutrinos. Various aspects of the source, including its nuclear activity, jet, outflow, and starburst region, are analyzed in detail using a multi-wavelength approach and relevant luminosities are derived. We then explore its gamma-ray and neutrino emissions and investigate potential mechanisms underlying these phenomena and their relations with the different astrophysical components to try to understand which one is responsible for the IceCube neutrinos. By first using simple order-of-magnitude arguments and then applying specific theoretical models, we infer that only the region close to the accretion disc around the supermassive black hole has both the right density of X-ray photons needed to provide the targets for protons to sustain neutrino production and of optical/infrared photons required to absorb the associated but unobserved gamma rays. We conclude by highlighting ongoing efforts to constrain a possible broad connection between neutrinos and active galactic nuclei, as well as future synergies between astronomical and neutrino facilities.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the energy spectrum of the diffuse cosmic neutrino flux from the ANTARES neutrino telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-significance evidences of the existence of a high-energy diffuse flux of cosmic neutrinos have emerged in the last decade from several observations by the IceCube Collaboration. The ANTARES neutrino telescope took data for 15 years in the Mediterranean Sea, from 2007 to 2022, and collected a high-purity all-flavour neutrino sample. The search for a diffuse cosmic neutrino signal using this dataset is presented in this article. This final analysis did not provide a statistically significant observation of the cosmic diffuse flux. However, this is converted into limits on the properties of the cosmic neutrino spectrum. In particular, given the sensitivity of the ANTARES neutrino telescope between 1 and 50 TeV, constraints on single-power-law hypotheses are derived for the cosmic diffuse flux below 20 TeV, especially for power-law fits of the IceCube data with spectral index softer than 2.8.</description>

      <title>A multi-wavelength study to decipher the 2017 flare of the blazar OJ 287</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In February 2017, the blazar OJ~287 underwent a period of intense multiwavelength activity. It reached a new historic peak in the soft X-ray (0.3-10 keV) band, as measured by Swift-XRT. This event coincides with a very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray outburst that led VERITAS to detect emission above 100 GeV, with a detection significance of $10\sigma$ (from 2016 December 9 to 2017 March 31). The time-averaged VHE $\gamma$-ray spectrum was consistent with a soft power law ($\Gamma = -3.81 \pm 0.26$) and an integral flux corresponding to $\sim2.4\%$ that of the Crab Nebula above the same energy. Contemporaneous data from multiple instruments across the electromagnetic spectrum reveal complex flaring behavior, primarily in the soft X-ray and VHE bands. To investigate the possible origin of such an event, our study focuses on three distinct activity states: before, during, and after the February 2017 peak. The spectral energy distributions during these periods suggest the presence of at least two non-thermal emission zones, with the more compact one responsible for the observed flare. Broadband modeling results and observations of a new radio knot in the jet of OJ~287 in 2017 are consistent with a flare originating from a strong recollimation shock outside the radio core.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new paradigm for the production of the dark matter (DM) relic abundance based on the evaporation of early Universe primordial black holes (PBHs) themselves formed from DM particles. As a concrete realization, we consider a minimal model of the dark sector in which a first-order phase transition results in the formation of Fermiball remnants that collapse to PBHs, which then emit DM particles. We show that the regurgitated DM scenario allows for DM in the mass range $\sim1$ GeV $- \,10^{16}$ GeV, thereby unlocking parameter space considered excluded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If dark matter (DM) consists of primordial black holes (PBHs) and particles simultaneously, PBHs are generically embedded within particle DM halos. Such ``dressed PBHs'' (dPBHs) are subject to modified constraints compared to PBHs and can contribute to significant DM abundance in the mass range $10^{-1} - 10^2 M_\odot$. We show that diffractive lensing of chirping gravitational waves (GWs) from binary mergers can not only discover, but can also identify dPBH lenses and discriminate them from bare PBHs on the event-by-event basis, with potential to definitively establish the coexistence of subdominant PBHs and particle DM.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a Past Merger of the Galactic Center Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06416v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) residing in the centers of most galaxies remains a mystery. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provided direct imaging of the SMBH Sgr A* at the Milky Way's center, indicating it likely spins rapidly with its spin axis significantly misaligned relative to the Galactic plane's angular momentum. Through investigating various SMBH growth models, here we show that the inferred spin properties of Sgr A* provide evidence of a past SMBH merger. Inspired by the merger between the Milky Way and Gaia-Enceladus, which has a 4:1 mass ratio as inferred from Gaia data, we have discovered that a 4:1 major merger of SMBH with a binary angular momentum inclination angle of 145-180 degrees with respect to the line of sight (LOS), can successfully replicate the measured spin properties of Sgr A*. This merger event in our galaxy provides potential observational support for the theory of hierarchical BH mergers in the formation and growth of SMBHs. The inferred merger rate, consistent with theoretical predictions, suggests a promising detection rate of SMBH mergers for space-borne gravitational wave detectors expected to operate in 2030s.</description>

      <title>Evidence for eccentricity in the population of binary black holes observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary black holes (BBHs) in eccentric orbits produce distinct modulations the emitted gravitational waves (GWs). The measurement of orbital eccentricity can provide robust evidence for dynamical binary formation channels. We analyze 57 GW events from the first, second and third observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration using a multipolar aligned-spin inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model with two eccentric parameters: eccentricity and relativistic anomaly. This is made computationally feasible with the machine-learning code DINGO which accelerates inference by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to traditional inference. First, we find eccentric aligned-spin versus quasi-circular aligned-spin $\log_{10}$ Bayes factors of 1.84 to 4.75 (depending on the glitch mitigation) for GW200129, 3.0 for GW190701 and 1.77 for GW200208_22. We measure $e_{\text{gw}, 10Hz}$ to be $0.27_{-0.12}^{+0.10}$ to $0.17_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$ for GW200129, $0.35_{-0.11}^{+0.32}$ for GW190701 and $0.35_{-0.21}^{+0.18}$ for GW200208_22. Second, we find $\log_{10}$ Bayes factors between the eccentric aligned-spin versus quasi-circular precessing-spin hypothesis between 1.43 and 4.92 for GW200129, 2.61 for GW190701 and 1.23 for GW200208_22. Third, our analysis does not show evidence for eccentricity in GW190521, which has an eccentric aligned-spin against quasi-circular aligned-spin $\log_{10}$ Bayes factor of 0.04. Fourth, we estimate that if we neglect the spin-precession and use an astrophysical prior, the probability of one out of the 57 events being eccentric is greater than 99.5% or $(100 - 8.4 \times 10^{-4})$% (depending on the glitch mitigation). Fifth, we study the impact on parameter estimation when neglecting either eccentricity or higher modes in eccentric models. These results underscore the importance of including eccentric parameters in the characterization of BBHs for GW detectors.</description>

      <title>The prototypical major cluster merger Abell 754. I. Calibration of MeerKAT data and radio/X-ray spectral mapping of the cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abell 754 is a rich galaxy cluster at $z=0.0543$ and is considered the prototype of a major cluster merger. Like many dynamically unrelaxed systems, it hosts diffuse radio emission on Mpc-scales. Extended synchrotron sources in the intra-cluster medium (ICM) are commonly interpreted as evidence that a fraction of the gravitational energy released during cluster mergers is dissipated into nonthermal components. Here, we use new MeerKAT UHF- and L-band observations to study nonthermal phenomena in Abell 754. These data are complemented with archival XMM-Newton observations to investigate the resolved spectral properties of both the radio and X-ray cluster emission.For the first time, we employed the pipeline originally developed to calibrate LOFAR data to MeerKAT observations. This allowed us to perform a direction-dependent calibration and obtain highly sensitive radio images in UHF- and L-bands which capture the extended emission with unprecedented detail. By using a large XMM-Newton mosaic, we produced thermodynamic maps of the ICM. Our analysis reveals that the radio halo in the cluster center is bounded by the well-known shock in the eastern direction. Furthermore, in the southwest periphery, we discover an extended radio source that we classify as a radio relic which is possibly tracing a shock driven by the squeezed gas compressed by the merger, outflowing in perpendicular directions. The low-luminosity of this relic appears compatible with direct acceleration of thermal pool electrons. We interpret the observed radio and X-ray features in the context of a major cluster merger with a nonzero impact parameter. Abell 754 is a remarkable galaxy cluster showcasing exceptional features associated with the ongoing merger event. The high quality of the new MeerKAT data motivates further work on this system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the isomonodromic method to study linear scalar massive perturbations of Kerr black holes for generic scalar masses $M\mu$ and generic black hole spins $a/M$. A degeneracy between the longest-living quasinormal mode and the first overtone is found for $(M\mu)_c \simeq 0.3704981$ and $(a/M)_c\simeq 0.9994660$. We show that the longest-living mode and the first overtone change continuously into each other as we vary the parameters around the point of degeneracy, providing evidence for the existence of a geometric phase around an exceptional point. We interpret our findings through a thermodynamic analogy.</description>
