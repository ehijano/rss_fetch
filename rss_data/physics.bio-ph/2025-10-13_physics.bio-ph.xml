      <title>Sub-Diffraction Chromatin Domains: Architecture, Regulation, and Functional Roles in Nuclear Organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale chromatin domains, variously termed nucleosome clutches, nanodomains, or packing domains, have emerged as fundamental architectural units of the mammalian genome during interphase and mitosis. Unlike cohesin-dependent loops or TADs, these 50-200 nm structures persist in the absence of loop extrusion, pointing to a distinct organizing principle shaped by histone post-translational modifications and constrained by interactions with the nuclear lamina. Super-resolution microscopy and electron tomography now enable their direct visualization, revealing conserved features such as fractal packing, enrichment for linker histone H1, and radial stratification of active and repressive histone marks. Accumulating evidence indicates that these domains act as transcriptional hubs, dynamically remodel in response to developmental and environmental cues, and undergo pathological disruption in disease. Integrated experimental, theoretical, and computational insights suggest that chromatin-protein interactions, epigenetic read-write processes, and diffusion-driven dynamics together govern their formation, persistence, and nuclear positioning. Viewed in this light, nanoscale domains represent a privileged regulatory tier, complementary to compartments and loop-based structures, that bridges local chromatin states with global nuclear architecture. By situating them alongside lamin-associated (LADs) and nucleolus-associated domains (NADs), we propose a unified biophysical framework for chromatin organization across scales and outline key open questions for future exploration. Because their structural disruption is a recurring feature of aging, cancer, and degenerative diseases, understanding these domains may open new avenues for diagnostics and therapeutic intervention.</description>

Abstract: Dynamic bonding is an essential feature of many soft materials. Molecular simulations have proven to be a powerful tool for modeling bonding kinetics and thermodynamics in these materials, providing insights into their properties that cannot be obtained by experiments alone. Here, we review recent advances in modeling dynamic bonding in soft matter via molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, and hybrid simulation methods, highlighting outstanding challenges and future directions.</description>

      <title>A pilot cohort study of a microfluidic-based point-of-care bilirubin measurement system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective The concentration of bilirubin in blood or serum is useful for assessing liver function as well as monitoring treatment. This study evaluates the clinical performance of a novel point-of-care (PoC) device for the detection of bilirubin in serum. The PoC device incorporates an integrated miniature optoelectronic sensing module and a microfluidic test cartridge.
  Methods Patients' serum total bilirubin concentrations, ranging from 2 {\mu}mol/L to 480 {\mu}mol/L, were measured using the PoC device and the standard laboratory method (n=20). Bland-Altman analysis and regression analysis using Passing-Bablok method were used to benchmark the PoC device against the standard laboratory measurements. The diagnostic capability of the PoC device in categorising the serum samples within clinically relevant bilirubin concentration thresholds of 200, 300, and 450 {\mu}mol/L was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
  Results The mean difference between the PoC device and the standard laboratory method was -5.6 {\mu}mol/L, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of -45.1 {\mu}mol/L to 33.9 {\mu}mol/L. The coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.986. The PoC device achieved a detection sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 97% in categorising bilirubin concentrations within bands used in clinical decision-making.
  Conclusions This study demonstrates that the proposed PoC device is capable of measuring bilirubin levels in patient samples with clinically acceptable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Weak transcription factor clustering at binding sites can facilitate information transfer from molecular signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcription factor concentrations provide signals to cells that allow them to regulate gene expression to make correct cell fate decisions. Calculations for noise bounds in gene regulation suggest that clustering or cooperative binding of transcription factors decreases signal-to-noise ratios at binding sites. However, clustering of transcription factor molecules around binding sites is frequently observed. We develop two complementary models for clustering transcription factors at binding site sensors that allow us to study information transfer from a signal, the morphogen Bicoid, to a variable relevant to development, namely future cell fates. We find that weak cooperativity or clustering can allow for maximal information transfer, especially about the relevant variable. The timescale of measurement is crucial for predicting the optimal clustering strength: for short measurements, clustering allows for the implementation of a switch, while for long measurements, weak clustering allows the sensor to access maximal developmental information provided in a nonlinear signal. Finally, we find that clustering not only facilitates information maximization about the relevant variable, but also can allow the binding site sensors to achieve optimality in a related optimization goal, the information bottleneck (IB) bound. While the measurement time restricts the region on the information plane that is accessible, changes in clustering in conjunction with changes in the binding energy can shift the binding site along the optimal bound, and towards an optimal trade-off between obtaining information about the signal and obtaining relevant information.</description>

      <title>ChromRec: Self-Assembly of Nucleosomes Driven by Directional Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center "recognition" potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question to be addressed. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.</description>

      <title>Confinement reduces surface accumulation of swimming bacteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many swimming bacteria naturally inhabit confined environments, yet how confinement influences their swimming behaviors remains unclear. Here, we combine experiments, continuum modeling and particle-based simulations to investigate near-surface bacterial swimming in dilute suspensions under varying confinement. Confinement reduces near-surface accumulation and facilitates bacterial escape. These effects are quantitatively captured by models incorporating the force quadrupole, a higher-order hydrodynamic singularity, that generates a rotational flow reorienting bacteria away from surfaces. Under strong confinement, bacterial trajectories straighten due to the balancing torques exerted by opposing surfaces. These findings highlight the role of hydrodynamic quadrupole interactions in near-surface bacterial motility, with implications for microbial ecology, infection control, and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Robust assessment of asymmetric division in colon cancer cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymmetric partition of fate determinants during cell division is a hallmark of cell differentiation. Recent work suggested that such a mechanism is hijacked by cancer cells to increase both their phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity and in turn their fitness. To quantify fluctuations in the partitioning of cellular elements, imaging-based approaches are used, whose accuracy is limited by the difficulty of detecting cell divisions. Our work addresses this gap proposing a general method based on high-throughput flow cytometry measurements coupled with a theoretical framework. We applied our method to a panel of both normal and cancerous human colon cells, showing that different kinds of colon adenocarcinoma cells display very distinct extents of fluctuations in their cytoplasm partition, explained by an asymmetric division of their size. To test the accuracy of our population-level protocol, we directly measure the inherited fractions of cellular elements from extensive time-lapses of live-cell laser scanning microscopy, finding excellent agreement across the cell types. Ultimately, our flow cytometry-based method promises to be accurate and easily applicable to a wide range of biological systems where the quantification of partition fluctuations would help accounting for the observed phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity</description>

      <title>Fixation and extinction in time-fluctuating spatially structured metapopulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacteria evolve in volatile environments and complex spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. Here, we consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment in which demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated to harsh and mild environmental conditions. Environmental variability can lead to population bottlenecks, following which the population is prone to fluctuation-induced extinction. Here, we analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to static environments, the mutant fixation probability depends on the rate of migration. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment strategy and discuss possible generalisations of our models.</description>

      <title>Adsorption Barrier Limits the Ice Inhibition Activity of Glycan-Rich Antifreeze Glycoproteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are among the most potent ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) agents, yet the molecular basis for their counterintuitive decline in activity with increasing glycosylated threonine (T*) content remains unresolved. Through molecular dynamics simulations of model glycoproteins with increasing T* content, we show that potent IRI activity arises not only from the thermodynamic stability of strong ice-binding states, but also from their kinetic accessibility. Specifically, the free energy barrier for forming strong ice-binding states from the unbound state constitutes a critical kinetic bottleneck. Increasing T* content enhances the overall hydration capacity due to the additional glycan moieties, thereby imposing a greater desolvation penalty and elevating the adsorption barrier. This kinetic limitation, rather than the absence of strong ice-binding states, accounts for the experimentally observed decline in IRI activity. To quantify the structural basis of this behavior, we introduce a facial amphiphilicity index that integrates both spatial segregation and compositional ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, and show that it correlates well with IRI activity. These findings highlight that facial amphiphilicity mediates a critical balance between binding stability and kinetic accessibility, providing a rational design principle for advanced IRI materials.</description>

      <title>Memristor-Driven Spike Encoding for Fully Implantable Cochlear Implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: This work aims to demonstrate a low-power, biomimetic auditory sensing concept for fully implantable cochlear implants. The approach draws inspiration from the frequency selectivity and temporal encoding of the cochlea, and uses neuromorphic spike generation to replace conventional signal processing blocks. The goal is to establish a compact, energy-efficient front-end architecture suitable for future implantable systems. Methods: An auditory sensing unit was implemented, consisting of a piezoelectric MEMS cantilever mechanically coupled to a single VO$_2$ nanogap Mott memristor-based oscillator. This configuration enables FFT-free, frequency-selective sensing and direct spike generation, forming a biomimetic auditory front end. The concept was experimentally examined using controlled mechanical excitation. Results: The sensing unit exhibited frequency-selective detection of mechanical vibrations in the nanometer to tens-of-nanometers displacement range and generated biomimetic spiking waveforms. Spike rate-encoding of the input amplitude was demonstrated, with output spiking frequencies tunable between approximately 100 Hz and 1 kHz depending on the excitation level. The waveform was finally converted to a biphasic shape suitable for cochlear implant stimulation. Significance: Temporal encoding is fundamental to natural auditory signal processing in the nervous system. By implementing this principle through neuromorphic spike encoding, the proposed approach can provide significant benefits for cochlear implants. In addition, the circuit has the potential to reduce footprint, energy consumption, and latencies compared with current commercial solutions.</description>
