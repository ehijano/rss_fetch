      <title>Using laser and ultrasound devices for breast cancer treatment: studying the effects of gold nanoparticles injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. After surgery, chemotherapy, and other invasive treatments, hyperthermia is a suitable choice with the minimal side effects. In this paper, the treatment of breast cancer using a combination of laser and ultrasound irradiation, in the presence of gold nanoparticles, is investigated. In the simulations, the breast tissue is represented as a multilayer structure and the tumor is supposed to consist two parts: a superficial section and a deeper region. In the initial stage, the superficial parts of the tumor, which also contain gold nanoparticles, are exposed to a continuous laser for 50 seconds followed by a cooling period of 20 seconds. Then, for deeper sections, ultrasound irradiation is utilized. The results indicated that the tissue necrosis volume was enhanced by the application of nanoparticles. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the combinational application of both of laser and ultrasound irradiation could eradicate both the superficial parts of the tumor and the deep parts.</description>

      <title>Development of a novel hybrid haptic (nHH) device with a remote center of rotation dedicated to laparoscopic surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on developing a novel hybrid-haptic (nHH) device with a remote center of rotation with 4 DOFs (degrees of freedom) intendant to be used as a haptic device. The new architecture is composed of two chains handling each one a part of the motions. It has the advantages of a parallel robot as high stiffness and accuracy, and the large workspace of the serial robots. The optimal synthesis of the nHH was performed using real-coded genetic algorithms. The optimization criteria and constraints were established and successively formulated and solved using a mono-objective function. A validation and comparison study were performed between the spherical parallel manipulator and the nHH. The obtained results are promising since the nHH is compared to other similar task devices, such as spherical parallel manipulator, and presents a suitable kinematic performance with a task workspace free singularity inside.</description>

      <title>Design and construction of a wireless robot that simulates head movements in cone beam computed tomography imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the major challenges in the science of maxillofacial radiology imaging is the various artifacts created in images taken by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging systems. Among these artifacts, motion artifact, which is created by the patient, has adverse effects on image quality. In this paper, according to the conditions and limitations of the CBCT imaging room, the goal is the design and development of a cable-driven parallel robot to create repeatable movements of a dry skull inside a CBCT scanner for studying motion artifacts and building up reference datasets with motion artifacts. The proposed robot allows a dry skull to execute motions, which were selected on the basis of clinical evidence, with 3-degrees of freedom during imaging in synchronous manner with the radiation beam. The kinematic model of the robot is presented to investigate and describe the correlation between the amount of motion and the pulse width applied to DC motors. This robot can be controlled by the user through a smartphone or laptop wirelessly via a Wi-Fi connection. Using wireless communication protects the user from harmful radiation during robot driving and functioning. The results show that the designed robot has a reproducibility above 95% in performing various movements.</description>

      <title>Development of the normalization method for the first large field-of-view plastic-based PET Modular scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In positron emission tomography acquisition (PET), sensitivity along a line of response can vary due to crystal geometrical arrangements in the scanner and/or detector inefficiencies, leading to severe artefacts in the reconstructed image. To mitigate these effects, data must be corrected by a set of normalization coefficients applied to each line of response. The J-PET Modular scanner is a PET device made of 50 cm long plastic strips arranged axially, currently in operation at the Jagiellonian University in Krak\'ow (Poland).
  We have implemented a normalization method for the large field-of-view plastic-based J-PET Modular scanner using the component-based approach. We estimated the geometric normalization factors for the J-PET Modular scanner using Monte Carlo simulations. We also analysed the effects of variations in detection efficiency. A dedicated cylindrical phantom was simulated to investigate the impact of various factors on image quality. The image quality was quantified in terms of radial and axial uniformity metrics, and the standard deviation to mean intensity ratio, determined for a set of image slices.
  Without normalization, reconstructions of a uniform cylinder exhibit artefacts. These artefacts were satisfactorily compensated using the normalization factors. Applying geometrical corrections lowers the non-uniformity of the image expressed as a standard deviation-to-mean ratio to a range between 5.5 % to 8.5 %. Computationally, the technique is straightforward to parallelize, making it time-efficient. Preliminary estimates suggest that the method is appropriate for use with long axial field-of-view scanners, such as the total-body J-PET, currently under development at the Jagiellonian University.</description>

      <title>Basis function compression for field probe monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Field monitoring using field probes allows for accurate measurement of magnetic field perturbations, such as from eddy currents, during MRI scanning. However, errors may result when the spatial variation of the fields is not well-described by the conventionally used spherical harmonics model that has the maximum order constrained by the number of probes. The objective of this work was to develop and validate a field monitoring approach that compresses higher order spherical harmonic basis functions into a smaller set of new basis functions that can be computed from fewer probes. Methods: Field monitoring of acquisitions was repeated with probes in different locations. High-order field dynamics were computed from this calibration probe data assembled from all scans, from which compression matrices could be devised using principal component analysis. Compression matrices were then utilized to fit field dynamics using compressed basis functions with data from 16 probes, which were then used in image reconstruction. Performance was evaluated by assessing the accuracy of computed field dynamics as well as in vivo image quality. Technique generalizability was also assessed by using various acquisition and diffusion encoding strategies for the calibration data. Results: Qualitative and quantitative improvements in accuracy were observed when using the proposed fitting method in comparison to the conventional approach. However, compression effectiveness was influenced by the specific acquisition data included in the calibration set. Conclusion: The ability to tailor basis functions to more compactly describe the spatial variation of field perturbations enables improved characterization of fields with rapid spatial variations.</description>

      <title>Compressed radiotherapy treatment planning (CompressRTP): A new paradigm for rapid and high-quality treatment planning optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Radiotherapy treatment planning involves solving large-scale optimization problems that are often approximated and solved sub-optimally due to time constraints. Central to these problems is the dose influence matrix which quantifies the radiation dose delivered from each beamlet to each voxel. Our findings demonstrate that this matrix is highly compressible, enabling a compact representation of the optimization problems and allowing them to be solved more efficiently and accurately. Methods: We precompute the primary (S) and scattering (L) dose contributions of the dose influence matrix A separately for photon therapy, expressed as: A = S + L. Our analysis reveals that the singular values of the scattering matrix L exhibit exponential decay, indicating that L is a low-rank matrix. This allows us to compress L into two smaller matrices: L=HW, where r is relatively small (approximately 5 to 10). Since the primary dose matrix S is sparse, this supports the use of the well-established "sparse-plus-low-rank" decomposition technique for the influence matrix A, approximated as: A = S + H * W. We introduce an efficient algorithm for sparse-plus-low-rank matrix decomposition, even without direct access to the scattering matrix. This algorithm is applied to optimize treatment plans for ten lung and ten prostate patients, using both compressed and sparsified versions of matrix A. We then evaluate the dose discrepancy between the optimized and final plans. We also integrate this compression technique with our in-house automated planning system, ECHO, and evaluate the dosimetric quality of the generated plans with and without compression.</description>

      <title>Comparing DWI image quality of deep-learning-reconstructed EPI with RESOLVE in breast lesions at 3.0T: a pilot study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenging spatial resolution of DWI could be addressed by deep learning based image reconstruction, by reducing noise without increasing acquisition time. To compare the image quality of the Echo Planar Imaging Deep Learning (EPI DL) DWI sequence with the clinically used simultaneous multi slice (SMS) RESOLVE in breast lesions. EPI DL and RESOLVE breast images from 20 participants were qualitatively evaluated. Quantitative image quality metrics of SNR and CNR on both high b-value (b800) images and ADC maps were calculated. SNR in RESOLVE vs. EP DL differed statistically significantly in manually delineations for b800 (p=0.006), ADC maps (p=0.001), and in ADC circularly delineations (0.001). DWI DL reconstruction may be clinically useful for addressing low-spatial resolution without compromising acquisition time and image quality. Such benefits coupled with the available methods of readout segmentation and SMS acquisitions may further enhance the value of DWI in breast imaging.</description>

      <title>A five-bar mechanism to assist finger flexion-extension movement: system implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of specialized personnel and assistive technology to assist in rehabilitation therapies is one of the challenges facing the health sector today, and it is projected to increase. For researchers and engineers, it represents an opportunity to innovate and develop devices that improve and optimize rehabilitation services for the benefit of society. Among the different types of injuries, hand injuries occur most frequently. These injuries require a rehabilitation process in order for the hand to regain its functionality. This article presents the fabrication and instrumentation of an end-effector prototype, based on a five-bar configuration, for finger rehabilitation that executes a natural flexion-extension movement. The dimensions were obtained through the gradient method optimization and evaluated through Matlab. Experimental tests were carried out to demonstrate the prototype's functionality and the effectiveness of a five-bar mechanism acting in a vertical plane, where gravity influences the mechanism's performance. Position control using fifth-order polynomials with via points was implemented in the joint space. The design of the end-effector was also evaluated by performing a theoretical comparison, calculated as a function of a real flexion-extension trajectory of the fingers and the angle of rotation obtained through an IMU. As a result, controlling the two degrees of freedom of the mechanism at several points of the trajectory assures the end-effector trajectory and therefore the fingers' range of motion, which helps for full patient recovery.</description>

      <title>Radiation Measurements Using Timepix3 with Silicon Sensor and Bare Chip in Proton Beams for FLASH Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the response of Timepix3 semiconductor pixel detectors in proton beams of varying intensities, with a focus on FLASH proton therapy. Using the Timepix3 ASIC chip, we measured the spatial and spectral characteristics of 220 MeV proton beams delivered in short pulses. The experimental setup involved Minipix readout electronics integrated with a Timepix3 chipboard in a flexible architecture, and an Advapix Timepix3 with a silicon sensor. Measurements were carried out with Timepix3 detectors equipped with GaAs and silicon Si sensors. We also investigated the response of a bare Timepix3 ASIC chip (without a sensor). The detectors were placed within a waterproof holder attached to the IBA Blue water phantom, with additional measurements performed in air behind a 2 cm-thick solid phantom. The results demonstrated the capability of the Timepix3 detectors to measure time-over-threshold (ToT) and count rate (number of events) in both conventional and ultra-high-dose-rates proton beams. The bare ASIC chip configuration sustained up to a dose rate (DR) of 270 Gy/s, although it exhibited limited spatial resolution due to low detection efficiency. In contrast, Minipix Timepix3 with experimental GaAs sensors showed saturation at low DR=5 Gy/s. Furthermore, the Advapix Timepix3 detector was used in standard and customized configurations. In the standard configuration (Ikrum =5), the detector showed saturation at DR=5 Gy/s. But, in the customized configuration when the per-pixel discharging signal (Ikrum) was increased to 80, the detector demonstrated enhanced performance by reducing the duration of the ToT signal, allowing beam spot imaging up to DR=28 Gy/s in the plateau region of the Bragg curve. For such DR, the frame acquisition time was reduced to the order of microseconds, meaning only a fraction of the pulse (with pulse lengths on the order of milliseconds) was captured.</description>

      <title>Automatic Quantification of Serial PET/CT Images for Pediatric Hodgkin Lymphoma Patients Using a Longitudinally-Aware Segmentation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\textbf{Purpose}$: Automatic quantification of longitudinal changes in PET scans for lymphoma patients has proven challenging, as residual disease in interim-therapy scans is often subtle and difficult to detect. Our goal was to develop a longitudinally-aware segmentation network (LAS-Net) that can quantify serial PET/CT images for pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma patients. $\textbf{Materials and Methods}$: This retrospective study included baseline (PET1) and interim (PET2) PET/CT images from 297 patients enrolled in two Children's Oncology Group clinical trials (AHOD1331 and AHOD0831). LAS-Net incorporates longitudinal cross-attention, allowing relevant features from PET1 to inform the analysis of PET2. Model performance was evaluated using Dice coefficients for PET1 and detection F1 scores for PET2. Additionally, we extracted and compared quantitative PET metrics, including metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) in PET1, as well as qPET and $\Delta$SUVmax in PET2, against physician measurements. We quantified their agreement using Spearman's $\rho$ correlations and employed bootstrap resampling for statistical analysis. $\textbf{Results}$: LAS-Net detected residual lymphoma in PET2 with an F1 score of 0.606 (precision/recall: 0.615/0.600), outperforming all comparator methods (P&lt;0.01). For baseline segmentation, LAS-Net achieved a mean Dice score of 0.772. In PET quantification, LAS-Net's measurements of qPET, $\Delta$SUVmax, MTV and TLG were strongly correlated with physician measurements, with Spearman's $\rho$ of 0.78, 0.80, 0.93 and 0.96, respectively. The performance remained high, with a slight decrease, in an external testing cohort. $\textbf{Conclusion}$: LAS-Net demonstrated significant improvements in quantifying PET metrics across serial scans, highlighting the value of longitudinal awareness in evaluating multi-time-point imaging datasets.</description>

      <title>Misspecification of Multiple Scattering in Scalar Wave Fields and its Impact in Ultrasound Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01220v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the localization of targets in the presence of multiple scattering. We focus on the often omitted scenario in which measurement data is affected by multiple scattering, and a simpler model is employed in the estimation. We study the impact of such model mismatch by means of the Misspecified Cram\'er-Rao Bound (MCRB). In numerical simulations inspired by tomographic inspection in ultrasound nondestructive testing, the MCRB is shown to correctly describe the estimation variance of localization parameters under misspecification of the wave propagation model. We provide extensive discussion on the utility of the MCRB in the practical task of verifying whether a chosen misspecified model is suitable for localization based on the properties of the maximum likelihood estimator and the nuanced distinction between bias and parameter space differences. Finally, we highlight that careful interpretation is needed whenever employing the classical CRB in the presence of mismatch through numerical examples based on the Born approximation and other simplified propagation models stemming from it.</description>

      <title>Differential geometry, a possible avenue for thermal ablation in oncology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a model for hyperthermia therapies based on heat diffusion in a biological tissue containing a topological defect. Biological tissues behave like active liquid crystals with the presence of topological defects which are likely to anchor tumors during the metastatic phase of cancer evolution and the therapy challenge is to destroy the cancer cells without damaging surrounding healthy tissues. The defect creates an effective non-Euclidean geometry for low-energy excitations, modifying the bio-heat equation. Applications to protocols of thermal ablation for various biological tissues (liver, prostate, and skin) is analyzed and discussed.</description>

Abstract: Beta-amyloid positron emission tomography (A$\beta$-PET) imaging has become a critical tool in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research and diagnosis, providing insights into the pathological accumulation of amyloid plaques, one of the hallmarks of AD. However, the high cost, limited availability, and exposure to radioactivity restrict the widespread use of A$\beta$-PET imaging, leading to a scarcity of comprehensive datasets. Previous studies have suggested that structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is more readily available, may serve as a viable alternative for synthesizing A$\beta$-PET images. In this study, we propose an approach to utilize 3D diffusion models to synthesize A$\beta$-PET images from T1-weighted MRI scans, aiming to overcome the limitations associated with direct PET imaging. Our method generates high-quality A$\beta$-PET images for cognitive normal cases, although it is less effective for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients due to the variability in A$\beta$ deposition patterns among subjects. Our preliminary results suggest that incorporating additional data, such as a larger sample of MCI cases and multi-modality information including clinical and demographic details, cognitive and functional assessments, and longitudinal data, may be necessary to improve A$\beta$-PET image synthesis for MCI patients.</description>
