      <title>Minimal Fractional Topological Insulator in half-filled conjugate moir\'{e} Chern bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a "minimal" fractional topological insulator (mFTI), motivated by the recent experimental report on the signatures of FTI at total filling factor $\nu_{\rm tot} = 3$ in a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'{e} system. The observed FTI at $\nu_{\rm tot} = 3$ is likely given by a topological state living in a pair of half-filled conjugate Chern bands with Chern numbers $C=\pm 1$ on top of another pair of fully-filled conjugate Chern bands. We propose the mFTI as a strong candidate topological state in the half-filled conjugate Chern bands. The mFTI is characterized by the following features: (1) It is a fully gapped topological order with 32 Abelian anyons (including the electron); (2) the minimally-charged anyon carries electric charge $e^\ast = e/2$, together with the spin-Hall conductivity, implying that the mFTI's robust edge state remains gapless whenever time-reversal symmetry and charge conversation are present; (3) the mFTI is "minimal" in the sense that it has the smallest total quantum dimension (a metric for the topological order's complexity) within all the topological orders that can potentially be realized at the same electron filling of the system and with the same Hall transports; (4) the mFTI is the common descendant of multiple valley-decoupled "product topological orders" with larger quantum dimensions. It is also a symmetry-enriched topological order promoted from multiple symmetry-protected topological states, after gauging part of their symmetries.</description>

      <title>Metastable ordered states induced by low temperature annealing of {\delta}-Ag2/3V2O5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In {\delta}-Ag2/3V2O5 with charge degrees of freedom in V, it is known that the charge ordering state and physical properties of V that appear at low temperatures depend strongly on the ordering state of Ag. In this study, we focused on the Ag ions in the interlayer and studied the structure using synchrotron radiation powder diffraction in dependence on temperature. We found that when the sample is slowly cooled from room temperature and ordering occurs at the Ag sites, V4+/V5+ charge ordering of V and subsequent V4+-V4+ structural dimers are produced. Although quenching the sample from room temperature suppresses the ordering of Ag, annealing at around 160 K promotes partial ordering of Ag and allows a metastable phase to be realized. This metastable phase is maintained even when the temperature is lowered again, producing a remarkable change in low-temperature properties. These results indicate that the ordered state of Ag, which is the key to control the charge-ordered state and physical properties, can be controlled by low-temperature annealing. The results of this study may provide a methodology for the realization of metastable states in a wide range of material groups of vanadium compounds, where competition among various charge ordered states underlies the physical properties.</description>

      <title>Distance-Dependent Evolution of Electronic States in Kagome- Honeycomb Lateral Heterostructures in FeSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate the formation and electronic influence of lateral heterointerfaces in FeSn containing Kagome and honeycomb layers. Lateral heterostructures offer spatially resolved property control, enabling the integration of dissimilar materials and promoting phenomena not typically observed in vertical heterostructures. Using the molecular beam epitaxy technique, we achieve a controllable synthesis of lateral heterostructures in the Kagome metal FeSn. With scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy in conjunction with first-principles calculations, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the bonding motif connecting the Fe3Sn-terminated Kagome and Sn2-terminated honeycomb surfaces. More importantly, we reveal a distance-dependent evolution of the electronic states in the vicinity of the heterointerfaces. This evolution is significantly influenced by the orbital character of the flat bands. Our findings suggest an approach to modulate the electronic properties of the Kagome lattice, which should be beneficial for the development of future quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Phase Diagram and Skyrmions of the Hubbard Model on the Beta-Mn Type Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic phase diagram for the Hubbard model on the Beta-Mn type lattice has been calculated as a function of the Coulomb interaction energy parameter U and the electron number per atom n by using the generalized Hartree-Fock approximation combined with the recursion method for electronic-structure calculations. The ferromagnetic state, the ferrimagnetic state, and the helimagnetic state as well as the 3Q multiple spin density waves (3QMSDW) states have been obtained on the U-n plane. Their detailed structures are examined with use of the Fourier analysis. It is shown that the calculated phase diagram and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction elucidate the magnetic interactions for the itinerant-electron skyrmions in transition metal alloys and compounds on the Beta-Mn type lattice.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio variational wave functions for the time-dependent many-electron Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing the dynamics of many-electron quantum systems is crucial for applications such as predicting electronic structures in quantum chemistry, the properties of condensed matter systems, and the behaviors of complex materials. However, the real-time evolution of non-equilibrium quantum electronic systems poses a significant challenge for theoretical and computational approaches, due to the system's exploration of a vast configuration space. This work introduces a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing mean-field approximations by capturing many-body correlations. The proposed methodology involves parameterizing the time-evolving quantum state, enabling the approximation of the state's evolution. To account for electron correlations, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow transformations. We also show that we can incorporate neural networks to parameterize these functions. The time-dependent variational Monte Carlo technique is employed to efficiently compute the optimal time-dependent parameters. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems: the solvable harmonic interaction model, the dynamics of a diatomic molecule in intense laser fields, and a quenched quantum dot. In all cases, we show clear signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics not captured by mean-field methods. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to accurately capture the time evolution of quantum states, providing insight into the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities of mean-field.</description>

      <title>Strong Local Bosonic Fluctuation: The Key to Understanding Strongly Correlated Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for understanding the Extremely Correlated Fermi Liquid (ECFL) phenomenon within the $U=\infty$ Hubbard model. Our approach involves deriving equations of motion for the single-particle Green's function $G$ and its associated self-energy $\Sigma$, which involves the product of the bosonic correlation function comprising both density ($D_N$) and spin ($D_S$) correlations with $G$. By solving these equations self-consistently, we explore the behavior of $G$, $D_N$, and $D_S$ as functions of frequency, temperature, and hole concentration. Our results reveal distinct coherent and incoherent Fermi liquid regimes characterized by the presence or absence of quasiparticle excitations. Additionally, we analyze the intrinsic dc resistivity $\rho(T)$, observing a crossover from $T^2$ to linear behavior with increasing temperature. Our findings delineate Fermi liquid, quantum incoherent, and `classical' regimes in strongly correlated systems, emphasizing the importance of quantum diffusive local charge and spin fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the diffuse continuum excitations in the classical spin liquid $h$-YMnO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend previous inelastic neutron scattering results on the geometrically frustrated antiferromagnet hexagonal-YMnO$_3$, which has been suggested to belong to the class of classical spin liquids. We extend the energy transfer coverage of the diffuse signal up to 6.9 meV within a wide temperature range around the ordering temperature, $T_\mathrm{N}$. The two distinct diffuse signals in the a-b plane, the signal localized at $\Gamma$' and the scattering intensity connecting $\Gamma$' points over the M', are shown to be only weakly energy dependent. In addition, an external magnetic field of up to 10.5 T applied along c is shown to have no effect on the diffuse signal. In the orthogonal scattering plane, the signals are shown to be dependent on l only through the magnetic form factor, showing that the correlations are purely two-dimensional, and supporting its origin to be the frustrated Mn$^{3+}$ triangles. This result is corroborated by atomistic spin dynamics simulations showing similar scattering vector and temperature behaviours. Lastly, data for the spin wave scattering in the (h, 0, l) plane allow for a discussion of the magnetic ground state where better agreement is found between the data and an ordered structure of the $\Gamma_1$ or $\Gamma_3$ symmetry, albeit crystal electric field arguments dismisses the $\Gamma_1$ as possibility.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced Ferromagnetic and Superconducting Orders in Multi-orbital Hubbard Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for hidden orders in photoexcited lattice systems is an active research field driven by experimental reports of light-induced or light-stabilized phases. In this study, we investigate hidden electronic orders in strongly correlated two-orbital Hubbard models with orbital-dependent bandwidths. In equilibrium, the half-filled systems are antiferromagnetically ordered. Using non-equilibrium dynamical mean field theory we demonstrate the appearance of nonthermal ferromagnetic order in the photo-doped state, if the two bandwidths are sufficiently different, and its coexistence with spin-singlet $\eta$-superconductivity in the high photo-doping region. Spin-triplet $\eta$-superconducting order appears instead if the two bandwidths are comparable. The rich nonequilibrium phasediagram uncovered in this work shows that Mott insulating multi-orbital systems provide an interesting platform for the realization of nonthermal electronic orders.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum criticality in ferromagnetic CeRh6Ge4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ is unusual in that its ferromagnetic transition can be suppressed continuously to zero temperature, i.e., to a ferromagnetic quantum-critical point (QCP), through the application of modest hydrostatic pressure. This discovery has raised the possibility that the ferromagnetic QCP may be of the Kondo-breakdown type characterized by a jump in Fermi volume, to which thermopower S measurements should be sensitive. Though $S/T$ changes both sign and magnitude around the critical pressure P$_{c}\approx{}0.8$ GPa, these changes are not abrupt but extend over a pressure interval from within the ferromagnetic state up to P$_c$. Together with temperature and pressure variations in electrical resistivity and previously reported heat capacity, thermopower results point to the near coincidence of two sequential effects near P$_c$, delocalization of 4f degrees-of-freedom through orbital-selective hybridization followed by quantum criticality of itinerant ferromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Higher condensation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified theory of defect condensations for topological orders in all dimensions based on higher categories, higher algebras and higher representations. We show that condensing a $k$-codimensional topological defect $A$ in an $n$+1D (potentially anomalous) topological order $\mathsf C^{n+1}$ amounts to a $k$-step process. In the first step, we condense $A$ along one of the transversal directions, thus obtaining a $(k-1)$-codimensional defect $\Sigma A$, which can be further condensed as the second step, so on and so forth. In the $k$-th step, condensing $\Sigma^{k-1}A$ along the only transversal direction defines a phase transition to a new phase $\mathsf D^{n+1}$. Mathematically, a $k$-codimensional defect $A$ is condensable if it is equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_k$-algebra. In this case, $\Sigma A$ is naturally a condensable $E_{k-1}$-algebra, thus it can be further condensed. The condensed phase $\mathsf D^{n+1}$ consists of all deconfined topological defects in $\mathsf C^{n+1}$. A $k$-codimensional topological defect is deconfined if and only if it is equipped with a $k$-dimensional $A$-action, which defines an $E_k$-module over $A$. When $\mathsf C^{n+1}$ is anomaly-free, the same condensation can be alternatively defined by replacing the last two steps by a single step of condensing the $E_2$-algebra $\Sigma^{k-2}A$ directly. The condensed phase $\mathsf D^{n+1}$ is determined by the category of $E_2$-modules over $\Sigma^{k-2}A$. When $n=2$, this modified last step is precisely a usual anyon condensation in a 2+1D topological order. The proofs of the most mathematical results will appear in a mathematical companion of this paper. We also briefly discuss some generalizations and applications that naturally arise from our condensation theory such as higher Morita theory, factorization homology and the condensation theory of non-topological defects.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of epitaxial magnetic pyrochlore heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis of stoichiometric and epitaxial pyrochlore iridate thin films presents significant challenges yet is critical for unlocking experimental access to novel topological and magnetic states. Towards this goal, we unveil an in-situ two-stage growth mechanism that facilitates the synthesis of high-quality oriented pyrochlore iridate thin films. The growth starts with the deposition of a pyrochlore titanate as an active iso-structural template, followed by the application of an in-situ solid phase epitaxy technique in the second stage to accomplish the formation of single crystalline, large-area films. This novel protocol ensures the preservation of stoichiometry and structural homogeneity, leading to a marked improvement in surface and interface qualities over previously reported methods. The success of this synthesis approach is attributed to the application of directional laser-heat annealing, which effectively reorganizes the continuous random network of ions into a crystalline structure, as evidenced by our comprehensive analysis of the growth kinetics. This new synthesis approach advances our understanding of pyrochlore iridate film fabrication and opens a new perspective for investigating their unique physical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fragility of a topologically ordered state, namely, the ground state of a weakly Zeeman perturbed honeycomb Kitaev model to environment induced decoherence effects mimicked by random local projective measurements. Our findings show the nonabelian Ising topological order, as quantified by a tripartite mutual information (the topological entanglement entropy $\gamma$,) is resilient to such disturbances. Further, $\gamma$ is found to evolve smoothly from a topologically ordered state to a distribution of trivial states as a function of rate of measurement (temperature). We assess our model by contrasting it with the Toric Code limit of the Kitaev model, whose ground state has abelian $Z_2$ topological order, and which has garnered greater attention in the literature of fault-tolerant quantum computation. The findings reveal the topological order in the Toric Code limit collapses rapidly as opposed to our model where it can withstand higher measurement rates.</description>

      <title>Stability of Anomalous Hall Crystals in multilayer rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments showing an integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in pentalayer rhombohedral graphene have been interpreted in terms of a valley-polarized interaction-induced Chern band. The resulting many-body state can be viewed as an Anomalous Hall Crystal (AHC), with a further coupling to a weak moir\'e potential. We explain the origin of the Chern band and the corresponding AHC in the pentalayer system. We propose a simplified model that focuses on the physics near high symmetry Brillouin zone points to describe the competition between AHC and Wigner Crystal (WC) phases. We discuss the possible role of the moir\'e potential. We emphasize that even if in the moir\'e-less limit, the AHC is not favored over a correlated Fermi liquid, the moir\'e potential will push the system into a `moir\'e-enabled AHC'. We also suggest that there is a range of alignment angles between R5G and hBN where a $C = 2$ insulator may be found at integer filling.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the time-dependent Quantum Geometric Tensor (tQGT) as a comprehensive tool for capturing the geometric character of insulators observable within linear response. We show that tQGT describes the zero-point motion of bound electrons and acts as a generating function for generalized sum rules of electronic conductivity. Therefore, tQGT enables a systematic and basis-independent framework to compute the instantaneous response of insulators, including optical mass, orbital angular momentum, and the dielectric constant in low-energy effective theories. It allows for a consistent approximation across these quantities upon restricting the number of occupied and unoccupied states in an effective low-energy description of an infinite quantum system. We outline how quantum geometry can be generated in periodic systems by lattice interference and examine spectral weight transfer from small frequencies to high frequencies by creating geometrically frustrated flat bands.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Variational Quantum Eigensolver to detect Phase Transitions through Energy Level Crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Level spectroscopy stands as a powerful method for identifying the transition point that delineates distinct quantum phases. Since each quantum phase exhibits a characteristic sequence of excited states, the crossing of energy levels between low-lying excited states offers a reliable mean to estimate the phase transition point. While approaches like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver are useful for approximating ground states of interacting systems using quantum computing, capturing low-energy excitations remains challenging. In our study, we introduce an equivariant quantum circuit that preserves the total spin and the translational symmetry to accurately describe singlet and triplet excited states in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a chain, which are crucial for characterizing its transition point. Additionally, we assess the impact of noise on the variational state, showing that conventional mitigation techniques like Zero Noise Extrapolation reliably restore its physical properties.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Localization in the Age of Classical Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time?
  This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.</description>

      <title>Operator size growth in Lindbladian SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of operator size in the Lindbladian SYK model with $q$-body interaction terms and linear jump terms at finite dissipation strength. We compute the operator size as well as its distribution numerically at finite $q$ and analytically at large $q$. With dissipative (productive) jump terms, the size converges to a value smaller (larger) than half the number of Majorana fermions. At weak dissipation, the evolution of operator size displays a quadratic-exponential-plateau behavior. The plateau value is determined by the ratios between the coupling of the interaction and the linear jump term in the large $q$ limit. The operator size distribution remains localized in the finite size region even at late times, contrasting with the unitary case. Moreover, we also derived the time-independent orthogonal basis for operator expansion which exhibits the ``operator size concentration'' at finite dissipation. Finally, we observe that the uncertainty relation for operator size growth is saturated at large $q$, leading to a classical dynamics of the operator size growth with dissipation.</description>

      <title>Lateral 2D superlattices in GaAs heterostructures with independent control of carrier density and modulation potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new double-layer design for 2D surface superlattice systems in GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures. Unlike previous studies, our device (1) uses an in-situ gate, which allows very short period superlattice in high mobility, shallow heterostructures; (2) enables independent control of the carrier density and the superlattice modulation potential amplitude over a wide range. We characterise this device design using low-temperature magneto-transport measurements and show that the fabrication process caused minimal damage to the system. We demonstrate the tuning of potential modulation from weak (much smaller than Fermi energy) to strong (larger than the Fermi energy) regimes.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure of Superconducting Infinite-Layer Lanthanum Nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Revealing the momentum-resolved electronic structure of infinite-layer nickelates is essential for understanding this new class of unconventional superconductors, but has been hindered by the formidable challenges in improving the sample quality. In this work, we report for the first time the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of superconducting La$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_{2}$ films prepared by molecular beam epitaxy and ${\mathrm{\textit{in situ}}}$ atomic-hydrogen reduction. The measured Fermi topology closely matches theoretical calculations, showing a large Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ derived Fermi sheet that evolves from hole-like to electron-like along $k_{z}$, and a three-dimensional (3D) electron pocket centered at Brillouin zone corner. The Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ derived bands show a mass enhancement ($m^*/m_{\rm{DFT}}$) of 2-3,while the 3D electron band shows negligible band renormalization. Moreover, the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ derived states also display a band dispersion anomaly at higher binding energy, reminiscent of the waterfall feature and kinks observed in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Spatially oscillating correlation functions in $\left(2+1\right)$-dimensional four-fermion models: The mixing of scalar and vector modes at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that the mixing of scalar and vector condensates produces spatially oscillating, but exponentially damped correlation functions in fermionic theories at finite density and temperature. We find a regime exhibiting this oscillatory behavior in a Gross-Neveu-type model that also features vector interactions within the mean-field approximation. The existence of this regime aligns with expectations based on symmetry arguments, that are also applicable to QCD at finite baryon density. We compute the phase diagram including both homogeneous phases and regions with spatially oscillating, exponentially damped correlation functions at finite temperature and chemical potential for different strengths of the vector coupling. Furthermore, we find that inhomogeneous condensates are disfavored compared to homogeneous ones akin to previous findings without vector interactions. We show that our results are valid for a broad class of $\left(2+1\right)$-dimensional models with local four-fermion interactions.</description>

      <title>Cuprate-like Electronic Structures in Infinite-Layer Nickelates with 3D dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in the infinite-layer (IL) nickelates provides a new platform and angle of view to study the long-standing problem of high temperature superconductivity . Many models were proposed to understand its superconducting mechanisms based on the calculated electronic structure, and the multiple Fermi surfaces and multiple orbitals involved create complications and controversial conclusions. Over the past 5 years, the lack of direct measurements of the electronic structure has hindered the understanding of nickelate superconductors. Here, we fill this gap by preparing IL LaNiO$_2$ and La$_{0.8}$Ca$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ thin films with superior surface quality and measuring their electronic structure by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).The Fermi surface consists of a large three-dimensional hole pocket primarily contributed by Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ states, and a small electron pocket at the Brillouin zone (BZ) corner. The hole pocket exhibits a two-dimensional character over approximately 80% of the Brillouin zone, and its Fermi surface topology and band dispersion closely resemble those observed in hole-doped cuprates, suggesting their superconducting mechanisms may be alike. Yet this hole pocket shows strong three-dimensional character near $k_z=\pi$, which deviates from previous calculations and adds new facets to the superconductivity in IL nickelates. The experimental electronic structure represents a pivotal step toward a microscopic understanding of the IL nickelate family and its superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional phase diagram of the charge density wave in doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb and Cs) have attracted much recent attention due to the coexistence of multiple exotic orders. Among them, the charge density wave (CDW) order has been shown to host various unconventional behaviors. Here, we investigate the CDW order by a combination of both bulk and surface doping methods. While element substitutions in bulk doping change both carriers and the crystal lattice, the surface doping primarily tunes the carrier concentration. As such, our results reveal a two-dimensional phase diagram of the CDW in doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. In the lightly bulk doped regime, the existence of CDW order is reversible by tuning the carrier concentration. But excessive bulk doping permanently destroys the CDW, regardless of the carrier doping level. These results provide insights to the origin of the CDW from both electronic and structural degrees of freedom. They also open an avenue for manipulating the exotic CDW order in Kagome superconductors.</description>

      <title>Universal Chemical Formula Dependence of $Ab$ $Initio$ Low-Energy Effective Hamiltonian in Single-Layer Carrier Doped Cuprate Superconductors -- Study by Hierarchical Dependence Extraction Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility to control the superconducting (SC) transition temperature at optimal hole doping $T_{c}^{\rm opt}$ in cuprates by tuning the chemical formula (CF). $T_{c}^{\rm opt}$ can be theoretically predicted from the parameters of the \textit{ab initio} low-energy effective Hamiltonian (LEH) with one antibonding (AB) Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$/O$2p_{\sigma}$ orbital per Cu atom in the CuO$_2$ plane, notably the nearest neighbor hopping amplitude $|t_1|$ and the ratio $u=U/|t_1|$, where $U$ is the onsite effective Coulomb repulsion. However, the CF dependence of $|t_1|$ and $u$ is a highly nontrivial question. In this paper, we propose the universal dependence of $|t_1|$ and $u$ on the CF and structural features in hole doped cuprates with a single CuO$_2$ layer sandwiched between block layers. To do so, we perform extensive \textit{ab initio} calculations of $|t_1|$ and $u$ and analyze the results by employing a machine learning method called Hierarchical Dependence Extraction (HDE). The main results are the following: (a) $|t_1|$ has a main-order dependence on the radii $R_{\rm X}$ and $R_{\rm A}$ of the apical anion X and cation A in the block layer. ($|t_1|$ increases when $R_{\rm X}$ or $R_{\rm A}$ decreases.) (b) $u$ has a main-order dependence on the negative ionic charge $Z_{\rm X}$ of X and the hole doping $\delta$ of the AB orbital. ($u$ decreases when $|Z_{\rm X}|$ increases or $\delta$ increases.) We elucidate and discuss the microscopic mechanism of (a,b). We demonstrate the predictive power of the HDE by showing the consistency between (a,b) and results from previous works. The present results provide a basis for optimizing SC properties in cuprates and possibly akin materials. Also, the HDE method offers a general platform to identify dependencies between physical quantities.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of strong t-e orbital hybridization and the effects of f orbitals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has revealed that the Cr family perovskite ReCrO$_3$ exhibits intriguing magnetic coupling interactions within Cr pairs, which may not follow the Goodenough-Kanamori (GK) rules due to the t-e hybridization between Cr$^\mathrm{III}$ ions. We investigate the complex magnetism involving both t-e hybridization and Re-$f$ orbitals in the molecular analogue of perovskite [$\mathrm{Ce_2^{III}Ce^{IV}Cr_8^{III}O_8(O_2CPh)_{18}(HO_2CPh)}$] ($\mathrm{Ce_3Cr_8}$) using first-principles method. Our results have shown that distinct from the bulk ReCrO$_3$, the superexchange via Cr-$d$ and O-$p$ orbitals can exhibit a unexpected dominate ferromagnetic (FM) Cr-O-Cr superexchange interaction in $\mathrm{Ce_3Cr_8}$ due to the strong t-e hybridization originated from the distorted molecular structure. The great sensitivity of the t-e hybridization with respect to the molecular structure, e.g., the angle of Cr-O-Cr, can lead to a ground state transition from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic state with the changes in the angle of Cr-O-Cr. The Ce-$f$ orbitals near the Fermi level can reduce this sensitivity through interacting with the Cr-$d$ orbitals via the virtual charge transfer process. Our results are strongly supported by a modified superexchange model based on the t-e hybridization theory. These findings complete the theory of superexchange magnetism involving the t-e hybridization and $f$ orbitals, and in the meanwhile introduce a new avenue for fine-tuning the magnetic characteristics via Tm-d/Re-f interactions at nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Emergent (2+1)D topological orders from iterative (1+1)D gauging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauging involves introducing new degrees of freedom, known as gauge fields, to localize an existing global symmetry. It is known that, following this process, the gauge fields exhibit a dual global symmetry. Subsequently, one can gauge this emergent global symmetry by creating new gauge fields that once again exhibit a global symmetry. We investigate this iterative process, wherein new degrees of freedom are created and entangled with the previous ones through local symmetries. We focus on gauging spin chains with Abelian group symmetries and arranging the new spins on a 2D lattice. The local symmetries of the emergent 2D state, which are modified by the concatenation of the following gauging maps surprisingly correspond to the stabilizer terms of the $XZZX$-code generalized to any Abelian group. We encode our construction in the family of tensor network states that we dub ``projected entangled pair emergent states'' (PEPES). By utilizing this representation and by considering the local symmetries as stabilizer Hamiltonian terms, we establish a connection between the condensable anyons at the boundary and the quantum phase of the initial symmetric state before the gauging process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the pressure dependence of the electronic and dynamical properties of six different CoGe phases: orthorhombic Cmmm, hexagonal P6/mmm and P$\bar{6}$2m, monoclinic C2/m, cubic P2$_{1}$3, and orthorhombic Pnma. Using first-principles DFT calculations and the direct force-constants method, we study the dynamical stability of individual phases under external pressure. We show that the orthorombic Cmmm and hexagonal P6/mmm structures are unstable over a broad pressure range and most pronounced imaginary phonon soft mode in both cases leads to a stable hexagonal P$\bar{6}$2m structure of the lowest ground-state energy of all studied phases at ambient and low (below $\sim 3$ GPa) external pressure. Under these conditions, the cubic P2$_{1}$3 phase has the highest energy, however, together with monoclinic C2/m and orthorombic Pnma it is dynamically stable and all these three structures can potentially coexist as meta-stable phases. Above $\sim 3$ GPa, the cubic P2$_{1}$3 phase becomes the most energetically favorable. Fitting the Birch--Murnaghan equation of state we derive bulk modulus for all mentioned phases, which indicate relatively high resistance of CoGe to compression. Such conclusions are confirmed by band structure calculations. Additionally, we show that electronic bands of the hexagonal P$\bar{6}$2m phase reveal characteristic features of the kagome-like structure, while in the cubic P2$_{1}$3 phase spectrum, one can locate spin-1 and double Weyl fermions. In both cases, the external pressure induces the Lifshitz transition, related to the modification of the Fermi surface topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in the design and optimization of Neural Network Quantum States (NNQS) have made them an effective method to investigate ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems. In contrast to the standard approach of training a separate NNQS from scratch at every point of the phase diagram, we demonstrate that the optimization at a highly expressive point of the phase diagram (i.e., close to a phase transition) yields interpretable features that can be reused to accurately describe a wide region across the transition. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on different systems in one and two dimensions by initially pretraining a NNQS at a given point of the phase diagram, followed by fine-tuning only the output layer for all other points. Notably, the computational cost of the fine-tuning step is very low compared to the pretraining stage. We argue that the reduced cost of this paradigm has significant potential to advance the exploration of condensed matter systems using NNQS, mirroring the success of fine-tuning in machine learning and natural language processing.</description>

Abstract: Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) is a powerful technique for measuring the full elastic tensor of a given material in a single experiment. Previously, this technique was limited to regularly-shaped samples such as rectangular parallelepipeds, spheres, and cylinders. We demonstrate a new method for determining the elastic moduli of irregularly-shaped samples, extending the applicability of RUS to a much larger set of materials. We apply this new approach to the recently-discovered unconventional superconductor UTe$_2$ and provide its elastic tensor at both 300 and 4 kelvin.</description>

Abstract: We present numerical simulation of the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) of the $L_{2,3}$ and $M_{2,3}$ edges of Ru in antiferromagnetic RuO$_2$ using a combination of density functional + dynamical mean-field theory and configuration interaction treatment of Anderson impurity model. We study the dependence of the dichroic spectra on the orientation of the N\'eel vector and discuss it in the context of altermagnetism. Approximate equivalence between the XMCD spectra for geometries with X-rays propagating parallel and perpendicular to the N\'eel vector is found and shown to be exact in absence of valence spin-orbit coupling and core-valence multipolar interaction.</description>

Abstract: Transition-metal atoms with d electrons sometimes form clusters in crystals, which significantly affects the physical properties. Such a cluster formation frequently accompanies a change in the crystal system, leading to the presence of domains with different crystal orientations. In particular, the cubic symmetry is rarely retained after the cluster formation. Here, we identify a cubic-to-cubic phase transition in lacunar spinel GaNb$_4$Se$_8$, where the change in the lattice parameter is less than 0.0001%. Each Nb$^{3.25+}$ tetramer with seven 4d electrons is distorted into a Nb$^{3+}$ trimer and a Nb$^{4+}$ monomer induced by charge disproportionation among Nb ions. While the Nb$^{3+}$ trimer with six 4d electrons forms spin-singlets in the sigma-bonding orbitals for three Nb-Nb bonds, a localized S=1/2 spin remains on the Nb$^{4+}$ ion. Furthermore, a local electric dipole moment is induced along the three-fold rotation axis of each distorted tetramer by the cluster rearrangement. The electric dipole moments are regularly arranged to maintain the cubic symmetry, giving rise to chiral order.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of mixed-state topological order and breakdown of quantum memory</title>

Abstract: Topological quantum memory can protect information against local errors up to finite error thresholds. Such thresholds are usually determined based on the success of decoding algorithms rather than the intrinsic properties of the mixed states describing corrupted memories. Here we provide an intrinsic characterization of the breakdown of topological quantum memory, which both gives a bound on the performance of decoding algorithms and provides examples of topologically distinct mixed states. We employ three information-theoretical quantities that can be regarded as generalizations of the diagnostics of ground-state topological order, and serve as a definition for topological order in error-corrupted mixed states. We consider the topological contribution to entanglement negativity and two other metrics based on quantum relative entropy and coherent information. In the concrete example of the 2D Toric code with local bit-flip and phase errors, we map three quantities to observables in 2D classical spin models and analytically show they all undergo a transition at the same error threshold. This threshold is an upper bound on that achieved in any decoding algorithm and is indeed saturated by that in the optimal decoding algorithm for the Toric code.</description>
