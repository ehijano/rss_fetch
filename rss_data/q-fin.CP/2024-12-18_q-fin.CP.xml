      <title>Volatility-Volume Order Slicing via Statistical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges faced in large-volume trading, where executing substantial orders can result in significant market impact and slippage. To mitigate these effects, this study proposes a volatility-volume-based order slicing strategy that leverages Exponential Weighted Moving Average and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. These methods are used to dynamically estimate future trading volumes and price ranges, enabling traders to adapt their strategies by segmenting order execution sizes based on these predictions. Results show that the proposed approach improves trade execution efficiency, reduces market impact, and offers a more adaptive solution for volatile market conditions. The findings have practical implications for large-volume trading, providing a foundation for further research into adaptive execution strategies.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Momentum with Momentum Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary objective of this research is to build a Momentum Transformer that is expected to outperform benchmark time-series momentum and mean-reversion trading strategies. We extend the ideas introduced in the paper Trading with the Momentum Transformer: An Intelligent and Interpretable Architecture to equities as the original paper primarily only builds upon futures and equity indices. Unlike conventional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, which operate sequentially and are optimized for processing local patterns, an attention mechanism equips our architecture with direct access to all prior time steps in the training window. This hybrid design, combining attention with an LSTM, enables the model to capture long-term dependencies, enhance performance in scenarios accounting for transaction costs, and seamlessly adapt to evolving market conditions, such as those witnessed during the Covid Pandemic. We average 4.14% returns which is similar to the original papers results. Our Sharpe is lower at an average of 1.12 due to much higher volatility which may be due to stocks being inherently more volatile than futures and indices.</description>

      <title>A Consolidated Volatility Prediction with Back Propagation Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a unique approach with AI algorithms to predict emerging stock markets volatility. Traditionally, stock volatility is derived from historical volatility,Monte Carlo simulation and implied volatility as well. In this paper, the writer designs a consolidated model with back-propagation neural network and genetic algorithm to predict future volatility of emerging stock markets and found that the results are quite accurate with low errors.</description>
