      <title>Blockchain Metrics and Indicators in Cryptocurrency Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is the construction of new indicators that can be useful to operate in the cryptocurrency market. These indicators are based on public data obtained from the blockchain network, specifically from the nodes that make up Bitcoin mining. Therefore, our analysis is unique to that network. The results obtained with numerical simulations of algorithmic trading and prediction via statistical models and Machine Learning demonstrate the importance of variables such as the hash rate, the difficulty of mining or the cost per transaction when it comes to trade Bitcoin assets or predict the direction of price. Variables obtained from the blockchain network will be called here blockchain metrics. The corresponding indicators (inspired by the "Hash Ribbon") perform well in locating buy signals. From our results, we conclude that such blockchain indicators allow obtaining information with a statistical advantage in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.</description>

      <title>Do Weibo platform experts perform better at predicting stock market?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sentiment analysis can be used for stock market prediction. However, existing research has not studied the impact of a user's financial background on sentiment-based forecasting of the stock market using artificial neural networks. In this work, a novel combination of neural networks is used for the assessment of sentiment-based stock market prediction, based on the financial background of the population that generated the sentiment. The state-of-the-art language processing model Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is used to classify the sentiment and a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is used for time-series based stock market prediction. For evaluation, the Weibo social networking platform is used as a sentiment data collection source. Weibo users (and their comments respectively) are divided into Authorized Financial Advisor (AFA) and Unauthorized Financial Advisor (UFA) groups according to their background information, as collected by Weibo. The Hong Kong Hang Seng index is used to extract historical stock market change data. The results indicate that stock market prediction learned from the AFA group users is 39.67% more precise than that learned from the UFA group users and shows the highest accuracy (87%) when compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Regional inflation analysis using social network data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflation is one of the most important macroeconomic indicators that have a great impact on the population of any country and region. Inflation is influenced by range of factors, one of which is inflation expectations. Many central banks take this factor into consideration while implementing monetary policy within the inflation targeting regime. Nowadays, a lot of people are active users of the Internet, especially social networks. There is a hypothesis that people search, read, and discuss mainly only those issues that are of particular interest to them. It is logical to assume that the dynamics of prices may also be in the focus of user discussions. So, such discussions could be regarded as an alternative source of more rapid information about inflation expectations. This study is based on unstructured data from Vkontakte social network to analyze upward and downward inflationary trends (on the example of the Omsk region). The sample of more than 8.5 million posts was collected between January 2010 and May 2022. The authors used BERT neural networks to solve the problem. These models demonstrated better results than the benchmarks (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree classifier, etc.). It makes possible to define pro-inflationary and disinflationary types of keywords in different contexts and get their visualization with SHAP method. This analysis provides additional operational information about inflationary processes at the regional level The proposed approach can be scaled for other regions. At the same time the limitation of the work is the time and power costs for the initial training of similar models for all regions of Russia.</description>

      <title>Detecting Anomalous Events in Object-centric Business Processes via Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies is important for identifying inefficiencies, errors, or fraud in business processes. Traditional process mining approaches focus on analyzing 'flattened', sequential, event logs based on a single case notion. However, many real-world process executions exhibit a graph-like structure, where events can be associated with multiple cases. Flattening event logs requires selecting a single case identifier which creates a gap with the real event data and artificially introduces anomalies in the event logs. Object-centric process mining avoids these limitations by allowing events to be related to different cases. This study proposes a novel framework for anomaly detection in business processes that exploits graph neural networks and the enhanced information offered by object-centric process mining. We first reconstruct and represent the process dependencies of the object-centric event logs as attributed graphs and then employ a graph convolutional autoencoder architecture to detect anomalous events. Our results show that our approach provides promising performance in detecting anomalies at the activity type and attributes level, although it struggles to detect anomalies in the temporal order of events.</description>

      <title>Combating Financial Crimes with Unsupervised Learning Techniques: Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction for Anti-Money Laundering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anti-Money Laundering (AML) is a crucial task in ensuring the integrity of financial systems. One keychallenge in AML is identifying high-risk groups based on their behavior. Unsupervised learning, particularly clustering, is a promising solution for this task. However, the use of hundreds of features todescribe behavior results in a highdimensional dataset that negatively impacts clustering performance.In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of combining clustering method agglomerative hierarchicalclustering with four dimensionality reduction techniques -Independent Component Analysis (ICA), andKernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Locality Preserving Projections (LPP)- to overcome the issue of high-dimensionality in AML data and improve clusteringresults. This study aims to provide insights into the most effective way of reducing the dimensionality ofAML data and enhance the accuracy of clustering-based AML systems. The experimental results demonstrate that KPCA outperforms other dimension reduction techniques when combined with agglomerativehierarchical clustering. This superiority is observed in the majority of situations, as confirmed by threedistinct validation indices.</description>

      <title>Ploutos: Towards interpretable stock movement prediction with financial large language model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened new pathways for many domains. However, the full potential of LLMs in financial investments remains largely untapped. There are two main challenges for typical deep learning-based methods for quantitative finance. First, they struggle to fuse textual and numerical information flexibly for stock movement prediction. Second, traditional methods lack clarity and interpretability, which impedes their application in scenarios where the justification for predictions is essential. To solve the above challenges, we propose Ploutos, a novel financial LLM framework that consists of PloutosGen and PloutosGPT. The PloutosGen contains multiple primary experts that can analyze different modal data, such as text and numbers, and provide quantitative strategies from different perspectives. Then PloutosGPT combines their insights and predictions and generates interpretable rationales. To generate accurate and faithful rationales, the training strategy of PloutosGPT leverage rearview-mirror prompting mechanism to guide GPT-4 to generate rationales, and a dynamic token weighting mechanism to finetune LLM by increasing key tokens weight. Extensive experiments show our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both prediction accuracy and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Applying News and Media Sentiment Analysis for Generating Forex Trading Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this research is to examine how sentiment analysis can be employed to generate trading signals for the Foreign Exchange (Forex) market. The author assessed sentiment in social media posts and news articles pertaining to the United States Dollar (USD) using a combination of methods: lexicon-based analysis and the Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm. The findings indicate that sentiment analysis proves valuable in forecasting market movements and devising trading signals. Notably, its effectiveness is consistent across different market conditions. The author concludes that by analyzing sentiment expressed in news and social media, traders can glean insights into prevailing market sentiments towards the USD and other pertinent countries, thereby aiding trading decision-making. This study underscores the importance of weaving sentiment analysis into trading strategies as a pivotal tool for predicting market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Mean-Reverting Time Series Prediction with Gaussian Processes: Functional and Augmented Data Structures in Financial Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of Gaussian Processes (GPs) for predicting mean-reverting time series with an underlying structure, using relatively unexplored functional and augmented data structures. While many conventional forecasting methods concentrate on the short-term dynamics of time series data, GPs offer the potential to forecast not just the average prediction but the entire probability distribution over a future trajectory. This is particularly beneficial in financial contexts, where accurate predictions alone may not suffice if incorrect volatility assessments lead to capital losses. Moreover, in trade selection, GPs allow for the forecasting of multiple Sharpe ratios adjusted for transaction costs, aiding in decision-making. The functional data representation utilized in this study enables longer-term predictions by leveraging information from previous years, even as the forecast moves away from the current year's training data. Additionally, the augmented representation enriches the training set by incorporating multiple targets for future points in time, facilitating long-term predictions. Our implementation closely aligns with the methodology outlined in, which assessed effectiveness on commodity futures. However, our testing methodology differs. Instead of real data, we employ simulated data with similar characteristics. We construct a testing environment to evaluate both data representations and models under conditions of increasing noise, fat tails, and inappropriate kernels-conditions commonly encountered in practice. By simulating data, we can compare our forecast distribution over time against a full simulation of the actual distribution of our test set, thereby reducing the inherent uncertainty in testing time series models on real data. We enable feature prediction through augmentation and employ sub-sampling to ensure the feasibility of GPs.</description>

      <title>Jump detection in high-frequency order prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose methods to infer jumps of a semi-martingale, which describes long-term price dynamics based on discrete, noisy, high-frequency observations. Different to the classical model of additive, centered market microstructure noise, we consider one-sided microstructure noise for order prices in a limit order book. We develop methods to estimate, locate and test for jumps using local order statistics. We provide a local test and show that we can consistently estimate price jumps. The main contribution is a global test for jumps. We establish the asymptotic properties and optimality of this test. We derive the asymptotic distribution of a maximum statistic under the null hypothesis of no jumps based on extreme value theory. We prove consistency under the alternative hypothesis. The rate of convergence for local alternatives is determined and shown to be much faster than optimal rates for the standard market microstructure noise model. This allows the identification of smaller jumps. In the process, we establish uniform consistency for spot volatility estimation under one-sided microstructure noise. A simulation study sheds light on the finite-sample implementation and properties of our new statistics and draws a comparison to a popular method for market microstructure noise. We showcase how our new approach helps to improve jump detection in an empirical analysis of intra-daily limit order book data.</description>

      <title>"Digitwashing": The Gap between Words and Deeds in Digital Transformation and Stock Price Crash Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contrast between companies' "fleshy" promises and the "skeletal" performance in digital transformation may lead to a higher risk of stock price crash. This paper selects a sample of Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2021, empirically analyses the specific impact of the gap between words and deeds in digital transformation (GDT) on the stock price crash risk, and explores the possible causes of GDT. We found that GDT significantly increases the stock price crash risk, and this finding is still valid after a series of robustness tests. In a further study, a deeper examination of the causes of GDT reveals that firms' perceptions of economic policy uncertainty significantly increase GDT, and the effect is more pronounced in the sample of loss-making firms. At the same time, the results of the heterogeneity test suggest that investors are more tolerant of state-owned enterprises when they are in the GDT situation. Taken together, we provide a concrete bridge between the two measures of digital transformation - digital text frequency and digital technology share - and offer new insights to enhance capital market stability.</description>

      <title>Social and individual learning in the Minority Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the roles of social and individual learning on outcomes of the Minority Game model of a financial market. Social learning occurs via agents adopting the strategies of their neighbours within a social network, while individual learning results in agents changing their strategies without input from other agents. In particular, we show how social learning can undermine efficiency of the market due to negative frequency dependent selection and loss of strategy diversity. The latter of which can lock the population into a maximally inefficient state. We show how individual learning can rescue a population engaged in social learning from such inefficiencies.</description>
