      <title>The Chemistry and Physics of $^{199}$Hg Nuclear Spin Polarization Relaxation in Quantum Magnetometry Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin magnetometry using optically pumped $^{199}$Hg has been successfully used in many fundamental physics experiments. A serious problem that has not been resolved is the instability of the $^{199}$Hg spin relaxation rate in atomic vapor cells under irradiation with 254 nm Hg resonance light. In this paper, previously obtained data are re-analyzed or analyzed for the first time. The effects of impurities of H$_2$ and O$_2$ are elucidated, and possible ways to stabilize cells are discussed. Surface states originating from the an der Waals interaction of \hg with fused silica are analyzed and shown to be critical to understanding relaxation mechanisms. A discussion of the possible use of a mixture of N$_2$O and other gases is presented.</description>

      <title>Event shape dependence of symmetry plane correlations using the Gaussian estimator in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC using AMPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of symmetry plane correlations (SPCs) can be useful in characterizing the direction of the anisotropic emission of produced particles in the final state. The study of SPCs provides an independent method to understand the transport properties of the system formed in heavy-ion collisions. Similar to anisotropic flow coefficients, which are largely influenced by the initial spatial anisotropy, SPCs also depend upon the participant plane correlation measured using the participating nucleons of the collision overlap region. In this paper, SPCs have been studied in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV using the event generator AMPT. In addition to their behaviour with the changing centrality of the collision, their event shape dependence has also been studied for the first time, using the event shape classifier transverse spherocity. The Gaussian estimator has been used to evaluate the correlations, and these have been compared to the participant plane correlations defined in an analogous way to the symmetry plane correlations and a qualitative match has been found between them. These event-shape differentiated symmetry plane correlations can be used to deduce the presence of higher-order anisotropies in the initial energy distribution, thus giving insight into the initial geometry of the colliding system, among other applications like model development and model testing using Bayesian analyses.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the helicity-dependent response in quasi-elastic proton knockout from $^{40}{\rm Ca}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of the electron-helicity-dependent cross-section term and the structure function $f^{\prime}_{01}$ in the quasi-elastic $A(\vec{e}, e^{\prime}p)$ process was studied. The $f^{\prime}_{01}$ was measured for proton knockout from the $1\mathrm{d}_{3/2}$ shell in $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}$ via the $^{40}{\rm Ca}(\vec{e},e' p)^{39}{\rm K}_{\rm g.s.}$ reaction, leaving the residual nucleus in a well-defined state. It requires a longitudinally polarized electron beam and out-of-plane proton detection. This structure function vanishes in the absence of final-state interactions (FSI) involving the ejected proton. Presented are the dependencies of $f^{\prime}_{01}$ on the missing momentum (closely related to the initial proton's Fermi momentum) and the angle between the knocked-out proton and the virtual photon momenta. The role of the spin-orbit interaction in FSI through the $\vec{L}\cdot \vec{S}$ term in a nuclear optical potential is discussed.</description>

      <title>The PUMA offline ion source beamline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The antiProton Unstable Matter Annihilation experiment (PUMA) at CERN aims to study the nucleonic composition in the matter density tail of stable and radioactive nuclei using low-energy antiprotons. Since there is no facility in which both low-energy antiprotons and radioactive nuclei can be produced, the experimental realization with exotic nuclei requires the transportation of the antiprotons from the Extra Low ENergy Antiproton (ELENA) facility to the nearby located Isotope mass Separator On-Line DEvice (ISOLDE). For tests and first applications of the proposed experimental technique to stable isotopes at ELENA, a dedicated offline ion source beamline was developed that will provide isotopically pure, cooled and bunched ion beams with intensities of more than $10^4$ ions per bunch while maintaining a vacuum of better than $5\times 10^{-10}$ mbar at the handover point. This offline ion source beamline is characterized and its capabilities are demonstrated using the example of stable krypton isotopes.</description>

      <title>From spin to pseudospin symmetry: The origin of magic numbers in nuclear structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic numbers lie at the heart of nuclear structure, reflecting enhanced stability in nuclei with closed shells. While the emergence of magic numbers beyond 20 is commonly attributed to strong spin-orbit coupling, the microscopic origin of the spin-orbit potential remains elusive, owing to its dependence on the resolution scale and renormalization scheme of nuclear forces. Here, we investigate the evolution of shell structure with varying momentum resolution in nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory, using the similarity renormalization group, which provides a fundamental framework for linking different scales. We uncover a universal transition from spin symmetry to pseudospin symmetry as the resolution scale decreases, during which magic numbers emerge naturally. A similar pattern is found in calculations using relativistic one-boson-exchange potentials, underscoring the robustness of the phenomenon. This work establishes a direct connection between realistic nuclear forces with a high resolution scale and effective nuclear forces at coarse-grained scales, offering a first-principles explanation for the origin of magic numbers and pseudospin symmetry in nuclear shell structure, and new insights into the structure of exotic nuclei far from stability.</description>

      <title>Extracting Meson Distribution Amplitudes from Nonlocal Euclidean Correlations at Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first complete result for the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) hard matching kernel indispensable for a precision extraction of light meson distribution amplitudes from lattice calculations of equal-time nonlocal Euclidean correlation functions. The results are given in both coordinate and momentum space, with the renormalization and matching accomplished in a state-of-the-art scheme. Our results can be used in both large-momentum effective theory and short-distance factorization approaches. Notably, our coordinate space kernel is directly applicable to nonsinglet quark unpolarized and helicity generalized parton distributions as well. We also illustrate the numerical impact of the NNLO matching, using the pion distribution amplitude as an example.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent random phase approximation for particle-number fluctuations and correlations in deep-inelastic collisions of $^{144}$Sm+$^{144}$Sm and $^{154}$Sm+$^{154}$Sm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fluctuation-dissipation mechanism underlying non-equilibrium transport in low-energy heavy-ion reactions remains unclear. Although the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) method provides a reasonable description of average reaction outcomes and one-body dissipation, it is known to significantly underestimate fluctuations of observables. The purpose of this work is to investigate deep-inelastic collisions of 144Sm+144Sm and 154Sm+154Sm with microscopic mean-field approaches and to show a predominant role of one-body dissipation as well as one-body fluctuations and correlation in low-energy heavy-ion reactions. Three dimensional TDHF calculations are carried out for 144Sm+144Sm at Ecm=500 MeV and 154Sm+154Sm at Ecm=485 MeV for a range of impact parameters with Skyrme SLy5 energy density functional. Backward time evolutions are performed as well to evaluate fluctuations and correlation in nucleon numbers within time-dependent random phase approximation (TDRPA). With TDRPA we calculate mass- and charge-number fluctuations, as well as the correlation between neutron and proton transfers, for each impact parameter. We demonstrate that TDRPA quantitatively reproduces the experimental \sigma_{AA}^2-TKEL distributions, whereas it systematically underestimates the charge fluctuation, \sigma_{ZZ}. The double-differential cross sections of reaction products are calculated, showing good agreement with the experimental data. We confirm a long-thought characteristic property that the closed-shell structure limits nucleon transfer at small energy losses, based on our microscopic TDHF and TDRPA calculations.</description>

      <title>Prompt and non-prompt production of charm hadrons in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we use machine learning (ML) based models to separate the prompt and non-prompt production of heavy flavour hadrons, such as $D^0$ and J/$\psi$, in proton-proton collisions at LHC energies. For this purpose, we use PYTHIA~8 to generate events, which provides a good qualitative agreement with experimental measurements of charm hadron production. The input features for the ML models are experimentally measurable. The prediction accuracy of the ML models used in this study reaches up to 99\%. The ML models can be useful in providing precise track-level identification, which is not possible in experiments with traditional methods. The contribution also discusses future applications of the ML models to understand the production of prompt and non-prompt heavy quark hadrons.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Baryon Stopping at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nucleon exhibits a rich internal structure governed by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), where its electric charge arises from valence quarks, while its spin and mass emerge from complex interactions among valence quarks, sea (anti-)quarks, and gluons. At the advent of QCD, an alternative hypothesis emerged suggesting, at high energies, the transport of a nucleon's baryon number could be traced by a non-perturbative configuration of gluon fields connecting its three valence quarks, forming a $Y$-shaped topology known as the gluon junction. Recent measurements by the STAR experiment are compatible with this scenario. In light of these measurements, this study aims to explore the mechanisms of baryon transport in high-energy nuclear collisions using the PYTHIA-8 framework, which incorporates a state-of-the-art hadronization model with advanced Color Flow (CF) and Color Reconnection (CR) mechanisms which mimic signatures of a baryon junction. Within this model setup, we investigate (i) the rapidity slope of the net-baryon distributions in photon-included processes ($\gamma$+p) and (ii) baryon over charge transport in the isobaric (Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr) collisions. Our study highlights the importance of the CF and CR mechanisms in PYTHIA-8, which plays a crucial role in baryon transport. The results show that the CF and CR schemes significantly affect the isobaric baryon-to-charge ratio, leading to different predictions for baryon stopping and underscoring the need to account for CF and CR effects in comparisons with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the deuteron mass radius via near-threshold $\rho^0$, $\omega$ and $\phi$ meson photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the near-threshold photoproduction of the $\rho^0$, $\omega$, and $\phi$ mesons on a deuterium target, leveraging published datasets from the DESY and SLAC facilities. In our extraction of the deuteron mass radius, we employ a dipole-form scalar gravitational form factor to effectively model the $|t|$-dependence of the differential cross sections associated with vector meson photoproductions. Utilizing the vector-meson dominance model alongside a low-energy Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) theorem assumption, we derive the deuteron mass radius from the near-threshold photoproduction data of the $\rho^0$, $\omega$, and $\phi$ mesons. The mass radii obtained from various datasets demonstrate consistency within the statistical uncertainties, yielding an average value of $2.07 \pm 0.15$ fm. This precision surpasses previous estimates solely based on the $\phi$ meson photoproduction data. Our findings provide novel constraints for theoretical nuclear structure models and significantly enhance our understanding of the mass distribution within the deuteron.</description>

Abstract: The HYpernuclei-Decay at R3B Apparatus (HYDRA) tracker is a novel time projection chamber combined with a plastic scintillator wall for timing and trigger purposes. This detector is a low radiation length tracker dedicated to measuring pions from the weak decay of light hypernuclei produced from ion-ion collisions at few GeV/nucleon in the magnetic field of the large-acceptance dipole magnet GLAD at the Reactions with Relativistic Radioactive Beams (R3B) experiment at GSI-FAIR.

      <description>arXiv:2504.10366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a didactic proposal on Rutherford's gold foil experiment, tailored for high schools. Grounded in constructivist pedagogy, the activity introduces key concepts of modern physics-often absent from standard curricula-through a hands on, inquiry-based approach. By employing analogical reasoning and black box modeling, students engage in experimental investigation and collaborative problem-solving to explore atomic structure. The activity was implemented as a case study with a class of first-year students (aged 14-15) from a applied science-focused secondary school in Italy. Data collection combined qualitative observations, structured discussions, and digital feedback tools to assess conceptual learning and student engagement. Findings indicate that well-designed, student-centered interventions can meaningfully support the development of abstract scientific understanding, while fostering critical thinking and collaborative skills.</description>

Abstract: We have extracted the nuclear level density of ${}^{128}$Te from a $(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{p} '\gamma)$ scattering experiment using the large-volume \labr\ and \cebr\ detectors from ELI-NP at the 9~MV Tandem facilities at IFIN-HH. The decay data were normalised using photonuclear data, resulting in nuclear level densities without intrinsic model dependencies from the constant temperature or Fermi gas models. The deduced nuclear level density follows in between the expectations from these two models, but we observe a clear divergence from a microscopic model based on the Skyrme force.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Fragmentation at the Future Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of conducting low-energy nuclear physics studies, including nuclear structure and decay, at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven. By comparing the standard theory of electron-nucleus scattering with the equivalent photon method applied to Ultraperipheral Collisions (UPC) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. In the limit of extremely high beam energies and small energy transfers, very transparent equations emerge. We apply these equations to analyze nuclear fragmentation in UPCs at the LHC and $eA$ scattering at the EIC, demonstrating that the EIC could facilitate unique photonuclear physics studies. However, we have also shown that the fragmentation cross-sections at the EIC are about 1,000 times smaller than those at the LHC. At the LHC, the fragmentation of uranium nuclei displays characteristic double-hump mass distributions from fission events, while at the EIC, fragmentation is dominated by neutron emission and fewer few fission products, about 10,000 smaller number of events.</description>

      <title>Ultra-cold neutron simulation framework for the free neutron lifetime experiment $\tau$SPECT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise determination of the free neutron lifetime is of great significance in modern precision physics. This key observable is linked to the mixing of up and down quarks via the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $V_{ud}$, and the abundance of primordial elements after the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis. However, the two leading measurement techniques for the neutron lifetime currently yield incompatible results, a discrepancy referred to as the neutron lifetime puzzle. To address the systematic uncertainties arising from neutron interactions with material walls, the $\tau$SPECT experiment employs a fully magnetic trap for ultra-cold neutrons (UCNs).
  UCNs are extremely low-energy neutrons with typical velocities below $8\,\textrm{m/s}$, which can be manipulated using magnetic fields, gravity, and suitable material guides, whose surface can reflect them at any angle of incidence. To precisely study and characterize UCN behavior during production, guidance, storage, and detection in $\tau$SPECT, we have developed a dedicated simulation framework. This framework is built upon the externally developed UCN Monte Carlo software package PENTrack and is enhanced with two companion tools: one for flexible and parametrizable upstream configuration of PENTrack such that the simulation's input settings can be adjusted to reproduce the experimental observations. The second package is used for analyzing, visualizing, and animating simulation data.
  The simulation results align well with experimental data obtained with $\tau$SPECT at the Paul Scherrer Institute and serve as a powerful resource for identifying systematic uncertainties and guiding future improvements to the current experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Response to Electrons and Pions in the Scintillating Fiber and Lead Calorimeter for the Future Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of the Baby Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (Baby BCAL) - a small-scale lead-scintillating-fiber (Pb/ScFi) prototype of the GlueX Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BCAL) - was tested in a dedicated beam campaign at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility (FTBF). This study provides a benchmark for the Pb/ScFi component of the future Barrel Imaging Calorimeter (BIC) in the ePIC detector at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The detector response to electrons and pions was studied at beam energies between 4 and 10 GeV, extending previous GlueX tests [NIM A 596 (2008) 327-337 and arXiv:1801.03088] to a higher energy regime.
  The calibrated detector exhibits good linearity within uncertainties, and its electron energy resolution meets EIC requirements. The data further constrain the constant term in the energy resolution to below 1.9%, improving upon previous constraints at lower energies. Simulations reproduce key features of the electron and pion data within the limitations of the collected dataset and the FTBF test environment. Electron-pion separation in the test beam setup was analyzed using multiple methods, incorporating varying degrees of beam-related effects. The inclusion of longitudinal shower profile information enhanced the separation performance, underscoring its relevance for the full-scale BIC in ePIC. These results provide essential benchmarks for the Pb/ScFi section of the future BIC, validating detector simulations and guiding optimization strategies for electron-pion discrimination.</description>

      <title>European Strategy for Particle Physics Update -- PIONEER: a next generation rare pion decay experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PIONEER is a rapidly developing effort aimed to perform a pristine test of lepton flavour universality (LFU) and of the unitarity of the first row of the CKM matrix by significantly improving the measurements of rare decays of the charged pion. In Phase I, PIONEER aims to measure the charged-pion branching ratio to electrons vs.\ muons $R_{e/\mu}$ to 1 part in $10^4$, improving the current experimental result $R_{e/\mu}\,\text{(exp)} =1.2327(23)\times10^{-4}$ by a factor of 15. This precision on $R_{e/\mu}$ will match the theoretical accuracy of the SM prediction allowing for a test of LFU at an unprecedented level, probing non-SM explanations of LFU violation through sensitivity to quantum effects of new particles up to the PeV mass scale. Phase II and III will aim to improve the experimental precision of the branching ratio of pion beta decay, $\pi^+\to \pi^0 e^+ \nu (\gamma)$, currently at $1.036(6)\times10^{-8}$, by a factor of three and six, respectively. The improved measurements will be used to extract $V_{ud}$ in a theoretically pristine manner. The ultimate precision of $V_{ud}$ is expected to reach the 0.05\,\% level, allowing for a stringent test of CKM unitarity. The PIONEER experiment will also improve the experimental limits by an order of magnitude or more on a host of exotic decays that probe the effects of heavy neutrinos and dark sector physics. This input to the 2026 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics Strategy describes the physics motivation and the conceptual design of the PIONEER experiment, and is prepared based on the PIONEER proposal submitted to and approved with high priority by the PSI program advisory committee (PAC). Using intense pion beams, and state-of-the-art instrumentation and computational resources, the PIONEER experiment is aiming to begin data taking by the end of this decade.</description>

      <title>Double shape quantum phase transitions in the SU3-IBM: new $\gamma$-soft phase and the shape phase transition from the new $\gamma$-soft phase to the prolate shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shape quantum phase transition is an important topic in nuclear structure. In this paper, we begin to study the shape quantum phase transition in the SU3-IBM. In this new proposed model, spherical-like spectra was found to resolve the spherical nucleus puzzle, which is a new $\gamma$-soft rotational mode. In this paper, the shape phase transition along the new $\gamma$-soft line is first discussed, and then the neighbouring case at the prolate side is also studied. We find that double shape phase transitions occur along a single parameter path. The new $\gamma$-softness is really a shape phase and the shape phase transition from the new $\gamma$-soft phase to the prolate shape is found. The experimental support is also found and $^{108}$Pd may be the critical nucleus.</description>
