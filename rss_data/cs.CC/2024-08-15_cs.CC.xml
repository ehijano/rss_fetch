      <title>Oracle without Optimal Proof Systems outside Nondeterministic Subexponential Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of optimal proof systems for sets outside of $\mathrm{NP}$. Currently, no set $L \notin \mathrm{NP}$ is known that has optimal proof systems. Our main result shows that this is not surprising, because we can rule out relativizable proofs of optimality for all sets outside $\mathrm{NTIME}(t)$ where $t$ is slightly superpolynomial. We construct an oracle $O$, such that for any set $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ at least one of the following two properties holds: $L$ does not have optimal proof systems relative to $O$. $L \in \mathrm{UTIME}^O(2^{2(\log n)^{8+4\log(\log(\log(n)))}})$. The runtime bound is slightly superpolynomial. So there is no relativizable proof showing that a complex set has optimal proof systems. Hence, searching for non-trivial optimal proof systems with relativizable methods can only be successful (if at all) in a narrow range above $\mathrm{NP}$.</description>

      <title>Exact values of generic subrank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we prove the subrank of a generic tensor in $\mathbb{C}^{n,n,n}$ to be $Q(n) = \lfloor\sqrt{3n - 2}\rfloor$ by providing a lower bound to the known upper bound. More generally, we find the generic subrank of tensors of all orders and dimensions. This answers two open questions posed in arXiv:2205.15168v2. Finally, we compute dimensions of varieties of tensors of subrank at least $r$.</description>

      <title>Quantifying over Optimum Answer Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Answer Set Programming with Quantifiers (ASP(Q)) has been introduced to provide a natural extension of ASP modeling to problems in the polynomial hierarchy (PH). However, ASP(Q) lacks a method for encoding in an elegant and compact way problems requiring a polynomial number of calls to an oracle in $\Sigma_n^p$ (that is, problems in $\Delta_{n+1}^p$). Such problems include, in particular, optimization problems. In this paper we propose an extension of ASP(Q), in which component programs may contain weak constraints. Weak constraints can be used both for expressing local optimization within quantified component programs and for modeling global optimization criteria. We showcase the modeling capabilities of the new formalism through various application scenarios. Further, we study its computational properties obtaining complexity results and unveiling non-obvious characteristics of ASP(Q) programs with weak constraints.</description>

      <title>The complexity of strong conflict-free vertex-connection $k$-colorability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a new variant of graph coloring by adding a connectivity constraint. A path in a vertex-colored graph is called conflict-free if there is a color that appears exactly once on its vertices. A connected graph $G$ is said to be strongly conflict-free vertex-connection $k$-colorable if $G$ admits a vertex $k$-coloring such that any two distinct vertices of $G$ are connected by a conflict-free $shortest$ path.
  Among others, we show that deciding whether a given graph is strongly conflict-free vertex-connection $3$-colorable is NP-complete even when restricted to $3$-colorable graphs with diameter $3$, radius $2$ and domination number $3$, and, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), cannot be solved in $2^{o(n)}$ time on such restricted input graphs with $n$ vertices. This hardness result is quite strong when compared to the ordinary $3$-COLORING problem: it is known that $3$-COLORING is solvable in polynomial time in graphs with bounded domination number, and assuming ETH, cannot be solved in $2^{o(\sqrt{n})}$ time in $n$-vertex graphs with diameter $3$ and radius $2$. On the positive side, we point out that a strong conflict-free vertex-connection coloring with minimum color number of a given split graph or a co-bipartite graph can be computed in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantages in (n,d)-&gt;1 Random Access Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:1510.03045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A random access code (RAC), corresponding to a communication primitive with various applications in quantum information theory, is an instance of a preparation-and-measurement scenario. In this work, we consider (n,d)-RACs constituting an "n"-length string, constructed from a "d" size set of letters, and send an encoding of the string in a single d-level physical system and present their quantum advantages. We first characterize optimal classical RACs, proving that the well-known classical strategy known as majority-encoding-identity-decoding is indeed optimal. We then construct a quantum protocol by exploiting only two incompatible measurements, the minimal requirement, and show the advantages beyond the classical one. We also discuss the generality of our results and whether quantum advantages are valid for all types of (n, d)-&gt;1 RACs.</description>

      <title>Generic Reed-Solomon Codes Achieve List-decoding Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Brakensiek, Gopi and Makam introduced higher order MDS codes as a generalization of MDS codes. An order-$\ell$ MDS code, denoted by $\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$, has the property that any $\ell$ subspaces formed from columns of its generator matrix intersect as minimally as possible. An independent work by Roth defined a different notion of higher order MDS codes as those achieving a generalized singleton bound for list-decoding. In this work, we show that these two notions of higher order MDS codes are (nearly) equivalent.
  We also show that generic Reed-Solomon codes are $\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$ for all $\ell$, relying crucially on the GM-MDS theorem which shows that generator matrices of generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve any possible zero pattern. As a corollary, this implies that generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve list decoding capacity. More concretely, we show that, with high probability, a random Reed-Solomon code of rate $R$ over an exponentially large field is list decodable from radius $1-R-\epsilon$ with list size at most $\frac{1-R-\epsilon}{\epsilon}$, resolving a conjecture of Shangguan and Tamo.</description>

      <title>An algebraic proof of the dichotomy for graph orientation problems with forbidden tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a set F of finite tournaments, the F-free orientation problem is the problem of orienting a given finite undirected graph in such a way that the resulting oriented graph does not contain any member of F. Using the theory of smooth approximations, we give a new shorter proof of the complexity dichotomy for such problems obtained recently by Bodirsky and Guzm\'{a}n-Pro. In fact, our approach yields a complexity dichotomy for a considerably larger class of computational problems where one is given an undirected graph along with additional local constraints on the allowed orientations. Moreover, the border between tractable and hard problems is described by a decidable algebraic condition.</description>
