      <title>Weak Gravitational Lensing in Ricci-Coupled Kalb-Ramond Bumblebee Gravity: Global Monopole and Axion-Plasmon Medium Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the influence of the axion-plasmon medium, as proposed in [10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.181803]\cite{Tercas:2018gxv}, on the optical properties of black holes in a Lorentz-violating spacetime containing a global monopole. Our primary aim is to provide a test for detecting the effects of a fixed axion-plasmon background within the framework of Ricci-coupled Kalb-Ramond bumblebee gravity. By extending the conventional Einstein-bumblebee model through a nonminimal coupling between the Kalb-Ramond field and the Ricci tensor, we demonstrate that the combined presence of a global monopole and Lorentz-violating effects induces significant modifications to the classical Schwarzschild lensing signature. Employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem within an optical geometry approach, we derive an analytical expression for the deflection angle that incorporates both linear and quadratic contributions from the Lorentz-violating parameter and the monopole charge. Furthermore, we investigate how the axion-plasmon coupling alters light propagation, affecting key observable gravitational deflection angle. Our results indicate that these optical characteristics are notably sensitive to the axion-plasmon parameters, thereby offering promising observational signatures for probing new physics beyond standard general relativity.</description>

      <title>Cornell and Coulomb potentials in the double defect spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the quantum dynamics of a scalar field in a spacetime incorporating dual topological defects, specifically a cosmic string and a global monopole. Utilizing a generalized metric that encapsulates the combined geometric effects of both defects, we solve the Klein--Gordon equation through separation of variables and examine the role of external potentials, with a focus on the generalized Cornell potential. A comparative analysis against the pure Coulomb potential is conducted to elucidate the modifications induced by the additional linear term. The presence of topological defects deforms the radial components of the wave equation, leading to energy spectrum shifts in bound states and alterations in scattering phase shifts. The results obtained provide a deeper theoretical foundation for understanding the behavior of spin-0 particles in nontrivial spacetime geometries, particularly in the presence of distinct potential interactions.</description>

      <title>Universal Horizons without Hypersurface Orthogonality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key consequence of Lorentz-violating gravity is the emergence of modified dispersion relations implying the absence of a universal maximum propagation speed. This challenges the conventional notion of the event horizon as a causal boundary common to all degrees of freedom. However, certain solutions in these theories exhibit \emph{universal horizons} -- surfaces capable of trapping signals of arbitrarily high speed, thereby restoring the notion of black hole. Previous studies have extensively characterised universal horizons in settings where Lorentz violation is encoded via a hypersurface-orthogonal \ae{}ther. In this work, we explore the possibility of extending this concept to more general cases where hypersurface orthogonality is relaxed. To do so, we construct a candidate trapping surface and analyse its causal properties using a general model for Lorentz-violating matter. We find that, in addition to the standard conditions associated to universal horizons, a local vanishing of the \ae{}ther's twist is also necessary. We then provide an explicit example of such a universal horizon by suitably deforming the \ae{}ther flow in a stealth Kerr solution recently found in Einstein--\ae{}ther theory. Moreover, we analyse the behaviour of trajectories which are not analytical at the universal horizon and discuss the implications of our findings for Hawking radiation. While our analysis is motivated by Einstein-\ae{t}her gravity, our results apply to broader classes of Lorentz-violating theories, further supporting the relevance of black hole phenomenology in these frameworks.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamic road to gravity and quantum phenomena: non-relativistic self-gravitating weakly nonlocal fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thermodynamic analysis of weakly nonlocal non-relativistic fluids is presented under the assumption that an additional scalar field - a so-called internal variable - also contributes to the dynamics. The most general evolution of this field and the constitutive relations for the pressure tensor and the energy current density are determined by the Liu procedure. The classical holography of perfect (i.e., non-dissipative) fluids is generally proved, according to which the divergence of the pressure tensor can be given by the gradient of a corresponding scalar potential. Both Newtonian gravity and quantum fluid mechanics are covered as special cases of our fluid model. The unified framework generalises and couples quantum physics and gravitational phenomena, shedding light on the common background of several known modifications and generalisations together with thermodynamic restrictions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signals from primordial black holes orbiting solar-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses between $10^{14}$ and $10^{20}$ kg are candidates to contribute a substantial fraction of the total dark matter abundance. When in orbit around the center of a star, which can possibly be a completely interior orbit, such objects would emit gravitational waves, as predicted by general relativity. In this work, we examine the gravitational wave signals emitted by such objects when they orbit typical stars, such as the Sun. We show that the magnitude of the waves that could eventually be detected on Earth from a possible PBH orbiting the Sun or a neighboring Sun-like star within our galaxy can be significantly stronger than those originating from a PBH orbiting a denser but more distant neutron star (NS). Such signals may be detectable by the LISA gravitational-wave detector. In addition, we estimate the contribution that a large collection of such PBH-star systems would make to the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) within a range of frequencies to which pulsar timing arrays are sensitive.</description>

      <title>Regular Black Hole Models in the Transition from Baryonic Matter to Quark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate gravitational collapse scenarios involving baryonic matter transitioning into quark-gluon plasma under extreme astrophysical conditions, focusing on their implications for the formation of regular black holes. Standard gravitational collapse models inevitably predict central singularities, highlighting the limitations of classical general relativity in extreme density regimes. By introducing a physically motivated, inhomogeneous transition rate between baryonic and quark matter, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that it is possible to construct regular black hole solutions featuring a nonsingular de Sitter-like core. We further analyze the observable consequences of these models, particularly emphasizing modifications to the black hole shadow radius, which provide direct observational constraints accessible through Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian dynamics of compact binaries with mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking into account the mass transfer effect, we derive the equations of motion of a compact binary system at the second-half post-Newtonian order. Applying such equations of motion to quasi-circular orbits, we obtain the time derivative of the orbital frequency, which is consistent with the angular momentum balance equation. Numerical estimates of the phase of gravitational waves are provided for typical mass transfer rates. Our result can be used to improve the waveforms of gravitational waves emitted by compact binaries with mass transfer.</description>

      <title>Parameter extraction of the stochastic gravitational wave background with peak-like templates in millihertz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a framework for extracting parameters of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) with peak-like templates in the millihertz frequency band, and analyzing transient contamination effects on parameter reconstruction. We present the spectrum and spectrogram under different conditions and provide the results of parameter reconstruction. Using templates from the early universe, we demonstrate that the peak-like templates outperform the broken power law (BPL) templates in power-law exponents recovery and peak frequency localization. The reconstruction results obtained using data from Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) are better than those obtained using data from Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) which is based on the spectrogram. For the single-peak template, the estimation accuracy of the exponent and peak frequency surpasses that of the BPL template by an order of magnitude, but demonstrates less precision in amplitude estimation compared to BPL. Regarding the double-peak template, parameter estimation results derived from the FFT methodology consistently outperform those obtained using STFT. Nevertheless, transient signals exhibit a detrimental impact on parameter estimation precision, causing errors to increase by an order of magnitude, particularly in multi-peak scenarios. This framework provides an example for using templates to analyze data from space-based gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Tidal heating in binary inspiral of strange quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate tidal heating associated with the binary inspiral of strange quark stars and its impact on the resulting gravitational wave signal. Tidal heating during the merger of neutron stars composed of nuclear matter may be considered negligible, but it has been demonstrated recently that the presence of hyperons at high densities could significantly enhance the dissipation during inspiral. In this work, we evaluate the bulk viscosity arising from non-leptonic weak processes involving quarks and show that it can be several orders of magnitude higher than the viscosity of nuclear matter at temperatures relevant to the inspiral phase of the merger of strange stars. We model strange quark matter in the normal phase using a non-ideal bag model including electrons and ensure compatibility with astrophysical constraints. By analysing equal-mass binary systems with component masses ranging from 1.4 to 1.8 $\, M_{\odot}$, we find that temperatures close to 0.1 MeV are reached by the end of the inspiral phase. We also estimate the effect on the gravitational waveform and conclude that the additional phase shift could range from $0.1$ to $0.5$ radians for strange quark masses of 200 MeV, making it potentially detectable by next-generation gravitational wave detectors. Given that tidal heating from hyperons is dominant only for very massive neutron stars having masses 1.8 to 2.0 $\, M_{\odot}$, a successful detection of this phase shift during the inspiral of binary systems with relatively low masses of 1.4 to 1.6 $\, M_{\odot}$ could be a smoking gun signature for the existence of strange quark stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore four-dimensional scalar-tensor theories obtained from well-defined dimensional regularizations of Lovelock invariants. When an infinite tower of corrections is considered, these theories allow for cosmological models in which the Big Bang singularity is replaced by an inflationary phase in the early-universe, and they also admit a specific class of regular black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>Bondi Mass, Memory Effect And Balance Law of Polyhomogeneous Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacetimes with metrics admitting an expansion in terms of a combination of powers of 1/r and ln r are known as polyhomogeneous spacetimes. The asymptotic behaviour of the Newman-Penrose quantities for these spacetimes is presented under certain gauges. The Bondi mass is revisited via the Iyer-Wald formalism. The memory effect of the gravitational radiation in the polyhomogeneous spacetimes is also discussed. It is found that the appearance of the logarithmic terms does not affect the balance law and it remains unchanged as the one of spacetimes with metrics admitting an expansion in terms of powers of 1/r.</description>

      <title>Signatures of NED on Quasi periodic Oscillations of a Magnetically Charged Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the influence of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) on the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of a magnetic charged black hole by analyzing the motion of test particles and their epicyclic frequencies. Starting from the effective potential, angular momentum, and energy of circular orbits, we examine how the NED parameter b alters the orbital dynamics. We find that as b increases, the system transitions smoothly from the RN regime towards the Schwarzschild profile, with observable changes in the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and Keplerian frequencies. We further investigate the variation in the radii of QPOs with respect to the NED parameter b by employing the RP, WD, and ER models. We also perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using observational QPO data from a diverse set of black hole sources spanning stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive regimes. The MCMC results yield consistent constraints on the parameter b across all mass regimes, indicating that NED effects leave a distinguishable signature on the QPO structure of a charged black hole.</description>

      <title>Horizons, throats and bounces in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity with a non-zero potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work conducts an in-depth exploration of exact electrically charged solutions, including traversable wormholes, black holes, and black bounces, within the framework of the scalar-tensor representation of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity (HMPG) with a non-zero scalar potential. By integrating principles from both the metric and Palatini formulations, HMPG provides a flexible approach to addressing persistent challenges in General Relativity (GR), such as the late-time cosmic acceleration and the nature of dark matter. Under the assumption of spherical symmetry, we employ an inverse problem technique to derive exact solutions in both the Jordan and Einstein conformal frames. This method naturally leads to configurations involving either canonical or phantom scalar fields. A thorough examination of horizon structures, throat conditions, asymptotic behaviour, and curvature regularity (via the Kretschmann scalar) reveals the intricate causal structures permitted by this theoretical model. The analysis uncovers a diverse range of geometric configurations, with the phantom sector exhibiting a notably richer spectrum of solutions than the canonical case. These solutions encompass traversable wormholes, black universe models, where the interior of a black hole evolves into an expanding cosmological phase rather than a singularity, as well as black bounce structures and multi-horizon black holes. The results demonstrate that introducing a non-zero scalar potential within HMPG significantly expands the array of possible gravitational solutions, yielding complex causal and curvature properties that go beyond standard GR. Consequently, HMPG stands out as a powerful theoretical framework for modelling extreme astrophysical environments, where deviations from classical gravity are expected to play a crucial role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories have shown great potential in inducing tailored modifications compared to cosmic evolution in the $\Lambda$CDM model. We reconsider quintessence models in this work in the context of three driving potentials. We center the action of these models in the late Universe which leaves early $\Lambda$CDM cosmology unchanged. The effects show the potential of producing a faster expanding cosmology with a high Hubble constant. The models are constrained using the cosmic chronometer data, Pantheon plus, and transversal baryonic acoustic oscillation data.</description>

      <title>Large black-hole scalar charges induced by cosmology in Horndeski theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The regularity of black hole solutions, embedded in an expanding Universe, is studied in a subclass of Horndeski theories, namely the sum of the simplest quadratic, cubic and quintic actions. We find that in presence of a time derivative of the scalar field, driven by the cosmological expansion, this regularity generically imposes large scalar charges for black holes, even when assuming strictly no direct coupling of matter to the scalar field. Such charges cause a significant accretion of the scalar field by the black holes, driving its local time derivative to a small value. This phenomenon, together with the Vainshtein screening typical of these theories, strongly suppresses observable scalar effects. We show that this full class of models is consistent with LIGO/Virgo detections of gravitational waves, but that the LISA mission should be able to constrain the coefficient of the quintic term at the $10^{-30}$ level in a self-acceleration scenario, an improvement by 16 orders of magnitude with respect to what is imposed by the speed of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit of axisymmetric spacetimes: local curvature, matter fields, and quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the deflection of photons in the strong deflection limit within static, axisymmetric spacetimes possessing reflection symmetry. As the impact parameter approaches its critical value, the deflection angle exhibits a logarithmic divergence. This divergence is characterized by a logarithmic rate and a constant offset, which we express in terms of coordinate-invariant curvature evaluated at the unstable photon circular orbit. The curvature contribution is encoded in the electric part of the Weyl tensor, reflecting tidal effects, and the matter contribution is encoded in the Einstein tensor, capturing the influence of local energy and pressure. We also express these coefficients using Newman--Penrose scalars. By exploiting the relationship between the strong deflection limit and quasinormal modes, we derive a new expression for the quasinormal mode frequency in the eikonal limit in terms of the curvature scalars. Our results provide a unified and coordinate-invariant framework that connects observable lensing features and quasinormal modes to the local geometry and matter distribution near compact objects.</description>

      <title>Wick rotation in the lapse, admissible complex metrics, and foliation changing diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06047v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Wick rotation in the lapse (not in time) is introduced that interpolates between Riemannian and Lorentzian metrics on real manifolds admitting a codimension-one foliation. The definition refers to a fiducial foliation but covariance under foliation changing diffeomorphisms can be rendered explicit in a reformulation as a rank one perturbation. Applied to scalar field theories a Lorentzian signature action develops a positive imaginary part thereby identifying the underlying complex metric as ``admissible''. This admissibility is ensured in non-fiducial foliations in technically distinct ways also for the variation with respect to the metric and for the Hessian. The Hessian of the Wick rotated action is a complex combination of a generalized Laplacian and a d'Alembertian, which is shown to have spectrum contained in a wedge of the upper complex half plane. Specialized to near Minkowski space the induced propagator differs from the one with the Feynman $i\epsilon$ prescription and on Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre backgrounds the difference to a Wick rotation in time is illustrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nikiforov-Uvarov method is a simple, yet elegant and powerful method for solving second-order differential equations of generalized hypergeometric type. In the past, it has been used to solve many problems in quantum mechanics and elsewhere. We apply this method to the classical problem of hydrogen-like atoms in spaces of constant curvature. Both the spectra of these atoms and their wave functions, including normalization, are easily obtained.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting new dark physics with the next generation of atomic clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wide classes of new fundamental physics theories cause apparent variations in particle mass ratios in space and time. In theories that violate the weak equivalence principle (EP), those variations are not uniform across all particles and may be detected with atomic and molecular clock frequency comparisons. In this work we explore the potential to detect those variations with near-future clock comparisons. We begin by searching published clock data for variations in the electron-proton mass ratio. We then undertake a statistical analysis to model the noise in a variety of clock pairs that can be built in the near future according to the current state of the art, determining their sensitivity to various fundamental physics signals. Those signals are then connected to constraints on fundamental physics theories that lead directly or indirectly to an effective EP-violating, including those motivated by dark matter, dark energy, the vacuum energy problem, unification or other open questions of fundamental physics. This work results in projections for tight new bounds on fundamental physics that could be achieved with atomic and molecular clocks within the next few years. Our code for this work is packaged into a forecast tool that translates clock characteristics into bounds on fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Rapid inference and comparison of gravitational-wave population models with neural variational posteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog has been analyzed with an abundance of different population models due to theoretical uncertainty in the formation of gravitational-wave sources. To expedite model exploration, we introduce an efficient and accurate variational Bayesian approach that learns the population posterior with a normalizing flow and serves as a drop-in replacement for existing samplers. With hardware acceleration, inference takes just seconds for the current set of black-hole mergers and readily scales to larger catalogs. The trained posteriors provide an arbitrary number of independent samples with exact probability densities, unlike established stochastic sampling algorithms that otherwise match with Jensen-Shannon divergences below 0.1 nats in our 14-dimensional parameter space, while requiring up to three orders of magnitude fewer likelihood evaluations and as few as $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$. Provided the posterior support is covered, discrepancies can be addressed with smoothed importance sampling, which quantifies a goodness-of-fit metric for the variational approximation while also estimating the evidence for Bayesian model selection. Neural variational inference thus enables interactive development, analysis, and comparison of population models, making it a useful tool for astrophysical interpretation of current and future gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Expanding on the double copy in null Fermi coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Weyl classical double copy for a Fermi normal coordinate expansion around null geodesics. To leading order in this "Penrose expansion", we recover a previously proposed double copy of the Penrose limit. For spacetimes with an exact double copy, this Penrose limit double copy is extended to all orders. For spacetimes without such a double copy, generic obstructions appear at second subleading order. We thus argue that for any spacetime, near any null geodesic there is a classical double copy structure at least up to first subleading order in the Penrose expansion. Finally, we point out a difficulty in identifying an appropriate flat space to extend our results to the Kerr-Schild double copy, related to the generic incompatibility between Kerr-Schild and Penrose-G\"uven gauge.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy with AdS-dS transitions vs. Baryon Acoustic Oscillations at $z =$ 2.3-2.4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, written in memory of Alexei Starobinsky, we discuss the observational viability of the Ph-$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model - a dynamical dark energy scenario based on a phantom scalar field undergoing an anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) transition - and revisit the Sahni-Shtanov braneworld model in light of updated BAO Ly-$\alpha$ data at $z \sim 2.3$. Both models are able to remain consistent with Planck CMB data while offering potential resolutions to the $H_0$ tension. In both cases, the expansion rate $H(z)$ is suppressed relative to Planck-$\Lambda$CDM at high redshift and enhanced at low redshift, while remaining consistent with the comoving distance to recombination as estimated by Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. Comparing model predictions with BAO-inferred values of $H(z)$, we find that SDSS Ly-$\alpha$ data at $z \approx 2.33$ mildly favor such dynamical models, whereas the recent DESI Ly-$\alpha$ measurements agree more closely with $\Lambda$CDM. Although current high-redshift BAO data do not decisively favor one model over another, our findings illustrate how frameworks originally developed to address earlier anomalies - such as the braneworld scenario - may gain renewed relevance in confronting today's cosmological tensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parity-inverted anti-de Sitter space -- ``flipped AdS'' -- is studied through the accelerating boundary correspondence of a moving mirror trajectory. The particle production exhibits positive energy flux and a finite total energy (both unlike AdS). The particle spectrum is of Whittaker form, with some similarities to a Planck thermal spectrum. We also derive the corresponding spacetime metric, with similarities to regular de Sitter space, but exhibiting a tower of repeated causal regions with horizons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of large-amplitude coherent states of a massive mechanical resonator, and their quantum-limited detection represent useful tools for quantum sensing and for testing fundamental physics theories. In fact, any weak perturbation may affect the coherent quantum evolution of the prepared state, providing a sensitive probe for such a perturbation. Here we consider a cavity optomechanical setup and the case of the detection of a weak mechanical nonlinearity. We consider different strategies, first focusing on the stationary dynamics in the presence of multiple tones driving the system, and then focusing on non-equilibrium dynamical strategies. These methods can be successfully applied for measuring Duffing-like material nonlinearities, or effective nonlinear corrections associated with quantum gravity theories.</description>

      <title>An intrinsic cosmological observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been much recent interest in the necessity of an observer degree of freedom in the description of local algebras in semiclassical gravity. In this work, we describe an example where the observer can be constructed intrinsically from the quantum fields. This construction involves the slow-roll inflation example recently analyzed by Chen and Penington, in which the gauge-invariant gravitational algebra arises from marginalizing over modular flow in a de Sitter static patch. We relate this procedure to the Connes-Takesaki theory of the flow of weights for type III von Neumann algebras, and further show that the resulting gravitational algebra can naturally be presented as a crossed product. This leads to a decomposition of the gravitational algebra into quantum field and observer degrees of freedom, with different choices of observer being related to changes in a quantum reference frame for the algebra. We also connect this example to other constructions of type II algebras in semiclassical gravity, and argue they all share the feature of being the result of gauging modular flow. The arguments in this work involve various properties of automorphism groups of hyperfinite factors, and so in an appendix we review the structure of these groups, which may be of independent interest for further investigations into von Neumann algebras in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Evidence for Non-Minimal Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent observational evidence of deviations from the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model points towards the presence of evolving dark energy. The simplest possibility consists of a cosmological scalar field $\varphi$, dubbed quintessence, driving the accelerated expansion. We assess the evidence for the existence of such a scalar field. We find that, if the accelerated expansion is driven by quintessence, the data favour a potential energy $V(\varphi)$ that is concave, i.e., $m^2=d^2V/d\varphi^2&lt;0$. Furthermore, and more significantly, the data strongly favour a scalar field that is non-minimally coupled to gravity (Bayes factor $\log(B) = 7.34 \pm 0.60$), leading to time variations in the gravitational constant on cosmological scales, and the existence of fifth forces on smaller scales. The fact that we do not observe such fifth forces implies that either new physics must come into play on non-cosmological scales or that quintessence is an unlikely explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration.</description>

Abstract: High order corrections to the perihelion precession are obtained in non-Newtonian central potentials, via complex analysis techniques. The result is an exact series expansion whose terms, for a perturbation of the form $\delta V=\frac{\gamma}{r^{s}}$, are calculated in closed form. To validate the method, the series is applied to the specific case of s=3, and the results are compared with those presented in literature, which are relate to the Schwarzschild metric. As a further test, a numerical simulation was carried out for the case where s=4. The algebraic calculations and numerical simulations were carried out via software with symbolic capabilities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Meets DESI: Dynamical Dark Energy in Light of the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent DESI DR2 observations indicate that dark energy has crossed from phantom to quintessence regime, a behavior known as the quintom-B realization. In this work we constrain dynamical dark energy and modified gravity using the swampland Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC), which forbids eternal acceleration since in this case any trans-Planckian quantum fluctuation would eventually stretch beyond the Hubble radius, breaking the applicability of any effective field theory and cosmological techniques. By combining DESI DR2 data with the TCC criterion, we impose tight constraints on the dark energy equation of state and its parameter space in scenarios such as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, Barboza-Alcaniz, Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan, EXP and LOG parameterizations, significantly constraining the quintom-A behavior. Also we examine models within the framework of $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ modified gravity theories, demonstrating that TCC is very powerful to constrain or exclude them, a result that indicates the necessity to consider infrared modifications on General Relativity apart from the usual ultraviolet ones. Our findings imply that viable dynamical dark energy scenarios must asymptotically transit to deceleration, shedding light on new physics consistent with both cosmological observations and quantum gravity principles.</description>

These neutrinos are gravitationally scattered off a spinning Kerr black hole surrounded by a thick accretion disk. The disk can co-rotate and counter-rotate with respect to BH spin.

      <description>arXiv:2504.07838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affleck-Dine (AD) baryogenesis can produce the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through the $CP$-violating dynamics of AD field. The field generally fragments into Q-balls, whose rapid decay induces enhanced gravitational waves. In this Letter, we investigate the anisotropies in this gravitational wave background as a new essential observable for AD baryogenesis. The evolution of AD field causes non-Gaussian baryonic isocurvature perturbations, and the non-Gaussianity modulates the spatial distribution of Q-balls on large scales, resulting in large-scale anisotropies in the Q-ball-induced gravitational wave background. We present that the anisotropies can be significantly large with a reduced angular power spectrum $\sim 10^{-2}$, and can be detected by future experiments like LISA. Moreover, these anisotropies universally reveal the $CP$-violating dynamics of AD field, opening a novel road to explore the longstanding baryon asymmetry puzzle.</description>

Abstract: We present a formula for the universal anomalous scaling of the multipole moments of a generic gravitating source in classical general relativity. We derive this formula in two independent ways using effective field theory methods. First, we use the absorption of low frequency gravitational waves by a black hole to identify the total multipole scaling dimension as the renormalized angular momentum of black hole perturbation theory. More generally, we show that the anomalous dimension is determined by phase shifts of gravitational waves elastically scattering off generic source multipole moments, which reproduces the renormalized angular momentum in the particular case of black holes. The effective field theory approach thus clarifies the role of the renormalized angular momentum in the multipole expansion. The universality of the point-particle effective description of compact gravitating systems further allows us to extract the universal part of the anomalous dimension, which is the same for any object, including black holes, neutron stars, and binary systems. As an application, we propose a novel resummation of the universal short-distance logarithms (``tails'') in the gravitational waveform of binary systems, which may improve the modeling of signals from current and future gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Sculpting the outer edge of accretion disks in pre-circumbinary binary black hole systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary black hole systems (BBHs) have become a vivid reality in astrophysics as stellar-mass black hole mergers are now detected through their related gravitational wave emission during the merger stage. If many studies were recently dedicated to the last stages of BBH where black holes are surrounded by a circumbinary disk (CBD), the structure of these systems prior to the formation of the CBD remains mostly unexplored. The aim of the present article is to investigate the potential modifications induced by the presence of a secondary black hole onto the structure of the accretion disk surrounding the primary black hole. We performed 2D classical hydrodynamical simulations of an accretion disk surrounding the primary black hole while taking into account all gravitational effects induced by both the primary black hole and the secondary black hole orbiting on circular orbits around the center of mass of the system.We report three main effects of the presence of a secondary black hole orbiting a circular orbit beyond the outer edge of the accretion disk: 1/ the outer radius of the accretion disk is significantly reduced and its ratio to the black hole separation is directly linked to only the mass ratio of the black holes; 2/ two spiral arms are visible in the gas density structure of the disk and 3/ the outer edge of the accretion disk exhibits an elliptical shape that mainly depends on the mass ratio of the black holes. Our results show that an accretion disk orbiting a primary black hole in a pre-CBD BBH exhibits specific features induced by the gravitational force generated by the presence of a secondary black hole beyond its outer edge. Such features, directly linked to the binary separation and mass ratio, has therefore the potential to help in the search and identification of BBH in the pre-CBD stage.</description>

      <title>One-loop renormalization of the effective field theory of inflationary fluctuations from gravitational interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We dig into the semi-classical description of gravity by studying one-loop corrections to primordial power spectra generated during cosmic inflation from gravitational nonlinear interactions. In the realm of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of inflationary fluctuations, we renormalize the quadratic Lagrangian dictating the linear dynamics of gauge-invariant perturbations. Since gravity is a non-renormalizable theory, this procedure is performed perturbatively in terms of negative powers of the EFT strong coupling scales. Since the interactions we consider are purely gravitational, they are ubiquitous and independent of the details of the EFT. Our results are thus relevant for a large class of approximately scale-invariant inflationary scenarios, be them driven by a single scalar field with canonical kinetic terms, or with a non-canonical structure \textit{\`a la} $P(X,\phi)$, or for an effective single-field description at the level of fluctuations only and emerging from a covariant multifield theory. Using dimensional regularization, we show that time-dependent Ultra-Violet (UV) divergences appearing at the loop level can be canceled at all times by an appropriate splitting of the bare Lagrangian into renormalized operators and counterterms. Moreover, we explicitly compute all finite contributions to the loops and we prove that, taking into account backreaction, the final one-loop renormalized power spectra of both the primordial curvature perturbation and of gravitational waves are exactly conserved on super-horizon scales. Conclusions of our work imply that the scalar and tensor propagation speeds are immune to radiative corrections from gravitational nonlinearities. We discuss a first application to multifield inflation.</description>

      <title>Cosmic acceleration driven by dark matter self-interactions: a phenomenological treatment</title>

      <description>arXiv:1904.01867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the idea that cosmic acceleration may be a byproduct of late-time effects like structure formation in two steps. First, we consider the equation of state for an inhomogeneous cosmic fluid, which may lead to a Gedanken-model for cosmic evolution, where dark matter is strongly self-interacting and stays in a plasma state until late stages of the cosmic evolution. After decoupling, it condensates to super-structures with cosmic voids similar to the current picture of the universe, introducing a negative pressure term in relation to self-interaction strength. Secondly, we carry out a cosmological analysis inspired by this scenario via a phenomenological ansatz that exhibits a transient behavior. In this analysis, we use the recent Type Ia supernova compilation and high redshift quasar data and compare the results to that of $\Lambda$CDM. It turns out that proposed model can solve the quasar Hubble diagram tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general class of scalar-teleparallel theories, which are based on a scalar field which is coupled to a flat connection with torsion and nonmetricity, and study its post-Newtonian limit using the parametrized post-Newtonian formalism. We find that among this class there are theories whose post-Newtonian limit fully agrees with general relativity; for others only the parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ deviate from their general relativity values $\beta = \gamma = 1$, while all other parameters remain the same, thus preserving total momentum conservation, local Lorentz invariance and local position invariance; finally, we also find theories whose post-Newtonian limit is pathological. Our main result is a full classification of the proposed theories into these different cases. We apply our findings to a number of simpler classes of theories and show that for these a subset of the aforementioned cases can be found.</description>

      <title>Prospects for cosmological constraints using gravitational wave memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The {\Lambda}CDM model has long served as a robust and predictive framework for cosmology, successfully explaining a wide range of observations, including the accelerated expansion of the Universe. However, discrepancies in cosmological parameter estimates and recent findings, such as those from DESI, hint at potential deviations from {\Lambda}CDM. Gravitational wave (GW) observations offer an independent method to probe the nature of dark energy, leveraging GWs from compact binary mergers as standard candles. In this study, we demonstrate that the integrated GW memory over cosmological distances encodes a unique imprint of the background spacetime. Unlike previous analyses, our approach captures non-linear dependencies on cosmological quantities, resulting in an enhancement of the integrated GW memory by a factor of 100 for high-redshift sources well within the sensitivity range of next-generation detectors like Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. We find that despite the diminishing strength of individual GWs at high redshifts, their cumulative effect leads to a significant amplification, akin to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, offering a potential new avenue for cosmological studies. By examining a range of dark energy models, we reveal that GW memory is potentially highly sensitive to the underlying cosmological framework, making it a promising probe of dark energy. This novel approach presents the possibility of a fresh perspective to address persistent cosmological tensions, and the nature of dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The oscillation spectrum of a neutron star is notably rich and intrinsically dependent on the equation of state of nuclear matter. With recent advancements in gravitational-wave and electromagnetic astronomy, we are nearing the capability to perform neutron-star asteroseismology and probe the complex physics of neutron stars. With this in mind, we explore the implementation of three-parameter finite-temperature matter models in the computation of neutron-star oscillations. We consider in detail the thermodynamics of nuclear matter and show how this information enters the problem. Our realistic treatment takes into account entropy and composition gradients that exist in the nuclear matter, giving rise to buoyant g-mode oscillations. To illustrate the implementation, we determine the oscillation spectrum of a low-temperature neutron star. In addition to the expected compositional and thermal g-modes, we find perturbations sourced by phase transitions in the equation of state. We also examine two thermal models, comparing the results for constant redshifted temperature with those for uniform entropy per baryon.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may form before cosmological first-order phase transitions, leading to inevitable collisions between PBHs and bubble walls. In this Letter, we have simulated for the first time the co-evolution of an expanding scalar wall passing through a black hole with full numerical relativity. This black hole-bubble wall collision yields multiple far-reaching phenomena, including the PBH mass growth, gravitational wave radiations, and momentum recoil that endows PBHs with additional velocities, approximately doubling the formation rate for PBH binaries and hence strengthening the observational constraints on the PBH abundances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the gravitational signatures of a nonlinear electromagnetic extension of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution. We conduct an analysis of light propagation, focusing on the photon sphere, shadow formation, and geodesic trajectories in this spacetime. The constraints on the parameter $\xi$, which characterizes the nonlinear extension of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, are derived from observational data provided by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The time delay effects are also considered. In the thermodynamic analysis, we examine the Hawking temperature, entropy, heat capacity, and the emission of Hawking radiation via the tunneling process. The remnant mass and evaporation time of the black hole at its final stage are estimated. In addition, we compute the quasinormal modes using the WKB approximation, taking into account the characteristic oscillations of the system under scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations. Additionally, the time-domain solution is analyzed for all these perturbations to examine their evolution over time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16920v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate spontaneous vectorization in the Einstein-Maxwell-Vector (EMV) model, introducing a novel mechanism driven by the interplay between electromagnetic and vector fields. A key innovation in our work is the resolution of an apparent divergence in the vector field near the event horizon, achieved by employing a generalized coordinate transformation. This not only extends the domain of existence for vectorized Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes (VRNBHs), but also refines the theoretical understanding of such solutions. We introduce a new concept of combined charge $\sqrt{\tilde{Q}^2 + \tilde{P}^2}$, which better captures the underlying physics of these black holes and provides a unified framework for analyzing thermodynamics and observable phenomena such as light ring structures. Our findings suggest that VRNBHs exhibit enhanced thermodynamic preference and distinctive light ring properties compared to Reissner-Nordstr\"om solutions. Moreover, we demonstrate how this combined charge approach reveals connections to two-charge black hole solutions, offering promising avenues for observational verification within the context of effective field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the existence of wormholes within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology, using isotropic dark matter as the source. We analyze three distinct density profiles and solve the modified gravity field equations alongside the stress-energy tensor conservation, applying appropriate boundary conditions to obtain traversable wormhole solutions. Each solution is shown to satisfy the geometric criteria for wormholes, and their regularity is verified by computing the Kretschmann scalar to ensure the absence of singularities under determined conditions. Additionally, we examine the stress-energy tensor to identify scenarios in which energy conditions are violated within this model. The wormhole geometry is further explored through embedding diagrams, and the amount of exotic matter required to sustain these structures is computed using the Volume Integral Quantifier. Finally, we study the shadow produced by our wormhole solution, considering one of the dark matter density profiles, and compare it with observations of the M87 galaxy.</description>

Abstract: The canonical multi-scalar field inflation where the kinetic and potential terms are sum-separable is ruled out by the current observations for the chaotic-type potential $V=\sum_{i} \mu_{i} \phi_{i}^{p}$. This paper explores the non-sum-separable case to validate the chaotic-type potential in the multi-scalar field, incorporating a linear coupling term between the kinetic and potential terms in the canonical Lagrangian. This coupling influences the slow-roll parameters and also alters our predictions for the spectral index $n_{s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, which directly depend on those parameters. In fact, compared to standard canonical multi-field inflation, the values of $n_{s}$ and $r$ decrease to levels consistent with the recent Planck+BICEP/Keck constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the gravitational waves emitted by a stellar-mass object in a quasi-circular inspiral orbit around a central supermassive polymerized black hole in loop quantum gravity. Treating the stellar-mass object as a massive test particle, we derive its equations of motion and the corresponding radial effective potential. We find that the peak of the radial effective potential decreases with the quantum parameter $\hat{k}$. We also examine the impact of quantum corrections on the properties of stable circular orbits around the polymerized black hole. We model the smaller object's trajectory as an adiabatic evolution along stable circular orbits using a semi-relativistic approach. In this method, the motion of the object is described by relativistic geodesics, and changes in the object's energy and orbital angular momentum due to gravitational radiation are calculated using the mass quadrupole formula. The corresponding gravitational waveforms are generated using the numerical kludge method, revealing that quantum corrections cause phase advances in the gravitational waveforms. We further analyze the potential constraints on the quantum parameter $\hat{k}$ from future space-based gravitational wave observations, concluding that these observations will likely impose stronger constraints on $\hat{k}$ than those obtained from black hole shadow measurements.</description>

Abstract: Analyzing the stability of quasinormal modes is essential for understanding black hole dynamics, particularly in the context of gravitational wave emissions and black hole spectroscopy. In this study, we employ the hyperboloidal approach to reformulate the quasinormal mode problem of a rotating analogue black hole, effectively transforming it into an eigenvalue problem associated with a non-self-adjoint operator. Using this method, we examine the influence of rotation on the stability of the QNM spectrum, relying on the associated pseudospectrum for qualitative assessment. Our findings indicate that the prograde overtones become more stable as rotation increases. This work enhances our understanding of spectrum stability in rotating systems and expands the study of pseudospectra in non-spherically symmetric spacetimes, with potential for empirical testing in terrestrial laboratories.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Dynamics in Non-Minimally Coupled Theories via the Noether Symmetry and the Eisenhart-Duval Lift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of a non-minimally coupled (NMC) scalar field in modified gravity, employing the Noether gauge symmetry (NGS) approach to systematically derive exact cosmological solutions. By formulating a point-like Lagrangian and analyzing the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations, conserved quantities were identified, reducing the complexity of the dynamical system. Through the application of Noether symmetry principles, the scalar field potential was found to follow a power-law form, explicitly dependent on the coupling parameter $\xi$, influencing the evolution of the universe. The study further explores inflationary dynamics, showing that for specific values of $\xi$, the potential resembles the Higgs-like structure, contributing to a deeper understanding of early cosmic expansion. To enhance the theoretical framework, the Eisenhart lift method was introduced, providing a geometric interpretation of the system by embedding the dynamical variables within an extended field space. This approach established a connection between the kinetic terms and Killing vectors, offering an alternative perspective on the conserved quantities. The study also derived geodesic equations governing the evolution of the system, reinforcing the link between symmetry-based techniques and fundamental cosmological properties.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations with ultralight vector dark matter fields: numerical implementation in CLASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider a dark matter candidate described by an ultralight vector field, whose mass is in principle in the range $H_{\rm{eq}}\sim 10^{-28}\rm{eV}\ll m&lt; \rm{eV}$. The homogeneous background vector field is assumed to point in a given direction. We present a numerical implementation of cosmological perturbations in a Bianchi type I geometry with vector field dark matter in a modified version of the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS). We study the evolution of large-scale cosmological perturbations in the linear regime. We compute the matter power spectrums defined for Fourier modes pointing in a given direction. We obtain interesting features in the power spectrums whose observational significance depends on the field mass. We compare the results with the standard $\rm{\Lambda CDM}$ and with the corresponding well-studied ultralight scalar field dark matter case. As for the scalar case we obtain a suppression in the power spectrums at small scales characterized by the same scale, namely the Jeans scale. The main characteristic feature of the vector field model we notice here for first time is that the amplitude of the suppression effect depends on the direction of the Fourier modes with respect to the background vector field, leaving eventually a possible anisotropic imprint in structure formation at small scales.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description when the EFT is generated via the interaction with heavy fields in UV theories.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a charged confining holographic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a recently constructed charged confining holographic background. The confining background corresponds to the charged soliton, which is a solution of minimal $d=5$ gauged supergravity. The solution has a compact spacelike direction with a Wilson line on a circle and asymptotes to $AdS_5$ with a planar boundary. For the classical case, we analyze the chaos using the power spectrum, Poincar\'{e} sections, and Lyapunov exponents, finding that both energy and charge play constructive effects on enhancing the chaotic nature of the system. We similarly analyze quantum chaos using the distribution of the spectrum's level-spacing and out-of-time-ordered correlators and thoroughly investigate the effects of charge and energy. A gradual transition from a chaotic to an integrable regime is obtained as the energy and charge increase from lower to higher values, with charge playing a subdominant role.</description>

      <title>Probability Distribution for Vacuum Energy Flux Fluctuations in Two Spacetime Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The probability distribution for vacuum fluctuations of the energy flux in two dimensions will be constructed, along with the joint distribution of energy flux and energy density. Our approach will be based on previous work on probability distributions for the energy density in two dimensional conformal field theory. In both cases, the relevant stress tensor component must be averaged in time, and the results are sensitive to the form of the averaging function. Here we present results for two classes of such functions, which include the Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. The distribution for the energy flux is symmetric, unlike that for the energy density. In both cases, the distribution may possess an integrable singularity. The functional form of the flux distribution function involves a modified Bessel function, and is distinct from the shifted Gamma form for the energy density. By considering the joint distribution of energy flux and energy density, we show that the distribution of energy flux tends to be more centrally concentrated than that of the energy density. We also determine the distribution of energy fluxes, conditioned on the energy density being negative. Some applications of the results will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Rods and Clock in a Gravitational Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local operators are the basic observables in quantum field theory which encode the physics observed by a local experimentalist. However, when gravity is dynamical, diffeomorphism symmetries are gauged which apparently obstructs a sensible definition of local operators, as different locations in spacetime are connected by these gauged symmetries. This consideration brings in the puzzle of reconciling our empirical world with quantum gravity. Intuitively, this puzzle can be avoided using relatively defined observables when there exists a natural reference system such as a distribution of galaxies in our universe. Nevertheless, this intuition is classical as the rods and clock defined in this way may also have quantum fluctuations so it is not a priori clear if it can be realized in the quantum regime. In this letter, we provide an affirmative answer to this question. Interestingly, we notice that the quantum fluctuations of the reference system are in fact essential for the realization of the above intuition in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Doubly Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the expectation that relativistic symmetries might acquire quantum features in Quantum Gravity, we take the first steps towards a theory of ''Doubly'' Quantum Mechanics, a modification of Quantum Mechanics in which the geometrical configurations of physical systems, measurement apparata, and reference frame transformations are themselves quantized and described by ''geometry'' states in a Hilbert space. We develop the formalism for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ measurements by promoting the group of spatial rotations $SU(2)$ to the quantum group $SU_q(2)$ and generalizing the axioms of Quantum Theory in a covariant way. As a consequence of our axioms, the notion of probability becomes a self-adjoint operator acting on the Hilbert space of geometry states, hence acquiring novel non-classical features. After introducing a suitable class of semi-classical geometry states, which describe near-to-classical geometrical configurations of physical systems, we find that probability measurements are affected, in these configurations, by intrinsic uncertainties stemming from the quantum properties of $SU_q(2)$. This feature translates into an unavoidable fuzziness for observers attempting to align their reference frames by exchanging qubits, even when the number of exchanged qubits approaches infinity, contrary to the standard $SU(2)$ case.</description>

      <title>Euclidean AdS wormholes and gravitational instantons in the Einstein-Skyrme theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Euclidean AdS wormholes provide a natural setup for studying the AdS/CFT correspondence with multiple boundaries. However, from a bottom-up perspective, they cannot be embedded in the four-dimensional Einstein-AdS-Maxwell theory if these boundaries have positive curvature. Nevertheless, Maldacena and Maoz showed that this obstruction could be circumvented by introducing merons in the four-dimensional Einstein-AdS-Yang-Mills theory. In this work, we show that Euclidean-AdS wormholes also exist in the four-dimensional Einstein-AdS-Skyrme theory, whose matter sector possesses a nontrivial baryonic charge. We compute its free energy and show that it does not depend on the integration constants whatsoever, resembling topological solitons. Additionally, we obtain its holographic stress tensor and show that it vanishes, allowing us to interpret this configuration as a holographic Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) state. Other topologically nontrivial ground states in Einstein-Skyrme theory are found, such as gravitational instantons, representing the homotopically inequivalent vacua of the theory. We find that they develop Hawking-Page phase transitions above a critical temperature. Some of these solutions are periodic in Euclidean time, representing the gravitational analog of calorons in Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>An overview of what current data can (and cannot yet) say about evolving dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and distance moduli from Type Ia supernovae suggest a preference for Dynamical Dark Energy (DDE) scenarios characterized by a time-varying equation of state (EoS). This focused review assesses its robustness across independent measurements and surveys. Using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization to describe the evolution of the DE EoS, we analyze over 35 dataset combinations, incorporating Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, three independent Type Ia supernova (SN) catalogs (PantheonPlus, Union3, DESY5), BAO measurements from DESI and SDSS, and expansion rate measurements $H(z)$ inferred from the relative ages of massive, passively evolving galaxies at early cosmic times known as Cosmic Chronometers (CC). This review has two main objectives: first, to evaluate the statistical significance of the DDE preference across different dataset combinations, which incorporate varying sources of information. Specifically, we consider cases where only low-redshift probes are used in different combinations, others where individual low-redshift probes are analyzed together with CMB data, and finally, scenarios where high- and low-redshift probes are included in all possible independent combinations. Second, we provide a reader-friendly synthesis of what the latest cosmological and astrophysical probes can (and cannot yet) reveal about DDE. Overall, our findings highlight that combinations that \textit{simultaneously} include PantheonPlus SN and SDSS BAO significantly weaken the preference for DDE. However, intriguing hints supporting DDE emerge in combinations that do not include DESI-BAO measurements: SDSS-BAO combined with SN from Union3 and DESY5 (with and without CMB) support the preference for DDE.</description>

      <title>Bubbles in a box: Eliminating edge nucleation in cold-atom simulators of vacuum decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decay of metastable 'false vacuum' states via bubble nucleation plays a crucial role in many cosmological scenarios. Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially far-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early Universe is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of Euclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the laboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.</description>
