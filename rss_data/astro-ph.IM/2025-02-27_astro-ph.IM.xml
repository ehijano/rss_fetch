      <title>Cross-Model Validation of Coronagraphic Exposure Time Calculators for the Habitable Worlds Observatory: A Report from the Exoplanet Science Yield sub-Working Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the exoplanet scientific productivity of the Habitable Worlds Observatory requires estimating science exposure times. From exoplanet yields to spectral retrievals, exposure times are at the heart of our understanding of the capabilities of this future mission. As such, ensuring accuracy and consistency between different exposure time calculators (ETCs) is critical. We summarize the efforts of the Exoplanet Science Yield sub-Working Group's ETC Calibration Task Group, which conducted a calibration study from March 4 to June 30 of 2024. We compare three commonly-used coronagraphic exposure time calculators. We find that the ETCs use a broad variety of differing methods, assumptions, and inputs that produce variation in the final exposure times at the ~60% level. The causes for the disagreement have largely been identified, flagged for further development efforts, and in some cases retired since the conclusion of this effort. We expect that addressing the flagged efforts will bring the ETCs to within better than ~30% agreement.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Transient Classification: From Simulations to Real Data and ZTF to LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has become essential for automated classification of astronomical transients, but current approaches face significant limitations: classifiers trained on simulations struggle with real data, models developed for one survey cannot be easily applied to another, and new surveys require prohibitively large amounts of labelled training data. These challenges are particularly pressing as we approach the era of the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), where existing classification models will need to be retrained using LSST observations. We demonstrate that transfer learning can overcome these challenges by repurposing existing models trained on either simulations or data from other surveys. Starting with a model trained on simulated Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves, we show that transfer learning reduces the amount of labelled real ZTF transients needed by 75\% while maintaining equivalent performance to models trained from scratch. Similarly, when adapting ZTF models for LSST simulations, transfer learning achieves 95\% of the baseline performance while requiring only 30\% of the training data. These findings have significant implications for the early operations of LSST, suggesting that reliable automated classification will be possible soon after the survey begins, rather than waiting months or years to accumulate sufficient training data.</description>

      <title>A Challenge of Developing a Classifier for Multi-Band Classification of Variable Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variable stars play a very important role in our understanding of the Milky Way and the universe. In recent years, many survey projects have generated a large amount of photometric data, necessitating classifiers that can quickly identify various types of variable stars. However, obtaining these classifiers often requires substantial manpower and computational resources. To conserve these resources, it would be best to have a classifier that can be used across surveys. We explore the possibility that a classifier created in one optical band can also work in other bands, likely from different survey facilities. We construct a random forest classifier based on photometric data in ASAS-SN V-band and OGLE I-band, and apply the classifier on ASAS-SN V-band and ZTF r-band light curves of variable star samples. We explore the classification differences of using the magnitude light-curves or the normalized flux light-curves, the periods derived from single band light-curves or the periods derived from the multi-band combined light-curves, and with or without color-related features. We find it feasible to develop a classifier capable of working in both V and r bands for certain types of variable stars, such as RRAB variables. For other types of variable stars, like Cepheids, the classifier is unable to make accurate identifications.</description>

      <title>First frequency phase transfer from the 3 mm to the 1 mm band on an Earth-sized baseline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency Phase Transfer (FPT) is a technique designed to increase coherence and sensitivity in radio interferometry by making use of the non-dispersive nature of the troposphere to calibrate high-frequency data using solutions derived at a lower frequency. While the Korean VLBI Network has pioneered the use of simultaneous multi-band systems for routine FPT up to an observing frequency of 130 GHz, this technique remains largely untested in the (sub)millimeter regime. A recent effort has been made to outfit dual-band systems at (sub)millimeter observatories participating in the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and to test the feasibility and performance of FPT up to the observing frequencies of the EHT. We present the results of simultaneous dual-frequency observations conducted in January 2024 on an Earth-sized baseline between the IRAM 30-m in Spain and the JCMT and SMA in Hawai`i. We performed simultaneous observations at 86 and 215 GHz on the bright sources J0958+6533 and OJ287, with strong detections obtained at both frequencies. We observe a strong correlation between the interferometric phases at the two frequencies, matching the trend expected for atmospheric fluctuations and demonstrating for the first time the viability of FPT for VLBI at a wavelength of $\sim$1 millimeter. We show that the application of FPT systematically increases the 215 GHz coherence on all averaging timescales. In addition, the use of the co-located JCMT and SMA as a single dual-frequency station demonstrates the feasibility of paired-antenna FPT for VLBI for the first time, with implications for future array capabilities (e.g., ALMA sub-arraying and ngVLA calibration strategies).</description>

      <title>Towards Higher Order Accuracy in Self-Gravitating Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High order algorithms have emerged in numerical astrophysics as a promising avenue to reduce truncation error (proportional to a power of the linear resolution $\Delta x$) with only a moderate increase to computational expense. Significant effort has been placed in the development of finite volume algorithms for (magneto)hydrodynamics, however, state-of-the-art astrophysical simulations tightly couple a plenitude of physics, additionally including gravity, photon transport, cosmic ray transport, chemistry, and/or diffusion, to name a few. Algorithms frequently operator split this additional physics (often a first order error in time) and/or adopt a model wherein their evaluation is limited to second order accuracy in space. In this work, we present a fourth order accurate finite volume scheme for self-gravitating hydrodynamics on a uniform Cartesian grid. The method supplies source terms for the gravitational acceleration ($\rho {\bf g}$) and gravitational energy release ($\rho {\bf v} \cdot {\bf g}$) associated with fourth-order accurate solutions to the Poisson equation. Our scheme (1) guarantees the conservation of total linear momentum, while (2) decreasing (in proportion to $\Delta x^4$) the effects of spurious heating and/or cooling associated with truncation error in the gravity. We demonstrate expected convergence rates for the algorithm by measuring errors in test problems evolving self-gravity modified linear waves and 3D polytropic equilibria. We test robustness of the algorithm by integrating an induced "inside-out" adiabatic collapse. We also discuss a method to smoothly downgrade the solution to second-order spatial accuracy to avoid spurious overshoots near steep density and/or pressure gradients.</description>

      <title>Tunable Kernel-Nulling interferometry for direct exoplanet detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nulling interferometry is a promising technique for direct detection of exoplanets. However, the performance of current devices is limited by different perturbations sources and especially by its sensitivity to any phase aberrations. The work presented here attempts to overcome those limitations by using a four-telescopes nulling interferometer architecture, called Kernel-Nuller, which includes a recombiner that positions the four signals in phase quadrature. This architecture is based on an integrated optical component containing 14 electronically controlled phase shifters, used to correct optical path differences that would be induced by manufacturing defects. The first part of the study consists in the development of an algorithm providing the delays to be injected into the component to optimize the performance of that device. The next step of this study deals with the analysis of the intensity distributions produced at the output of the Kernel-Nuller through a series of observations. Then we apply statistical tests and data treatment techniques to detect the signature of an exoplanets.</description>

      <title>"Frog-eyes" in Astronomy: Monitoring Binary Radial Velocity Variations Through A Pair of Narrow-Band Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations are a crucial step in driving major discoveries in the era of time-domain surveys. However, the pace of current spectroscopic surveys is increasingly unable to meet the demands of rapidly advancing large-scale time-domain surveys. To address this issue, we propose the ``Frog-eyes" system, which employs a pair of narrow-band filters: one positioned near a strong absorption line to capture signals from Doppler shifts, and the other placed on the adjacent continuum to monitor intrinsic variations. The combination of observations from the two filters enables the extraction of radial velocity (RV) curves from a large sample of binary stars, and is particularly efficient for single-lined binaries (SB1), using photometric techniques. Comprehensive mock simulations on SB1 demonstrate that the binary orbital parameters can be precisely measured from the extracted RV curves for binary systems where the primary star has an effective temperature greater than 6000 K. With a typical ground-based photometric precision of approximately 0.3%, the uncertainties in the derived semi-amplitude K and eccentricity e are less than 10% and 0.1, respectively, for binary systems with K $\ge$ 30 km/s. These encouraging results are further validated by real observations of the hot subdwarf-white dwarf binary system HD 265435, using a non-specialized ``Frog-eyes" system installed on the Chinese 2.16m telescope. Once this system is properly installed on large-field-of-view survey telescopes, the rate of acquiring RV curves for binaries will approach their detection rate in leading time-domain photometric surveys.</description>

      <title>A method for statistical research on binary stars using radial velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using radial velocity to estimate binary fraction and predict orbital parameter distribution laws is an important method in the studies of binary stars. However, the high dimensionality of the orbital parameters of the binary system pose challenges to this work, particularly in terms of sample size and the accuracy of the calculated results.
  We have proposed and implemented an algorithm called DVCD (Differential Velocity Cumulative Distribution) for the statistical analysis of binary properties. % On the basis of higher accuracy than previous methods, the running efficiency of the method is greatly improved. This method not only achieves higher accuracy than previous approaches but also significantly improves computational efficiency. The computing time for the same sample and the hardware environment was reduced to $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-5}$ of that of some previous methods.
  Red giant samples from APOGEE DR16 were analyzed using the DVCD method. Both the hyperparameter of the orbital period $\pi$ and the intrinsic binary fraction ($f_{bin}$) can be constrained. We divided the sample into 16 subsets based on log$g$ and $M/H$. Calculation results showed that the binary fraction decreases with the decrease of surface gravity and decreases with the increase of metallicity. This trend provides important constraints on the evolution of binary stars.</description>

      <title>From Stars to Molecules: AI Guided Device-Agnostic Super-Resolution Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-resolution imaging has revolutionized the study of systems ranging from molecular structures to distant galaxies. However, existing deep-learning-based methods require extensive calibration and retraining for each imaging setup, limiting their practical deployment. We introduce a device-agnostic deep-learning framework for super-resolution imaging of point-like emitters that eliminates the need for calibration data or explicit knowledge of optical system parameters. Our model is trained on a diverse, numerically simulated dataset encompassing a broad range of imaging conditions, enabling robust generalization across different optical setups. Once trained, it reconstructs super-resolved images directly from a single resolution-limited camera frame with superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to conventional methods. We experimentally validate our approach using a custom-built microscopy setup with ground truth emitter positions and demonstrate its versatility on astronomical and single-molecule localization microscopy datasets, achieving unprecedented resolution without prior information. Our findings establish a pathway toward universal, calibration-free super-resolution imaging, expanding its applicability across scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Parameter Determination of Exoplanet through Asteroseismic Host Star Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study develops a robust framework for exoplanet characterization by leveraging asteroseismic constraints on host stars. Using precise photometric data from missions such as \textit{Kepler} and \textit{TESS}, we derive stellar parameters, including mass, radius, and age, with high accuracy through asteroseismic analysis. These stellar parameters are incorporated as priors in a Bayesian framework to refine planetary properties such as mass, radius, and orbital parameters. By applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, we extract posterior distributions of planetary parameters, achieving significant improvements in precision and reliability. This approach is particularly effective for systems with evolved host stars, where precise stellar properties are essential for resolving uncertainties in planetary characterization. The results demonstrate the importance of asteroseismology in bridging stellar astrophysics and exoplanet science, enabling detailed studies of planetary system architectures and their dependence on host star properties. Our methodology underscores the synergy between stellar and planetary studies, paving the way for future research on exoplanet populations. This work provides a foundation for utilizing data from upcoming missions like \textit{PLATO}, ensuring continued advancements in the precision and scope of exoplanet characterization.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Analysis into the Feasibility of Missions to Asteroid 2024 YR$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently discovered asteroid 2024 YR$_4$ has an orbital period of almost exactly 4 years, a descending node located almost exactly 1 au from the Sun, with a perihelion slightly less than that. Its combination of semi-major axis and perihelion renders it a 'Potentially Hazardous Object' (PHO) in the Apollo class. It now has a low chance of colliding with the Earth on 22 December 2032, yet there is the potential for many further close encounters with Earth into the distant future. This paper investigates the feasibility of missions to this object in the short term, up to and including its close encounter in 2032, and exploits the preliminary mission design software known as 'Optimum Interplanetary Trajectory Software' (OITS). Many flyby opportunities are found with launch windows virtually throughout 2028. Sample Returns are also eminently feasible over this period. Rendezvous missions with 'New Horizons' spacecraft (adopted as a convenient reference mission) are available, although these require launches around late 2028 and early 2029, and with much longer flight durations. In summary it is found that 2024 YR$_4$ represents an 'opportunity rich environment' and bodes well for any future attempts by humanity to either examine this object close up, or even to deflect it if necessary.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Assessment of Data Volume Reduction for IACTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High energy cosmic-rays generate air showers when they enter Earth's atmosphere. Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy is possible using either direct detection of shower particles at mountain altitudes, or with arrays of imaging air-Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). Advances in the technique and larger collection areas have increased the rate at which air-shower events can be captured, and the amount of data produced by modern high-time-resolution Cherenkov cameras. Therefore, Data Volume Reduction (DVR) has become critical for such telescope arrays, ensuring that only useful information is stored long-term. Given the vast amount of raw data, owing to the highest resolution and sensitivity, the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will need robust data reduction strategies to ensure efficient handling and analysis. The CTAO data rates needs be reduced from hundreds of Petabytes (PB) per year to a few PB/year.
  This paper presents algorithms tailored for CTAO but also applicable for other arrays, focusing on selecting pixels likely to contain shower light. It describes and evaluates multiple algorithms based on their signal efficiency, noise rejection, and shower reconstruction. With a focus on a time-based clustering algorithm which demonstrates a notable enhancement in the retention of low-level signal pixels. Moreover, the robustness is assessed under different observing conditions, including detector defects. Through testing and analysis, it is shown that these algorithms offer promising solutions for efficient volume reduction in CTAO, addressing the challenges posed by the array's very large data volume and ensuring reliable data storage amidst varying observational conditions and hardware issues.</description>

      <title>Search for anti-quark nuggets via their interaction with the LHC beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anti-quark nuggets (AQNs) have been suggested to solve the dark matter (DM) and the missing antimatter problem in the universe and have been proposed as an explanation of various observations. Their size is in the {\mu}m range and their density is about equal to the nuclear density with an expected flux of about $0.4 / km^2 / year$. For the typical velocity of DM constituents ($\sim$250 km/s), the solar system bodies act as highly performing gravitational lenses. Here we assume that DM streams or clusters are impinging, e.g., on the Earth, as it was worked out for DM axions and Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). Interestingly, in the LHC beam, unforeseen beam losses are triggered by so-called Unidentified Falling Objects (UFOs), which are believed to be constituted of dust particles with a size in the {\mu}m range and a density of several orders of magnitude lower than AQNs. Prezeau suggested that streaming DM constituents incident on the Earth should result in jet-like structures ("hairs") exiting the Earth, or a kind of caustics. Such ideas open novel directions in the search for DM. This work suggests a new analysis of the UFO results at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), assuming that they are eventually, at least partly, due to AQNs. Firstly, a reanalysis of the existing data from the 4000 beam monitors since the beginning of the LHC is proposed, arguing that dust and AQNs should behave differently. The feasibility of this idea has been discussed with CERN accelerator people and potential collaborators.</description>

      <title>Position and Time Determination without Prior State Knowledge via Onboard Optical Observations of Delta Scuti Variable Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a navigation concept for solving the lost in space and time problem using optical observations of $\delta$ Scuti variable stars. Only a small number of techniques exist that allow a spacecraft to recover from being lost in both space and time, which can be caused by a failure of the onboard clock and navigation systems. Optical observations of $\delta$ Scuti stars, which can be collected onboard from star trackers or navigation cameras, may enable autonomous position and time determination without requiring additional equipment or external communication. Our results indicate that less than one day of observation by the OSIRIS-APEX PolyCam may enable position and time determination accuracy within 0.03 au (3$\sigma$) and 3 seconds (3$\sigma$).</description>

      <title>Constraint on Lorentz Invariance Violation for spectral lag transition in GRB 160625B using profile likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reanalyze the spectral lag data for GRB 160625B using frequentist inference in order to constrain the energy scale ($E_{QG}$) of Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV). For this purpose, we use profile likelihood to deal with the astrophysical nuisance parameters. This is in contrast to Bayesian inference implemented in previous works, where marginalization was carried out over the nuisance parameters. We show that with profile likelihood, we do not find a global minimum for $\chi^2$ as a function of $E_{QG}$ below the Planck scale for both linear and quadratic models of LIV, whereas bounded credible intervals were previously obtained using Bayesian inference. Therefore, we can set one-sided lower limits in a straightforward manner. We find that $E_{QG} \geq 2.55 \times 10^{16}$ GeV and $E_{QG} \geq 1.85 \times 10^7$ GeV at 95\% c.l., for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively. Therefore, this is the first proof-of-principles application of profile likelihood method to the analysis of GRB spectral lag data to constrain LIV.</description>
