      <title>Hacia una implementaci\'on \'etica e inclusiva de la Inteligencia Artificial en las organizaciones: un marco multidimensional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article analyzes the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on contemporary society and the importance of adopting an ethical approach to its development and implementation within organizations. It examines the critical perspective of French philosopher \'Eric Sadin and others, who warn of the risks of unbridled technologization that can erode human autonomy. However, the article also recognizes the active role that various actors, such as governments, academics and civil society, can play in shaping the development of AI aligned with human and social values. A multidimensional approach is proposed that combines ethics with regulation, innovation and education. It highlights the importance of developing detailed ethical frameworks, incorporating ethics in the training of professionals, conducting ethical impact audits, and encouraging stakeholder participation in AI design. In addition, four fundamental pillars for the ethical implementation of AI in organizations are presented: 1) Integrated values, 2) Trust and transparency, 3) Empowering human growth, and 4) Identifying strategic factors. These pillars cover aspects such as alignment with the company's ethical identity, governance and accountability, human-centered design, continuous training and adaptability in the face of technological and market changes. It concludes by emphasizing that ethics must be the cornerstone of the strategy of any organization that aspires to incorporate AI, establishing a solid framework to ensure that the technology is developed and used in a way that respects and promotes human values.</description>

      <title>Integrating A.I. in Higher Education: Protocol for a Pilot Study with 'SAMCares: An Adaptive Learning Hub'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning never ends, and there is no age limit to grow yourself. However, the educational landscape may face challenges in effectively catering to students' inclusion and diverse learning needs. These students should have access to state-of-the-art methods for lecture delivery, online resources, and technology needs. However, with all the diverse learning sources, it becomes harder for students to comprehend a large amount of knowledge in a short period of time. Traditional assistive technologies and learning aids often lack the dynamic adaptability required for individualized education plans. Large Language Models (LLM) have been used in language translation, text summarization, and content generation applications. With rapid growth in AI over the past years, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants have been developed. This research aims to bridge this gap by introducing an innovative study buddy we will be calling the 'SAMCares'. The system leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) (in our case, LLaMa-2 70B as the base model) and Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) to offer real-time, context-aware, and adaptive educational support. The context of the model will be limited to the knowledge base of Sam Houston State University (SHSU) course notes. The LLM component enables a chat-like environment to interact with it to meet the unique learning requirements of each student. For this, we will build a custom web-based GUI. At the same time, RAG enhances real-time information retrieval and text generation, in turn providing more accurate and context-specific assistance. An option to upload additional study materials in the web GUI is added in case additional knowledge support is required. The system's efficacy will be evaluated through controlled trials and iterative feedback mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Finding the white male: The prevalence and consequences of algorithmic gender and race bias in political Google searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search engines like Google have become major information gatekeepers that use artificial intelligence (AI) to determine who and what voters find when searching for political information. This article proposes and tests a framework of algorithmic representation of minoritized groups in a series of four studies. First, two algorithm audits of political image searches delineate how search engines reflect and uphold structural inequalities by under- and misrepresenting women and non-white politicians. Second, two online experiments show that these biases in algorithmic representation in turn distort perceptions of the political reality and actively reinforce a white and masculinized view of politics. Together, the results have substantive implications for the scientific understanding of how AI technology amplifies biases in political perceptions and decision-making. The article contributes to ongoing public debates and cross-disciplinary research on algorithmic fairness and injustice.</description>

      <title>Heat, Health, and Habitats: Analyzing the Intersecting Risks of Climate and Demographic Shifts in Austrian Districts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of hot weather on health outcomes of a population is mediated by a variety of factors, including its age profile and local green infrastructure. The combination of warming due to climate change and demographic aging suggests that heat-related health outcomes will deteriorate in the coming decades. Here, we measure the relationship between weekly all-cause mortality and heat days in Austrian districts using a panel dataset covering $2015-2022$. An additional day reaching $30$ degrees is associated with a $2.4\%$ increase in mortality per $1000$ inhabitants during summer. This association is roughly doubled in districts with a two standard deviation above average share of the population over $65$. Using forecasts of hot days (RCP) and demographics in $2050$, we observe that districts will have elderly populations and hot days $2-5$ standard deviations above the current mean in just $25$ years. This predicts a drastic increase in heat-related mortality. At the same time, district green scores, measured using $10\times 10$ meter resolution satellite images of residential areas, significantly moderate the relationship between heat and mortality. Thus, although local policies likely cannot reverse warming or demographic trends, they can take measures to mediate the health consequences of these growing risks, which are highly heterogeneous across regions, even in Austria.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal load shifting for truly clean computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Companies with datacenters are procuring significant amounts of renewable energy to reduce their carbon footprint. There is increasing interest in achieving 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) matching in electricity usage, aiming to eliminate all carbon footprints associated with electricity consumption on an hourly basis. However, the variability of renewable energy resources poses significant challenges for achieving this goal. We explore the impact of shifting computing jobs and associated power loads both in time and between datacenter locations. We develop an optimization model to simulate a network of geographically distributed datacenters managed by a company leveraging spatio-temporal load flexibility to achieve 24/7 CFE matching. We isolate three signals relevant for informed use of load flexiblity: varying average quality of renewable energy resources, low correlation between wind power generation over long distances due to different weather conditions, and lags in solar radiation peak due to Earth's rotation. We illustrate that the location of datacenters and the time of year affect which signal drives an effective load-shaping strategy. The energy procurement and load-shifting decisions based on informed use of these signals facilitate the resource-efficiency and cost-effectiveness of clean computing -- the costs of 24/7 CFE are reduced by 1.29$\pm$0.07 EUR/MWh for every additional percentage of flexible load. We provide practical guidelines on how companies with datacenters can leverage spatio-temporal load flexibility for truly clean computing. Our results and the open-source optimization model can also be useful for a broader variety of companies with flexible loads and an interest in eliminating their carbon footprint.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Release of Israel's National Registry of Live Births</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In February 2024, Israel's Ministry of Health released microdata of live births in Israel in 2014. The dataset is based on Israel's National Registry of Live Births and offers substantial value in multiple areas, such as scientific research and policy-making. At the same time, the data was processed so as to protect the privacy of 2014's mothers and newborns. The release was co-designed by the authors together with stakeholders from both inside and outside the Ministry of Health. This paper presents the methodology used to obtain that release. It also describes the considerations involved in choosing the methodology and the process followed.
  We used differential privacy as our formal measure of the privacy loss incurred by the released dataset. More concretely, we prove that the released dataset is differentially private with privacy loss budget \varepsilon = 9.98. We extensively used the private selection algorithm of Liu and Talwar (STOC 2019) to bundle together multiple steps such as data transformation, model generation algorithm, hyperparameter selection, and evaluation. The model generation algorithm selected was PrivBayes (Zhang et al., SIGMOD 2014). The evaluation was based on a list of acceptance criteria, which were also disclosed only approximately so as to provide an overall differential privacy guarantee. We also discuss concrete challenges and barriers that appear relevant to the next steps of this pilot project, as well as to future differentially private releases.</description>

      <title>Global News Synchrony and Diversity During the Start of the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: News coverage profoundly affects how countries and individuals behave in international relations. Yet, we have little empirical evidence of how news coverage varies across countries. To enable studies of global news coverage, we develop an efficient computational methodology that comprises three components: (i) a transformer model to estimate multilingual news similarity; (ii) a global event identification system that clusters news based on a similarity network of news articles; and (iii) measures of news synchrony across countries and news diversity within a country, based on country-specific distributions of news coverage of the global events. Each component achieves state-of-the art performance, scaling seamlessly to massive datasets of millions of news articles. We apply the methodology to 60 million news articles published globally between January 1 and June 30, 2020, across 124 countries and 10 languages, detecting 4357 news events. We identify the factors explaining diversity and synchrony of news coverage across countries. Our study reveals that news media tend to cover a more diverse set of events in countries with larger Internet penetration, more official languages, larger religious diversity, higher economic inequality, and larger populations. Coverage of news events is more synchronized between countries that not only actively participate in commercial and political relations -- such as, pairs of countries with high bilateral trade volume, and countries that belong to the NATO military alliance or BRICS group of major emerging economies -- but also countries that share certain traits: an official language, high GDP, and high democracy indices.</description>

      <title>Web3 and the State: Indian state's redescription of blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article does a close reading of a discussion paper by NITI Aayog and a strategy paper by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) advocating non-financial use cases of blockchain in India. By noting the discursive shift from transparency to trust that grounds these two documents and consequently Indian state's redescription of blockchain, the paper foregrounds how governance by infrastructure is at the heart of new forms of governance and how blockchain systems are being designated as decentral by states to have recentralizing effects. The papers highlight how a mapping of discursive shifts of notions such as trust, transparency, (de)centralization and (dis)intermediation can be a potent site to investigate redescriptions of emerging sociotechnical systems.</description>

      <title>Are Models Biased on Text without Gender-related Language?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gender bias research has been pivotal in revealing undesirable behaviors in large language models, exposing serious gender stereotypes associated with occupations, and emotions. A key observation in prior work is that models reinforce stereotypes as a consequence of the gendered correlations that are present in the training data. In this paper, we focus on bias where the effect from training data is unclear, and instead address the question: Do language models still exhibit gender bias in non-stereotypical settings? To do so, we introduce UnStereoEval (USE), a novel framework tailored for investigating gender bias in stereotype-free scenarios. USE defines a sentence-level score based on pretraining data statistics to determine if the sentence contain minimal word-gender associations. To systematically benchmark the fairness of popular language models in stereotype-free scenarios, we utilize USE to automatically generate benchmarks without any gender-related language. By leveraging USE's sentence-level score, we also repurpose prior gender bias benchmarks (Winobias and Winogender) for non-stereotypical evaluation. Surprisingly, we find low fairness across all 28 tested models. Concretely, models demonstrate fair behavior in only 9%-41% of stereotype-free sentences, suggesting that bias does not solely stem from the presence of gender-related words. These results raise important questions about where underlying model biases come from and highlight the need for more systematic and comprehensive bias evaluation. We release the full dataset and code at https://ucinlp.github.io/unstereo-eval.</description>

      <title>Attention is All They Need: Exploring the Media Archaeology of the Computer Vision Research Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research papers, in addition to textual documents, are a designed interface through which researchers communicate. Recently, rapid growth has transformed that interface in many fields of computing. In this work, we examine the effects of this growth from a media archaeology perspective, through the changes to figures and tables in research papers. Specifically, we study these changes in computer vision over the past decade, as the deep learning revolution has driven unprecedented growth in the discipline. We ground our investigation through interviews with veteran researchers spanning computer vision, graphics and visualization. Our analysis focuses on the research attention economy: how research paper elements contribute towards advertising, measuring and disseminating an increasingly commodified ``contribution.'' Through this work, we seek to motivate future discussion surrounding the design of both the research paper itself as well as the larger sociotechnical research publishing system, including tools for finding, reading and writing research papers.</description>

      <title>Thousands of AI Authors on the Future of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the largest survey of its kind, 2,778 researchers who had published in top-tier artificial intelligence (AI) venues gave predictions on the pace of AI progress and the nature and impacts of advanced AI systems The aggregate forecasts give at least a 50% chance of AI systems achieving several milestones by 2028, including autonomously constructing a payment processing site from scratch, creating a song indistinguishable from a new song by a popular musician, and autonomously downloading and fine-tuning a large language model. If science continues undisrupted, the chance of unaided machines outperforming humans in every possible task was estimated at 10% by 2027, and 50% by 2047. The latter estimate is 13 years earlier than that reached in a similar survey we conducted only one year earlier [Grace et al., 2022]. However, the chance of all human occupations becoming fully automatable was forecast to reach 10% by 2037, and 50% as late as 2116 (compared to 2164 in the 2022 survey).
  Most respondents expressed substantial uncertainty about the long-term value of AI progress: While 68.3% thought good outcomes from superhuman AI are more likely than bad, of these net optimists 48% gave at least a 5% chance of extremely bad outcomes such as human extinction, and 59% of net pessimists gave 5% or more to extremely good outcomes. Between 38% and 51% of respondents gave at least a 10% chance to advanced AI leading to outcomes as bad as human extinction. More than half suggested that "substantial" or "extreme" concern is warranted about six different AI-related scenarios, including misinformation, authoritarian control, and inequality. There was disagreement about whether faster or slower AI progress would be better for the future of humanity. However, there was broad agreement that research aimed at minimizing potential risks from AI systems ought to be prioritized more.</description>

      <title>Regulating AI-Based Remote Biometric Identification. Investigating the Public Demand for Bans, Audits, and Public Database Registrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI is increasingly being used in the public sector, including public security. In this context, the use of AI-powered remote biometric identification (RBI) systems is a much-discussed technology. RBI systems are used to identify criminal activity in public spaces, but are criticised for inheriting biases and violating fundamental human rights. It is therefore important to ensure that such systems are developed in the public interest, which means that any technology that is deployed for public use needs to be scrutinised. While there is a consensus among business leaders, policymakers and scientists that AI must be developed in an ethical and trustworthy manner, scholars have argued that ethical guidelines do not guarantee ethical AI, but rather prevent stronger regulation of AI. As a possible counterweight, public opinion can have a decisive influence on policymakers to establish boundaries and conditions under which AI systems should be used -- if at all. However, we know little about the conditions that lead to regulatory demand for AI systems. In this study, we focus on the role of trust in AI as well as trust in law enforcement as potential factors that may lead to demands for regulation of AI technology. In addition, we explore the mediating effects of discrimination perceptions regarding RBI. We test the effects on four different use cases of RBI varying the temporal aspect (real-time vs. post hoc analysis) and purpose of use (persecution of criminals vs. safeguarding public events) in a survey among German citizens. We found that German citizens do not differentiate between the different modes of application in terms of their demand for RBI regulation. Furthermore, we show that perceptions of discrimination lead to a demand for stronger regulation, while trust in AI and trust in law enforcement lead to opposite effects in terms of demand for a ban on RBI systems.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the Margin: How Capitalism Fuels AI at the Expense of Minoritized Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the intricate relationship between capitalism, racial injustice, and artificial intelligence (AI), arguing that AI acts as a contemporary vehicle for age-old forms of exploitation. By linking historical patterns of racial and economic oppression with current AI practices, this study illustrates how modern technology perpetuates and deepens societal inequalities. It specifically examines how AI is implicated in the exploitation of marginalized communities through underpaid labor in the gig economy, the perpetuation of biases in algorithmic decision-making, and the reinforcement of systemic barriers that prevent these groups from benefiting equitably from technological advances. Furthermore, the paper discusses the role of AI in extending and intensifying the social, economic, and psychological burdens faced by these communities, highlighting the problematic use of AI in surveillance, law enforcement, and mental health contexts. The analysis concludes with a call for transformative changes in how AI is developed and deployed. Advocating for a reevaluation of the values driving AI innovation, the paper promotes an approach that integrates social justice and equity into the core of technological design and policy. This shift is crucial for ensuring that AI serves as a tool for societal improvement, fostering empowerment and healing rather than deepening existing divides.</description>

      <title>Grassroots Social Networking: Where People have Agency over their Personal Information and Social Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13941v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offering an architecture for social networking in which people have agency over their personal information and social graph is an open challenge. Here we present a grassroots architecture for serverless, permissionless, peer-to-peer social networks termed Grassroots Social Networking that aims to address this challenge. The architecture is geared for people with networked smartphones -- roaming (address-changing) computing devices communicating over an unreliable network (e.g., using UDP). The architecture incorporates (i) a decentralized social graph, where each person controls, maintains and stores only their local neighborhood in the graph; (iii) personal feeds, with authors and followers who create and store the feeds; and (ii) a grassroots dissemination protocol, in which communication among people occurs only along the edges of their social graph. The architecture realizes these components using the blocklace data structure -- a partially-ordered conflict-free counterpart of the totally-ordered conflict-based blockchain. We provide two example Grassroots Social Networking protocols -- Twitter-like and WhatsApp-like -- and address their security (safety, liveness and privacy), spam/bot/deep-fake resistance, and implementation, demonstrating how server-based social networks could be supplanted by a grassroots architecture.</description>

      <title>Prediction without Preclusion: Recourse Verification with Reachable Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are often used to decide who receives a loan, a job interview, or a public benefit. Models in such settings use features without considering their actionability. As a result, they can assign predictions that are fixed $-$ meaning that individuals who are denied loans and interviews are, in fact, precluded from access to credit and employment. In this work, we introduce a procedure called recourse verification to test if a model assigns fixed predictions to its decision subjects. We propose a model-agnostic approach for recourse verification with reachable sets $-$ i.e., the set of all points that a person can reach through their actions in feature space. We develop methods to construct reachable sets for discrete feature spaces, which can certify the responsiveness of any model by simply querying its predictions. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the infeasibility of recourse on datasets from consumer finance. Our results highlight how models can inadvertently preclude access by assigning fixed predictions and underscore the need to account for actionability in model development.</description>

      <title>Brilla AI: AI Contestant for the National Science and Maths Quiz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The African continent lacks enough qualified teachers which hampers the provision of adequate learning support. An AI could potentially augment the efforts of the limited number of teachers, leading to better learning outcomes. Towards that end, this work describes and evaluates the first key output for the NSMQ AI Grand Challenge, which proposes a robust, real-world benchmark for such an AI: "Build an AI to compete live in Ghana's National Science and Maths Quiz (NSMQ) competition and win - performing better than the best contestants in all rounds and stages of the competition". The NSMQ is an annual live science and mathematics competition for senior secondary school students in Ghana in which 3 teams of 2 students compete by answering questions across biology, chemistry, physics, and math in 5 rounds over 5 progressive stages until a winning team is crowned for that year. In this work, we built Brilla AI, an AI contestant that we deployed to unofficially compete remotely and live in the Riddles round of the 2023 NSMQ Grand Finale, the first of its kind in the 30-year history of the competition. Brilla AI is currently available as a web app that livestreams the Riddles round of the contest, and runs 4 machine learning systems: (1) speech to text (2) question extraction (3) question answering and (4) text to speech that work together in real-time to quickly and accurately provide an answer, and then say it with a Ghanaian accent. In its debut, our AI answered one of the 4 riddles ahead of the 3 human contesting teams, unofficially placing second (tied). Improvements and extensions of this AI could potentially be deployed to offer science tutoring to students and eventually enable millions across Africa to have one-on-one learning interactions, democratizing science education.</description>

      <title>The Emerging AI Divide in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The digital divide describes disparities in access to and usage of digital tooling between social and economic groups. Emerging generative artificial intelligence tools, which strongly affect productivity, could magnify the impact of these divides. However, the affordability, multi-modality, and multilingual capabilities of these tools could also make them more accessible to diverse users in comparison with previous forms of digital tooling. In this study, we characterize spatial differences in U.S. residents' knowledge of a new generative AI tool, ChatGPT, through an analysis of state- and county-level search query data. In the first six months after the tool's release, we observe the highest rates of users searching for ChatGPT in West Coast states and persistently low rates of search in Appalachian and Gulf states. Counties with the highest rates of search are relatively more urbanized and have proportionally more educated, more economically advantaged, and more Asian residents in comparison with other counties or with the U.S. average. In multilevel models adjusting for socioeconomic and demographic factors as well as industry makeup, education is the strongest positive predictor of rates of search for generative AI tooling. Although generative AI technologies may be novel, early differences in uptake appear to be following familiar paths of digital marginalization.</description>

      <title>Fast Abstracts and Student Forum Proceedings -- EDCC 2024 -- 19th European Dependable Computing Conference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of the Fast Abstracts track is to bring together researchers and practitioners working on dependable computing to discuss work in progress or opinion pieces. Contributions are welcome from academia and industry. Fast Abstracts aim to serve as a rapid and flexible mechanism to: (i) Report on current work that may or may not be complete; (ii) Introduce new ideas to the community; (iii) State positions on controversial issues or open problems; (iv) Share lessons learnt from real-word dependability engineering; and (v) Debunk or question results from other papers based on contra-indications. The Student Forum aims at creating a vibrant and friendly environment where students can present and discuss their work, and exchange ideas and experiences with other students, researchers and industry. One of the key goals of the Forum is to provide students with feedback on their preliminary results that might help with their future research directions.</description>
