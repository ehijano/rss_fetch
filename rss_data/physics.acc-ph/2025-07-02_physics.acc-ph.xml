      <title>Cathodes and Shape Modification of Cavity for DESY Superconducting Photoinjector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four DESY prototypes of the L-band superconducting RF photoinjector cavity demonstrated on-axis peak gradients above 55MV/m during multiple vertical cryogenic tests. Two of these prototypes,16G09 and 16G10, achieved these gradients with both superconducting and normal-conducting metallic cathodes, fabricated from either high-purity niobium or lower-purity copper. The DESY photoinjector, under development for over two decades as a continuous-wave electron source for FELs, differs from other SRF injectors in that its metallic cathode plug is attached directly to the cavity backplate, exposing the emitting surface to the high electric field within the cavity. This design obviates the need for a choke filter or load-lock system. The initial 1.6-cell cavity geometry was derived from the Low-Loss design developed for the CEBAF 12GeV upgrade, scaled from 1.5GHz to 1.3GHz. This shape was later replaced with the current High Gradient TESLA profile. In this report, we discuss current cathode options and present modifications to the cavity shape aimed at significantly reducing the electric field near the cathode opening</description>

      <title>Detuning Properties of RF Phase Modulation in an Electron Storage Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.15555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In electron storage rings, it is possible to increase the bunch length by applying phase modulation to the radio frequency accelerating field by choosing appropriate parameters for the modulation. Such a bunch lengthening effect improves beam parameters such as beam lifetime, which can help us achieve better beam stability. It is well known that the modulation frequency around the double synchrotron frequency is effective in lengthening the bunch. The dependence of bunch lengthening on modulation frequency, the so-called detuning property, has a peak around the double synchrotron frequency with a frequency width that depends on the modulation amplitude. Nonlinear effects due to phase modulation lead to a peak frequency shift in a negative direction from the double synchrotron frequency, accompanied by an asymmetric peak shape. Beam current also affects the properties of the detuning condition of such bunch lengthening. We investigated the detuning property using a theoretical model and systematic measurements at the electron storage ring KARA, and we verified the qualitative agreement between the experiments and the theoretical model. The macro-particle simulations have confirmed the agreement.</description>
