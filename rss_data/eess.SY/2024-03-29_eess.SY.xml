      <title>Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Enhanced Navigation of Autonomous Surface Vessels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes an approach for collision avoidance, path following, and anti-grounding of autonomous surface vessels under consideration of environmental forces based on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). Artificial Potential Fields (APFs) set the foundation for the cost function of the optimal control problem in terms of collision avoidance and anti-grounding. Depending on the risk of a collision given by the resulting force of the APFs, the controller optimizes regarding an adapted heading and travel speed by additionally following a desired path. For this purpose, nonlinear vessel dynamics are used for the NMPC. To extend the situational awareness concerning environmental disturbances impacted by wind, waves, and sea currents, a nonlinear disturbance observer is coupled to the entire NMPC scheme, allowing for the correction of an incorrect vessel motion due to external forces. In addition, the most essential rules according to the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) are considered. The results of the simulations show that the proposed framework can control an autonomous surface vessel under various challenging scenarios, including environmental disturbances, to avoid collisions and follow desired paths.</description>

      <title>GENESIS-RL: GEnerating Natural Edge-cases with Systematic Integration of Safety considerations and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of autonomous systems, the safety and reliability of the system components are fundamental requirements. These components are often vulnerable to complex and unforeseen environments, making natural edge-case generation essential for enhancing system resilience. This paper presents GENESIS-RL, a novel framework that leverages system-level safety considerations and reinforcement learning techniques to systematically generate naturalistic edge cases. By simulating challenging conditions that mimic the real-world situations, our framework aims to rigorously test entire system's safety and reliability. Although demonstrated within the autonomous driving application, our methodology is adaptable across diverse autonomous systems. Our experimental validation, conducted on high-fidelity simulator underscores the overall effectiveness of this framework.</description>

      <title>Real-time accident detection and physiological signal monitoring to enhance motorbike safety and emergency response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid urbanization and improved living standards have led to a substantial increase in the number of vehicles on the road, consequently resulting in a rise in the frequency of accidents. Among these accidents, motorbike accidents pose a particularly high risk, often resulting in serious injuries or deaths. A significant number of these fatalities occur due to delayed or inadequate medical attention. To this end, we propose a novel automatic detection and notification system specifically designed for motorbike accidents. The proposed system comprises two key components: a detection system and a physiological signal monitoring system. The detection system is integrated into the helmet and consists of a microcontroller, accelerometer, GPS, GSM, and Wi-Fi modules. The physio-monitoring system incorporates a sensor for monitoring pulse rate and SpO$_{2}$ saturation. All collected data are presented on an LCD display and wirelessly transmitted to the detection system through the microcontroller of the physiological signal monitoring system. If the accelerometer readings consistently deviate from the specified threshold decided through extensive experimentation, the system identifies the event as an accident and transmits the victim's information -- including the GPS location, pulse rate, and SpO$_{2}$ saturation rate -- to the designated emergency contacts. Preliminary results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system in accurately detecting motorbike accidents and promptly alerting emergency contacts. We firmly believe that the proposed system has the potential to significantly mitigate the risks associated with motorbike accidents and save lives.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Data for Accelerating Model Predictive Control by Constraint Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) solves a receding-horizon optimization problem in real-time, which can be computationally demanding when there are thousands of constraints. To accelerate online computation of MPC, we utilize data to adaptively remove the constraints while maintaining the MPC policy unchanged. Specifically, we design the removal rule based on the Lipschitz continuity of the MPC policy. This removal rule can use the information of historical data according to the Lipschitz constant and the distance between the current state and historical states. In particular, we provide the explicit expression for calculating the Lipschitz constant by the model parameters. Finally, simulations are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic Control of Uncertain Dynamical Systems: Harnessing Synergy Between Fixed-Gain Control and Adaptive Learning Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both fixed-gain control and adaptive learning architectures aim to mitigate the effects of uncertainties. In particular, fixed-gain control offers more predictable closed-loop system behavior but requires the knowledge of uncertainty bounds. In contrast, while adaptive learning does not necessarily require such knowledge, it often results in less predictable closed-loop system behavior compared to fixed-gain control. To this end, this paper presents a novel symbiotic control framework that offers the strengths of fixed-gain control and adaptive learning architectures. Specifically, this framework synergistically integrates these architectures to mitigate the effects of uncertainties in a more predictable manner as compared to adaptive learning alone and it does not require any knowledge on such uncertainties. Both parametric and nonparametric uncertainties are considered, where we utilize neural networks to approximate the unknown uncertainty basis for the latter case. Counterintuitively, the proposed framework has the ability to achieve a desired level of closed-loop system behavior even with an insufficient number of neurons (e.g., when the neural network approximation error is large) or in the face of injudiciously selected adaptive learning parameters (e.g., high leakage term parameters).</description>

      <title>Resilience-Oriented Operation of Micro-Grids in both Grid-Connected and Isolated Conditions within Sustainable Active Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the increasing occurrence of natural disasters, importance of maintaining sustainable energy for cities and society is felt more than ever. On the other hand, power loss reduction is a challenging issue of active distribution networks (ADNs). In this paper, a new convex optimization model is proposed with two objective functions including energy loss reduction in normal operating mode and system load shedding minimization in critical conditions after the occurrence of natural disasters. This purpose is fulfilled through optimal allocation of distributed generation (DG) units from both conventional and renewable types as well as energy storage systems (ESSs). In addition, a new formulation has been derived to form optimal micro-grids (MGs) aiming at energy loss reduction in normal operating condition and resiliency index improvement under emergency situations. The developed model is implemented in GAMS software and the studies have been tested and analyzed on the IEEE 33-bus system. The results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of energy loss reduction as well as resilience enhancement in extreme operation condition following severe disruptions in the system.</description>

      <title>Tunable Superconducting Magnetic Levitation with Self-Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic levitation based on the flux pinning nature of type II superconductors has the merit of self-stability, making it appealing for applications such as high speed bearings, maglev trains, space generators, etc. However, such levitation systems physically rely on the superconductor pre-capturing magnetic flux (i.e. field cooling process) before establishing the levitation state which is nonadjustable afterwards. Moreover, practical type II superconductors in the levitation system inevitably suffer from various sources of energy losses, leading to continuous levitation force decay. These intrinsic drawbacks make superconducting maglev inflexible and impractical for long term operation. Here we propose and demonstrate a new form of superconducting maglev which is tunable and with self-stability. The maglev system uses a closed-loop type II superconducting coil to lock flux of a magnet, establishing self-stable levitation between the two objects. A flux pump is used to modulate the total magnetic flux of the coil without breaking its superconductivity, thus flexibly tuning levitation force and height meanwhile maintaining self-stability. For the first time, we experimentally demonstrate a self-stable type II superconducting maglev system which is able to: counteract long term levitation force decay, adjust levitation force and equilibrium position, and establish levitation under zero field cooling condition. These breakthroughs may bridge the gap between demonstrations and practical applications of type II superconducting maglevs.</description>

      <title>Design and Evaluation of a DC Microgrid Testbed for DER Integration and Power Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a DC microgrid testbed setup that consists of various Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) including solar Photovoltaics (PV), supercapacitors for voltage regulation, and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). The DC microgrid accommodates both non-flexible and flexible loads which can be dynamically adjusted based on PV power availability. The integration of the setup with the Hyphae Autonomous Power Interchange System (APIS) framework automates energy transfer within the BESS, ensuring efficient power management and optimizing the overall efficiency of the DC microgrid. Furthermore, the setup is validated in terms of the efficacy of the proposed model via real-time simulation, facilitated by the Speedgoat baseline real-time target Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) machine. The results demonstrate the model's adeptness in efficiently managing power sharing, emphasizing the capabilities of the DC microgrid setup in terms of performance and reliability in dynamic energy scenarios as well as enhancing the resilience of the grid amidst PV uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Gain-Only Neural Operator Approximators of PDE Backstepping Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the recently introduced deep learning-powered approach to PDE backstepping control, we present an advancement applicable across all the results developed thus far: approximating the control gain function only (a function of one variable), rather than the entire kernel function of the backstepping transformation (a function of two variables). We introduce this idea on a couple benchmark (unstable) PDEs, hyperbolic and parabolic. We alter the approach of quantifying the effect of the approximation error by replacing a backstepping transformation that employs the approximated kernel (suitable for adaptive control) by a transformation that employs the exact kernel (suitable for gain scheduling). A major simplification in the target system arises, with the perturbation due to the approximation shifting from the domain to the boundary condition. This results in a significant difference in the Lyapunov analysis, which nevertheless results in a guarantee of the stability being retained with the simplified approximation approach. The approach of approximating only the control gain function simplifies the operator being approximated and the training of its neural approximation, with an expected reduction in the neural network size. The price for the savings in approximation is paid through a somewhat more intricate Lyapunov analysis, in higher Sobolev spaces for some PDEs, as well as some restrictions on initial conditions that result from higher Sobolev spaces. While the proposed approach appears inapplicable to uses in adaptive control, it is almost certainly applicable in gain scheduling applications of neural operator-approximated PDE backstepping controllers.</description>

      <title>Expectation Maximization Aided Modified Weighted Sequential Energy Detector for Distributed Cooperative Spectrum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed cooperative spectrum sensing usually involves a group of unlicensed secondary users (SUs) collaborating to detect the primary user (PU) in the channel, and thereby opportunistically utilize it without causing interference to the PU. The conventional energy detector (ED) based spectrum sensing ignores the dynamic nature of the PU by using energy statistic only from the present sensing interval for the PU detection. However, for a dynamic PU, previous studies have shown that improved detection capabilities can be achieved by aggregating both present and past energy samples in a test statistic. To this end, a weighted sequential energy detector (WSED) has been proposed, but it is based on aggregating all the collected energy samples over an observation window. For a highly dynamic PU, that involves also combining the outdated samples in the test statistic. In this paper, we propose a modified WSED (mWSED) that uses the primary user states information over the window to aggregate only the highly correlated energy samples in its test statistic. In practice, since the PU states are a priori unknown, we also develop a joint expectation-maximization and Viterbi (EM-Viterbi) algorithm based scheme to iteratively estimate the states by using the energy samples collected over the window. The estimated states are then used in mWSED to compute its test statistics, and the algorithm is referred to here as EM-mWSED. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the states estimation performance of EM-Viterbi and the PU detection performance of EM-mWSED. The results show that, for both highly dynamic as well as slowly time-varying PU, these algorithms outperform the ED and WSED at PU detection, and their performances improve by either increasing the average number of neighbors per SU in the network, or by increasing the SNR or the number of samples per energy statistic.</description>

      <title>Feedback Optimization of Incentives for Distribution Grid Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy prices and net power injection limitations regulate the operations in distribution grids and typically ensure that operational constraints are met. Nevertheless, unexpected or prolonged abnormal events could undermine the grid's functioning. During contingencies, customers could contribute effectively to sustaining the network by providing services. This paper proposes an incentive mechanism that promotes users' active participation by essentially altering the energy pricing rule. The incentives are modeled via a linear function whose parameters can be computed by the system operator (SO) by solving an optimization problem. Feedback-based optimization algorithms are then proposed to seek optimal incentives by leveraging measurements from the grid, even in the case when the SO does not have a full grid and customer information. Numerical simulations on a standard testbed validate the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Lane-Change in Dense Traffic with Model Predictive Control and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an online smooth-path lane-change control framework. We focus on dense traffic where inter-vehicle space gaps are narrow, and cooperation with surrounding drivers is essential to achieve the lane-change maneuver. We propose a two-stage control framework that harmonizes Model Predictive Control (MPC) with Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) by utilizing driving intentions to generate smooth lane-change maneuvers. To improve performance in practice, the system is augmented with an adaptive safety boundary and a Kalman Filter to mitigate sensor noise. Simulation studies are investigated in different levels of traffic density and cooperativeness of other drivers. The simulation results support the effectiveness, driving comfort, and safety of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>SAM-dPCR: Real-Time and High-throughput Absolute Quantification of Biological Samples Using Zero-Shot Segment Anything Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital PCR (dPCR) has revolutionized nucleic acid diagnostics by enabling absolute quantification of rare mutations and target sequences. However, current detection methodologies face challenges, as flow cytometers are costly and complex, while fluorescence imaging methods, relying on software or manual counting, are time-consuming and prone to errors. To address these limitations, we present SAM-dPCR, a novel self-supervised learning-based pipeline that enables real-time and high-throughput absolute quantification of biological samples. Leveraging the zero-shot SAM model, SAM-dPCR efficiently analyzes diverse microreactors with over 97.7% accuracy within a rapid processing time of 3.16 seconds. By utilizing commonly available lab fluorescence microscopes, SAM-dPCR facilitates the quantification of sample concentrations. The accuracy of SAM-dPCR is validated by the strong linear relationship observed between known and inferred sample concentrations. Additionally, SAM-dPCR demonstrates versatility through comprehensive verification using various samples and reactor morphologies. This accessible, cost-effective tool transcends the limitations of traditional detection methods or fully supervised AI models, marking the first application of SAM in nucleic acid detection or molecular diagnostics. By eliminating the need for annotated training data, SAM-dPCR holds great application potential for nucleic acid quantification in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>A New Method for Sensorless Estimation of the Speed and Position in Brushed DC Motors Using Support Vector Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, for many applications, it is necessary to know the speed and position of motors. This can be achieved using mechanical sensors coupled to the motor shaft or using sensorless techniques. The sensorless techniques in brushed dc motors can be classified into two types: 1) techniques based on the dynamic brushed dc motor model and 2) techniques based on the ripple component of the current. This paper presents a new method, based on the ripple component, for speed and position estimation in brushed dc motors, using support vector machines. The proposed method only measures the current and detects the pulses in this signal. The motor speed is estimated by using the inverse distance between the detected pulses, and the position is estimated by counting all detected pulses. The ability to detect ghost pulses and to discard false pulses is the main advantage of this method over other sensorless methods. The performed tests on two fractional horsepower brushed dc motors indicate that the method works correctly in a wide range of speeds and situations, in which the speed is constant or varies dynamically.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Robotics: Tail Risk Measures in Planning, Control, and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need for a systematic approach to risk assessment has increased in recent years due to the ubiquity of autonomous systems that alter our day-to-day experiences and their need for safety, e.g., for self-driving vehicles, mobile service robots, and bipedal robots. These systems are expected to function safely in unpredictable environments and interact seamlessly with humans, whose behavior is notably challenging to forecast. We present a survey of risk-aware methodologies for autonomous systems. We adopt a contemporary risk-aware approach to mitigate rare and detrimental outcomes by advocating the use of tail risk measures, a concept borrowed from financial literature. This survey will introduce these measures and explain their relevance in the context of robotic systems for planning, control, and verification applications.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation in Large Language Model Integrated 6G Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the upcoming 6G era, vehicular networks are shifting from simple Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication to the more complex Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) connectivity. At the forefront of this shift is the incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) into vehicles. Known for their sophisticated natural language processing abilities, LLMs change how users interact with their vehicles. This integration facilitates voice-driven commands and interactions, departing from the conventional manual control systems. However, integrating LLMs into vehicular systems presents notable challenges. The substantial computational demands and energy requirements of LLMs pose significant challenges, especially in the constrained environment of a vehicle. Additionally, the time-sensitive nature of tasks in vehicular networks adds another layer of complexity. In this paper, we consider an edge computing system where vehicles process the initial layers of LLM computations locally, and offload the remaining LLM computation tasks to the Roadside Units (RSUs), envisioning a vehicular ecosystem where LLM computations seamlessly interact with the ultra-low latency and high-bandwidth capabilities of 6G networks. To balance the trade-off between completion time and energy consumption, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize the total cost of the vehicles and RSUs. The problem is then decomposed into two sub-problems, which are solved by sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method and fractional programming technique. The simulation results clearly indicate that the algorithm we have proposed is highly effective in reducing both the completion time and energy consumption of the system.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Symmetry in Dynamics for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Asymmetric Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work in reinforcement learning has leveraged symmetries in the model to improve sample efficiency in training a policy. A commonly used simplifying assumption is that the dynamics and reward both exhibit the same symmetry. However, in many real-world environments, the dynamical model exhibits symmetry independent of the reward model: the reward may not satisfy the same symmetries as the dynamics. In this paper, we investigate scenarios where only the dynamics are assumed to exhibit symmetry, extending the scope of problems in reinforcement learning and learning in control theory where symmetry techniques can be applied. We use Cartan's moving frame method to introduce a technique for learning dynamics which, by construction, exhibit specified symmetries. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that the proposed method learns a more accurate dynamical model.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Time-Varying Optimization via Derivative Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization algorithms have a rich and fundamental relationship with ordinary differential equations given by its continuous-time limit. When the cost function varies with time -- typically in response to a dynamically changing environment -- online optimization becomes a continuous-time trajectory tracking problem. To accommodate these time variations, one typically requires some inherent knowledge about their nature such as a time derivative.
  In this paper, we propose a novel construction and analysis of a continuous-time derivative estimation scheme based on "dirty-derivatives", and show how it naturally interfaces with continuous-time optimization algorithms using the language of ISS (Input-to-State Stability). More generally, we show how a simple Lyapunov redesign technique leads to provable suboptimality guarantees when composing this estimator with any well-behaved optimization algorithm for time-varying costs.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary State Transition of Open Qubit System Based on Switching Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a switching control strategy based on Lyapunov control for arbitrary state transitions in open qubit systems. With coherent vector representation, we propose a switching control strategy, which can prevent the state of the qubit from entering invariant sets and singular value sets, effectively driving the system ultimately to a sufficiently small neighborhood of target states. In comparison to existing works, this control strategy relaxes the strict constraints on system models imposed by special target states. Furthermore, we identify conditions under which the open qubit system achieves finite-time stability (FTS) and finite-time contractive stability (FTCS), respectively. This represents a critical improvement in quantum state transitions, especially considering the asymptotic stability of arbitrary target states is unattainable in open quantum systems. The effectiveness of our proposed method is convincingly demonstrated through its application in a qubit system affected by various types of decoherence, including amplitude, dephasing and polarization decoherence.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Preload Control of Cable-Driven Parallel Robots for Handling Task</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for dynamic adjustment of cable preloads based on the actuation redundancy of \acp{CDPR}, which allows increasing or decreasing the platform stiffness depending on task requirements. This is achieved by computing preload parameters with an extended nullspace formulation of the kinematics. The method facilitates the operator's ability to specify a defined preload within the operation space. The algorithms are implemented in a real-time environment, allowing for the use of optimization in hybrid position-force control. To validate the effectiveness of this approach, a simulation study is performed, and the obtained results are compared to existing methods. Furthermore, the method is investigated experimentally and compared with the conventional position-controlled operation of a cable robot. The results demonstrate the feasibility of adaptively adjusting cable preloads during platform motion and manipulation of additional objects.</description>

      <title>Rapid nonlinear convex guidance via overparameterized monomial coordinates and fundamental solution expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework by which the nonlinear trajectory optimization problem is posed as a path-planning problem in a space liberated of dynamics. In this space, general state constraints for continuous and impulsive control problems are encoded as linear constraints on the native overparameterized variables. This framework is enabled by nonlinear expansion in the vicinity of a reference in terms of fundamental solutions and a minimal nonlinear basis of mixed monomials in problem initial conditions. The former can be computed using state transition tensors, differential algebra, or analytic approaches, and the latter is computed analytically. Nonlinear guidance schemes are proposed taking advantage of this framework, including a successive convex programming scheme for delta-V minimizing trajectory optimization. This work enables a stable and highly rapid nonlinear guidance implementation without the need for collocation or real-time integration.</description>

      <title>A noise-tolerant, resource-saving probabilistic binary neural network implemented by the SOT-MRAM compute-in-memory system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a spin-orbit torque(SOT) magnetoresistive random-access memory(MRAM)-based probabilistic binary neural network(PBNN) for resource-saving and hardware noise-tolerant computing applications. With the presence of thermal fluctuation, the non-destructive SOT-driven magnetization switching characteristics lead to a random weight matrix with controllable probability distribution. In the meanwhile, the proposed CIM architecture allows for the concurrent execution of the probabilistic vector-matrix multiplication (PVMM) and binarization. Furthermore, leveraging the effectiveness of random binary cells to propagate multi-bit probabilistic information, our SOT-MRAM-based PBNN system achieves a 97.78\% classification accuracy under a 7.01\% weight variation on the MNIST database through 10 sampling cycles, and the number of bit-level computation operations is reduced by a factor of 6.9 compared to that of the full-precision LeNet-5 network. Our work provides a compelling framework for the design of reliable neural networks tailored to the applications with low power consumption and limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>Fisher-Rao Gradient Flows of Linear Programs and State-Action Natural Policy Gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kakade's natural policy gradient method has been studied extensively in the last years showing linear convergence with and without regularization. We study another natural gradient method which is based on the Fisher information matrix of the state-action distributions and has received little attention from the theoretical side. Here, the state-action distributions follow the Fisher-Rao gradient flow inside the state-action polytope with respect to a linear potential. Therefore, we study Fisher-Rao gradient flows of linear programs more generally and show linear convergence with a rate that depends on the geometry of the linear program. Equivalently, this yields an estimate on the error induced by entropic regularization of the linear program which improves existing results. We extend these results and show sublinear convergence for perturbed Fisher-Rao gradient flows and natural gradient flows up to an approximation error. In particular, these general results cover the case of state-action natural policy gradients.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of a Class of Large-Scale Systems of Linear Hyperbolic PDEs via Continuum Approximation of Exact Backstepping Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish that stabilization of a class of linear, hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with a large (nevertheless finite) number of components, can be achieved via employment of a backstepping-based control law, which is constructed for stabilization of a continuum version (i.e., as the number of components tends to infinity) of the PDE system. This is achieved by proving that the exact backstepping kernels, constructed for stabilization of the large-scale system, can be approximated (in certain sense such that exponential stability is preserved) by the backstepping kernels constructed for stabilization of a continuum version (essentially an infinite ensemble) of the original PDE system. The proof relies on construction of a convergent sequence of backstepping kernels that is defined such that each kernel matches the exact backstepping kernels (derived based on the original, large-scale system), in a piecewise constant manner with respect to an ensemble variable; while showing that they satisfy the continuum backstepping kernel equations. We present a numerical example that reveals that complexity of computation of stabilizing backstepping kernels may not scale with the number of components of the PDE state, when the kernels are constructed on the basis of the continuum version, in contrast to the case in which they are constructed on the basis of the original, large-scale system. In addition, we formally establish the connection between the solutions to the large-scale system and its continuum counterpart. Thus, this approach can be useful for design of computationally tractable, stabilizing backstepping-based control laws for large-scale PDE systems.</description>

      <title>Situation Awareness for Driver-Centric Driving Style Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is evidence that the driving style of an autonomous vehicle is important to increase the acceptance and trust of the passengers. The driving situation has been found to have a significant influence on human driving behavior. However, current driving style models only partially incorporate driving environment information, limiting the alignment between an agent and the given situation. Therefore, we propose a situation-aware driving style model based on different visual feature encoders pretrained on fleet data, as well as driving behavior predictors, which are adapted to the driving style of a specific driver. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms static driving styles significantly and forms plausible situation clusters. Furthermore, we found that feature encoders pretrained on our dataset lead to more precise driving behavior modeling. In contrast, feature encoders pretrained supervised and unsupervised on different data sources lead to more specific situation clusters, which can be utilized to constrain and control the driving style adaptation for specific situations. Moreover, in a real-world setting, where driving style adaptation is happening iteratively, we found the MLP-based behavior predictors achieve good performance initially but suffer from catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, behavior predictors based on situationdependent statistics can learn iteratively from continuous data streams by design. Overall, our experiments show that important information for driving behavior prediction is contained within the visual feature encoder. The dataset is publicly available at huggingface.co/datasets/jHaselberger/SADC-Situation-Awareness-for-Driver-Centric-Driving-Style-Adaptation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a robust disturbance observer framework for maritime autonomous surface vessels considering model and measurement uncertainties. The core contribution lies in a nonlinear disturbance observer, reconstructing the forces on a vessel impacted by the environment. For this purpose, mappings are found leading to synchronized global exponentially stable error dynamics. With the stability theory of Lyapunov, it is proven that the error converges exponentially into a ball, even if the disturbances are highly dynamic. Since measurements are affected by noise and physical models can be erroneous, an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is used to generate more reliable state estimations. In addition, a noise estimator is introduced, which approximates the noise strength. Depending on the severity of the measurement noise, the observed disturbances are filtered through a cascaded structure consisting of a weighted moving average (WMA) filter, a UKF, and the proposed disturbance observer. To investigate the capability of this observer framework, the environmental disturbances are simulated dynamically under consideration of different model and measurement uncertainties. It can be seen that the observer framework can approximate dynamical forces on a vessel impacted by the environment despite using a low measurement sampling rate, an erroneous model, and noisy measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The retrodirective antenna array is considered as a mechanism to enable target tracking of a power receiver for long range wireless power transfer (WPT) due to its simplicity in implementation using only analog circuits. By installing the retrodirective capability on both the generator and rectenna arrays, a feedback loop that produces a high efficiency WPT channel is created. In this paper, we characterize the dynamics of this phenomenon using a discrete-time state-space model based on S-parameters and show that the system can naturally achieve maximum theoretical WPT efficiency. We further confirmed the theoretical analysis through a hardware experiment using a 12-port circuit board with measurable S-parameters mimicking a static wireless channel. The results collected from the hardware experiment show agreement with the proposed theoretical framework by comparing the theoretical efficiency with the measured efficiency and by showing that the collected data points follow the predicted condition to achieve maximum efficiency.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a (control) barrier function synthesis and safety verification scheme for interconnected nonlinear systems based on assume-guarantee contracts (AGC) and sum-of-squares (SOS) techniques. It is well-known that the SOS approach does not scale well for barrier function synthesis for high-dimensional systems. In this paper, we show that compositional methods like AGC can mitigate this problem. We formulate the synthesis problem into a set of small-size problems, which constructs local contracts for subsystems, and propose a negotiation scheme among the subsystems at the contract level. The proposed scheme is then implemented numerically on two examples: vehicle platooning and room temperature regulation.</description>

      <title>Safe Collective Control under Noisy Inputs and Competing Constraints via Non-Smooth Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of safely coordinating ensembles of identical autonomous agents to conduct complex missions with conflicting safety requirements and under noisy control inputs. Using non-smooth control barrier functions (CBFs) and stochastic model-predictive control as springboards, and by adopting an extrinsic approach where the ensemble is treated as a unified dynamic entity, we devise a method to synthesize safety-aware control inputs for uncertain collectives. Drawing upon stochastic CBF theory and recent developments in Boolean CBF composition, our method proceeds by smoothing a Boolean-composed CBF and solving a stochastic optimization problem where each agent's forcing term is restricted to the affine subspace of control inputs certified by the combined CBF. For the smoothing step, we employ a polynomial approximation scheme, providing evidence for its advantage in generating more conservative yet sufficiently-filtered control inputs than the smoother but more aggressive equivalents produced from an approximation technique based on the log-sum-exp function. To further demonstrate the utility of the proposed method, we present an upper bound for the expected CBF approximation error, along with results from simulations of a single-integrator collective under velocity perturbations. Lastly, we compare these results with those obtained using a naive state-feedback controller lacking safety filters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07039v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-optimal control for high-order chain-of-integrators systems with full state constraints and arbitrarily given terminal states remains a challenging problem in the optimal control theory domain, yet to be resolved. To enhance further comprehension of the problem, this paper establishes a novel notation system and theoretical framework, providing the switching manifold for high-order problems in the form of switching laws. Through deriving properties of switching laws regarding signs and dimension, this paper proposes a definite condition for time-optimal control. Guided by the developed theory, a trajectory planning method named the manifold-intercept method (MIM) is developed. The proposed MIM can plan time-optimal jerk-limited trajectories with full state constraints, and can also plan near-optimal non-chattering higher-order trajectories with negligible extra motion time compared to optimal profiles. Numerical results indicate that the proposed MIM outperforms all baselines in computational time, computational accuracy, and trajectory quality by a large gap.</description>

Abstract: The operation of water distribution networks is a complex procedure aimed at efficiently delivering consumers with adequate water quantity while ensuring its safe quality. An added challenge is the dependency of the water quality dynamics on the system's hydraulics, which influences the performance of the water quality controller. Prior research has addressed either solving the optimum operational hydraulic setting problem or regulating the water quality dynamics as separate problems. Additionally, there have been efforts to couple these two problems and solve one compact problem resulting in trade-offs between the contradictory objectives. In contrast, this paper examines the dependency and influence from a control-theoretic standpoint. More specifically, we explore the influence of accountability for water quality controllability improvement when addressing the pump scheduling problem. We examine its effects on the cumulative cost of the interconnected systems as well as the subsequent performance of the water quality controller. To achieve this, we develop a framework that incorporates different controllability metrics within the operational hydraulic optimization problem; its aim is attaining an adequate level of water quality control across the system. We assess the aforementioned aspects' performance on various scaled networks with a wide range of numerical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preservation by Intermittent Transmission in Cooperative LQG Control Systems</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a cooperative linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control system with a single user and a server. In this system, the user runs a process and employs the server to meet the needs of computation. However, the user regards its state trajectories as privacy. Therefore, we propose a privacy scheme, in which the user sends data to the server intermittently. By this scheme, the server's received information of the user is reduced, and consequently the user's privacy is preserved. In this paper, we consider a periodic transmission scheme. We analyze the performance of privacy preservation and LQG control of different transmission periods. Under the given threshold of the control performance loss, a trade-off optimization problem is proposed. Finally, we give the solution to the optimization problem.</description>

      <title>FPGA-Based Neural Thrust Controller for UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has improved a variety of fields by providing a versatile, cost-effective and accessible platform for implementing state-of-the-art algorithms. To accomplish a broader range of tasks, there is a growing need for enhanced on-board computing to cope with increasing complexity and dynamic environmental conditions. Recent advances have seen the application of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), particularly in combination with Reinforcement Learning (RL), to improve the adaptability and performance of UAVs, especially in unknown environments. However, the computational requirements of DNNs pose a challenge to the limited computing resources available on many UAVs. This work explores the use of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) as a viable solution to this challenge, offering flexibility, high performance, energy and time efficiency. We propose a novel hardware board equipped with an Artix-7 FPGA for a popular open-source micro-UAV platform. We successfully validate its functionality by implementing an RL-based low-level controller using real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>gatekeeper: Online Safety Verification and Control for Nonlinear Systems in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the gatekeeper algorithm, a real-time and computationally-lightweight method that ensures that trajectories of a nonlinear system satisfy safety constraints despite sensing limitations. gatekeeper integrates with existing path planners and feedback controllers by introducing an additional verification step to ensure that proposed trajectories can be executed safely, despite nonlinear dynamics subject to bounded disturbances, input constraints and partial knowledge of the environment. Our key contribution is that (A) we propose an algorithm to recursively construct safe trajectories by numerically forward propagating the system over a (short) finite horizon, and (B) we prove that tracking such a trajectory ensures the system remains safe for all future time, i.e., beyond the finite horizon. We demonstrate the method in a simulation of a dynamic firefighting mission, and in physical experiments of a quadrotor navigating in an obstacle environment that is sensed online. We also provide comparisons against the state-of-the-art techniques for similar problems.</description>

      <title>Streaming quantum gate set tomography using the extended Kalman filter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Closed-loop control algorithms for real-time calibration of quantum processors require efficient filters that can estimate physical error parameters based on streams of measured quantum circuit outcomes. Development of such filters is complicated by the highly nonlinear relationship relationship between observed circuit outcomes and the magnitudes of elementary errors. In this work, we apply the extended Kalman filter to data from quantum gate set tomography to provide a streaming estimator of the both the system error model and its uncertainties. Our numerical examples indicate extended Kalman filtering can achieve similar performance to maximum likelihood estimation, but with dramatically lower computational cost. With our method, a standard laptop can process one- and two-qubit circuit outcomes and update gate set error model at rates comparable with current experimental execution.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Distributed Estimation and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15865v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study distributed estimation and learning problems in a networked environment where agents exchange information to estimate unknown statistical properties of random variables from their privately observed samples. The agents can collectively estimate the unknown quantities by exchanging information about their private observations, but they also face privacy risks. Our novel algorithms extend the existing distributed estimation literature and enable the participating agents to estimate a complete sufficient statistic from private signals acquired offline or online over time and to preserve the privacy of their signals and network neighborhoods. This is achieved through linear aggregation schemes with adjusted randomization schemes that add noise to the exchanged estimates subject to differential privacy (DP) constraints, both in an offline and online manner. We provide convergence rate analysis and tight finite-time convergence bounds. We show that the noise that minimizes the convergence time to the best estimates is the Laplace noise, with parameters corresponding to each agent's sensitivity to their signal and network characteristics. Our algorithms are amenable to dynamic topologies and balancing privacy and accuracy trade-offs. Finally, to supplement and validate our theoretical results, we run experiments on real-world data from the US Power Grid Network and electric consumption data from German Households to estimate the average power consumption of power stations and households under all privacy regimes and show that our method outperforms existing first-order, privacy-aware, distributed optimization methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Legged robots exhibit significant potential across diverse applications, including but not limited to hazardous environment search and rescue missions and the exploration of unexplored regions both on Earth and in outer space. However, the successful navigation of these robots in dynamic environments heavily hinges on the implementation of efficient collision avoidance techniques. In this research paper, we employ Collision Cone Control Barrier Functions (C3BF) to ensure the secure movement of legged robots within environments featuring a wide array of static and dynamic obstacles. We introduce the Quadratic Program (QP) formulation of C3BF, referred to as C3BF-QP, which serves as a protective filter layer atop a reference controller to ensure the robots' safety during operation. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through simulations conducted on PyBullet.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Regression on Sparse and Noisy Data with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of deriving dynamical models from sparse and noisy data. High-quality data is crucial for symbolic regression algorithms; limited and noisy data can present modeling challenges. To overcome this, we combine Gaussian process regression with a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method to denoise the data and identify nonlinear dynamical equations. Our simple approach offers improved robustness with sparse, noisy data compared to SINDy alone. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a Lotka-Volterra model, a unicycle dynamic model in simulation, and hardware data from an NVIDIA JetRacer system. We show superior performance over baselines including 20.78% improvement over SINDy and 61.92% improvement over SSR in predicting future trajectories from discovered dynamics.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Recurrent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose real-time recurrent reinforcement learning (RTRRL), a biologically plausible approach to solving discrete and continuous control tasks in partially-observable markov decision processes (POMDPs). RTRRL consists of three parts: (1) a Meta-RL RNN architecture, implementing on its own an actor-critic algorithm; (2) an outer reinforcement learning algorithm, exploiting temporal difference learning and dutch eligibility traces to train the Meta-RL network; and (3) random-feedback local-online (RFLO) learning, an online automatic differentiation algorithm for computing the gradients with respect to parameters of the network.Our experimental results show that by replacing the optimization algorithm in RTRRL with the biologically implausible back propagation through time (BPTT), or real-time recurrent learning (RTRL), one does not improve returns, while matching the computational complexity for BPTT, and even increasing complexity for RTRL. RTRRL thus serves as a model of learning in biological neural networks, mimicking reward pathways in the basal ganglia.</description>

      <title>Johnsen-Rahbek Capstan Clutch: A High Torque Electrostatic Clutch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many robotic systems, the holding state consumes power, limits operating time, and increases operating costs. Electrostatic clutches have the potential to improve robotic performance by generating holding torques with low power consumption. A key limitation of electrostatic clutches has been their low specific shear stresses which restrict generated holding torque, limiting many applications. Here we show how combining the Johnsen-Rahbek (JR) effect with the exponential tension scaling capstan effect can produce clutches with the highest specific shear stress in the literature. Our system generated 31.3 N/cm^2 sheer stress and a total holding torque of 7.1 Nm while consuming only 2.5 mW/cm^2 at 500 V. We demonstrate a theoretical model of an electrostatic adhesive capstan clutch and demonstrate how large angle (theta &gt; 2pi) designs increase efficiency over planar or small angle (theta &lt; pi) clutch designs. We also report the first unfilled polymeric material, polybenzimidazole (PBI), to exhibit the JR-effect.</description>

      <title>Saturability of the Quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao Bound in Multiparameter Quantum Estimation at the Single-Copy Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (QCRB) as the ultimate lower bound for precision in quantum parameter estimation is only known to be saturable in the multiparameter setting in special cases and under conditions such as full or average commutavity of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives (SLDs) associated with the parameters. Moreover, for general mixed states, collective measurements over infinitely many identical copies of the quantum state are generally required to attain the QCRB. In the important and experimentally relevant single-copy scenario, a necessary condition for saturating the QCRB in the multiparameter setting for general mixed states is the so-called partial commutativity condition on the SLDs. However, it is not known if this condition is also sufficient. This paper establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for saturability of the multiparameter QCRB in the single-copy setting in terms of the commutativity of a set of projected SLDs and the existence of a unitary solution to a system of nonlinear partial differential equations. New necessary conditions that imply partial commutativity are also obtained, which together with another condition become sufficient. Moreover, when the sufficient conditions are satisfied an optimal measurement saturating the QCRB can be chosen to be projective and explicitly characterized. An example is developed to illustrate the case of a multiparameter quantum state where the conditions derived herein are satisfied and can be explicitly verified.</description>

      <title>Chattering Phenomena in Time-Optimal Control for High-Order Chain-of-Integrators Systems with Full State Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-optimal control for high-order chain-of-integrators systems with full state constraints and arbitrary given terminal states remains an open and challenging problem in optimal control theory domain. However, optimal control's behaviors in high-order problems lack of precision characterization, even where the existence of chattering phenomena remain unknown and overlooked. This paper establishes a theoretical framework of chattering phenomena in the problem, focusing on the uniqueness of state constraints inducing chattering, the upper bound of switching times in an unconstrained arc during chattering, and the convergence of states and costates to the chattering limit point. For the first time, this paper proves the existence of chattering phenomena in the problems. The chattering optimal control for 4th order problems with velocity constraints is precisely solved, providing an approach to plan strictly time-optimal snap-limited trajectories, while other cases of order $n\leq4$ are proved to not allow chattering. The conclusions correct the longstanding misconception in the industry regarding the time-optimality of S-shaped trajectories with minimal switching times.</description>
