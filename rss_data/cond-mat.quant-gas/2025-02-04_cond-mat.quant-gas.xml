      <title>A neutral-atom Hubbard quantum simulator in the cryogenic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics and the study of strongly-correlated quantum materials. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems beyond the reach of current numerical techniques. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically and so explored using the quantum simulator itself. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling no unbiased numerical simulation is available. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to significantly below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</description>

      <title>Vacancy-assisted superfluid drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study superfluid drag in the two-component, two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with infinitely strong repulsive interactions. We demonstrate, with a combination of analytic and numeric techniques, that the motion of holes leads to strong dissipationless coupling between currents in the two components. We show that this behavior is attributable to polaronic correlations that emerge in the presence of spin currents, and which can be observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Fractional vorticity, Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield systems and complex structures for the (generalized) spinor Gross-Pitaevskii equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (generalized) Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for a complex scalar field in two spatial dimensions is analyzed. It is shown that there is an infinite family of self-interaction potentials which admit Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bounds together with the corresponding first-order BPS systems. For each member of this family, the solutions of the first-order BPS systems are automatically solutions of the corresponding second-order generalized GPE. The simplest topologically non-trivial solutions of these first-order BPS systems describe configurations with quantized fractional vorticity. The corresponding fraction is related to the degree of non-linearity. The case in which the self-interaction potential is of order six (namely $|\Psi|^{6}$, which is a relevant theory both in relativistic quantum field theories in $(2+1)$ dimensions in connection with the quantum Hall effect as well as in the theory of the supersolids) is analyzed in detail. Such formalism can also be extended to the case of quantum mixtures with multi-component GPEs. The relationship between these techniques and supersymmetry will be discussed. In particular, despite several standard features, we will show that there are multi-component GPEs that are not supersymmetric (at least, not in the standard sense) and possess a BPS system of the above type.</description>

      <title>Structural Dynamics and Strong Correlations in Dynamical Quantum Optical Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When placing an ultracold atomic gas inside a cavity, the light-matter coupling is enhanced and nonlinear atomic dynamics are generated, offering a promising platform for quantum simulation of models with short- and long-range interactions. Recently, superradiant self organized phases for ultracold atomic gases inside a cavity, pumped by a blue detuned optical lattice, have been observed. Here, we explore the formation of quantum many-body phases with strongly interacting bosonic atoms inside an optical cavity, subject to transverse blue detuned pumping. We analyze the interplay between superradiant self-organization with superfluid and Mott insulator phases, without the need of including higher lying bands, as the Wannier functions are dynamically linked to the cavity light via backaction. We observe different kinds of structural phase transitions driven by the light inside the cavity and the interplay with atomic collisions. We observe the mode softening at the critical points in the quantum phase transitions which can be measured in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Doped resonating valence bond states: How robust are the spin ice phases in 3D Rydberg arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg blockade effect provides a convenient platform for simulating locally constrained many-body systems, such as quantum dimer models and quantum loop models, especially their novel phases like topological orders and gapless quantum spin ice (QSI) phases. To discuss the possible phase diagram containing different QSIs in 3D Rydberg arrays, here, we have constructed an extended Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonian with equal-weight-superposition ground state in different fillings at the RK point. Therefore, both the perfect QSIs with fixed local dimer filling and their monomer-doped states can be simulated directly by Monte Carlo sampling. Using single mode approximation, the excitations of dimers and monomers have also been explored in different fillings. We find that, in the thermodynamical limit, even doping a small amount of monomers can disrupt the topological structure and lead to the existence of off-diagonal long-range order. However, in a finite size (as in cold-atom experiment), the property of QSI will be kept in a certain region like a crossover after doping. The phase diagram containing different QSIs and off-diagonal order phases is proposed.</description>

      <title>Surface tension of Bose-Einstein condensate at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the influence of nonzero temperature on a bounded surface of a dilute Bose gas confined by a hard wall, utilizing the Gross-Pitaevskii theory and the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation to describe surface excitations. The theoretical calculations are compared with experimental data for liquid helium II, demonstrating excellent agreement. An empirical relation is found for the temperature-dependence of the surface tension. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the contribution of surface excitations remains below 0.7\% in the most of recent experiments on Bose-Einstein condensate.</description>

      <title>Binary Bosonic Mixtures with Pair Hopping in Synthetic Dimension: Phase Transitions and Demixing Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the cluster Gutzwiller mean-field method to investigate the ground-state phase diagrams and demixing effects in binary boson mixtures with pair hopping in synthetic dimensions. Our study reveals two novel interspecies paired superfluid phases: the paired super-counter-fluid (PSCF) phase, featuring pairs of two particles of one species and two holes of the other, and the SCF* phase, which combines PSCF and super-counter-fluid (SCF) orders. These phases provide new insights into XY ferromagnet states from a pseudo-spin perspective, with SCF* and PSCF states corresponding to different XY ferromagnet phases depending on particle filling. We also identify a quantum quadruple critical point in the interexchange asymmetric case. Importantly, we demonstrate that the mixed-demixed critical point is phase-dependent due to pairing hopping, differing from normal two-component bosonic systems. Experimental schemes to observe these novel phases are proposed.</description>

      <title>Optimizing lossy state preparation for quantum sensing using Hamiltonian engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most prominent platforms for demonstrating quantum sensing below the standard quantum limit is the spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. While a quantum advantage using several tens of thousands of atoms has been demonstrated in this platform, it faces an important challenge: atom loss. Atom loss is a Markovian error process modelled by Lindblad jump operators, and a no-go theorem, which we also show here, stating that the loss of atoms in all spin components reduces the quantum advantage to a constant factor. Here, we show that this no-go theorem can be circumvented if we constrain atom losses to a single spin component. Moreover, we show that in this case, the maximum quantum Fisher information with $N$ atoms scales as $N^{3/2}$, establishing that a scalable quantum advantage can be achieved despite atom loss. Although Lindblad jump operators are generally non-Hermitian and non-invertible, we use their Moore-Penrose inverse to develop a framework for constructing several states with this scaling of Fisher information in the presence of losses. We use Hamiltonian engineering with realistic Hamiltonians to develop experimental protocols for preparing these states. Finally, we discuss possible experimental techniques to constrain the losses to a single spin mode.</description>

      <title>Semi-group influence matrices for non-equilibrium quantum impurity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for describing the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity models out of equilibrium which is based on the influence matrix approach. By replacing the dynamical map of a large fermionic quantum environment with an effective semi-group influence matrix (SGIM) which acts on a reduced auxiliary space, we overcome the limitations of previous proposals, achieving high accuracy at long evolution times. This SGIM corresponds to a uniform matrix-product state representation of the influence matrix and can be obtained by an efficient algorithm presented in this paper. We benchmark this approach by computing the spectral function of the single impurity Anderson model with high resolution. Further, the spectrum of the effective dynamical map allows us to obtain relaxation rates of the impurity towards equilibrium following a quantum quench. Finally, for a quantum impurity model with on-site two-fermion loss, we compute the spectral function and confirm the emergence of Kondo physics at large loss rates.</description>

      <title>Universal fluctuations of localized two interacting particles in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the universal fluctuations of localized wavefunction in the Fock space of two interacting particles in one-dimensional disordered systems, focusing on the interplay between random potentials and random long-range interactions. By mapping the system onto a directed polymer problem, we show that random potentials alone produce correlated energies for the sites in the Fock space, giving rise to the fluctuation growth exponent 1/2. Introducing random long-range interactions alters these correlations and drives the system's fluctuations into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in (1+1)D with the exponent 1/3. To validate the universality of the observed fluctuation scaling, we study a complex directed polymer model with competing point and columnar disorder. Our results confirm that columnar disorder corresponds to on-site energies in the Fock space from the random potentials, while point disorder models the effects of random long-range interactions between the two particles. These findings provide new insights into the Fock-space perspective for examining disordered quantum many-body systems, and emphasize the critical role of disorder structure in determining the universality class of fluctuations in localized quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Stabilizerness of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-stabilizerness or quantum magic of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($\rm SYK$) model, a prototype example of maximally chaotic quantum matter. We show that the Majorana spectrum of its ground state, encoding the spreading of the state in the Majorana basis, displays a Gaussian distribution as expected for chaotic quantum many-body systems. We compare our results with the case of the $\rm SYK_2$ model, describing non-chaotic random free fermions, and show that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively different in the two cases, featuring an exponential Laplace distribution for the $\rm SYK_2$ model rather than a Gaussian. From the spectrum we extract the stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) and show that for both models it displays a linear scaling with system size, with a prefactor that is larger for the SYK model, which has therefore higher magic. Finally, we discuss the spreading of quantun magic under unitary dynamics, as described by the evolution of the Majorana spectrum and the stabilizer Renyi Entropy starting from a stabilizer state. We show that the SRE for the $\rm SYK_2$ model equilibrates rapidly, but that in the steady-state the interacting chaotic SYK model has more magic than the simple $\rm SYK_2$. Our results therefore suggest that non-stabilizerness allows to sharply detect many-body quantum chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes play a prominent role in relaxation of diverse physical systems to equilibria, ranging from astrophysical black holes to tiny droplets of quark-gluon plasma at RHIC and LHC accelerators. We propose that a novel kind of quasinormal modes govern the direct approach to self-similar time evolution of nonthermal fixed points, whose relevance ranges from high energy physics to cold atom gases. We utilize black hole perturbation theory techniques to compute the spectrum of these far from equilibrium quasinormal modes for a kinetic theory with a Focker-Planck collision kernel in isotropic and homogeneous states. Our conclusion is that quasinormal modes of nonthermal fixed points give rise to a tower of progressively more decaying power-law contributions. A byproduct of our analysis is a precise determination and improved understanding of the distribution function characterizing nonthermal fixed points.</description>

      <title>SU(N) magnetism with ultracold molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry are paradigmatic settings for quantum many-body physics. They have been studied for the insights they provide into complex materials and their ability to stabilize exotic ground states. Ultracold alkaline-earth atoms were predicted to exhibit SU($N$) symmetry for $N=2I+1=1,2,\ldots,10$, where $I$ is the nuclear spin. Subsequent experiments have revealed rich many-body physics. However, alkaline-earth atoms realize this symmetry only for fermions with repulsive interactions. In this paper, we predict that ultracold molecules shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields or microwaves exhibit SU($N$) symmetry, which holds because deviations of the s-wave scattering length from the spin-free values are only about 3\% for CaF with static-field shielding and are estimated to be even smaller for bialkali molecules. They open the door to $N$ as large as $32$ for bosons and $36$ for fermions. They offer important features unachievable with atoms, including bosonic systems and attractive interactions.</description>

      <title>Two-component droplet phases and their spectral stability in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We unravel the existence and stability properties of one-dimensional droplets arising in genuine two-component particle imbalanced bosonic mixtures under the influence of a weak harmonic confinement. A plethora of miscible droplet phases is found with the majority component atoms in the vicinity of the minority ones assembling in a droplet configuration while the remaining excess atoms being in the gas state. Our computations identify a transition from a bound to a trapped gas many-body state for increasing total atom number and fixed interactions, with the bound character being prolonged for stronger intercomponent attractions. Spectral stability of these two-component droplets is revealed by examining their underlying Bogoliubov-de-Gennes excitation spectrum. Furthermore, the collective dynamics associated with the fundamental dipole and breathing modes of the system is monitored by suddenly shifting the trap's center or quenching the trap's frequency, respectively. There, a back action of the significantly localized minority component is imprinted in the majority cloud. The present findings can be simulated in recent cold-atom experiments, thus setting the stage for probing the complex nonequilibrium dynamics of two-component droplets.</description>

      <title>Automated Graph-Based Detection of Quantum Control Schemes: Application to Molecular Laser Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the demanding frontiers in ultracold quantum science is identifying laser cooling schemes for complex atoms and molecules out of their vast spectra of internal states. Motivated by the prospect of expanding the set of available ultracold molecules for applications in fundamental physics, chemistry, astrochemistry, and quantum simulation, we propose and demonstrate an automated graph-based search approach for viable laser cooling schemes. The method is time efficient, reproduces the results of previous manual searches, and reveals a plethora of new potential laser cooling schemes. We discover laser cooling schemes for YO, C$_2$, OH$^+$, CN, and CO$_2$, including surprising schemes that start from highly excited states or do not rely on a strong main transition. A central insight of this work is that the reinterpretation of quantum states and transitions between them as a graph can dramatically enhance the ability to identify new quantum control schemes for complex quantum systems. As such, this approach will also apply to complex atoms and, in fact, any complex many-body quantum system with a discrete spectrum of internal states.</description>

      <title>Spatial Form Factor for Point Patterns: Poisson Point Process, Coulomb Gas, and Vortex Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point processes have broad applications in science and engineering. In physics, their use ranges from quantum chaos to statistical mechanics of many-particle systems. We introduce a spatial form factor (SFF) for the characterization of spatial patterns associated with point processes. Specifically, the SFF is defined in terms of the averaged even Fourier transform of the distance between any pair of points. We focus on homogeneous Poisson point processes and derive the explicit expression for the SFF in $d$-spatial dimensions. The SFF can then be found in terms of the even Fourier transform of the probability distribution for the distance between two independent and uniformly distributed random points on a $d$-dimensional ball, arising in the ball line picking problem. The relation between the SFF and the set of $n$-order spacing distributions is further established. The SFF is analyzed in detail for $d=1,2,3$ and in the infinite-dimensional case, as well as for the $d$-dimensional Coulomb gas, as an interacting point process. As a physical application, we describe the spontaneous vortex formation during Bose-Einstein condensation in finite time recently studied in ultracold atom experiments and use the SFF to reveal the stochastic geometry of the resulting vortex patterns. In closing, we also introduce a generalization of the SFF applicable to arbitrary sets in a metric space.</description>

      <title>SU($N$) symmetry with ultracold alkali dimers: weak dependence of scattering properties on hyperfine state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the prospect of using ultracold alkali diatomic molecules to implement many-body quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry. Experimentally accessible molecules offer large $N$ for both bosonic and fermionic systems, with both attractive and repulsive interactions. We carry out coupled-channel scattering calculations on pairs of NaK, NaRb and NaCs molecules that are shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields. We develop new methods to handle the very large basis sets required to include nuclear spins. We show that all the molecules studied have the properties required for SU($N$) symmetry: the collisions are principally elastic, and the scattering lengths depend only weakly on the spin states of the molecules. The rates of spin-changing inelastic collisions are very low. We develop and test a semiclassical model of the spin dependence and find that it performs well.</description>

      <title>Periodic Boundary Conditions for Bosonic Path Integral Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for bosonic path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) that scales quadratically with the number of particles. Path integral methods are a powerful tool to simulate bosonic condensed phases, which exhibit fundamental physical phenomena such as Bose--Einstein condensation and superfluidity. Recently, we developed a quadratic scaling algorithm for bosonic PIMD, but employed an ad hoc treatment of PBC. Here we rigorously enforce PBC in bosonic PIMD. It requires summing over the spring energies of all periodic images in the partition function, and a naive implementation scales exponentially with the system size. We present an algorithm for bosonic PIMD simulations of periodic systems that scales only quadratically. We benchmark our implementation on the free Bose gas and a model system of cold atoms in optical lattices. We also study an approximate treatment of PBC based on the minimum-image convention, and derive a numerical criterion to determine when it is valid.</description>
