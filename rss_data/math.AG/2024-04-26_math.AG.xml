      <title>Mirror Construction for Nakajima Quiver Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the ADHM quiver representations and the corresponding sheaves as the mirror objects of formal deformations of the framed immersed Lagrangian sphere decorated with flat bundles. More generally, framed double quivers of Nakajima are constructed as localized mirrors of framed Lagrangian immersions in dimension two. This produces a localized mirror functor to the dg category of modules over the framed preprojective algebra.
  For affine ADE quivers in specific multiplicities, the corresponding (unframed) Lagrangian immersions are homological tori, whose moduli of stable deformations are asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) spaces. We show that framed stable Lagrangian branes are transformed into monadic complexes of framed torsion-free sheaves over the ALE spaces.
  A main ingredient is the notion of framed Lagrangian immersions. Moreover, it is important to note that the deformation space of a Lagrangian immersion with more than one component is stacky. Using the formalism of quiver algebroid stacks, we find isomorphisms between the moduli of stable Lagrangian immersions and that of special Lagrangian fibers of an SYZ fibration in the affine $A_n$ cases.</description>

      <title>Central charges in local mirror symmetry via hypergeometric duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the better-behaved GKZ hypergeometric systems to study toric Calabi-Yau Deligne-Mumford stacks and their Hori-Vafa mirrors given by affine hypersurfaces in algebraic tori. We show the equality between A-model and B-model central charges, in terms of period integrals and hypergeometric series respectively. This settles a conjecture of Hosono, which could also be considered as a generalization of the Gamma conjecture for local mirror symmetry.</description>

      <title>The Noether inequalities for a foliated surface of general type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\mathcal{F},S)$ be a foliated surface of general type with reduced singularities over the complex number. We establish the Noether type inequalities for $(\mathcal{F},S)$. Namely, we prove that $\mathrm{vol}(\mathcal{F}) \geq p_g(\mathcal{F})-2$, and that $\mathrm{vol}(\mathcal{F}) \geq 2p_g(\mathcal{F})-4$ if moreover the surface $S$ is also of general type. Examples show that both of the Noether type inequalities are sharp.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Euler Characteristic of Symmetric Powers of Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the quadratic Euler characteristic of the symmetric powers of a smooth, projective curve over any field $k$ that is not of characteristic two, using the Motivic Gauss-Bonnet Theorem of Levine-Raksit. As an application, we show over a field of characteristic zero that the power structure on the Grothendieck-Witt ring introduced by Pajwani-P\'al computes the compactly supported $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristic of symmetric powers for all curves.</description>

      <title>Obstruction classes for moduli spaces of sheaves and Lagrangian fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate obstruction classes of moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces. We extend previous results by Caldararu, explicitly determining the obstruction class and its order in the Brauer group. Our main theorem establishes a short exact sequence relating the Brauer group of the moduli space to that of the underlying K3 surface. This provides a criterion for when the moduli space is fine, generalising well-known results for K3 surfaces. Additionally, we explore applications to Ogg-Shafarevich theory for Beauville-Mukai systems. Furthermore, we investigate birational equivalences of Beauville-Mukai systems on elliptic K3 surfaces, presenting a complete characterisation of such equivalences.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Witten Invariants and Mirror Symmetry for Non-Fano Varieties Using Scattering Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gromov-Witten invariants arise in the topological A-model as counts of worldsheet instantons. On the A-side, these invariants can be computed for a Fano or semi-Fano toric variety using generating functions associated to the toric divisors. On the B-side, the same invariants can be computed from the periods of the mirror. We utilize scattering diagrams (aka wall structures) in the Gross-Siebert mirror symmetry program to extend the calculation of Gromov-Witten invariants to non-Fano toric varieties. Following the work of Carl-Pumperla-Siebert, we compute corrected mirror superpotentials $\vartheta_1(\mathbb{F}_m)$ and their periods for the Hirzebruch surfaces $\mathbb{F}_m$ with $m \ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Semistable reduction of covers of degree $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a local field of residue characteristic $p&gt;0$. We explain how to compute the semistable reduction of $K$-curves $Y$ equipped with a degree-$p$ morphism from $Y$ to the projective line. This includes the reduction at $p$ of superelliptic curves of degree $p$, but our approach is not limited to Galois covers. We give particular attention to the reduction of plane quartics at $p=3$, which case is implemented in SageMath. We use the language of non-archimedean analytic geometry in the sense of Berkovich. A key tool is the different function of Cohen, Temkin, and Trushin.</description>

      <title>Connected components of the moduli space of L-parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, in order to formulate a categorical version of the local Langlands correspondence, several authors have constructed moduli spaces of $\mathbf{Z}[1/p]$-valued L-parameters for $p$-adic groups. The connected components of these spaces over various $\mathbf{Z}[1/p]$-algebras $R$ are conjecturally related to blocks in categories of $R$-representations of $p$-adic groups. Dat-Helm-Kurinczuk-Moss described the components when $R$ is an algebraically closed field and gave a conjectural description when $R = \overline{\mathbf{Z}}[1/p]$. In this paper, we prove a strong form of this conjecture applicable to any integral domain $R$ over $\overline{\mathbf{Z}}[1/p]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a detection algorithm for SAGBI basis in polynomial rings, analogous to a Gr\"obner basis detection algorithm previously proposed by Gritzmann and Sturmfels. We also present two accompanying software packages named SagbiGbDetection for Macaulay2 and Julia. Both packages allow the user to find one or more term orders for which a set of input polynomials form either Gr\"obner basis for the ideal they generate or a SAGBI basis for the subalgebra. Additionally, we investigate the computational complexity of homogeneous SAGBI detection and apply our implementation to several novel examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1706.04417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Segal constructed a derived equivalence for an interesting 5-fold flop that was provided by Abuaf. The aim of this article is to add some results for the derived equivalence for Abuaf's flop. Concretely, we study the equivalence for Abuaf's flop by using Toda-Uehara's tilting bundles and Iyama-Wemyss's mutation functors. In addition, we observe a "flop-flop=twist" result and a "multi-mutation=twist" result for Abuaf's flop.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1911.07760v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Kazhdan-Lusztig variety is the intersection of a locally-closed Schubert cell with an opposite Schubert variety in a flag variety. We present a linear parametrization of the Schubert cells in the affine type A flag variety via Bott-Samelson maps, and give explicit equations that generate the Kazhdan-Lusztig ideals in these coordinates. Furthermore, our equations form a Gr\"obner basis for the Kazhdan-Lusztig ideals. Our result generalizes a result of Woo-Yong that gave a Gr\"obner basis for Kazhdan-Lusztig ideals in the type A flag variety.</description>

      <title>Manifolds with trivial Chern classes II: Manifolds Isogenous to a Torus Product, coframed Manifolds and a question by Baldassarri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a general question addressed by Mario Baldassarri in 1956, we discuss characterizations of the Pseudo-Abelian Varieties introduced by Roth, and we introduce a first new notion, of Manifolds Isogenous to a k-Torus Product: the latter have the last k Chern classes trivial in rational cohomology and vanishing Chern numbers. We show that in dimension 2 the latter class is the correct substitute for some incorrect assertions by Enriques, Dantoni, Roth and Baldassarri: these are the surfaces with $K_X$ nef and $c_2(X)=0 \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z})$. We observe in the last section, using a construction by Chad Schoen, that such a simple similar picture does not hold in higher dimension. We discuss then, as a class of solutions to Baldassarri's question, manifolds isogenous to projective (respectively: K\"ahler) manifolds whose tangent bundle or whose cotangent bundle has a trivial subbundle of positive rank. We see that the class of `partially framed' projective manifolds (that is, whose tangent bundle has a trivial subbundle) consists, in the case where $K_X$ is nef, of the Pseudo-Abelian varieties of Roth; while the class of `partially co-framed' projective manifolds is not yet fully understood in spite of the new results that we are able to show here: and we formulate some open questions and conjectures. In the course of the paper we address also the case of more general compact complex Manifolds, introducing the new notions of suspensions over parallelizable Manifolds, of twisted hyperelliptic Manifolds, and we describe the known results under the K\"ahler assumption.</description>

We also show that the non-nef locus and the diminished base locus of the adjoint divisor of an NQC log canonical generalized pair coincide.

      <title>Mutations of noncommutative crepant resolutions in geometric invariant theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a generic quasi-symmetric representation of a connected reductive group $G$. The GIT quotient stack $\mathfrak{X}=[X^{\rm ss}(\ell)/G]$ with respect to a generic $\ell$ is a (stacky) crepant resolution of the affine quotient $X/G$, and it is derived equivalent to a noncommutative crepant resolution (=NCCR) of $X/G$. Halpern-Leistner and Sam showed that the derived category $\mathrm{D}^b(\mathrm{coh}~\mathfrak{X})$ is equivalent to certain subcategories of $\mathrm{D}^b(\mathrm{coh}~[X/G])$, which are called magic windows. This paper studies equivalences between magic windows that correspond to wall-crossings in a hyperplane arrangement in terms of NCCRs. We show that those equivalences coincide with derived equivalences between NCCRs induced by tilting modules, and that those tilting modules are obtained by certain operations of modules, which is called exchanges of modules. When $G$ is a torus, it turns out that the exchanges are nothing but iterated Iyama--Wemyss mutations. Although we mainly discuss resolutions of affine varieties, our theorems also yield a result for projective Calabi-Yau varieties. Using techniques from the theory of noncommutative matrix factorizations, we show that Iyama--Wemyss mutations induce a group action of the fundamental group $\pi_1(\mathbb{P}^1 \backslash\{0,1,\infty\})$ on the derived category of a Calabi-Yau complete intersection in a weighted projective space.</description>

      <title>Dimension growth for affine varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove uniform upper bounds on the number of integral points of bounded height on affine varieties. If $X$ is an irreducible affine variety of degree $d\geq 4$ in $\mathbb{A}^n$ which is not the preimage of a curve under a linear map $\mathbb{A}^n\to \mathbb{A}^{n-\dim X+1}$, then we prove that $X$ has at most $O_{d,n,\varepsilon}(B^{\dim X - 1 + \varepsilon})$ integral points up to height $B$. This is a strong analogue of dimension growth for projective varieties, and improves upon a theorem due to Pila, and a theorem due to Browning-Heath-Brown-Salberger.
  Our techniques follow the $p$-adic determinant method, in the spirit of Heath-Brown, but with improvements due to Salberger, Walsh, and Castryck-Cluckers-Dittmann-Nguyen. The main difficulty is to count integral points on lines on an affine surface in $\mathbb{A}^3$, for which we develop point-counting results for curves in $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$.
  We also formulate and prove analogous results over global fields, following work by Paredes-Sasyk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a submonoid of a free Abelian group of finite rank. We show that if $k$ is a field of prime characteristic such that the monoid $k$-algebra $k[S]$ is split $F$-regular, then $k[S]$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra, or equivalently, that $S$ is a finitely generated monoid. Split $F$-regular rings are possibly non-Noetherian or non-$F$-finite rings that satisfy the defining property of strongly $F$-regular rings from the theories of tight closure and $F$-singularities. Our finite generation result provides evidence in favor of the conjecture that split $F$-regular rings in function fields over $k$ have to be Noetherian. The key tool is Diophantine approximation from convex geometry.</description>

Abstract: Given a prime number $p$ and a positive integer $m$, we provide a family of diagonal hypersurfaces $\{ f_n \}_{n = 1}^{\infty}$ in $m$ variables, for which the denominator of $\text{ fpt } (f_{n})$ (in lowest terms) is always $p$ and whose $F$-pure thresholds stabilize after a certain $n$. We also provide another family of diagonal hypersurfaces $\{ g_n \}_{n = 1}^{\infty}$ in $m$ variables, for which the power of $p$ in the denominator of $\text{ fpt } (g_{n})$ (in lowest terms) diverges to $\infty$ as $n \to \infty$. This behavior of the denominator of the $F$-pure thresholds is dependent on the congruence class of $p$ modulo the smallest two exponents of $\{ f_n \}$ and $\{ g_n \}$.</description>

Abstract: Let G be a connected reductive group acting on a finite dimensional vector space V. Assume that V is equipped with a G-invariant symplectic form. Then the ring C[V] of polynomial functions becomes a Poisson algebra. The ring C[V]^G of invariants is a sub-Poisson algebra. We call V multiplicity free if C[V]^G is Poisson commutative, i.e., if {f,g}=0 for all invariants f and g. Alternatively, G also acts on the Weyl algebra W(V) and V is multiplicity free if and only if the subalgebra W(V)^G of invariants is commutative. In this paper we classify all multiplicity free symplectic representations.</description>
