      <title>Haskap Pie: A Halo finding Algorithm with efficient Sampling, K-means clustering, tree-Assembly, Particle tracking, Python modules, Inter-code applicability, and Energy solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a new Python-based stand-alone halo finding algorithm, Haskap Pie, that combines several methods of halo finding and tracking into a single calculation. Our halo-finder flexibly solves halos for simulations produced by eight simulation codes (ART-I, ENZO, RAMSES, CHANGA, GADGET-3, GEAR, AREPO and GIZMO) and for both zoom-in or full-box N-body or hydrodynamical simulations without the need for additional tuning or user-specified modeling parameters. When compared to Rockstar and Consistent Trees, our halo-finder tracks subhalos much longer and more consistently, produces halos with better constrained physical parameters, and returns a much denser halo mass function for halos with more than 100 particles. Our results also compare favorably to recently described specialized particle-tracking extensions to Rockstar. Our algorithm is well-suited to a variety of studies of simulated galaxies and is particularly robust for a new generation of studies of merging and satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$: fast differentiable angular power spectra beyond Limber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming stage IV wide-field surveys will provide high precision measurements of the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. Their interpretation requires fast and accurate theoretical predictions including large scales. For this purpose, we introduce $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$, a fast, accurate and differentiable $\texttt{JAX}$-based pipeline for the computation of the angular power spectrum beyond the Limber approximation. It uses a new FFTLog-based method which can reach arbitrary precision and includes interpolation along $k$, allowing for $k$-dependent growth factor and biases. $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$ includes a wide range of probes and effects such as galaxy clustering, including magnification bias, redshift-space distortions and primordial non-Gaussianity, weak lensing, including intrinsic alignment, cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing and CMB integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We compare our pipeline to the other available beyond-Limber codes within the N5K challenge from the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Dark Energy Science Collaboration. $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$ computes the 120 different angular power spectra over 103 $\ell$-multipoles in 5 ms on one GPU core. Using a pre-calculation, $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$ is thus about 40$\times$ faster than the winner of the N5K challenge with comparable accuracy. Furthermore, all outputs are auto-differentiable, facilitating gradient-based sampling and robust and accurate Fisher forecasts. We showcase a Markov Chain Monte Carlo on an LSST-like survey as well as a Fisher forecast, illustrating $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$'s differentiability, speed and reliability in measuring cosmological parameters. The code is publicly available at https://cosmo-gitlab.phys.ethz.ch/cosmo_public/swiftcl.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Violation with Gravitational Waves: Constraints from NANOGrav and IPTA Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a theoretical framework in which Lorentz symmetry is explicitly broken by incorporating derivative terms of the extrinsic curvature into the gravitational action. These modifications introduce a scale-dependent damping effect in the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs), governed by a characteristic energy scale denoted as $M_{{LV}}$ . We derive the modified spectral energy density of GWs within this model and confront it with recent observational data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the second data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). Our analysis yields a lower bound on the Lorentz-violating energy scale, finding $M_{{LV}} &gt; 10^{-19}$ GeV at 68\% confidence level. This result significantly improves upon previous constraints derived from LIGO/VIRGO binary merger observations. Our findings demonstrate the potential of pulsar timing arrays to probe fundamental symmetries of spacetime and offer new insights into possible extensions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Basic Elements of Strong Gravitational Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even when used to describe the same phenomenon, equations, graphics and words each give different perspectives and lead to complementary insights. The basic elements of strong gravitational lensing are introduced here favoring words and graphics over equations whenever possible. Fermat's principle is the fundamental driver of strong lensing. Three "D's'' encapsulate the essential effects of lensing: Delay, Deflection and Distortion. Gravity and geometry both contribute to the delay of photons from a lensed source. Their interplay determines how the images of a source are deflected and how they are stretched or compressed. Caustics and critical curves are explained. Images of doubly, triply, quadruply and quintuply lensed sources are displayed. A table of symbols, their definitions and distinctions provides a summary of the basic elements of strong lensing.</description>

      <title>An Accurate Modeling of Nano-Hertz Gravitational Wave Signal from Eccentric Supermassive Binary Black Holes: Essential Step Towards a Robust Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz (nHz) regime, detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), offers a promising avenue to probe the cosmic population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). These SMBHBs are expected to retain substantial eccentricity throughout their evolution due to their formation history. In this study, we propose a new modeling scenario of the nHz SGWB by incorporating the eccentricity of SMBHBs into a multi-scale adaptive simulation-based framework. We employ a time-domain eccentric waveform model, \esigmahm{}, to generate realistic gravitational wave (GW) signals from an astrophysical population of SMBHB, including physical effects from sub-parsec scales to Gpc scales. The eccentric inspiraling binary, unlike circular binaries, emits GW signal in multiple frequencies. As a consequence, the SGWB energy density in each frequency bin is not independent; instead, the presence of eccentricity introduces a spectral correlation between different frequencies. We show that these spectral correlations are absent for circular binaries but become increasingly significant for populations with higher eccentricities. Our novel approach can capture this effect and opens up the window towards measuring this with a high signal-to-noise ratio with future observations. This work develops the frontier of nHz signal modeling using eccentricity at small scales and can model realistic nHz signal, which will be essential for robust inference from future observations to shed light on the astrophysical properties of SMBHBs.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Constraints on Non-Thermal Light Massive Relics from Future CMB Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present Fisher forecasts on non-thermal LiMR models for the upcoming CMB Stage IV experiment -- particularly focusing on a model of inflaton/moduli decay giving rise to non-thermally distributed dark sector particles, and also comparing our results with those for sterile particles following the Dodelson-Widrow distribution. Two independent parameters, the effective number of extra relativistic species $\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}$ and the effective mass $M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}$ of the relic, influence linear cosmological observables. We find $\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}$ to be more tightly constrained with $\sigma(\Delta N_\mathrm{eff})\sim10^{-3}$, for a less abundant, heavier LiMR which becomes fully non-relativistic around matter-radiation equality than a more abundant, lighter LiMR which becomes fully non-relativistic just after recombination, for which $\sigma(\Delta N_\mathrm{eff})\sim10^{-2}$. The uncertainties on $M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}$ differ by a factor of $\sim3$ between the two cases. Our analysis also reveals distinct parameter correlations: the phenomenological parameters $\{\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}, M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}\}$ are found to be negatively correlated for the former case and positively correlated for the latter. We obtain similar constraints on the cosmological parameters (in either case) for both the inflaton/moduli decay and the Dodelson-Widrow models when the first two moments of the LiMR distribution function, related to the phenomenological parameters, are matched. Finally, by constructing a modified distribution that matches the first two moments of the Dodelson-Widrow but deviates maximally in the third moment, we demonstrate that CMB Stage IV data is not expected to be sensitive to higher moments of the distribution.</description>

      <title>CHEX-MATE: The Impact of Triaxiality and Orientation on Planck SZ Cluster Selection and Weak Lensing Mass Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy cluster abundance measurements are a valuable tool for constraining cosmological parameters like the mass density ($\Omega_m$) and density fluctuation amplitude ($\sigma_8$). Wide area surveys detect clusters based on observables, such as the total integrated Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect signal ($Y_{SZ}$) in the case of Planck. Quantifying the survey selection function is necessary for a cosmological analysis, with completeness representing the probability of detecting a cluster as a function of its intrinsic properties. Employing a Monte-Carlo method, we inject triaxial cluster profiles into random positions within the Planck all-sky maps, and subsequently determine the completeness of the Planck-selected CHEXMATE sample as a function of both geometry and SZ brightness. This is then used to generate 1000 mock CHEX-MATE cluster catalogs, and the distribution of shapes and orientations of the detected clusters, along with any associated bias in weak lensing-derived mass ($M_{WL}$) due to this orientation-dependent selection, denoted as $1 - b_{\chi}$, is obtained. We show that cluster orientation impacts completeness, with a higher probability of detecting clusters elongated along the line of sight (LOS). This leads to $1 - b_{\chi}$ values of $0-4\%$ for CHEXMATE clusters relative to a random population. The largest increase in $M_{WL}$ is observed in the lowest mass objects, which are most impacted by orientation-related selection bias. This bias is relevant for upcoming SZ surveys like CMB-S4, and should be considered for surveys utilizing other probes for cluster detection, such as Euclid.</description>

      <title>Compartmentalization in the Dark Sector of the Universe after DESI DR2 BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a non-linear interaction between the dark matter and dark energy components of the universe. In particular, within the FLRW geometry, where dark matter is described by a dust fluid and dark energy by an ideal gas with a constant equation of state parameter, we introduce energy transfer between the two fluids. The effective cosmological fluid leads to a unified dynamical dark energy model with the feature that the Hubble function admits an analytic expression. We study this model using the DESI DR2 Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations data and the Supernova data from Pantheon+. The interacting model fits the data better than the $\Lambda$CDM model, with $\chi_{\text{model}}^{2}-\chi_{\Lambda\text{CDM}}^{2}=-5$. Using the Akaike Information Criterion to compare the two models, we derive $\text{AIC}_{\operatorname{model}}-\text{AIC}_{\Lambda\text{CDM}}=-1$, from which we conclude that the interacting model is marginally better supported by the data than the $\Lambda$CDM, but the difference is not statistically significant.</description>

      <title>Toward a simultaneous resolution of the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions: early dark energy and an interacting dark sector model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tension between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and that measured from late-time observations, such as the local distance ladder, is a major challenge in modern cosmology. Early dark energy (EDE) has been proposed as a possible resolution to the $H_0$ tension, but it typically worsens the $S_8$ tension by enhancing the small-scale matter power spectrum due to an increased cold dark matter density. To address this issue, we propose a model that combines EDE with an interacting dark energy-dark matter (iDEDM) scenario, and investigate whether this mixed model can simultaneously resolve both tensions. We find that the DE-DM interaction suppress the growth of structure and reduce $S_8$, while EDE contributes to increase $H_0$, although less effectively than in the EDE-only case. Our MCMC analysis using Planck 2018, DESI BAO, DES, Pantheon+, and SH0ES data shows that the mixed model provides modest improvements in both tensions, although it does not fully resolve either. This limitation appears to stem from the fact that both EDE and iDEDM independently favor a higher present-day matter density, which reduces the angular diameter distance and limits the degree to which EDE can lower the sound horizon.</description>

      <title>A view of the CIZA J2242.8+5301 galaxy cluster at very low radio frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The galaxy cluster CIZA J2242.8+5301 is a well-studied merging galaxy cluster that hosts prominent double radio relics including the famous sausage relic, as well as other diffuse radio sources. Observations at frequencies below 100 MHz are essential for investigating the physics of radio relics as they provide unique access to the low-energy population of cosmic-ray electrons. We aim to study the morphology, spectral characteristics, and physical processes that produce relics. We present the first observations of the Sausage cluster at 45 MHz, the lowest radio frequency at which this cluster has been studied to date, using the Low Band Antenna (LBA) of the LOFAR radio interferometer. We made use of ten hours of LOFAR LBA observations, from which we achieved a thermal-noise limited radio image with a noise level of 1.5 mJy/beam at a resolution of 15 arcsec. These data were combined with existing multi-frequency measurements at higher frequencies: LOFAR High Band Antenna, Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. This broad frequency coverage allowed us to derive integrated spectral indices, spectral index and curvature maps, and Mach number distributions across the relics. We derived Mach numbers from the local injection index measure using low-frequency data with M_N = 2.9 +-0.5 for the northern relic and M_S = 2.9+-0.8 for the southern relic. LOFAR LBA observations reveal a remarkably symmetric surface brightness profile across the eastern part of the northern relic, with wings extending on either side of the peak. This discovery is contrary to the expectation of particle acceleration at a single, sharp shock and the subsequent downstream advection of accelerated electrons. We modelled the surface brightness profile, including the effects of projection, magnetic field variation, and shock deformation.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial curvature perturbations with present and future GW detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial scalar curvature perturbations ($\zeta$), typically probed on large cosmological scales via CMB and LSS observations, can be significantly enhanced on smaller scales by various early Universe mechanisms, for instance, non-minimal inflationary models. While decoupled at linear order, scalar and tensor perturbations, i.e., Gravitational Waves (GWs), interact at second order. As a consequence, an enhanced primordial scalar power spectrum $P_\zeta(k)$ can source a sizable stochastic GW background (SGWB). In these proceedings, we briefly review the generation mechanism of such signals, typically referred to as scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs), and discuss the prospects of measuring them with present and future Pulsar Timing Arrays datasets and future GW observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA.</description>

      <title>Colloquium: The Cosmic Dipole Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cosmological Principle, which states that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic (when averaged on large scales), is the foundational assumption of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies such as the current standard Lambda-Cold-Dark-Matter ({\Lambda}CDM) model. This simplification yields an exact solution to the Einstein field equations that relates space and time through a single time-dependent scale factor, which defines cosmological observables such as the Hubble parameter and the cosmological redshift. The validity of the Cosmological Principle, which underpins modern cosmology, can now be rigorously tested with the advent of large, nearly all-sky catalogs of radio galaxies and quasars. Surprisingly, the dipole anisotropy in the large-scale distribution of matter is found to be inconsistent with the expectation from kinematic aberration and Doppler boosting effects in a perturbed FLRW universe, which is the standard interpretation of the observed dipole in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although the matter dipole agrees in direction with that of the CMB dipole, it is anomalously larger, demonstrating that either the rest frames in which matter and radiation appear isotropic are not the same, or that there is an unexpected intrinsic anisotropy in at least one of them. This discrepancy now exceeds 5{\sigma} in significance. We review these recent findings, as well as the potential biases, systematic issues, and alternate interpretations that have been suggested to help alleviate the tension. We conclude that the cosmic dipole anomaly poses a serious challenge to FLRW cosmology, and the standard {\Lambda}CDM model in particular, as an adequate description of our Universe.</description>

      <title>Metagalactic Ultraviolet Background Tables for Calculating Diffuse Astrophysical Plasma Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In developing a deeper understanding of the Circumgalactic Medium, one feature that is poorly understood is the nature of the ultraviolet background (UVB) and its impact on observed column densities. A wide array of UVB models have been created over the years by many different authors, each based on the latest observational data available at the time. In addition to having a large variance between model properties, the formatting between released models is also inconsistent.
  This data release provides reformatted versions of several widely-used ultraviolet background models-Faucher-Gigu\`ere et al. 2009, Haardt and Madau 2012, Puchwein et al. 2019, and Faucher-Gigu\`ere 2020-such that each model is in the same units and thus can be utilized to directly compare these models over a wide redshift range. This release also includes code to run a 'cloudy_cooling_tools' pipeline to generate ionization tables for different UVB models.</description>

      <title>The Intracluster Light of Abell 3667: Unveiling an Optical Bridge in LSST Precursor Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracluster light, the diffuse glow of stars stripped from galaxies during a cluster's formation, is an established tracer of a cluster's dynamical history. The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is set to revolutionize studies of intracluster light by imaging the entire southern sky down to a limiting surface brightness $\mu \gtrsim 30\text{mag}/\text{arcsec}^2$ by year ten. In this letter, we create a precursor LSST dataset (reaching the equivalent of year eight depth) using DECam observations of Abell 3667 and study its intracluster light. We have discovered a low surface brightness ($ \mu \gtrsim 26\text{mag}/\text{arcsec}^2 $) optical bridge extending over $\sim 400\text{ kpc}$ which connects the two brightest galaxies (BCG1 and BCG2) in the cluster; the color and surface brightness of the bridge is consistent with formation via a major merger. The inner regions of BCG1 ($r &lt; 200\text{ kpc}$) and BCG2 ($r &lt; 50\text{ kpc}$) are consistent with formation via gradual stripping of satellite galaxies, but BCG2's outer profile appears disrupted by a recent merger. We hypothesize that the bridge is a relic of a recent first-pass between the two brightest galaxies and is composed of stars being stripped from BCG2. Future studies of intracluster light with LSST will discover new features such as the bridge in local clusters while enabling detailed studies of the stellar populations of these features with its six photometric bands.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Likelihoods for Large-Scale Structure of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a formalism for deriving likelihoods of the cosmological density field directly from first principles within Perturbation Theory (PT). By assuming a perturbative expansion around the Gaussian initial density field and additional stochastic components, we analytically compute two forms of the likelihood. Full marginalization over all underlying fields yields the likelihood of the observed density field, expressed in terms of its summary statistics (such as the power spectrum and bispectrum), which are naturally given by the formalism, and conditioned on model parameters. Marginalizing only over the stochastic fields results in the field-level likelihood. A key strength of this method is its ability to automatically specify the precise combinations of initial field covariances and PT expansion kernels required at each perturbative order (e.g., tree-level power spectrum and bispectrum, and the 1-loop power spectrum). This guarantees that the resulting likelihoods are fully consistent with PT at the chosen order of accuracy, avoiding ad-hoc choices in constructing the statistical model.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from Q-balls produced in a first-order phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the formation of Q-balls in false vacuum remnants during a cosmological first-order phase transition. We find that under certain circumstances Q-balls can collapse to form primordial black holes. This scenario can produce multimessenger signals that may be observed at upcoming experiments, including 1-100 nHz gravitational waves from the phase transition, and gamma-rays emitted from primordial black holes as Hawking radiation and as superradiance. These signals are quite distinctive, and differ markedly from signals expected from Fermi-balls. The reheating of the dark sector from the phase transition may address the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Explaining the PeV Neutrino Fluxes at KM3NeT and IceCube with Quasi-Extremal Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The KM3NeT experiment has recently observed a neutrino with an energy around 100 PeV, and IceCube has detected five neutrinos with energies above 1 PeV. While there are no known astrophysical sources, exploding primordial black holes could have produced these high-energy neutrinos. For Schwarzschild black holes this interpretation results in tensions between the burst rates inferred from the KM3NeT and IceCube observations, and with indirect constraints from the extragalactic gamma ray background. In this letter we show that if there is a population of primordial black holes charged under a new dark $u(1)$ symmetry which spend most of their time in a quasi-extremal state, the neutrino emission at 1 PeV may be more suppressed than at 100 PeV. The burst rates implied by the KM3NeT and IceCube observations and the indirect constraints can then all be consistent at $1\sigma$. Furthermore, these black holes could constitute all of the observed dark matter in the universe.</description>

      <title>The galaxy-halo connection of disc galaxies over six orders of magnitude in stellar mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Abridged) The relations between stellar ($M_\ast$), gas ($M_{\rm gas}$), baryonic ($M_{\rm bar} = M_\ast + M_{\rm gas}$), and dark matter halo mass ($M_{200}$) provide unique constraints on galaxy formation and cosmology. The shape of the relations constrains how galaxies regulate their growth through gas accretion, star formation, and feedback; their scatter probes the stochasticity of galaxy assembly.
  Here, we assemble a sample of 49 nearby gas-rich dwarf and massive disc galaxies with unmatched ancillary data. We obtain their gas kinematics and derive their dark matter properties through rotation curve decomposition. Our sample allows us to study the galaxy-halo connection across nearly six orders of magnitude in $M_\ast$. We find that the $M_{\rm gas}-M_{200}$ relation rises monotonically, with galaxies having around 4 per cent of the average cosmological baryon fraction in cold gas. Contrastingly, the $M_\ast-M_{200}$ relation shows a more complex behaviour. A particularly interesting finding is that of a population of baryon-deficient' dwarfs (BDDs) with stellar masses $\sim 1-1.5$ orders of magnitude lower than expected from current models. Yet, baryon-rich galaxies also exist, and we find a large spread in the baryon retention fraction across our galaxies. We compare our findings with semi-analytic and hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations. While the simulations broadly reproduce most observed features, they struggle to match the BDDs and do not capture the diversity in baryon fractions. Understanding these differences will shed new light on how feedback regulates galaxy formation. Finally, we study the dark matter halo concentration-mass relation. We find that below $M_{200} \sim 10^{11}\,M_\odot$, the concentrations are systematically lower than expected. We discuss whether these results stem from the influence of baryonic physics or the environment.</description>

      <title>Langer's nucleation rate reproduced on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Langer's rate of bubble nucleation is quantitatively correct up to small higher-loop corrections, in comparison to lattice simulations. These results are a significant advancement on decades of lattice studies showing only qualitative trends, and the first showing agreement for any conservative system. We confirm that the failure to fully thermalize the metastable phase explains discrepancies with recent lattice studies that found disagreement with Langer's rate. The key theoretical development is the translation of Langer's perturbative definition of a thermal metastable phase into a nonperturbative statement that can be implemented on the lattice. Our statistical and systematic errors are small enough to allow us to measure on the lattice the coefficient of the two-loop contribution, missing from the perturbative prediction. Our conclusions also exclude a possible systematic uncertainty in $^3$He experiments.</description>

      <title>The Phase Space of Low-Mass Binary Compact Objects from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Catalog: Hints on the Chances of Different Formation Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations have significantly advanced our understanding of binary compact object (BCO) formation, yet directly linking these observations to specific formation scenarios remains challenging. The BCO phase space provides a robust and data-driven approach to discover the likely formation scenarios of these binaries. In this study, we expand the previously introduced binary black hole phase-space technique to encompass low-mass compact objects (LMCOs), establishing a novel framework to investigate their diverse formation mechanisms. Applying this approach to selected low-mass events $(\lesssim 5 M_\odot)$ from the GWTC-3 catalog and the recently observed GW230529 event, we show for the first time the phase-space demonstration of the LMCOs and find the associated probabilities for different formation scenarios including neutron stars, astrophysical black holes, or primordial black holes. Our analysis includes the astrophysical modelling uncertainties in and how it causes degeneracy between different formation scenarios. In future, with improvements in GW detector sensitivity and with detection of more GW events, the LMCO phase-space framework will significantly strengthen our capacity to associate more likely formation scenarios over the other, thereby refining our understanding of compact object formation for both astrophysical and primordial scenarios, and its evolution across the cosmic redshift.</description>

      <title>On the Probability of the Initial Conditions for Inflation and Slow Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some recent studies based on numerical relativity simulations claim that slow contraction/ekpyrosis is strongly preferred over inflation as the smoothing mechanism that brought the universe into the homogeneous, isotropic and flat state we observe today on large scales. In this paper, we evaluate the likelihood of the initial conditions employed in the aforementioned simulations by estimating the probability that a free scalar field dominating the universe at the beginning of inflation or ekpyrosis will be sufficiently homogeneous on scales comparable to the Hubble radius at that time. We explore the space of parameters that characterize the initial power spectrum of the scalar field, finding that either can be more likely than the other for a fixed choice of parameters. On the other hand, when we extremize over these parameters, we find that the maximal probability for inflation is much higher than that of ekpyrosis.</description>

      <title>Kinetically Modified Palatini Inflation Meets ACT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the coexistence of a non-minimal coupling to gravity fR=1+cR phi^(n/2) with a kinetic mixing of the form fk=fR^m -- where n=2 and 4 and 0.5&lt;m&lt;10 -- reconciles chaotic inflation based on the phi^n potential with the recent ACT results, if we adopt the Palatini formulation of gravity. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and energy scales below the cut-off scale of the corresponding effective theory. The model can be also embedded in supergravity by introducing two chiral superfields and a monomial superpotential, linear with respect to the inflaton-accompanying field. Its stabilization is achieved thanks to a compact contribution to the Kaehler potential, whose the inflationary part includes an holomorphic logarithmic term and a real one multiplying a shift-symmetric quadratic polynomial term.</description>

      <title>Neutron Stars in Causal Scalar-Tensor Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study static, spherically symmetric neutron stars in a class of scalar-tensor theories with non-canonical kinetic terms (K-essence) obeying all causality and hyperbolicity conditions. These models have non-trivial dynamics that lead to a type of anti-screening of the scalar. They lead to small corrections in the solar system due to a small coupling, but can lead to large corrections in regimes of high densities, especially neutron stars. We solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations numerically using realistic equations of state (SLy4, WFF1, MS1, MPA1). For a given central density, we find that two distinct configurations may exist, forming two separate branches of solutions. We find that above a certain critical central density solutions with the correct asymptotic behavior at spatial infinity cannot be obtained. We obtain precise predictions for the mass-radius relation for neutron stars for different values of the parameters in the model and we compare to data.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in Primordial Dark Matter Halos and Its Impact on the First Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high-resolution simulations of the first star-forming clouds in 15 minihalos with masses ranging from $\sim 10^5$ to $10^7\ \text{M}_{\odot}$ at redshifts $z \sim 17 - 20$, using the \texttt{GIZMO} code. Our simulations incorporate detailed primordial gas physics and adopt initial conditions from the state-of-the-art TNG cosmological simulations. To achieve the required resolution, we apply a particle-splitting technique that increases the resolution of the original TNG data by a factor of $\sim 10^5$, reaching gas and dark matter particle masses of $0.2\ \text{M}_{\odot}$ and $80\ \text{M}_{\odot}$, respectively. This enables us to resolve gas accretion during the early assembly of minihalos and to capture the emergence of strong turbulent flows. We find that turbulence, driven by gas infall into the dark matter potential wells, is predominantly supersonic, with characteristic Mach numbers ranging from $1.8$ to $4.2$, increasing with halo mass. The supersonic turbulence effectively fragments the central gas cloud into multiple dense clumps, some of which form gravitationally bound cores and begin to collapse into the first stars. Our results suggest that supersonic turbulence is a common feature in minihalos and plays a key role in generating clumpy star-forming clouds, with important implications for the initial mass function of the first stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.00607v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) generated by individual inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) at the centers of galaxies may be detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) in the future. These GW signals, which encode absolute cosmic distances, can serve as bright and dark sirens, potentially evolving into a precise cosmological probe. Here, we show that a PTA in the era of the Square Kilometre Array, comprising 100 millisecond pulsars, could potentially detect about 25 bright sirens and 41 dark sirens over a 10-year observation period. The bright sirens, combined with cosmic microwave background data, offer capabilities comparable to current mainstream joint cosmological observations for measuring the equation of state of dark energy. The dark sirens could achieve a measurement precision of the Hubble constant close to that of current distance-ladder observations. Our results suggest that ultra-low-frequency GWs from individual SMBHBs are of great significance in investigating the nature of dark energy and determining the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Quantifying and mitigating the effect of snapshot interval in light-cone Epoch of Reionization 21-cm simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) neutral Hydrogen (HI) 21-cm signal evolves significantly along the line-of-sight (LoS) due to the light-cone (LC) effect. It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to correctly interpret the signal. The 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by stitching together slices from a finite number $(N_{\rm RS})$ of "reionization snapshot'', each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the finite value of $N_{\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large discontinuities $(&gt; 200 \%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N_{\rm RS}$ is small $(=2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $\delta \bar{x}_{\rm HI} =0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \%$ for $N_{\rm RS}=13$ where $\delta \bar{x}_{\rm HI}=0.02$. We find that we can achieve $\delta \bar{x}_{\rm HI} \le 0.01$ with $N_{\rm RS} =26$, and we use this as the reference for comparing the other simulations. We present and also validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N_{\rm RS}$ without a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in generating the dark matter and halo density fields. Our method generates these fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC simulations with $N_{\rm RS}=51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors go down as $N_{\rm RS}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Absence of antisymmetric tensor fields : Clue from Starobinsky model of f(R) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02771v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the surprising aspects of the present Universe, is the absence of any noticeable observable effects of higher-rank antisymmetric tensor fields in any natural phenomena. Here, we address the possible explanation of the absence of the higher rank antisymmetric tensor fields within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. We explore the cosmological evolution of the scalar degrees of freedom associated with higher curvature term in a general $f(R)$ gravity model $f (R) = R +\alpha_n R^n$. We show that while different cosmological parameters mimic standard behaviour at different epochs for different forms of higher curvature gravity (i.e. different values of n ), only Starobinsky model (n = 2) gives a natural justification for the invisibility of the signatures of the massless modes of higher rank antisymmetric fields. In contrast, for other models ($n\neq2$), despite their agreement with standard cosmology, the scalar degree of freedom induces an enhancement in the coupling of the antisymmetric fields and thereby contradicts the observation. The result does not change even with the inclusion of the Cosmological Constant. Thus, our result reveals that among different $f(R)$ models, Starobinsky model successfully explains the suppression of the massless modes of higher rank antisymmetric tensor fields leading to their invisibility in the present universe.</description>

      <title>The evolving role of astrophysical modelling in dark matter halo relaxation response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the change in the radial distribution of dark matter within haloes in response to baryonic astrophysical processes in galaxies at different epochs, investigating the role of astrophysical modeling in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations in producing the response. We find that the linear quasi-adiabatic relaxation with additional dependence on the halo-centric distance provides a good description not only at $z=0$, but also at an earlier epoch ($z=1$) in the IllustrisTNG simulation suite, with parameters being more universal across a much larger variety of haloes at $z=1$ than at $z=0$. Through systematic analysis of a large collection of simulations from the CAMELS project, we find that the baryonic prescriptions for both AGN and stellar feedbacks have a strong influence on the relaxation response of the dark matter halo. In particular, only the parameters controlling the overall feedback energy flux have an effect on the relaxation response, while the wind speed and burstiness have negligible effect on the relaxation at a fixed amount of energy flux. However, the exact role of these parameters on the relaxation depends on the redshift. We also study the role of a variety of baryonic astrophysical processes through the EAGLE physics variation simulations. While these depict a similar picture regarding the importance of feedback effects, they also reveal that the gas equation of state has one of the strongest influences on the relaxation response, consistent with the expectation from self-similar analyses.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Kinematics of SLACS Lens Galaxies. I: Data and Kinematic Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain spatially resolved kinematics with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) integral-field spectrograph for a sample of 14 massive (11 &lt; log$_{10}$ M$_*$/M$_{\odot}$ &lt; 12) lensing early-type galaxies at z~0.15-0.35 from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey. We integrate kinematic maps within the effective radius and examine rotational and dispersion velocities, showing that 11/14 are slow rotators. The dataset is unprecedented for galaxy-scale strong lenses in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), sampling, and calibration. Systematics are at 1-1.4%, and positive covariance is &lt;1% between sample galaxies and between spatial bins, with primary contibutions from stellar template library selection and fitted wavelength range. This enables cosmographic inference with lensing time delays with &lt;2% uncertainty on H$_0$. We integrate the datacubes within various circular apertures and compare with SDSS velocity dispersions. Velocity dispersions extracted from SDSS spectra for these 14 galaxies, which have low S/N (~9/$\r{A}$) relative to the parent sample, are subject to systematic errors (and covariance) due to stellar template library selection at the level of 3(2)%, which need to be added to the random errors. Comparison between our KCWI measurements, our analysis of SDSS spectra, and previously published measurements based on SDSS spectra shows mean differences within a few percent, which are insignificant given the uncertainties of the SDSS-based measurements. Correlations between scaling relations using quantities inferred from dynamical, lensing, and stellar population models agree with previous SLACS analysis with no statistically significant change. A follow-up paper will present Jeans modeling in the context of broader studies of galaxy evolution and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Binary Neutron Stars: Does Mass-Redshift Correlation Matter?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave detectors are expected to detect millions of compact binary mergers across cosmological distances. The features of the mass distribution of these mergers, combined with gravitational wave distance measurements, will enable precise cosmological inferences, even without the need for electromagnetic counterparts. However, achieving accurate results requires modeling the mass spectrum, particularly considering possible redshift evolution. Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are thought to be less influenced by changes in metallicity compared to binary black holes (BBH) or neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. This stability in their mass spectrum over cosmic time reduces the chances of introducing biases in cosmological parameters caused by redshift evolution. In this study, we use the population synthesis code COMPAS to generate astrophysically motivated catalogs of BNS mergers and explore whether assuming a non-evolving BNS mass distribution with redshift could introduce biases in cosmological parameter inference. Our findings show that despite significant variations in the BNS mass distribution across binary physics assumptions and initial conditions in COMPAS, the joint mass-redshift population can be expressed as the product of the mass distribution marginalized over redshift and the redshift distribution marginalized over masses. This enables a 2% unbiased constraint on the Hubble constant-sufficient to address the Hubble tension. Additionally, we show that in the fiducial COMPAS setup, the bias from a non-evolving BNS mass model is less than 0.5% for the Hubble parameter measured at redshift 0.4. These results establish BNS mergers as strong candidates for spectral siren cosmology in the era of next-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>GalSBI: Phenomenological galaxy population model for cosmology using simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08701v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present GalSBI, a phenomenological model of the galaxy population for cosmological applications using simulation-based inference. The model is based on analytical parametrizations of galaxy luminosity functions, morphologies and spectral energy distributions. Model constraints are derived through iterative Approximate Bayesian Computation, by comparing Hyper Suprime-Cam deep field images with simulations which include a forward model of instrumental, observational and source extraction effects. We developed an emulator trained on image simulations using a normalizing flow. We use it to accelerate the inference by predicting detection probabilities, including blending effects and photometric properties of each object, while accounting for background and PSF variations. This enables robustness tests for all elements of the forward model and the inference. The model demonstrates excellent performance when comparing photometric properties from simulations with observed imaging data for key parameters such as magnitudes, colors and sizes. The redshift distribution of simulated galaxies agrees well with high-precision photometric redshifts in the COSMOS field within $1.5\sigma$ for all magnitude cuts. Additionally, we demonstrate how GalSBI's redshifts can be utilized for splitting galaxy catalogs into tomographic bins, highlighting its potential for current and upcoming surveys. GalSBI is fully open-source, with the accompanying Python package, $\texttt{galsbi}$, offering an easy interface to quickly generate realistic, survey-independent galaxy catalogs.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Synthetic-source Injection Across the Full Survey Using Balrog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic source injection (SSI), the insertion of sources into pixel-level on-sky images, is a powerful method for characterizing object detection and measurement in wide-field, astronomical imaging surveys. Within the Dark Energy Survey (DES), SSI plays a critical role in characterizing all necessary algorithms used in converting images to catalogs, and in deriving quantities needed for the cosmology analysis, such as object detection rates, galaxy redshift estimation, galaxy magnification, star-galaxy classification, and photometric performance. We present here a source injection catalog of $146$ million injections spanning the entire 5000 deg$^2$ DES footprint, generated using the Balrog SSI pipeline. Through this sample, we demonstrate that the DES Year 6 (Y6) image processing pipeline provides accurate estimates of the object properties, for both galaxies and stars, at the percent-level, and we highlight specific regimes where the accuracy is reduced. We then show the consistency between SSI and data catalogs, for all galaxy samples developed within the weak lensing and galaxy clustering analyses of DES Y6. The consistency between the two catalogs also extends to their correlations with survey observing properties (seeing, airmass, depth, extinction, etc.). Finally, we highlight a number of applications of this catalog to the DES Y6 cosmology analysis. This dataset is the largest SSI catalog produced at this fidelity and will serve as a key testing ground for exploring the utility of SSI catalogs in upcoming surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider DHOST inflationary models with a shift symmetry leading to a de Sitter space-time at the background cosmological level. Deviations from scale invariance of the scalar and tensor perturbations follow from the breaking of the shift symmetry by quadratic and quartic operators. These models show a strong violation of the consistency relation of single-field inflationary models with a very flat spectrum of tensor perturbations. This opens up the prospects of future detection of primordial gravitational waves by mHz experiments.</description>

      <title>How probable is the Lyman-$\alpha$ damping wing in the spectrum of the redshift z = 5.9896 quasar ULAS J0148+0600?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shape of the Ly-$\alpha$ transmission in the near zone of the redshift $z=5.9896$ quasar ULAS J0148$+$0600 (hereafter J0148) is consistent with a damping wing arising from an extended neutral hydrogen island in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM). Here we use simulations of late-ending reionisation from Sherwood-Relics to assess the expected incidence of quasars with Ly-$\alpha$ and Ly-$\beta$ absorption similar to the observed J0148 spectrum. We find a late end to reionisation at $z=5.3$ is a necessary requirement for reproducing a Ly-$\alpha$ damping wing consistent with J0148. This occurs in $\sim3$ per cent of our simulated spectra for an IGM neutral fraction $\langle x_{\rm HI}\rangle=0.14$ at $z=6$. However, using standard assumptions for the ionising photon output of J0148, the a priori probability of drawing a simulated quasar spectrum with a Ly-$\alpha$ damping wing profile \emph{and} Ly-$\alpha$ near zone size that simultaneously match J0148 is low, $p&lt;10^{-2}$. This may indicate that the ionising emission from J0148 is variable on timescales $t&lt;10^{5}\rm\,yr$, or alternatively that the Ly-$\alpha$ transmission in the J0148 near zone is impacted by the transverse proximity effect from nearby star-forming galaxies or undetected quasars. We also predict the IGM temperature should be $T\sim 4\times 10^{4}\rm\,K$ within a few proper Mpc of the Ly-$\alpha$ near zone edge due to recent H$\,\rm \scriptstyle I$ and He$\,\rm \scriptstyle II$ photo-heating. Evidence for enhanced thermal broadening in the Ly-$\alpha$ absorption near the damping wing edge would provide further evidence that the final stages of reionisation are occurring at $z&lt;6$.</description>

Abstract: The primordial four-point function encodes a wealth of information about the inflationary Universe. Despite extensive theoretical work, most models of four-point physics have never been compared to data. In this series, we conduct a detailed analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization trispectra, searching for a wide variety of phenomena including local effects, self-interactions, curvatons, DBI inflation, gauge fields, solid inflation, scalar field exchange, spinning massive field exchange, chiral physics, point sources, and gravitational lensing. After presenting a suite of separable primordial templates, we derive thirteen quasi-optimal estimators that directly estimate the underlying template amplitudes. These are unbiased, minimum variance, mask-deconvolved, and account for correlations between templates (including with lensing). Each estimator can be efficiently implemented using spherical harmonic transforms, Monte Carlo methods, and optimization techniques, and asymptotes to standard forms in certain limits. In Paper 2, we implement these estimators in public code, and in Paper 3, use them to constrain primordial trispectra with Planck data. This enables a wide variety of tests of inflation, including some of the first direct constraints on cosmological collider physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To unlock the vast potential of the CMB trispectrum, we require both robust estimators and efficient computational tools. In this work, we introduce the public code PolySpec: a suite of quartic estimators designed to measure the amplitudes of a wide variety of inflationary templates, including local non-Gaussianity, effective field theory models, direction-dependent trispectra, spinning massive particle exchange, and weak gravitational lensing. PolySpec includes a python/cython implementation of each estimator derived in Paper 1 and has been carefully optimized to ensure efficient use of computational resources. We perform a broad range of validation tests, which demonstrate that the estimator is unbiased and minimum-variance, both in Gaussian and non-Gaussian regimes. In addition, we forecast constraints on various types of trispectra; this highlights the utility of CMB polarization and demonstrates that many models of primordial physics are poorly correlated with the simple templates considered in previous studies. This work lays the foundation for the Planck trispectrum analyses performed in Paper 3.</description>

Abstract: Is there new physics hidden in the four-point function of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)? We conduct a detailed analysis of the Planck PR4 temperature and polarization trispectrum for $\ell\in[2,2048]$. Using the theoretical and computational tools developed in Paper 1 and Paper 2, we search for 33 template amplitudes, encoding a variety of effects from inflationary self-interactions to particle exchange. We find no evidence for primordial non-Gaussianity and set stringent constraints on both phenomenological amplitudes and couplings in the inflationary Lagrangian. Due to the use of optimal estimators and polarization data, our constraints are highly competitive. For example, we find $\sigma(g_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc})=4.8\times 10^4$ and $\tau_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc} &lt;1500$ (95\% CL), a factor of two improvement on Effective Field Theory amplitudes, and a $43\sigma$ detection of gravitational lensing. Many templates are analyzed for the first time, such as direction-dependent trispectra and the collapsed limit of the `cosmological collider', across a range of masses and spins. We perform a variety of validation tests; whilst our results are stable, the most relevant systematics are found to be lensing bias, residual foregrounds, and mismatch between simulations and data. The techniques discussed in this series can be extended to future datasets, allowing the primordial Universe to be probed at even higher sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Optimal intrinsic alignment estimators in the presence of redshift-space distortions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present estimators for quantifying intrinsic alignments in large spectroscopic surveys that efficiently capture line-of-sight (LOS) information while being relatively insensitive to redshift-space distortions (RSD). We demonstrate that changing the LOS integration range, {\Pi}max, as a function of transverse separation outperforms the conventional choice of a single {\Pi}max value. This is further improved by replacing the flat {\Pi}max cut with a LOS weighting based on shape projection and RSD. Although these estimators incorporate additional LOS information, they are projected correlations that exhibit signal-to-noise ratios comparable to 3D correlation functions, such as the IA quadrupole. Using simulations from Abacus Summit, we evaluate these estimators and provide recommended {\Pi}max values and weights for projected separations of 1 - 100 Mpc/h. These will improve measurements of intrinsic alignments in large cosmological surveys and the constraints they provide for both weak lensing and direct cosmological applications.</description>

Abstract: We constrain the evolution of dark matter energy density over time, specifically focusing on deviation from the standard model represented by the equation $\rho_{m}\propto(1+z)^{3-\varepsilon}$, where $\varepsilon$ is a constant parameter. Utilizing a diverse array of observational datasets, including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data from the first release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), distance priors derived from cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations by the Planck satellite, Hubble rate data obtained through the cosmic chronometers (CC) method, type Ia supernova (SNIa) data from the Panthon sample, and the data from the redshift space distortion (RSD) measurements ($f\sigma_8$), we derive stringent constraints on the deviation parameter. We find that for the model under consideration, the deviation parameter is constrained to be $\varepsilon = -0.0073^{+0.0029}_{-0.0033}$, indicating a deviation of approximately $2.4\sigma$ from the scenario where dark matter and vacuum dark energy do not interact. When compared with previous studies and alternative analyses, our findings provide corroborative evidence for an interaction between dark matter and vacuum dark energy, particularly in light of the release of BAO data from DESI.</description>

      <title>A joint analysis of 3D clustering and galaxy x CMB-lensing cross-correlations with DESI DR1 galaxies</title>

Abstract: The spectroscopic data from DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) galaxies enables the analysis of 3D clustering by fitting galaxy power spectra and reconstructed correlation functions in redshift space. Given low measurements of the amplitude of structure from cosmic shear at $z\sim1$, redshift space distortions (RSD) + Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signals from DESI galaxies combined with weak lensing can break degeneracies and provide a tight alternative constraint on the $z\sim1$ amplitude of structure. In this paper we perform joint analyses that combine full-shape + post-reconstruction information from the DESI DR1 BGS and LRG samples along with angular cross-correlations with Planck PR4 and ACT DR6 CMB lensing maps. We show that adding galaxy-lensing cross-correlations tightens clustering amplitude constraints, improving $\sigma_8$ uncertainties by $\sim 40\%$ over RSD+BAO alone. We also include angular galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-lensing spectra using photometric samples from the DESI Legacy Survey to further improve constraints. Our headline results are $\sigma_8 = 0.803\pm 0.017$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.3037\pm 0.0069$, and $S_8 = 0.808\pm 0.017$. Given DESI's preference for higher $\sigma_8$ compared to lower values from BOSS, we perform a catalog-level comparison of LRG samples from both surveys. We test sensitivity to dark energy assumptions by relaxing our $\Lambda$CDM prior and allowing for evolving dark energy via the $w_0-w_a$ parameterization. We find our $S_8$ constraints to be relatively unchanged despite a $~3.5\sigma$ tension with the cosmological constant model when combining with the Union3 supernova likelihood. Finally we test general relativity (GR) by allowing the gravitational slip parameter ($\gamma$) to vary, and find $\gamma = 1.17\pm0.11$ in mild ($\sim1.5\sigma$) tension with the GR value of $1.0$.</description>

      <title>QCD-Collapsed Domain Walls: QCD Phase Transition and Gravitational Wave Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a discrete symmetry that is anomalous under QCD, the domain walls produced in the early universe from its spontaneous breaking can naturally annihilate due to QCD instanton effects. The gravitational waves generated from wall annihilation have their amplitude and frequency determined by both the discrete symmetry breaking scale and the QCD scale. The evidence of stochastic gravitational waves at nanohertz observed by pulsar timing array experiments suggests that the discrete-symmetry-breaking scale is around 100 TeV, assuming the domain-wall explanation. The annihilation temperature is about 100 MeV, which could naturally be below the QCD phase transition temperature. We point out that the QCD phase transition within some domains with an effective large QCD $\theta$ angle could be a first-order one. To derive the phase diagram in $\theta$ and temperature, we adopt a phenomenological linear sigma model with three quark flavors. The domain-wall explanation for the NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA and CPTA results hints at a first-order QCD phase transition, which predicts additional gravitational waves at higher frequencies. If the initial formation of domain walls is also a first-order process, this class of domain-wall models predicts an interesting gravitational wave spectroscopy with frequencies spanning more than ten orders of magnitude, from nanohertz to 100 Hz.</description>

      <title>The SAGA Survey. V. Modeling Satellite Systems around Milky Way-mass Galaxies with Updated UniverseMachine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environment plays a critical role in shaping the assembly of low-mass galaxies. Here, we use the UniverseMachine (UM) galaxy-halo connection framework and the Data Release 3 of the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey to place dwarf galaxy star formation and quenching into a cosmological context. UM is a data-driven forward model that flexibly parameterizes galaxy star formation rates (SFR) using only halo mass and assembly history. We add a new quenching model to UM, tailored for galaxies with stellar masses $\lesssim 10^9$ solar masses, and constrain the model down to a stellar mass $\gtrsim 10^7$ solar masses using new SAGA observations of 101 satellite systems around Milky Way (MW)-mass hosts and a sample of isolated field galaxies in a similar mass range from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The new best-fit model, 'UM-SAGA,' reproduces the satellite stellar mass functions, average SFRs, and quenched fractions in SAGA satellites while keeping isolated dwarfs mostly star forming. The enhanced quenching in satellites relative to isolated field galaxies leads the model to maximally rely on halo assembly to explain the observed environmental quenching. Extrapolating the model down to a stellar mass $\sim 10^{6.5}$ solar masses yields a quenched fraction of $\gtrsim$ 30% for isolated field galaxies and $\gtrsim$ 80% for satellites of MW-mass hosts at this stellar mass. This specific prediction can soon be tested by spectroscopic surveys to reveal the relative importance of internal feedback, cessation of mass and gas accretion, satellite-specific gas processes, and reionization for the evolution of faint low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>Flow-based Nonperturbative Simulation of First-order Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a flow-based method for simulating and calculating nucleation rates of first-order phase transitions in scalar field theory on a lattice. Motivated by recent advancements in machine learning tools, particularly normalizing flows for lattice field theory, we propose the ``partitioning flow-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (PFMCMC) sampling" method to address two challenges encountered in normalizing flow applications for lattice field theory: the ``mode-collapse" and ``rare-event sampling" problems. Using a (2+1)-dimensional real scalar model as an example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our PFMCMC method in modeling highly hierarchical order parameter probability distributions and simulating critical bubble configurations. These simulations are then used to facilitate the calculation of nucleation rates. We anticipate the application of this method to (3+1)-dimensional theories for studying realistic cosmological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of quasars at $z&gt;6.5$: public data release and composite spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations for a sample of $45$ quasars at $6.50 &lt; z \leq 7.64$ with absolute magnitudes at $1450$ \r{A} in the range $-28.82 \leq M_{1450} \leq -24.13$ and their composite spectrum. The median redshift and $M_{1450}$ of the quasars in the sample are $z_{\rm{median}}=6.71$ and $M_{1450,\rm{median}} \simeq -26.1$, respectively. The NIR spectra are taken with echelle spectrographs, complemented with additional data from optical long slit instruments, and then reduced consistently using the open-source Python-based spectroscopic data reduction pipeline PypeIt. The median of the mean signal-to-noise ratios per $110$ km s$^{-1}$ pixel in the J, H, and K band [median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{\lambda} \rangle$] is: median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{J} \rangle=9.7$, median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{H} \rangle=10.3$, and median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{K} \rangle=11.7$; demonstrating the good data quality. This work presents the largest medium/moderate-resolution sample of quasars at $z&gt;6.5$ from ground-based instruments. Despite the diversity in instrumental setups and spectral quality, the data set is uniformly processed and well-characterized, making it ideally suited for several scientific goals, including the study of the quasar proximity zones and damping wings, the Ly$\alpha$ forest, the intergalactic medium's metal content, as well as other properties such as the distribution of SMBH masses and Eddington ratios. Our composite spectrum is compared to others at both high and low-$z$ from the literature, showing differences in the strengths of many emission lines, probably due to differences in luminosity among the samples, but a consistent continuum slope, which proves that the same spectral features are preserved in quasars at different redshift ranges.</description>

      <title>EDEN: Exploring Disks Embedded in N-body simulations of Milky-Way-mass halos from Symphony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of galactic disks on the tidal stripping of cold dark matter subhalos within Milky Way (MW)-mass halos ($M_{\rm vir}\sim 10^{12}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) using a new simulation suite, EDEN. By re-simulating 45 MW-mass zoom-in halos from the N-body Symphony compilation with embedded disk potentials, which evolve according to star formation histories predicted by the UniverseMachine model, we self-consistently tie disk growth to halo accretion rate and significantly expand the range of disk masses and formation histories studied. We use the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder Symfind to enhance the robustness of subhalo tracking. We find that disks near the median disk-to-halo mass ratio of our sample ($M_{\ast, \rm Disk}/M_{\rm vir, host} = 2\%$) reduce subhalo peak mass functions within 100 kpc by about $10\%$ for peak masses above $ 10^8\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Heavier, MW/M31-like disks ($M_{\ast, \rm Disk}/M_{\rm vir, host} \gtrsim 5\%$) lead to a reduction of more than $40\%$. Subhalo abundance suppression is more pronounced near halo centers, with particularly enhanced stripping for subhalos accreted over 8 Gyr ago on orbits with pericenters &lt; 100 kpc. Suppression is further amplified when disk mass is increased within fixed halo and disk assembly histories. In all cases, the suppression we measure should be interpreted as stripping below the mass resolution limit rather than complete subhalo disruption. This study reshapes our understanding of the MW's impact on its satellites, suggesting it strips subhalos more efficiently than typical MW-mass galaxies due to its larger disk-to-halo mass ratio and earlier disk formation.</description>

      <title>Is leptogenesis during gravitational reheating flavourful?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the impact of charged lepton Yukawa equilibration on leptogenesis during gravitational reheating. During the post-inflationary era, the inflaton field is assumed to oscillate around the minimum of a monomial potential, leading to the gravitational production of Standard Model (SM) particles, constituting the radiation bath. The heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHN), responsible for generating baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis, are also produced through graviton-mediated scattering of the homogeneous inflaton field and thermal bath, as well as from the the inverse decay of the bath particles. By considering both minimal and non-minimal gravitational contributions to SM, we demonstrate that flavour effects can be safely neglected in the minimal reheating scenario. However, with large non-minimal coupling, these effects may become important, depending on the choice of the RHN mass. We identify the corresponding viable parameter space that satisfies the observed baryon asymmetry in each case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can decay into two photons with a rest-frame frequency given by half of the ALP mass. This implies that ultra-violet searches can be used to investigate ALPs in the multi-eV mass range. We use archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope between 110 and 170 nm to constrain ALPs with mass between 14.4-22.2 eV. We consider observations of a set of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and galaxy clusters and assume the ALP density in these objects to follow their dark matter density. The derived limit on the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ excludes values above $10^{-12}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ over the whole mass range and surpasses previous limits by over one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves in Quadratic Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadratic gravity is a fourth-order (in derivatives) theory that can serve as an attractive upgrade to the standard description of gravity provided by General Relativity, thanks to its renormalizability and its built-in description of primordial inflation. We bring quadratic gravity into a second-order form by introducing an auxiliary tensor field and we consider the primordial tensor fluctuations (gravitational waves) in the theory around a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker background. After a canonical quantization of the perturbations, we calculate the tensor power spectrum in quasi de Sitter spacetime. We find that the spectral index $n_t$ and the amplitude $A_t$ of the tensor power spectrum are both suppressed by the factor $(1 + 2{\bf H}^2_*/m_\text{gh}^2)^{-1}$, where ${\bf H}_*$ is the Hubble rate at horizon exit and $m_\text{gh}$ is the mass of the spin-two ghost. This restores the slow-roll consistency condition familiar from single-field inflation models, where the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is equal to $-8n_t$ in the lowest nontrivial order in the slow-roll approximation. We also discuss the well-known issue of the ghost problem in fourth-order theories and how it pertains to the results at hand.</description>

      <title>More accurate slow-roll approximations for inflation in scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new versions of the slow-roll approximation for inflationary models with nonminimally coupled scalar fields. We derive more precise expressions for the standard slow-roll parameters as functions of the scalar field. To verify the accuracy of the proposed approximations, we consider inflationary models with the induced gravity term and the fourth-order monomial potential. For specific values of the model parameters, this model is the well-known Higgs-driven inflationary model. We investigate the inflationary dynamics in the Jordan frame and come to the conclusion that the proposed versions of the slow-roll approximation are not only more accurate at the end of inflation, but also give essentially more precise estimations for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the amplitude of scalar perturbations $A_s$.</description>

      <title>DESI Emission Line Galaxies: Clustering Dependence on Stellar Mass and [OII] Luminosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We measure the projected two-point correlation functions of emission line galaxies (ELGs) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) One-Percent Survey and model their dependence on stellar mass and [OII] luminosity. We select $\sim$180,000 ELGs with redshifts of $0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.6$ and define 27 samples according to cuts in redshift and both galaxy properties. Following a framework that describes the conditional [OII] luminosity-stellar mass distribution as a function of halo mass, we simultaneously model the clustering measurements of all samples at fixed redshift. Based on the modeling result, most ELGs in our samples are classified as central galaxies, residing in halos of a narrow mass range with a typical median of $\sim$10$^{12.2-12.4}$ $h^{-1} M_\odot$. We observe a weak dependence of clustering amplitude on stellar mass, which is reflected in the model constraints and is likely a consequence of the 0.5-dex measurement uncertainty in the stellar mass estimates. The model shows a trend between galaxy bias and [OII] luminosity at high redshift ($1.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.6$) that is otherwise absent at lower redshifts.</description>

Abstract: The recent discovery of a large number of massive black holes within the first two billion years after the Big Bang, as well as their peculiar properties, have been largely unexpected based on the extrapolation of the properties of luminous quasars. These findings have prompted the development of several theoretical models for the early formation and growth of black holes, which are, however, difficult to differentiate. We report the metallicity measurement around a gravitationally lensed massive black hole at redshift 7.04, hosted in a galaxy with very low dynamical mass. The weakness of the [OIII]5007 emission line relative to the narrow Hbeta emission indicates an extremely low chemical enrichment, less than 0.01 solar. We argue that such properties cannot be uncommon among accreting black holes around this early cosmic epoch. Explaining such a low chemical enrichment in a system that has developed a massive black hole is challenging for most theories. Models assuming heavy black hole seeds (such as Direct Collapse Black Holes) or super-Eddington accretion scenarios struggle to explain the observations, although they can potentially reproduce the observed properties in rare cases. Models invoking "primordial black holes" (i.e. putative black holes formed shortly after the Big Bang) may potentially explain the low chemical enrichment associated with this black hole.</description>
