      <title>Autodifferentiable Geometric Restraints for Enhanced Sampling Simulations with Classical and Machine Learned Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of external restraints is ubiquitous in advanced molecular simulation techniques. In general, restraints serve to reduce the configurational space that is available for sampling, thereby reducing the computational demands associated with a given simulations. Examples include the use of positional restraints in docking simulations or positional restraints in studies of catalysis. Past work has sought to couple complex restraining potentials with enhanced sampling methods, including Metadynamics or Extended Adaptive Biasing Force approaches. Here, we introduce the use of more general geometric potentials coupled with enhanced sampling methods that incorporate neural networks or spectral decomposition to achieve more efficient sampling in the context of advanced materials design.</description>

      <title>The Use of Wigner Expansion and Path Integral Method for Quantum Correction of the Low-Order Spectral Moments and Collision-Induced Absorption Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims at examination of the lower-order spectral moments in collision-induced absorption (CIA), taking the translational He-Ar band as an example. General quantum corrections for the zeroth and first spectral moments are derived on the basis of the Wigner expansion up to the order of $\hbar^8$ and $\hbar^{10}$, respectively. These corrections were then explored for numerical simulation of the He-Ar moments over the temperature range 50-500 K. The accuracy of the obtained temperature dependencies is validated through the comparison with direct quantum solution of the scattering and bound-state problems as well as with the results obtained using the path integral (PI) approach. Quite satisfactory agreement was achieved as a result of the application of the two independent ways of approximate accounting for the quantum nature of absorption. The robustness of the Wigner expansion and PI corrections was thus demonstrated, both of which can be used to obviate direct quantum simulation of the CIA spectral moments. The approximate method is suggested for an accurate simulation of the CIA spectral profile on the basis of the obtained quantum-corrected moments and the classical trajectory-based formalism.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Conserving Neural Operators for Super-Resolution Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural surrogate solvers can estimate solutions to partial differential equations in physical problems more efficiently than standard numerical methods, but require extensive high-resolution training data. In this paper, we break this limitation; we introduce a framework for super-resolution learning in solid mechanics problems. Our approach allows one to train a high-resolution neural network using only low-resolution data. Our Equilibrium Conserving Operator (ECO) architecture embeds known physics directly into the network to make up for missing high-resolution information during training. We evaluate this ECO-based super-resolution framework that strongly enforces conservation-laws in the predicted solutions on two working examples: embedded pores in a homogenized matrix and randomly textured polycrystalline materials. ECO eliminates the reliance on high-fidelity data and reduces the upfront cost of data collection by two orders of magnitude, offering a robust pathway for resource-efficient surrogate modeling in materials modeling. ECO is readily generalizable to other physics-based problems.</description>

      <title>Generating new coordination compounds via multireference simulations, genetic algorithms and machine learning: the case of Co(II) molecular magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of coordination compounds with target properties often requires years of continuous feedback loop between theory, simulations and experiments. In the case of magnetic molecules, this conventional strategy has indeed led to the breakthrough of single-molecule magnets with working temperatures above nitrogen's boiling point, but at significant costs in terms of resources and time. Here, we propose a computational strategy able to accelerate the discovery of new coordination compounds with desired electronic and magnetic properties. Our approach is based on a combination of high-throughput multireference ab initio methods, genetic algorithms and machine learning. While genetic algorithms allow for an intelligent sampling of the vast chemical space available, machine learning reduces the computational cost by pre-screening molecular properties in advance of their accurate and automated multireference ab initio characterization. Importantly, the presented framework is able to generate novel organic ligands and explore chemical motifs beyond those available in pre-existing structural databases. We showcase the power of this approach by automatically generating new Co(II) mononuclear coordination compounds with record magnetic properties in a fraction of the time required by either experiments or brute-force ab initio approaches</description>

      <title>Equi-Euler GraphNet: An Equivariant, Temporal-Dynamics Informed Graph Neural Network for Dual Force and Trajectory Prediction in Multi-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for enabling digital twin applications across industries. While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</description>

      <title>Accurate Point Defect Energy Levels from Non-Empirical Screened Range-Separated Hybrid Functionals: the Case of Native Vacancies in ZnO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use density functional theory (DFT) with non-empirically tuned screened range-separated hybrid (SRSH) functionals to calculate the electronic properties of native zinc and oxygen vacancy point defects in ZnO, and we predict their defect levels for thermal and optical transitions in excellent agreement with available experiments and prior calculations that use empirical hybrid functionals. The ability of this non-empirical first-principles framework to accurately predict quantities of relevance to both bulk and defect level spectroscopy enables high-accuracy DFT calculations with non-empirical hybrid functionals for defect physics, at a reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Component, Multi-Physics Computational Model for Solving Coupled Cardiac Electromechanics and Vascular Haemodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The circulatory system, comprising the heart and blood vessels, is vital for nutrient transport, waste removal, and homeostasis. Traditional computational models often treat cardiac electromechanics and blood flow dynamics separately, overlooking the integrated nature of the system. This paper presents an innovative approach that couples a 3D electromechanical model of the heart with a 3D fluid mechanics model of vascular blood flow. Using a file-based partitioned coupling scheme, these models run independently while sharing essential data through intermediate files. We validate this approach using solvers developed by separate research groups, each targeting disparate dynamical scales employing distinct discretisation schemes, and implemented in different programming languages. Numerical simulations using idealised and realistic anatomies show that the coupling scheme is reliable and requires minimal additional computation time relative to advancing individual time steps in the heart and blood flow models. Notably, the coupled model predicts muscle displacement and aortic wall shear stress differently than the standalone models, highlighting the importance of coupling between cardiac and vascular dynamics in cardiovascular simulations. Moreover, we demonstrate the model's potential for medical applications by simulating the effects of myocardial scarring on downstream vascular flow. This study presents a paradigm case of how to build virtual human models and digital twins by productive collaboration between teams with complementary expertise.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Eigensolver: A Comparative Analysis of Classical and Quantum Optimization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we study the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) application for the Ising model as a test bed model, in which we pivotally delved into several optimization methods, both classical and quantum, and analyzed the quantum advantage that each of these methods offered, and then we proposed a new combinatorial optimization scheme, deemed as QN-SPSA+PSR which combines calculating approximately Fubini-study metric (QN-SPSA) and the exact evaluation of gradient by Parameter-Shift Rule (PSR). The QN-SPSA+PSR method integrates the QN-SPSA computational efficiency with the precise gradient computation of the PSR, improving both stability and convergence speed while maintaining low computational consumption. Our results provide a new potential quantum supremacy in the VQAs's optimization subroutine, even in Quantum Machine Learning's optimization section, and enhance viable paths toward efficient quantum simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Computing (NISQ) devices. Additionally, we also conducted a detailed study of quantum circuit ansatz structures in order to find the one that would work best with the Ising model and NISQ, in which we utilized the properties of the investigated model.</description>

      <title>Dislocation-density based crystal plasticity: stability and attractors in slip rate driven processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dislocation-density based crystal plasticity (CP) models are introduced to account for the microstructral changes throughout the deformation process, enabling more quantitative predictions of the deformation process compared to slip-system resistance-based plasticity models. In this work, we present a stability analysis of slip rate driven processes for some established dislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model and its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation density model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of such systems. Interestingly, we demonstrate that even size-independent models can exhibit size-dependent effects through variations in initial dislocation density. Notably, the initial dislocation density significantly influences material hardening or softening responses. To further explore these phenomena, we conduct numerical simulations of micro-pillar compression using an Eulerian crystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based CP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale materials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical devices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Heat Transport via Evanescent Radiation by Hot Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict an additional thermal transport pathway across metal/non-metal interfaces with large electron-phonon non-equilibrium via evanescent radiative heat transfer. In such systems, electron scattering processes vary drastically and can be leveraged to guide heat across interfaces via radiative heat transport without engaging the lattice directly. We employ the formalism of fluctuational electrodynamics to simulate the spectral radiative heat flux across the interface of a metal film and a non-metal substrate. We find that the radiative conductance can exceed 300 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ at an electron temperature of 5000 K for an emitting tungsten film on a hexagonal boron nitride substrate, becoming comparable to its conductive counterpart. This allows for a more holistic approach to the heat flow across interfaces, accounting for electron-phonon non-equilibrium and ultrafast near-field phonon-polariton coupling.</description>

      <title>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures provide local field enhancement to be used as efficiency-boosting tools in fluorescence-based applications. For photostable quantum dots (QDs) to have enhanced emission, their size and exact location in the proximity of plasmonic nanostructure become key parameters while constructing light emitting devices. However, plasmonic nanostructures mostly suffer from non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which hinders the ultimate performance of fluorophores. In this work, we provided critical interparticle distances through finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, where the radiative decay rate is equalized to the non-radiative counterpart for light emitting QD-based technologies. To show the promises of the QD placement at a critical distance, we demonstrate an optical switch for the fluorescence efficiency of a CdSe/ZnS core-shell QD (CSQD) by optically exciting the silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance. While the provided single particle spectroscopy allows for the observation of heterogeneity in CSQD-AgNP coupling that is often masked in ensemble measurements, our benchmark study serves as a base reference for the development of QD-based light emitting technologies by resolving the optically switchable active tuning of radiative decay rates.</description>
