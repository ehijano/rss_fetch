      <title>Corrigendum to: Elliptic Boundary Value Problems with Fractional Regularity Data: The First Order Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preliminary material of the monograph (arXiv:1607.03852) written by the first two authors contains two major imprecisions that necessitates a number of (in the end harmless) changes throughout the entire text. One is about identification of abstract and concrete Hardy spaces for perturbed Dirac operators, the other one about interpolation of quasi-Banach function spaces. Since these erroneous statements are not unlikely to spread, we provide a detailed corrigendum, including further background and corrected statements for all affected results. All other results remain unchanged.</description>

      <title>A unique continuation property for $|\overline \partial u| \leq V |u|$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $u: \Omega \subset \mathbb C^n \to \mathbb C^m$, for $n \geq 2$ and $m \geq 1$. Let $1 \leq p \leq 2$, and $2(2n)^2 -1 \leq q &lt; \infty$ such that $\displaystyle \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{p'} = 1$ and $\displaystyle \frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{p'} = \frac{1}{q}$. Suppose $|\overline \partial u| \leq V |u|$, where $V \in L^q_{\operatorname{loc}}(\Omega)$. Then $u$ has a unique continuation property in the following sense: if $u \in W^{1,p}_{\operatorname{loc}}(\Omega)$ and for some $z_0 \in \Omega$, $\| u \|_{L^{p'}(B(z_0,r))} $ decays faster than any powers of $r$ as $r \to 0$, then $u \equiv 0$. The same result holds for $q=\infty$ if $u$ is scalar-valued ($m=1$).</description>

      <title>Bergman spaces and reproducing kernel for the biquaternionic Vekua equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the main properties of the Bergman spaces of weak $L_p$- solutions for a biquaternionic Vekua equation of the form \[ \mathbf{D}w(x)-\mathbf{Q}_Aw(x)=0 \] on bounded domains of $\mathbb{R}^3$, where the operator $\mathbf{Q}_A$ involves quaternionic conjugation and multiplications, both left and right, by essentially bounded functions. Properties such as completeness, separability, and reflexivity are shown. It is demonstrated that the solutions belonging to the Bergman spaces are locally H\"older continuous and that the evaluation maps are bounded in the $L_p$-norm. Consequently, for the case $p=2$, we obtain a reproducing integral kernel and an explicit formula for the orthogonal projection onto the Bergman space. For $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, the explicit form for the annihilator of the Bergman space in the dual $L_{p'}$ is presented, along with an orthogonal decomposition for $L_2$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative analysis and its applications for Keller-Segel type systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the De Giorgi iteration to quantitatively analyze the upper bound of solutions for Keller-Segel type systems. The refined upper bound estimate presented here has broad applications in determining large time behaviours of weak solutions and improving the regularity for models involving the $p$-Laplace operator. To demonstrate the applicability of our findings, we investigate the asymptotic stability of a chemotaxis model with nonlinear signal production and a chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes model with a logistic source. Additionally, within the context of $p$-Laplacian diffusion, we establish H\"{o}lder continuity for a chemotaxis-haptotaxis model and a chemotaxis-Stokes model.</description>

      <title>On the density patch problem for the 2-D inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first construct a class of global strong solutions for the 2-D inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations under very general assumption that the initial density is only bounded and the initial velocity is in $H^1(\mathbb{R}^2)$. With suitable assumptions on the initial density, which includes the case of density patch and vacuum bubbles, we prove that Lions' s weak solution is the same as the strong solution with the same initial data. In particular, this gives a complete resolution of the density patch problem proposed by Lions: {\it for the density patch data $\rho_0=1_{D}$ with a smooth bounded domain $D\subset\mathbb{R}^2$, the regularity of $D$ is preserved by the time evolution of Lions's weak solution.}</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions to a class of $(2, q)$-Laplacian equations in the strongly sublinear regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence and multiplicity of normalized solutions for the following $(2, q)$-Laplacian equation \begin{equation}\label{Equation} \left\{\begin{aligned} &amp;-\Delta u-\Delta_q u+\lambda u=g(u),\quad x \in \mathbb{R}^N, &amp;\|u\|_2^2 =c^2, \end{aligned}\right. \tag{$\mathscr E_\lambda$} \end{equation} where $1&lt;q&lt;N$, $\Delta_q=\operatorname{div}\left(|\nabla u|^{q-2} \nabla u\right)$ is the $q$-Laplacian operator, $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier and $c&gt;0$ is a constant. The nonlinearity $g:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous and the behaviour of $g$ at the origin is allowed to be strongly sublinear, i.e., $\lim \limits_{s \rightarrow 0} g(s) / s=-\infty$, which includes the logarithmic nonlinearity $$g(s)= s \log s^2.$$ We consider a family of approximating problems that can be set in $H^1\left(\mathbb{R}^N\right)\cap D^{1, q}\left(\mathbb{R}^N\right)$ and the corresponding least-energy solutions. Then, we prove that such a family of solutions converges to a least-energy solution to the original problem. Additionally, under certain assumptions about $g$ that allow us to work in a suitable subspace of $H^1\left(\mathbb{R}^N\right)\cap D^{1, q}\left(\mathbb{R}^N\right)$, we prove the existence of infinitely many solutions of the above $(2, q)$-Laplacian equation.</description>

      <title>Fine Boundary Regularity For The Fractional (p,q)-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we deal with the fine boundary regularity, a weighted H\"{o}lder regularity of weak solutions to the problem involving the fractional $(p,q)$-Laplacian denoted by \begin{eqnarray*}
  \begin{array}{rll}
  (-\Delta)_{p}^{s} u + (-\Delta)_{q}^{s} u &amp;= f(x) &amp;\text{ in } \Omega
  u&amp;=0 &amp;\text{ in } \mathbb{R}^N\setminus\Omega;
  \end{array} \end{eqnarray*} where $\Omega$ is a $C^{1,1}$ bounded domain and $2 \leq p \leq q &lt;\infty.$ For $0&lt;s&lt;1$ and for non-negative data $f\in L^{\infty}(\Omega),$ we employ the nonlocal analogue of the boundary Harnack method to establish that $u/{d_{\Omega}^{s}} \in C^{\alpha}(\Bar{\Omega})$ for some $\alpha \in (0,1),$ where $d_\Omega(x)$ is the distance of $x$ from the boundary. A novel barrier construction allows us to analyse the regularity theory even in the absence of the scaling or the homogeneity properties of the operator. Additionally, we extend our idea to sign changing bounded $f$ as well and prove a fine boundary regularity for fractional $(p,q)$ Laplacian for some range of $s.$</description>

      <title>A fractional approach to strain-gradient plasticity: beyond core-radius of discrete dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a strain-gradient theory for plasticity as the $\Gamma$-limit of discrete dislocation fractional energies, without the introduction of a core-radius. By using the finite horizon fractional gradient introduced by Bellido, Cueto, and Mora-Corral of 2023, we consider a nonlocal model of semi-discrete dislocations, in which the stored elastic energy is computed via the fractional gradient of order $1-\alpha$. As $\alpha$ goes to $0$, we show that suitably rescaled energies $\Gamma$-converge to the macroscopic strain-gradient model of Garroni, Leoni, and Ponsiglione of 2010.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Sobolev spaces W^{1,p}(V) and W_0^{1,p}(V) on a locally finite graph G=(V,E), which are fundamental tools when we apply the variational methods to partial differential equations on graphs. As a key contribution of this note, we show that in general, W^{1,p}(V) is not equivalent to W_0^{1,p}(V) on locally finite graphs, which is different from the situation on Euclidean space R^N.</description>

      <title>Null controllability for stochastic parabolic equations with Robin boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the null controllability of forward and backward linear stochastic parabolic equations with linear Robin (or Fourier) boundary conditions. These equations incorporate zero and first order terms with bounded coefficients. To prove our null controllability results, a key tool will be the derivation of two new global Carleman estimates for the weak solutions of the corresponding adjoint equations in negative Sobolev space. These Carleman estimates are established using a duality method.</description>

      <title>On the existence of solutions for a class of systems of integro-differential equations with the logarithmic Laplacian and drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a system of integro-differential equations in L^2(R, R^N), which contains the logarithmic Laplacian in the presence of transport terms. The linear operators associated with the system satisfy the Fredholm property. By virtue of a fixed point technique, we demonstrate the existence of solutions. We emphasize that the discussion is more complicated than that of the scalar situation as there are more cumbersome technicalities to overcome.</description>

      <title>Microstructures in a two-dimensional frustrated spin system: Scaling regimes and a discrete-to-continuum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study pattern formation within the $J_1$-$J_3$ - spin model on a two-dimensional square lattice in the case of incompatible (ferromagnetic) boundary conditions on the spin field. We derive the discrete-to-continuum $\Gamma$-limit at the helimagnetic/ferromagnetic transition point, which turns out to be characterized by a singularly perturbed multiwell energy functional on gradient fields. Furthermore, we study the scaling law of the discrete minimal energy. The constructions used in the upper bound include besides rather uniform or complex branching-type patterns also structures with vortices. Our results show in particular that in certain parameter regimes the formation of vortices is energetically favorable.</description>

      <title>On existence of weak solutions to a Baer-Nunziato type system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a dissipative version of a compressible one velocity Baer--Nunziato type system for a mixture of two compressible heat conducting gases is considered. The complete existence proof for weak solutions to this system was addressed as an open problem in \cite[Section 5]{KNAC}. The purpose of this paper is to prove the global in time existence of weak solutions to the one velocity Baer--Nunziato type system for arbitrary large initial data. The goal is achieved in three steps. Firstly, the given system is transformed into a new one which possesses the "Navier-Stokes-Fourier" structure. Secondly, the new system is solved by an adaptation of the Feireisl--Lions approach for solving the compressible Navier--Stokes equations. Eventually, the existence of a weak solution to the original one velocity Baer--Nunziato system using the almost uniqueness property of renormalized solutions to pure transport equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a generalized two component Camassa-Holm system. Based on local well-posedness results and lifespan estimates, we establish sharpness of continuity on the data-to-solution map by showing that it is not uniformly continuous from product Sobolev spaces $H^s \times H^{s}$ to $C([0,T]; H^s \times H^{s})$. The proof of nonuniform dependence is based upon approximate solutions.</description>

      <title>Improved lower bound for the radius of analyticity for the modified KdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the initial value problem (IVP) associated to the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation (mKdV) in the defocusing scenario: \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{array}{l} \partial_t u+ \partial_x^3u-u^2\partial_x(u) = 0, \quad x,t\in\mathbb{R}, \\ u(x,0) = u_0(x), \end{array}\right. \end{equation*} where $u$ is a real valued function and the initial data $u_0$ is analytic on $\mathbb{R}$ and has uniform radius of analyticity $\sigma_0$ in the spatial variable.
  It is well-known that the solution $u$ preserves its analyticity with the same radius $\sigma_0$ for at least some time span $0&lt;T_0\le 1$. This local result was obtained in [Nonlinear Differ. Equ. Appl. (2024), 31--68] by proving a trilinear estimate in the Gevrey spaces $G^{\sigma, s}$, $s\geq \frac14$. Global in time behaviour of the solution and algebraic lower bound of the evolution of the radius of analyticity was also studied in authors' earlier works in [Nonlinear Differ. Equ. Appl. (2024), 31--68] and [J. Evol. Equ. 24 No. 42 (2024)] by constructing almost conserved quantities in the classical Gevrey space with $H^1$ and $H^2$ levels of Sobolev regularities. The present study aims to construct a new almost conservation law in the Gevrey space defined with a weight function $\cosh(\sigma|\xi|)$ and use it demonstrate that the local solution $u$ extends globally in time, and the radius of spatial analyticity is bounded from below by $c T^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, for any time $T\geq T_0$. The outcome of this paper represents an improvement on the one achieved by the authors' previous work in [J. Evol. Equ. 24 No. 42 (2024)].</description>

      <title>Stability of a Two-Phase Stokes Problem with Surface Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the well-posedness of a system of partial differential equations that model the dynamics of a two-dimensional Stokes bubble immersed in two-dimensional ambient Stokes fluid of the same viscosity that extends to infinity under the effect of surface tension. We assume that the two fluids are immiscible and incompressible and that there is no interfacial jump in the fluid velocity. For this PDE system, a circular fluid bubble is a steady-state solution. Given an initial contour for the fluid bubble which is sufficiently close to a circle, we show that there exists a unique, global-in-time solution. This unique solution decays to a circle exponentially fast, which means that circular fluid bubbles are stable steady-state solutions. We also obtain a result concerning the regularity of the unique solution, that although the initial perturbation around a circular contour is assumed to be of low regularity, any later perturbation becomes real analytic, hence smooth.</description>

      <title>Existence of nonnegative energy-dissipating solutions to a class of stochastic thin-film equations under weak slippage: Part II -- compactly supported initial data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence of martingale solutions to a class of stochastic thin-film equations for mobility exponents $n \in (2,3)$ and compactly supported initial data. With the perspective to study free-boundary problems related to stochastic thin-film equations in future work, we start from the surface-tension driven stochastic thin-film equation with Stratonovich noise and exploit the regime of coefficients in front of the Stratonovich correction term (which is of porous-media-type) for which energy dissipation can be established. By Bernis inequalities, third order spatial derivatives of appropriate powers of the solution are controlled. Analytically, we rely on approximation with $\mathbb{P}$-almost surely strictly positive solutions and compactness methods based on energy-entropy estimates as well as martingale identification techniques.</description>

Abstract: For mobility exponents $n \in (2,3)$, we prove existence of strictly positive solutions to stochastic thin-film equations with singular effective interface potential and Stratonovich-type lower-order terms. With the perspective of using these solutions in Part II to construct surface-tension-energy dissipating solutions to stochastic thin-film equations with compactly supported initial data, for which finite speed of propagation is shown in future work, we establish decay estimates on the sum of surface-tension energy and effective interface potential -- without relying on further functionals involving initial data. Besides an extension of earlier techniques used in the case $n=2$ and a refinement of oscillation estimates for discrete solutions, the main analytical novelty of this paper is a discretization method which shows nonnegativity for a finite-element counterpart of the integral $\int_{\mathcal O} (u^{n-2}u_{x})_x u_{xx} dx$ under periodic boundary conditions in the parameter regime $n \in (2,3)$. This nonnegativity property serves to control It\^o-correction terms in the estimate for the decay of the surface-tension energy. This way, it is the key to obtain the desired decay estimates for the sum of surface-tension energy and effective interface potential which permit to establish the singular limit of vanishing effective interface potential in Part II.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this work is to prove an instance of the unique continuation principle for area minimizing integral currents. More precisely, consider an $m$-dimensional area minimizing integral current and an $m$-dimensional minimal surface, both contained in $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$ with $n\geq 1$. We show that if, in an integral sense, the current has infinite order of contact with the minimal surface at a point, then the current and the minimal surface coincide in a neighborhood of that point.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Laplacian eigenvalues for smooth planar domains with strongly attractive Robin conditions imposed on a part of the boundary and Neumann condition on the remaining boundary. The asymptotics of individual eigenvalues is described in terms of an effective operator on an interval with boundary conditions at the endpoints. For several typical geometries a more precise asymptotics in terms of the boundary curvature is obtained.</description>

      <title>On Constructions of Fractal Spaces Using Replacement and the Combinatorial Loewner Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combinatorial Loewner property was introduced by Bourdon and Kleiner as a quasismmetrically invariant substitute for the Loewner property for general fractals and boundaries of hyperbolic groups. While the Loewner property is somewhat restrictive, the combinatorial Loewner property is very generic -- Bourdon and Kleiner showed that many familiar fractals and group boundaries satisfy it. If $X$ is quasisymmetric to a Loewner space, it has the combinatorial Loewner property. Kleiner conjectured in 2006 that the converse to this holds for self-similar fractals -- the hope being that this would lead to the existence of many exotic Loewner spaces. We disprove this conjecture and give the first examples of spaces which are self-similar and combinatorially Loewner and which are not quasisymmetric to Loewner spaces.
  In the process we introduce a self-similar replacement rule, called a linear replacement rule, which is inspired by the work of Laakso. This produces a new rich class of fractal spaces, where closed form computations of potentials and their conformal dimensions are possible. These spaces exhibit a rich class of behaviors from analysis on fractals in regards to diffusions, Sobolev spaces, energy measures and conformal dimensions. These behaviors expand on the known examples of Cantor sets, gaskets, Vicsek sets, and the often too difficult carpet-like spaces. Especially the counter examples to Kleiner's conjecture that arise from this construction are interesting, since they open up the possibility to study the new realm of combinatorially Loewner spaces that are not quasisymmetric to Loewner spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the KPZ equation in $1$ spatial dimension with noise that is rougher than white by an exponent $\gamma&gt;1/4$. Under a weak coupling limit, formally removing the nonlinearity from the equation, we show using regularity structures that the renormalised solutions converge to a Gaussian limit that is different from the solution of the linear part of the equation. The regime of this effect has a nontrivial overlap with the subcritical regime $\gamma&lt;1/2$.</description>

      <title>Unboundedness phenomenon in a model of urban crime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.01016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that spatial patterns ("hotspots") may form in the crime model
  \begin{equation}
  \left\{\;
  \begin{aligned}
  u_{t} &amp;= \tfrac{1}{\varepsilon}\Delta u - \tfrac{\chi}{\varepsilon} \nabla \cdot \left(\tfrac{u}{v} \nabla v \right) - \varepsilon uv, \\
  v_{t} &amp;= \Delta v - v + u v,
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
  \end{equation}
  which we consider in $\Omega = B_R(0) \subset \mathbb R^n$, $R &gt; 0$, $n \geq 3$ with $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, $\chi &gt; 0$ and initial data $u_0$, $v_0$ with sufficiently large initial mass $m := \int_\Omega u_0$.
  More precisely, for each $T &gt; 0$ and fixed $\Omega$, $\chi$ and (large) $m$, we construct initial data $v_0$ exhibiting the following unboundedness phenomenon: Given any $M&gt;0$, we can find $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ such that the first component of the associated maximal solution becomes larger than $M$ at some point in $\Omega$ before the time $T$. Since the $L^1$ norm of $u$ is decreasing, this implies that some heterogeneous structure must form.
  We do this by first constructing classical solutions to the nonlocal scalar problem
  \[
  w_t = \Delta w + m \frac{w^{\chi+1}}{\int_\Omega w^\chi}
  \]
  from the solutions to the crime model by taking the limit $\varepsilon \searrow 0$ under the assumption that the unboundedness phenomenon explicitly does not occur on some interval $(0,T)$. We then construct initial data for this scalar problem leading to blow-up before time $T$. As solutions to the scalar problem are unique, this proves our central result by contradiction.</description>

      <title>Semi-discrete modeling of systems of wedge disclinations and edge dislocations via the Airy stress function method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.02511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a variational theory for lattice defects of rotational and translational type. We focus on finite systems of planar wedge disclinations, disclination dipoles, and edge dislocations, which we model as the solutions to minimum problems for isotropic elastic energies under the constraint of kinematic incompatibility. Operating under the assumption of planar linearized kinematics, we formulate the mechanical equilibrium problem in terms of the Airy stress function, for which we introduce a rigorous analytical formulation in the context of incompatible elasticity. Our main result entails the analysis of the energetic equivalence of systems of disclination dipoles and edge dislocations in the asymptotics of their singular limit regimes. By adopting the regularization approach via core radius, we show that, as the core radius vanishes, the asymptotic energy expansion for disclination dipoles coincides with the energy of finite systems of edge dislocations. This proves that Eshelby's kinematic characterization of an edge dislocation in terms of a disclination dipole is exact also from the energetic standpoint.</description>

      <title>A general nonlinear characterization of stochastic incompleteness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic incompleteness of a Riemannian manifold $M$ amounts to the nonconservation of probability for the heat semigroup on $M$. We show that this property is equivalent to the existence of nonnegative, nontrivial, bounded (sub)solutions to $\Delta W=\psi(W)$ for one, hence all, general nonlinearity $\psi$ which is only required to be continuous, nondecreasing, with $\psi(0)=0$ and $\psi&gt;0$ in $(0,+\infty)$. Similar statements hold for unsigned (sub)solutions. We also prove that stochastic incompleteness is equivalent to the nonuniqueness of bounded solutions to the nonlinear parabolic equation $\partial_t u =\Delta\phi(u)$ with bounded initial data for one, hence all, general nonlinearity $\phi$ which is only required to be continuous, nondecreasing and nonconstant. Such a generality allows us to deal with equations of both fast-diffusion and porous-medium type, as well as with the one-phase and two-phase classical Stefan problems, which seem to have never been investigated in the manifold setting.</description>

      <title>Sedimentation of particles with very small inertia I: Convergence to the transport-Stokes equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04637v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the sedimentation of $N$ spherical particles with identical radii $R$ in a Stokes flow in $\mathbb R^3$. The particles satisfy a no-slip boundary condition and are subject to constant gravity. The dynamics of the particles is modeled by Newton's law but with very small particle inertia as $N$ tends to infinity and $R$ to $0$. In a mean-field scaling, we show that the particle evolution is well approximated by the transport-Stokes system which has been derived previously as the mean-field limit of inertialess particles. In particular this justifies to neglect the particle inertia in the microscopic system, which is a typical modelling assumption in this and related contexts. The proof is based on a relative energy argument that exploits the coercivity of the particle forces with respect to the particle velocities in a Stokes flow. We combine this with an adaptation of Hauray's method for mean-field limits to $2$-Wasserstein distances.Moreover, in order to control the minimal distance between particles, we prove a representation of the particle forces. This representation makes the heuristic \enquote{Stokes law} rigorous that the force on each particle is proportional to the difference of the velocity of the individual particle and the mean-field fluid velocity generated by the other particles.</description>

      <title>Global Solutions for Two-Phase Complex Fluids with Quadratic Anchoring in Soft Matter Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a diffuse interface model describing the complex rheology and the interfacial dynamics during phase separation in a polar liquid-crystalline emulsion. More precisely, the physical systems comprises a two-phase mixture consisting in a polar liquid crystal immersed in a Newtonian fluid. Such composite material is a paradigmatic example of complex fluids arising in Soft Matter which exhibits multiscale interplay. Beyond the Ginzburg-Landau and Frank elastic energies for the concentration and the polarization, the free energy of the system is characterized by a quadratic anchoring term which tunes the orientation of the polarization at the interface. This leads to several quasi-linear nonlinear couplings in the resulting system describing the macroscopic dynamics. In this work, we establish the first mathematical results concerning the global dynamics of two-phase complex fluids with interfacial anchoring mechanism. First, we determine a set of sufficient conditions on the parameters of the system and the initial conditions which guarantee the existence of global weak solutions in two and three dimensions. Secondly, we show that weak solutions are unique and globally regular in the two dimensional case. Finally, we complement our analysis with some numerical simulations to display polarization and interfacial anchoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the initial value problems (IVPs) for the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation \begin{equation*} \label{mKdV} \left\{\begin{array}{l} \partial_t u+ \partial_x^3u+\mu u^2\partial_xu =0, \quad x\in\mathbb{R},\; t\in \mathbb{R} , \\ u(x,0) = u_0(x), \end{array}\right. \end{equation*} where $u$ is a real valued function and $\mu=\pm 1$, and the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with third order dispersion (tNLS equation in short) \begin{equation*} \label{t-NLS} \left\{\begin{array}{l} \partial_t v+i\alpha \partial_x^2v+\beta \partial_x^3v+i\gamma |v|^2v = 0, \quad x\in\mathbb{R},\; t\in\mathbb{R} , \\ v(x,0) = v_0(x), \end{array}\right. \end{equation*} where $\alpha, \beta$ and $\gamma$ are real constants and $v$ is a complex valued function. In both problems, the initial data $u_0$ and $v_0$ are analytic on $\mathbb{R}$ and have uniform radius of analyticity $\sigma_0$ in the space variable.
  We prove that the both IVPs are locally well-posed for such data by establishing an analytic version of the trilinear estimates, and showed that the radius of spatial analyticity of the solution remains the same $\sigma_0$ till some lifespan $0&lt;T_0\le 1$. We also consider the evolution of the radius of spatial analyticity $\sigma(t)$ when the local solution extends globally in time and prove that for any time $T\ge T_0$ it is bounded from below by $c T^{-\frac43}$, for the mKdV equation in the defocusing case ($\mu = -1$) and by $c T^{-(4+\varepsilon)}$, $\varepsilon&gt;0$, for the tNLS equation. The result for the mKdV equation improves the one obtained in [ J. L. Bona, Z. Gruji\'c and H. Kalisch, Algebraic lower bounds for the uniform radius of spatial analyticity for the generalized KdV equation, Ann Inst. H. Poincar\'e 22 (2005) 783--797] and, as far as we know, the result for the tNLS equation is the new one.</description>

Abstract: The mysterious phenomena of revivals in linear dispersive periodic equations was discovered first experimentally in optics in the 19th century, then rediscovered several times by theoretical and experimental investigations. While the term has been used systematically and consistently by many authors, there is no consensus on a rigorous definition. In this paper, we describe revivals modulo a regularity condition in a large class of Schr\"odinger's equations with complex bounded potentials. As we show, at rational times the solution is given explicitly by finite linear combinations of translations and dilations of the initial datum, plus an additional continuous term.</description>

Abstract: We study stability and inclusion of the jump set of minimizers of convex denoising functionals, such as the celebrated "Rudin-Osher-Fatemi" functional, for scalar or vectorial signals. We show that under mild regularity assumptions on the data fidelity term and the regularizer, the jump set of the minimizer is essentially a subset of the original jump set. Moreover, we give an estimate on the magnitude of jumps in terms of the data. This extends old results, in particular of the first author (with V. Caselles and M. Novaga) and of T. Valkonen, to much more general cases. We also consider the case where the original datum has unbounded variation, and define a notion of its jump set which, again, must contain the jump set of the solution.</description>

Abstract: The paper addresses the doubly elliptic eigenvalue problem $$\begin{cases} -\Delta u=\lambda u \qquad &amp;\text{in $\Omega$,}\\ u=0 &amp;\text{on $\Gamma_0$,}\\ -\Delta_\Gamma u +\partial_\nu u =\lambda u\qquad &amp;\text{on $\Gamma_1$,} \end{cases} $$ where $\Omega$ is a bounded open subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ ($N\ge 2$) with $C^1$ boundary $\Gamma=\Gamma_0\cup\Gamma_1$, $\Gamma_0\cap\Gamma_1=\emptyset$, $\Gamma_1$ being nonempty and relatively open on $\Gamma$. Moreover $\mathcal{H}^{N-1}(\overline{\Gamma}_0\cap\overline{\Gamma}_1)=0$ and $\mathcal{H}^{N-1}(\Gamma_0)&gt;0$. We recognize that $L^2(\Omega)\times L^2(\Gamma_1)$ admits a Hilbert basis of eigenfunctions of the problem and we describe the eigenvalues. Moreover, when $\Gamma$ is at least $C^2$ and $\overline{\Gamma}_0\cap\overline{\Gamma}_1=\emptyset$, we give several qualitative properties of the eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>On the Capacities Associated with Local Muckenhoupt Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06810v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of capacities associated with local Muckenhoupt weights. Fundamental properties of local Muckenhoupt weights will be revisited. Weak type boundedness of nonlinear potential and capacitary strong type inequalities associated with such weights will be addressed. The boundedness of the local maximal function on the spaces of Choquet integrals associated with such weighted capacities will be justified as an application of the theory. We also address on the thinness of sets with the Kellogg property as another application.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of singular solutions to the fractional Yamabe problem on spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove nonuniqueness results for complete metrics with constant positive fractional curvature conformal to the round metric on $S^n \setminus S^k$, using bifurcation techniques. These are singular (positive) solutions to a non-local equation with critical non-linearity.</description>
