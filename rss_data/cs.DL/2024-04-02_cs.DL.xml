      <title>A First Ontological Model for the Description of the Art Market in the Semantic Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation presents the first version of a project at the Fondazione Federico Zeri, aimed at modelling the art market starting from the recognition of the peculiarities of this sector and relying on the data collected by this institute during its research activities on its documentary collection. Specifically, this study describes the development of an ontology, able to describe agents, events and sources which define the art market and enable its investigation. The recognition of existing conceptual models is hence followed by the description of the adopted methodology, based on the protocol SAMOD. The central section provides a general overview of the final ontology, integrating the results of a preliminary study. Lastly, the appendix lists motivating scenarios, examples and competency questions collected during the first SAMOD iterations, as well as a first alignment with existing models.</description>

      <title>Forensic Scientometrics -- An emerging discipline to protect the scholarly record</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forensic Scientometrics (FoSci) is emerging as a vital discipline at the intersection of scientific integrity and security. Scholarship and scholarly communication are critical for maintaining scientific integrity, influencing public trust in science, health, technology, policy, and law. Yet, these foundations are threatened by the misuse of scientific research for personal, commercial, ideological, and geopolitical gains, including questionable practices and misconduct. The rise of paper mills and predatory publishers, along with ideological and geopolitical motivations, undermines academic integrity. This field pioneers the integration of traditional scientometric methods with ethics to address pressing challenges in research integrity and security, crucial in an era of heightened scrutiny over science's reliability. FoSci's development signifies a collective commitment to maintaining scientific trust, marked by a call for official recognition and support from stakeholders across the scientific ecosystem.</description>

      <title>How biomedical papers accumulated their clinical citations: A large-scale retrospective analysis based on PubMed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explored the temporal characteristics of clinical citations of biomedical papers, including how long it takes to receive its first clinical citation (the initial stage) and how long it takes to receive two or more clinical citations after its first clinical citation (the build-up stage). Over 23 million biomedical papers in PubMed between 1940 and 2013 and their clinical citations are used as the research data. We divide these biomedical papers into three groups and four categories from clinical citation level and translational science perspectives. We compare the temporal characteristics of biomedical papers of different groups or categories. From the perspective of clinical citation level, the results show that highly clinically cited papers had obvious advantages of receiving clinical citations over medium and lowly clinically cited papers in both the initial and build-up stages. Meanwhile, as the number of clinical citations increased in the build-up stage, the difference in the length of time to receive the corresponding number of clinical citations among the three groups of biomedical papers significantly increased. From the perspective of translational science, the results reveal that biomedical papers closer to clinical science more easily receive clinical citations than papers closer to basic science in both the initial and build-up stages. Moreover, we found that highly clinically cited papers had the desperate advantage of receiving clinical citations over even the clinical guidelines or clinical trials. The robustness analysis of the two aspects demonstrates the reliability of our results.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Increasing Use of LLMs in Scientific Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific publishing lays the foundation of science by disseminating research findings, fostering collaboration, encouraging reproducibility, and ensuring that scientific knowledge is accessible, verifiable, and built upon over time. Recently, there has been immense speculation about how many people are using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in their academic writing, and to what extent this tool might have an effect on global scientific practices. However, we lack a precise measure of the proportion of academic writing substantially modified or produced by LLMs. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic, large-scale analysis across 950,965 papers published between January 2020 and February 2024 on the arXiv, bioRxiv, and Nature portfolio journals, using a population-level statistical framework to measure the prevalence of LLM-modified content over time. Our statistical estimation operates on the corpus level and is more robust than inference on individual instances. Our findings reveal a steady increase in LLM usage, with the largest and fastest growth observed in Computer Science papers (up to 17.5%). In comparison, Mathematics papers and the Nature portfolio showed the least LLM modification (up to 6.3%). Moreover, at an aggregate level, our analysis reveals that higher levels of LLM-modification are associated with papers whose first authors post preprints more frequently, papers in more crowded research areas, and papers of shorter lengths. Our findings suggests that LLMs are being broadly used in scientific writings.</description>

      <title>BrainKnow -- Extracting, Linking, and Associating Neuroscience Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vast accumulation of neuroscience knowledge presents a challenge for researchers to timely and accurately locate the specific information they require. Constructing a knowledge engine that automatically extracts and organizes information from academic papers can provide researchers with timely and accurate informational services. We present the Brain Knowledge Engine (BrainKnow), which extracts and integrates neuroscience knowledge from published papers from PubMed. BrainKnow comprises a substantial repository, containing 3,626,931 relations spanning a broad spectrum of 37,011 neuroscience concepts extracted from 1817744 articles. The relations in BrainKnow can be accessed and navigated through a user-friendly web interface. Additionally, BrainKnow employs graph network algorithms for the recommendation and visualization of knowledge. BrainKnow is capable of automatic real-time updates. BrainKnow represents the first neuroscience knowledge graph that not only integrates knowledge in-depth but also facilitates fully automated updates.</description>
