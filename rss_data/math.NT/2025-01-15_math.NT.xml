      <title>Bounds on the hermitian u-invariants under quadratic field extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hermitian u-invariants of a central simple algebra with involution are studied. In this context, a new technique is obtained to give bounds for the behavior of these invariants under a quadratic field extension. This is applied to obtain bounds in terms of the index and the u-invariant of the base field.</description>

      <title>Generalized Euler numbers and ordered set partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euler numbers have been widely studied. A signed version of the Euler numbers of even subscript are given by the coefficients of the exponential generating function 1/(1+x^2/2!+x^4/4!+...). Leeming and MacLeod introduced a generalization of the Euler numbers depending on an integer parameter d where one takes the coefficients of the expansion of 1/(1+x^d/d!+x^{2d}/(2d)!+...). These numbers have been shown to have many interesting properties despite being much less studied. And the techniques used have been mainly algebraic. We propose a combinatorial model for them as signed sums over ordered partitions. We show that this approach can be used to prove a number of old and new results including a recursion, integrality, and various congruences. Our methods include sign-reversing involutions and M\"obius inversion over partially ordered sets.</description>

      <title>Rational points on the non-split Cartan modular curve of level 27 and quadratic Chabauty over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to work of Rouse, Sutherland, and Zureick-Brown, it is known exactly which subgroups of GL$_2(\mathbf{Z}_3)$ can occur as the image of the $3$-adic Galois representation attached to a non-CM elliptic curve over $\mathbf{Q}$, with a single exception: the normaliser of the non-split Cartan subgroup of level 27. In this paper, we complete the classification of 3-adic Galois images by showing that the normaliser of the non-split Cartan subgroup of level 27 cannot occur as a 3-adic Galois image of a non-CM elliptic curve.
  Our proof proceeds via computing the $\mathbf{Q}(\zeta_3)$-rational points on a certain smooth plane quartic curve $X'_H$ (arising as a quotient of the modular curve $X_{ns}^+(27)$) defined over $\mathbf{Q}(\zeta_3)$ whose Jacobian has Mordell--Weil rank 6. To this end, we describe how to carry out the quadratic Chabauty method for a modular curve $X$ defined over a number field $F$, which, when applicable, determines a finite subset of $X(F\otimes\mathbf{Q}_p)$ in certain situations of larger Mordell--Weil rank than previously considered. Together with an analysis of local heights above 3, we apply this quadratic Chabauty method to determine $X'_H(\mathbf{Q}(\zeta_3))$. This allows us to compute the set $X_{ns}^+(27)(\mathbf{Q})$, finishing the classification of 3-adic images of Galois.</description>

      <title>Relating flat connections and polylogarithms on higher genus Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we relate two recent constructions that generalize classical (genus-zero) polylogarithms to higher-genus Riemann surfaces. A flat connection valued in a freely generated Lie algebra on a punctured Riemann surface of arbitrary genus produces an infinite family of homotopy-invariant iterated integrals associated to all possible words in the alphabet of the Lie algebra generators. Each iterated integral associated to a word is a higher-genus polylogarithm. Different flat connections taking values in the same Lie algebra on a given Riemann surface may be related to one another by the composition of a gauge transformation and an automorphism of the Lie algebra, thus producing closely related families of polylogarithms. In this paper we provide two methods to explicitly construct this correspondence between the meromorphic multiple-valued connection introduced by Enriquez in e-Print 1112.0864 and the non-meromorphic single-valued and modular-invariant connection introduced by D'Hoker, Hidding and Schlotterer, in e-Print 2306.08644.</description>

      <title>A modular approach to Fermat equations of signature $(p,p,5)$ using Frey hyperelliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we carry out the steps of Darmon's program for the generalized Fermat equation $$ x^n + y^n = z^5. $$ In particular, we develop the machinery necessary to prove an optimal bound on the exponent $n$ for solutions satisfying certain $2$-adic and $5$-adic conditions which are natural from the point of view of the method. We also reduce the problem of resolving this equation to a `big image conjecture', completing a line of ideas suggested in his original program.
  The above equation is an example of a generalized Fermat equation for which the predicted Frey abelian varieties have dimension $ &gt; 1$ and thus it represents an interesting test case for Darmon's program.</description>

      <title>A note on necessary conditions for a friend of 10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00624v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solitary numbers are shrouded with mystery. A folklore conjecture assert that 10 is a solitary number i.e. it has no friends. In this article, we establish that if $N$ is a friend of $10$ then it must be odd square with at least seven distinct prime factors, with $5$ being the least one. Moreover there exists a prime factor $p$ of $N$ such that $2a+1\equiv 0 \pmod f$ and $5^{f}\equiv 1 \pmod p$ where $f$ is the smallest odd positive integer greater than $1$ and less than or equal to $\min\{ 2a+1,p-1\}$, provided $5^{2a}\mid \mid N$. Further, there exist prime factors $p$ and $q$ (not necessarily distinct) of $N$ such that $p\equiv1 \pmod {10}$ and $q\equiv 1\pmod 6$. Besides, we prove that if a Fermat prime $F_k$ divides $N$ then $N$ must have a prime factor congruent to $1$ modulo $2F_k$. Also, if we consider the form of $N$ as $N=5^{2a}m^2$ then $m$ is non square-free. Furthermore, we show that $\Omega(N)\geq 2\omega(N)+6a-4$ and if $\Omega(m)\leq K$ then $N&lt; 5\cdot 6^{(2^{K-2a+1}-1)^2}$ where $\Omega(n)$ and $\omega(n)$ denote the total number of prime factors and the number of distinct prime factors of the integer $n$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Sum of Consecutive Terms of Pell and Related Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study new identities related to the sums of adjacent terms in the Pell sequence, defined by $P_{n} := 2P_{n-1}+P_{n-2}$ for $ n\geq 2$ and $P_{0}=0, P_{1}=1$, and generalize these identities for many similar sequences. We prove that the sum of $N&gt;1$ consecutive Pell numbers is a fixed integer multiple of another Pell number if and only if $4\mid N$. We consider the generalized Pell $(k,i)$-numbers defined by $p(n) :=\ 2p(n-1)+p(n-k-1) $ for $n\geq k+1$, with $p(0)=p(1)=\cdots =p(i)=0$ and $p(i+1)=\cdots = p(k)=1$ for $0\leq i\leq k-1$, and prove that the sum of $N=2k+2$ consecutive terms is a fixed integer multiple of another term in the sequence. We also prove that for the generalized Pell $(k,k-1)$-numbers such a relation does not exist when $N$ and $k$ are odd. We give analogous results for the Fibonacci and other related second-order recursive sequences.</description>

      <title>Constructions of well-rounded algebraic lattices over odd prime degree cyclic number fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algebraic lattices are those obtained from modules in the ring of integers of algebraic number fields through the canonical or twisted embeddings. In turn, well-rounded lattices are those with maximal cardinality of linearly independent vectors in its set of minimal vectors. Both classes of lattices have been applied for signal transmission in some channels, such as wiretap channels. Recently, some advances have been made in the search for well-rounded lattices that can be realized as algebraic lattices. Moreover, some works have been published studying algebraic lattices obtained from modules in cyclic number fields of odd prime degree $p$. In this work, we generalize some results of a recent work of Tran et al. and we provide new constructions of well-rounded algebraic lattices from a certain family of modules in the ring of integers of each of these fields when $p$ is ramified in its extension over the field of rational numbers.</description>

      <title>Artin-Schreier-Witt lifts of purely inseparable extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a discrete valued field $K$ of positive characteristic, we study the cyclic lifting problem of purely inseparable extensions of the residue field. We prove that unlike the mixed characteristic case, cyclic lifts of any finite purely inseparable modular extension exist and show how to explicitly construct them. Moreover, given such a residual extension, we prove the existence of Artin-Schreier-Witt lifts of any finite degree. This follows from a more general construction based on the notion of $\mathcal{G}$-weaves and $\mathcal{G}$-cyclic extensions where $\mathcal{G}$ is an arbitrary gene over $K$. In particular, this gives an affirmative answer to a question in \cite{ramification_survey} as well as implies that there is no cap on the wild ramification index unlike the mixed characteristic case. We also show some interesting applications such as constructing cyclic lifts of fields that are isomorphic to the tensor product of a purely inseparable modular extension and an Artin-Schreier-Witt extension. Finally, we prove a structure theorem of Artin-Schreier-Witt extensions over a discrete valued fields which restricts the ramification type of intermediate field extensions complementing the above results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09701v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any positive integer $r$, Nahm's problem is to determine all $r\times r$ rational positive definite matrix $A$, $r$-dimensional rational vector $B$ and rational scalar $C$ such that the rank $r$ Nahm sum associated with $(A,B,C)$ is modular. Around 2007, Zagier conjectured that if the rank $r$ Nahm sum for $(A,B,C)$ is modular, then so is the dual Nahm sum associated with $(A^{-1},A^{-1}B,B^\mathrm{T} A^{-1}B/2-{r}/{24}-C)$. We construct some explicit rank four Nahm sums which are modular while their duals are not modular. This provides counterexamples to Zagier's duality conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number and $\zeta_p$ a primitive $p$-th root of unity. Chebotarev's theorem states that every square submatrix of the $p \times p$ matrix $(\zeta_p^{ij})_{i,j=0}^{p-1}$ is non-singular. In this paper we prove the same for principal submatrices of $(\zeta_n^{ij})_{i,j=0}^{n-1}$, when $n=pr$ is the product of two distinct primes, and $p$ is a large enough prime that has order $r-1$ in $\mathbf{Z}_r^*$. As an application, an uncertainty principle for cyclic groups of order $n$ is established when $n=pr$ as described above.</description>

      <title>Iterated Entropy Derivatives and Binary Entropy Inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We embark on a systematic study of the $(k+1)$-th derivative of $x^{k-r}H(x^r)$, where $H(x):=-x\log x-(1-x)\log(1-x)$ is the binary entropy and $k&gt;r\geq 1$ are integers. Our motivation is the conjectural entropy inequality $\alpha_k H(x^k)\geq x^{k-1}H(x)$, where $0&lt;\alpha_k&lt;1$ is given by a functional equation. The $k=2$ case was the key technical tool driving recent breakthroughs on the union-closed sets conjecture. We express $ \frac{d^{k+1}}{dx^{k+1}}x^{k-r}H(x^r)$ as a rational function, an infinite series, and a sum over generalized Stirling numbers. This allows us to reduce the proof of the entropy inequality for real $k$ to showing that an associated polynomial has only two real roots in the interval $(0,1)$, which also allows us to prove the inequality for fractional exponents such as $k=3/2$. The proof suggests a new framework for proving tight inequalities for the sum of polynomials times the logarithms of polynomials, which converts the inequality into a statement about the real roots of a simpler associated polynomial.</description>

      <title>Bailey pairs, radial limits of $q$-hypergeometric false theta functions, and a conjecture of Hikami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper we prove a conjecture of Hikami on the values of the radial limits of a family of $q$-hypergeometric false theta functions. Hikami conjectured that the radial limits are obtained by evaluating a truncated version of the series. He proved a special case of his conjecture by computing the Kashaev invariant of certain torus links in two different ways. We prove the full conjecture using Bailey pairs. In the second part of the paper we show how the framework of Bailey pairs leads to further results of this type.</description>

      <title>Generic decompositions of Deligne--Lusztig representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G_0$ be a reductive group over $\mathbb{F}_p$ with simply connected derived subgroup, (geometrically) connected center and Coxeter number $h+1$. We extend Jantzen's generic decomposition pattern from $(2h-1)$-generic to $h$-generic Deligne--Lusztig representations, which is optimal. We also prove several results on the ``obvious'' Jordan--H\"older factors of general Deligne--Lusztig representations. As an application we improve the weight elimination result of arXiv:1610.04819 [math.NT]</description>

      <title>Totally ramified subfields of $p$-algebras over discrete valued fields with imperfect residue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a complete discrete valued field of characteristic $p$ with residue $k$ which is not necessarily perfect. We prove the Conjecture in \cite{cs} that a $p$-algebra over $K$ contains a totally ramified cyclic maximal subfield if it contains a totally ramified purely inseparable maximal subfield provided $k$ satisfies some conditions on its $p$-rank.</description>

      <title>An in-depth study of the power function $x^{q+2}$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$: the differential, boomerang, and Walsh spectra, with an application to coding theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $q = p^m$, where $p$ is an odd prime number and $m$ is a positive integer. In this paper, we examine the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, which consists of $q^2$ elements. We first present an alternative method to determine the differential spectrum of the power function $f(x) = x^{q+2}$ on $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, incorporating several key simplifications. This methodology provides a new proof of the results established by Man, Xia, Li, and Helleseth in Finite Fields and Their Applications 84 (2022), 102100, which not only completely determine the differential spectrum of $f$ but also facilitate the analysis of its boomerang uniformity.
  Specifically, we determine the boomerang uniformity of $f$ for the cases where $q \equiv 1$ or $3$ (mod $6$), with the exception of the scenario where $p = 5$ and $m$ is even. Furthermore, for $p = 3$, we investigate the value distribution of the Walsh spectrum of $f$, demonstrating that it takes on only four distinct values. Using this result, we derive the weight distribution of a ternary cyclic code with four Hamming weights. The article integrates refined mathematical techniques from algebraic number theory and the theory of finite fields, employing several ingredients, such as exponential sums, to explore the cryptographic analysis of functions over finite fields. They can be used to explore the differential/boomerang uniformity across a wider range of functions.</description>
