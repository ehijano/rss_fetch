      <title>Inequivalence of stochastic and Bohmian arrival times in time-of-flight experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent prediction [Com. Phys., 6, 195 (2023)] that time-of-flight experiments with ultracold atoms could test different interpretations of quantum mechanics, this work investigates the arrival times predicted by the stochastic interpretation, whereby quantum particles follow definite but non-deterministic and non-differentiable trajectories. The distribution of arrival times is obtained from a Fokker-Planck equation, and confirmed by direct simulation of trajectories. It is found to be in general different from the distribution predicted by the Bohmian interpretation, in which quantum particles follow definite deterministic and differentiable trajectories. This result suggests that trajectory-based interpretations of quantum mechanics could be experimentally discriminated.</description>

      <title>Atomic Quantum Technologies for Quantum Matter and Fundamental Physics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics is living an era of unprecedented cross-fertilization among the different areas of science. In this perspective review, we discuss the manifold impact that ultracold-atom quantum technologies can have in fundamental and applied science through platforms for quantum simulation, computation, metrology and sensing. We illustrate how the engineering of table-top experiments with atom technologies is engendering applications to understand problems in condensed matter and fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics, foundational aspects of quantum mechanics, quantum chemistry and the emerging field of quantum biology. We take the perspective of two main approaches, i.e. creating quantum analogues and building quantum simulators, highlighting that independently of the ultimate goal of a universal quantum computer to be met, the remarkable transformative effects of these achievements remain unchanged. We convey three main messages. First, atomic quantum technologies have enabled a new way in which quantum technologies are used for fundamental science, even beyond the advancement of knowledge, which is characterised by truly cross-disciplinary research, extended interplay between theoretical and experimental thinking, and intersectoral approach. Second, quantum many-body physics is taking the center stage in frontier's science. Third, quantum science progress will have capillary impact on society. Thus, the adoption of a responsible research and innovation approach to quantum technologies is mandatory, to accompany citizens in building awareness and future scaffolding. Following on all these reflections, this perspective review is aimed at scientists active or interested in interdisciplinary research, providing the reader with an overview of the current status of these wide fields of research where ultracold-atomic platforms play a vital role in their description and simulation.</description>

      <title>Scalable, ab initio protocol for quantum simulating SU($N$)$\times$U(1) Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a protocol for the scalable quantum simulation of SU($N$)$\times$U(1) lattice gauge theories with alkaline-earth like atoms in optical lattices in both one- and two-dimensional systems. The protocol exploits the combination of naturally occurring SU($N$) pseudo-spin symmetry and strong inter-orbital interactions that is unique to such atomic species. A detailed ab initio study of the microscopic dynamics shows how gauge invariance emerges in an accessible parameter regime, and allows us to identify the main challenges in the simulation of such theories. We provide quantitative results about the requirements in terms of experimental stability in relation to observing gauge invariant dynamics, a key element for a deeper analysis on the functioning of such class of theories in both quantum simulators and computers.</description>
