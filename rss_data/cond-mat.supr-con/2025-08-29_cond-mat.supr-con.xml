      <title>Distinct Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Thermoelectric Transport Across Superconducting Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relaxation dynamics of heat transport in superconductors, shaped by the interplay of diffusion, nonlinearity, and magnetic fields. Focusing on regimes near the critical temperature Tc, we analyze two classes of relaxation diffusion equations that give rise to qualitatively distinct dynamics, which we denote as Type I (linear) and Type II (nonlinear). Type I relaxation, characteristic of the normal state above Tc, results in a steady and spatially uniform heat current governed by linear diffusion. By contrast, Type II relaxation, relevant below Tc, exhibits non steady dynamics marked by pronounced spatial inhomogeneities and an evolving pattern, in which an initially localized hot spot propagates transiently through the system. The striking distinction between these regimes underscores a fundamental shift in transport mechanisms across the superconducting phase transition and provides experimentally relevant predictions in light of emerging techniques for probing local dissipation.</description>

      <title>Josephson Diode Effect from Nonequilibrium Current in a Superconducting Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Josephson diode effect in a superconducting interferometer under nonequilibrium conditions. In contrast to its thermodynamic counterpart, which requires the simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetry, we demonstrate that a diode-like asymmetry of the critical current can emerge solely due to a dissipative current in the normal region of an otherwise symmetric Josephson junction. This effect is driven entirely by the nonequilibrium conditions, without the need for additional inversion symmetry breaking. Using the standard quasiclassical Keldysh Green's function formalism, we explicitly calculate the diode coefficient from the supercurrent-phase relation of the interferometer. Remarkably, within certain ranges of control parameters, such as applied voltage, temperature, and the geometric aspect ratio of the device, the diode coefficient can exceed its nominal perfect value.</description>

      <title>Symmetry properties of pair correlations in heavy deformed nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nucleons are known to form pairing correlations with various types of spin-symmetries. Spin-singlet neutron-neutron and proton-proton pairing is abundant in the nuclear chart but spin-triplet and mixed-spin proton-neutron pairing correlations have also been predicted to form at least in the ground states of certain nuclei. A realistic candidate region is that of the lightest Lanthanides where it was recently demonstrated that the nuclear deformation expected to emerge enhances spin-triplet pairing correlations. In this paper we provide the details of the deformed multimodal Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov theory that lead to this conclusion, as well as the details of the effects identified. We present in detail the response of different pairing correlations to various deformation modes and calculate their signatures in the odd-even staggering of masses. This paper provides a detailed discussion, and some resolutions, on the long-standing question ``what is the effect of nuclear deformation on the various pairing correlations?''</description>
