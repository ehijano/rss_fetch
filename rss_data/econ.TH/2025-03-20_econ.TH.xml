      <title>An Ambiguous State Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a replicated state machine (such as a blockchain protocol) can retain liveness in a strategic setting even while facing substantial ambiguity over certain events. This is implemented by a complementary protocol called "Machine II", which generates a non-ergodic value within chosen intervals such that no limiting frequency can be observed. We show how to implement this machine algorithmically and how it might be applied strategically as a mechanism for "veiling" actions. We demonstrate that welfare-enhancing applications for veiling exist for users belonging to a wide class of ambiguity attitudes, e.g. Binmore (2016), Gul and Pesendorfer (2014). Our approach is illustrated with applications to forking disputes in blockchain oracles and to Constant Function Market Makers, allowing the protocol to retain liveness without exposing their users to sure-loss.</description>

      <title>Discussion about the assumptions of Category Theory approach to agent-based modeling in microeconomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a possible category theoretical description for agent based modeling by outlining justifications for two main principles to describe the valuations in a realistic way in microeconomics: 1) It is assumed that the valuations can be expressed as a subcategory of the category of metric space so that value differences between various objects, that agents assign to them, can be expressed with a metric that is consistent with the concept of distance in mathematical metric spaces. 2) In realistic economic models, the category of valuations does not consist of linear spaces other than in special cases.
  We also discuss how category theoretical concepts such as morphisms and functors can be used to express transformations within categories and relations between other categories. We then present examples how functors and morphisms could be used to describe relationships and operations, such as ownership changes, transactions, and price formation, in the context of some of the established theories in microeconomics. Finally, we discuss briefly possible applications, such as product design and price optimization.</description>

      <title>Shinohara Rock-Paper-Scissors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes Shinohara Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS), a variant of the classic RPS game introduced by board game designer Yoshiteru Shinohara. Players compete against a host who always plays rock, so players choose either rock or paper. The twist is that if two or more players choose paper, they are eliminated, and the last remaining player is the winner, creating strategic tension among the players. There exists a unique symmetric subgame perfect equilibrium, in which the probability of choosing paper satisfies the equation $(1-p)^{n-1} + p^{n-1}/n = 1/n$, where $n$ is the number of remaining players. The game also admits a continuum of asymmetric equilibria.</description>
