      <title>Small metal artifact detection and inpainting in cardiac CT images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Quantification of cardiac motion on pre-treatment CT imaging for stereotactic arrhythmia radiotherapy patients is difficult due to the presence of image artifacts caused by metal leads of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). New methods are needed to accurately reduce the metal artifacts in already reconstructed CTs to recover the otherwise lost anatomical information. Purpose: To develop a methodology to automatically detect metal artifacts in cardiac CT scans and inpaint the affected volume with anatomically consistent structures and values. Methods: ECG-gated 4DCT scans of 12 patients who underwent cardiac radiation therapy for treating ventricular tachycardia were collected. The metal artifacts in the images were manually contoured. A 2D U-Net deep learning (DL) model was developed to segment the metal artifacts. A dataset of synthetic CTs was prepared by adding metal artifacts from the patient images to artifact-free CTs. A 3D image inpainting DL model was trained to refill the metal artifact portion in the synthetic images with realistic values. The inpainting model was evaluated by analyzing the automated segmentation results of the four heart chambers on the synthetic dataset. Additionally, the raw cardiac patient cases were qualitatively inspected. Results: The artifact detection model produced a Dice score of 0.958 +- 0.008. The inpainting model was able to recreate images with a structural similarity index of 0.988 +- 0.012. With the chamber segmentations improved surface Dice scores from 0.684 +- 0.247 to 0.964 +- 0.067 and the Hausdorff distance reduced from 3.4 +- 3.9 mm to 0.7 +- 0.7 mm. The inpainting model's use on cardiac patient CTs was visually inspected and the artifact-inpainted images were visually plausible. Conclusion: We successfully developed two deep models to detect and inpaint metal artifacts in cardiac CT images.</description>

      <title>Retinal arterial blood flow measured by real-time Doppler holography at 33,000 frames per second</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel quantitative estimation method for total retinal arterial blood flow utilizing real-time Doppler holography at an unprecedented frame rate of 33,000 frames per second. This technique, leveraging high-speed digital holography, enables non-invasive angiographic imaging of the retina, providing detailed blood flow contrasts essential for assessing retinal health. The proposed quantitative analysis method consists of segmenting primary in-plane retinal arteries and calculating local blood velocity using Doppler frequency broadening. The analysis integrates a forward scattering model to achieve blood flow estimation. Our findings highlight the potential of Doppler holography as a powerful tool for diagnosing and monitoring the treatment of retinal vascular conditions, complementary to existing imaging methods.</description>

      <title>X-ray multiple-beam (n-baem) dynamical diffraction theories, numerical methods to solve them and experimental verification by using the synchrotron X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behavior of X-rays diffracted in a perfect or quasi-perfect crystal can be described by the dynamical theory of X-ray diffraction. Study on the two-beam cases in which only transmitted and one reflected X-ray beams are strong has a history of one hundred years. However, the population of researchers who study on the multiple-beam cases (n-beam cases) in which more than two beams are simultaneously strong is small. The present author has derived the Takagi-Taupin (T-T) dynamical theory that can be applied to the n-beam cases, coded the computer programs to solve it and experimentally verified them by using the synchrotron X-rays. The equivalence between the Ewald-Laue (E-L) and the T-T dynamical theories described by the Fourier transform also for the n-beam cases is explicitly verified in the present paper. Further, the methods of the computer simulations and the experiments are also described.
  Furthermore, a hypothesis concerning the too large values of R-factor in protein crystallography is also described. This might be extremely important in protein crystallography in the future.</description>

      <title>High-count-rate Particle Tracking in Proton and Carbon Radiotherapy with Timepix2 Operated in Ultra-Short Acquisition Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the operational acquisition time limits of Timepix3 and Timepix2 detectors operated in frame mode for high-count rate of high deposited energy transfer particles. Measurements were performed using alpha particles from a 241Am laboratory source and proton and carbon ion beams from a synchrotron accelerator. The particle count rate upper limit is determined by overlapping per-pixel particle signals, identifiable by the hits per pixel counter &gt; 2, indicating the need to decrease acquisition time. On the other hand, the lower limit is the time required to collect the particle deposited charge while maintaining spectral properties. Different acquisition times were evaluated for an AdvaPIX Timepix3 detector (500 um Silicon sensor) with standard per-pixel DAC settings and a Minipix Timepix2 detector (300 um Silicon sensor) with standard and customized settings the pulse shaping parameter and threshold. For AdvaPIX Timepix3, spectra remained accurate down to 100 us frame acquisition time; at 10 us, loss of collected charge occurred, suggesting either avoiding this acquisition time or applying a correction. Timepix2 allowed acquisition times down to 100 ns for single particle track measurements even for high energy loss, enabled by a new Timepix2 feature delaying shutter closure until full particle charge collection. This work represents the first measurement utilizing Timepix-chips pixel detectors in an accelerator beam of clinical energy and intensity without the need to decrease the beam current. This is made possible by exploiting the short shutter feature in Timepix2 and a customized per-pixel energy calibration of the Timepix2 detector with a larger discharging signal value which allowed for a shorter time-over-threshold (ToT) signal. These customized settings extend the operation of the pixel detectors to higher event rates up to 10^9 particles/cm^2/s.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Radiotherapy Model for Brain Tumors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the analytical and numerical study of a mathematical model for brain tumors with radiotherapy influence. Under certain assumptions on the given data in the model, we prove existence and uniqueness of a weak nonnegative (biological relevant) solution. Then, assuming only more regular initial data, we obtain the extra regularity of this solution. Besides, we analyze the optimal control of the advection coefficient responding for the radiotherapy effect on the tumor cell population. Finally, we provide numerical illustration to all obtained analytical results.</description>

      <title>So You Want to Image Myelin Using MRI: Magnetic Susceptibility Source Separation for Myelin Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In MRI, researchers have long endeavored to effectively visualize myelin distribution in the brain, a pursuit with significant implications for both scientific research and clinical applications. Over time, various methods such as myelin water imaging, magnetization transfer imaging, and relaxometric imaging have been developed, each carrying distinct advantages and limitations. Recently, an innovative technique named as magnetic susceptibility source separation has emerged, introducing a novel surrogate biomarker for myelin in the form of a diamagnetic susceptibility map. This paper comprehensively reviews this cutting-edge method, providing the fundamental concepts of magnetic susceptibility, susceptibility imaging, and the validation of the diamagnetic susceptibility map as a myelin biomarker that indirectly measure myelin content. Additionally, the paper explores essential aspects of data acquisition and processing, offering practical insights for readers. A comparison with established myelin imaging methods is also presented, and both current and prospective clinical and scientific applications are discussed to provide a holistic understanding of the technique. This work aims to serve as a foundational resource for newcomers entering this dynamic and rapidly expanding field.</description>

      <title>Real-time CBCT Imaging and Motion Tracking via a Single Arbitrarily-angled X-ray Projection by a Joint Dynamic Reconstruction and Motion Estimation (DREME) Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) provides instantaneous visualization of patient anatomy for image guidance, motion tracking, and online treatment adaptation in radiotherapy. While many real-time imaging and motion tracking methods leveraged patient-specific prior information to alleviate under-sampling challenges and meet the temporal constraint (&lt; 500 ms), the prior information can be outdated and introduce biases, thus compromising the imaging and motion tracking accuracy. To address this challenge, we developed a framework (DREME) for real-time CBCT imaging and motion estimation, without relying on patient-specific prior knowledge. DREME incorporates a deep learning-based real-time CBCT imaging and motion estimation method into a dynamic CBCT reconstruction framework. The reconstruction framework reconstructs a dynamic sequence of CBCTs in a data-driven manner from a standard pre-treatment scan, without utilizing patient-specific knowledge. Meanwhile, a convolutional neural network-based motion encoder is jointly trained during the reconstruction to learn motion-related features relevant for real-time motion estimation, based on a single arbitrarily-angled x-ray projection. DREME was tested on digital phantom simulation and real patient studies. DREME accurately solved 3D respiration-induced anatomic motion in real time (~1.5 ms inference time for each x-ray projection). In the digital phantom study, it achieved an average lung tumor center-of-mass localization error of 1.2$\pm$0.9 mm (Mean$\pm$SD). In the patient study, it achieved a real-time tumor localization accuracy of 1.8$\pm$1.6 mm in the projection domain. DREME achieves CBCT and volumetric motion estimation in real time from a single x-ray projection at arbitrary angles, paving the way for future clinical applications in intra-fractional motion management.</description>
