      <title>Microtearing Turbulence and Its Role in High-Density-Gradient Plasmas in Wendelstein 7-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gyrokinetic simulations reveal that microtearing mode (MTM) turbulence dominates transport in a Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) discharge characterized by large density gradients, moderate temperature gradients, and low plasma beta. This conclusion is supported by the close agreement between simulated and experimentally measured heat and particle fluxes. The emergence of MTMs is attributed to the absence of competing instabilities -- such as ion temperature gradient modes and density-gradient-driven trapped-electron modes -- under these plasma conditions, together with the stabilizing influence of the W7-X max-J magnetic configuration. Furthermore, moderate collisionality and low magnetic shear are found to facilitate MTM onset. These findings advance the understanding of high-density-gradient regimes, which are essential for achieving high-performance operation in W7-X plasmas.</description>

      <title>Modification of ion-temperature-gradient turbulence by impurities in stellarator plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations have shown that impurities can strongly modify the turbulent heat flux in stellarator plasmas. Here, the ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) dispersion relation in a plasma containing impurities is analytically solved in certain limits and an expression for the modification of the ITG growth rate by impurities is derived. The analytical expression is the sum of three terms corresponding to three different physical causes (impurity density gradient, impurity temperature gradient and dilution) of the change in the growth rate. The scalings predicted analytically for the modification of the growth rate are shown to be reproduced by linear gyrokinetic simulations. The conditions for reduction or increase of the ITG growth by impurities are also correctly predicted by the analytical solution to the dispersion relation. Finally, a remarkable correlation is found between the analytical expression for the modification of the growth rate and the modification of the turbulent heat flux obtained from nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations.</description>

      <title>Coupling of neutrino beam-driven MHD waves and resonant instabilities in rotating magnetoplasmas with neutrino two-flavor oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of neutrino-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and instabilities in a rotating magnetoplasma with weak neutrino interactions. We show, for the first time, that neutrino-driven shear Alfv{\'e}n and oblique magnetosonic waves can be coupled by the Coriolis force, forming new wave modes affected by this force, as well as neutrino beam and two neutrino flavor oscillations. Our work extends previous theories by demonstrating that shear Alfv{\'e}n waves are influenced by neutrino effects and by identifying instabilities resulting from resonant interactions with both a streaming neutrino beam and flavor oscillations. We find that the Coriolis force, as well as plasma density and magnetic field strength, have a significant impact on the profiles of the instability growth rates. Our findings may shed new light on the physical mechanisms underlying core-collapse supernovae.</description>

      <title>First Observation of Dispersive Shock Waves in an Electron Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dispersive shock waves (DSWs) are expanding nonlinear wave trains that arise when dispersion regularizes a steepening front, a phenomenon observed in fluids, plasmas, optics, and superfluids. Here we report the first experimental observation of DSWs in an intense electron beam, using the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER). A localized induction-cell perturbation produced a negative density pulse that evolved into a leading soliton-like peak followed by an expanding train of oscillations. The leading peak satisfied soliton scaling laws for width^2 vs inverse amplitude and velocity vs amplitude, while the total wave-train width increased linearly with time, consistent with Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) predictions. Successive peaks showed decreasing amplitude and velocity toward the trailing edge, in agreement with dispersive shock ordering. These results demonstrate that intense charged particle beams provide a new laboratory platform for studying dispersive hydrodynamics, extending nonlinear wave physics into the high-intensity beam regime.</description>

      <title>Simulation of surface x-ray emission from the ASTERICS ECR ion source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bremsstrahlung x-ray emission induced by the impact of plasma electrons de-confined on the chamber wall of the ASTERICS electron cyclotron resonance ion source is investigated through a suite of two simulation codes. The electron high energy temperature distribution tail at the wall is found to be anisotropic and increases with Bmin. The electrons impinge the walls with broad angular distribution peaking at angles ranging between 5-25{\deg} with respect to the surface, which has consequences on the x-ray emission directionality and on the yield of electrons bouncing back toward the plasma, reaching up to 50%. The x-ray dose is mapped inside and around the ion source for Bmin = 0.8 T and an electron temperature artificially increased to 120 keV to dimension with margin the cave shielding. The dose without shielding reaches 100 $\mu$Sv/h per kW of impacting electrons at 5 m. A set of internal and external shielding is presented to attenuate this dose and reduce it to less than 1 $\mu$Sv/h per kW of electrons. A parametric electron distribution temperature study with Fluka indicates that the deposition of 1 W of heat in the superconducting cold mass per kW of plasma electrons, as reported experimentally, is obtained when the temperature is set to 380 keV. Such a result is compatible with previous experiments achieved on several ion sources showing an x-ray spectral temperature 3 to 4 times higher radially.</description>

      <title>Phase space transport, quasilinear diffusion and locality in phase velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14657v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the motion of charged particles subjected to a discrete spectrum of electrostatic waves. We focus on situations when transport dominates, leading to significant variations in particle velocity. Nonetheless, these velocity changes remain finite due to the presence of KAM tori bounding phase space. We analyze the conditions under which transport can be modeled as a diffusion process and evaluate the relevance of the so-called quasilinear value of the diffusion coefficient. We distinguish between traditional quasilinear diffusion, when wave-particle interaction is perturbative, and the so-called chaotic regime of diffusion, when the particle motion looks erratic. In the perturbative regime, we demonstrate both numerically and theoretically that diffusion occurs only when wave-particle interaction is local in phase velocity; that is, when wave contributions from phase velocities far from the particles instantaneous velocities are negligible. Conversely, numerical results indicate that chaotic diffusion can occur even when wave-particle interaction is not local. However, without locality, the diffusion coefficient is not the quasilinear one. Furthermore, in regimes when quasilinear diffusion is applicable, we introduce a simple analytical expression for the time evolution of the velocity distribution function, that accounts for phase space boundaries.</description>

      <title>Influence of an external static magnetic field on prebreakdown electron emission and heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High magnetic fields can increase the occurrence of vacuum arcing, suggesting that both electric and magnetic fields can play a role in the vacuum arcing process. The mechanism of vacuum arcing in high magnetic fields is believed to involve both the cathode and the anode, with the cathode serving as the originator of field-emitting nanoprotrusions or tips, while the anode serves a secondary role. Significant heating of the anode surface can be achieved by magnetic focusing of the emitted electron beam, leading to increased heat flux due to greater current density. We simulated the emitted electron beam in different configurations of the electric and magnetic fields using the particle-in-cell (PIC) and finite element methods (FEM). The heating caused by the impacting electron beam was simulated for magnetic fields ranging from 0 T to 30 T. The directions of the electric and magnetic fields were found to play a major role in the focusing of the electron beam. We found that a sufficient temperature increase on the anode surface for evaporation can be reached at magnetic fields on the order of 10-30 T, suggesting the possibility of plasma initiation on the anode side.</description>
