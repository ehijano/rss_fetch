      <title>Multivariate Rough Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by empirical evidence from the joint behavior of realized volatility time series, we propose to model the joint dynamics of log-volatilities using a multivariate fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This model is a multivariate version of the Rough Fractional Stochastic Volatility model proposed in Gatheral, Jaisson, and Rosenbaum, Quant. Finance, 2018. It allows for different Hurst exponents in the different marginal components and non trivial interdependencies.
  We discuss the main features of the model and propose an estimator that jointly identifies its parameters. We derive the asymptotic theory of the estimator and perform a simulation study that confirms the asymptotic theory in finite sample.
  We carry out an extensive empirical investigation on all realized volatility time series covering the entire span of about two decades in the Oxford-Man realized library. Our analysis shows that these time series are strongly correlated and can exhibit asymmetries in their cross-covariance structure, accurately captured by our model. These asymmetries lead to spillover effects that we analyse theoretically within the model and then using our empirical estimates. Moreover, in accordance with the existing literature, we observe behaviors close to non-stationarity and rough trajectories.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Time Series Categorization and Temporal Fusion Transformers to Improve Cryptocurrency Price Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organizing and managing cryptocurrency portfolios and decision-making on transactions is crucial in this market. Optimal selection of assets is one of the main challenges that requires accurate prediction of the price of cryptocurrencies. In this work, we categorize the financial time series into several similar subseries to increase prediction accuracy by learning each subseries category with similar behavior. For each category of the subseries, we create a deep learning model based on the attention mechanism to predict the next step of each subseries. Due to the limited amount of cryptocurrency data for training models, if the number of categories increases, the amount of training data for each model will decrease, and some complex models will not be trained well due to the large number of parameters. To overcome this challenge, we propose to combine the time series data of other cryptocurrencies to increase the amount of data for each category, hence increasing the accuracy of the models corresponding to each category.</description>

      <title>Predicting Value at Risk for Cryptocurrencies With Generalized Random Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.08224v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the prediction of Value at Risk (VaR) for cryptocurrencies. In contrast to classic assets, returns of cryptocurrencies are often highly volatile and characterized by large fluctuations around single events. Analyzing a comprehensive set of 105 major cryptocurrencies, we show that Generalized Random Forests (GRF) (Athey, Tibshirani &amp; Wager, 2019) adapted to quantile prediction have superior performance over other established methods such as quantile regression, GARCH-type and CAViaR models. This advantage is especially pronounced in unstable times and for classes of highly-volatile cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, we identify important predictors during such times and show their influence on forecasting over time. Moreover, a comprehensive simulation study also indicates that the GRF methodology is at least on par with existing methods in VaR predictions for standard types of financial returns and clearly superior in the cryptocurrency setup.</description>

      <title>Estimation of bid-ask spreads in the presence of serial dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from a basic model in which the dynamic of the transaction prices is a geometric Brownian motion disrupted by a microstructure white noise, corresponding to the random alternation of bids and asks, we propose moment-based estimators along with their statistical properties. We then make the model more realistic by considering serial dependence: we assume a geometric fractional Brownian motion for the price, then an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the microstructure noise. In these two cases of serial dependence, we propose again consistent and asymptotically normal estimators. All our estimators are compared on simulated data with existing approaches, such as Roll, Corwin-Schultz, Abdi-Ranaldo, or Ardia-Guidotti-Kroencke estimators.</description>
