      <title>Next-Generation Conflict Forecasting: Unleashing Predictive Patterns through Spatiotemporal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting violent conflict at high spatial and temporal resolution remains a central challenge for both researchers and policymakers. This study presents a novel neural network architecture for forecasting three distinct types of violence -- state-based, non-state, and one-sided -- at the subnational (priogrid-month) level, up to 36 months in advance. The model jointly performs classification and regression tasks, producing both probabilistic estimates and expected magnitudes of future events. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks and generates approximate predictive posterior distributions to quantify forecast uncertainty.
  The architecture is built on a Monte Carlo Dropout Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) U-Net, integrating convolutional layers to capture spatial dependencies with recurrent structures to model temporal dynamics. Unlike many existing approaches, it requires no manual feature engineering and relies solely on historical conflict data. This design enables the model to autonomously learn complex spatiotemporal patterns underlying violent conflict.
  Beyond achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance, the model is also highly extensible: it can readily integrate additional data sources and jointly forecast auxiliary variables. These capabilities make it a promising tool for early warning systems, humanitarian response planning, and evidence-based peacebuilding initiatives.</description>

      <title>Data Verbalisation: What is Text Doing in a Data Visualisation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article discusses the role that text elements play in a data visualisation. We argue that there is a need for a simple, coherent explanation of text elements similar to the understanding that already exists for non-text elements like bars, points, and lines. We explore examples of how text is used within a data visualisation and use existing knowledge and assessment techniques to evaluate when text is effective and when it is not. The result is a framework that aims to be easy to understand and easy to apply in order to understand the purpose and effectiveness of the text elements in any data visualisation.</description>

      <title>Sequential Change Detection for Learning in Piecewise Stationary Bandit Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A finite-horizon variant of the quickest change detection problem is investigated, which is motivated by a change detection problem that arises in piecewise stationary bandits. The goal is to minimize the \emph{latency}, which is smallest threshold such that the probability that the detection delay exceeds the threshold is below a desired low level, while controlling the false alarm probability to a desired low level. When the pre- and post-change distributions are unknown, two tests are proposed as candidate solutions. These tests are shown to attain order optimality in terms of the horizon. Furthermore, the growth in their latencies with respect to the false alarm probability and late detection probability satisfies a property that is desirable in regret analysis for piecewise stationary bandits. Numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical performance results.</description>
