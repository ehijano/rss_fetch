      <title>Nonexistence of closed timelike geodesics in Kerr spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kerr-star spacetime is the extension over the horizons and in the negative radial region of the Kerr spacetime. Despite the presence of closed timelike curves below the inner horizon, we prove that the timelike geodesics cannot be closed in the Kerr-star spacetime. Since the existence of closed null geodesics was ruled out by the author in Sanzeni [arXiv:2308.09631v3 (2024)], this result shows the absence of closed causal geodesics in the Kerr-star spacetime.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the gravitational wave detectability of globular clusters and the Magellanic Clouds for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the stellar evolution code BPASS and the gravitational wave simulation code LEGWORK to simulate populations of compact binaries that may be detected by the in-development space-based gravitational wave (GW) detector LISA. Specifically, we simulate the Magellanic Clouds and binary populations mimicking several globular clusters, neglecting dynamical effects. We find that the Magellanic Clouds would have a handful of detectable sources each, but for globular clusters the amount of detectable sources would be less than one. We compare our results to earlier research and find that our predicted numbers are several tens of times lower than calculations using the stellar evolution code BSE that take dynamical effects into account, but also calculations using the stellar evolution code SeBa for the Magellanic Clouds. This correlates with earlier research which compared BPASS models for GW sources in the Galactic disk with BSE models and found a similarly sized discrepancy. We analyse and explain this discrepancy as being caused by differences between the stellar evolution codes, particularly in the treatment of mass transfer and common-envelope events in binaries, where in BPASS mass transfer is more likely to be stable and tends to lead to less orbital shrinkage in the common-envelope phase than in other codes. This difference results in fewer compact binaries with periods short enough to be detected by LISA existing in the BPASS population. For globular clusters, we conclude that the impact of dynamical effects is uncertain from the literature, but the differences in stellar evolution have an effect of a factor of a few tens.</description>

      <title>Quantum Black Hole as a Harmonic Oscillator from the Perspective of the Minimum Uncertainty Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the Schwarzschild black hole interior, which is derived from a Hamiltonian formulated in terms of canonical phase space coordinates, we show that by applying a simple reparametrization, this equation can be expressed as the eigenvalue equation of a quantum linear harmonic oscillator. Within the standard quantization framework, we find that the resulting wave function diverges in the region of the classical singularity, and the expectation value of the Kretschmann scalar is undefined for all states within the black hole. However, when we apply the minimal uncertainty approach to the quantization process, we obtain a wave function that is both well-defined and square-integrable. Additionally, the expectation value of the Kretschmann scalar for these states remains finite throughout the black hole's interior, suggesting that the classical singularity is resolved in this approach, replaced it by a minimum radius.</description>

      <title>Magnetically charged black-bounce solution via nonlinear electrodynamics in a k-essence theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we obtain and analyze a new class of analytical solutions of magnetically charged black bounces in k-essence theory, spherically symmetric in (3+1)-dimensions, coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics (NED). We consider two metric models, Simpson-Visser and Bardeen, for the k-essence configurations n = 1/3 and n = 1/5. We obtain in an analytical way which scalar field, field potential, and Lagrangian NED are necessary to support the metrics. We analyze the behavior of these quantities and the energy conditions due to the scalar field and the NED.</description>

      <title>Universal topological classifications of black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the universal classifications of black hole states by considering them as topological defects within the thermodynamic parameter space. Through the asymptotic behaviors of the constructed vector, our results indicate the existence of four distinct topological classifications, denoted as $W^{1-}$, $W^{0+}$, $W^{0-}$, and $W^{1+}$. Within these classifications, the innermost small black hole states are characterized as unstable, stable, unstable, and stable, respectively, while the outermost large ones exhibit an unstable, unstable, stable, and stable behavior. These classifications also display contrasting thermodynamic properties in both low and high Hawking temperature limits. Furthermore, we establish a systematic ordering of the local thermodynamically stable and unstable black hole states as the horizon radius increases for a specific topological classification. These results reveal the universal topological classifications governing black hole thermodynamics, providing valuable insights into the fundamental nature of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Birefringence in Symmetron Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetron is a light scalar which provides a screening mechanism so as to evade the strong constraints from local gravity tests. In order to achieve this goal, a $Z_2$ symmetry is imposed on the symmetron model. In this paper, we introduce a new symmetron Chern-Simons-like gravitational interaction which is $Z_2$ invariant but breaks the parity symmetry explicitly. As a result, it is found that this coupling can generate gravitational wave (GW) amplitude birefringence when GWs propagate over the symmetron backgrounds. Due to the matter density difference, the symmetron profile changes significantly when entering the galaxy, so that we need to discuss the extra-galactic and galactic situations separately. On the one hand, the cosmological symmetron field follows the adiabatic solution, which induces a parity-violating GW amplitude correction with its exponent proportional to the GW frequency and the traveling distance. On the other hand, the symmetron takes the screening solution within the Milky Way, and the generated GW birefringence is only a function of the GW frequency. By further comparing these two contributions, we find that the extra-galactic symmetron field produces the dominant birefringence effects. Finally, with the latest GW data from LIGO-Virgo-Kagra, we place a reasonable constraint on the parity-violating coupling parameter in this symmetron model.</description>

      <title>Dark matter and dark energy in combinatorial quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that dark matter and dark energy arise naturally in a recently proposed model of combinatorial quantum gravity. Dark energy is due to the ground-state curvature at finite coupling, dark matter arises from allotropy in the discrete structure of space-time. The stable structure of the space-time "crystal" represents the curved background, the coexisting metastable allotropes of higher curvature and energy are natural candidates for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Constraining matter bounce scenario from scalar-induced vector perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bouncing cosmologies, while offering a compelling alternative to inflationary models, face challenges from the growth of vector perturbations during the contracting phase. While linear vector instabilities can be avoided with specific initial conditions or the absence of vector degrees of freedom, we demonstrate the significant role of secondary vector perturbations generated by non-linear interactions with scalar fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that in a broad class of single-field matter bounce scenarios, these secondary vector perturbations inevitably get unacceptably large amplitudes, provided the curvature fluctuations are consistent with cosmic microwave background observations. This finding underscores the crucial importance of scalar-induced vector perturbations in bouncing cosmology and highlights the need for further investigation into their potential impact on the viability of these models.</description>

      <title>Pure Lovelock Gravity regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new family of regular black holes (RBH) in Pure Lovelock gravity, where the energy density is determined by the gravitational vacuum tension, which varies for each value of $n$ in each Lovelock case. A notable feature of our model is that the regular solution closely resembles the vacuum solution before reaching the event horizon. For odd $n$, the transverse geometry is spherical, with phase transitions occurring during evaporation, and the final state of this process is a remnant. For even $n$, the transverse geometry in non trivial and corresponds to a hyperboloid. In the case of $d=2n+1$ with even $n$, we find an RBH without a dS core and no inner horizon (whose presence has been recently debated in the literature due to the question of whether its presence is unstable or not), and no phase transitions. For $d&gt;2n+1$ with even $n$, the RBH possesses both an event horizon and a cosmological horizon and no inner horizon. The existence of the cosmological horizon arises without the usual requirement of a positive cosmological constant. From both numerical and analytical analysis, we deduce that as the event horizon expands and the cosmological horizon contracts, thermodynamic equilibrium is achieved in a remnant when the two horizons coincide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore wormhole solutions sourced by Casimir energy density involving generalized uncertainty principle corrections within the framework of Rastall-Rainbow gravity. The questions of traversability and stability, as well as the presence of exotic matter, are carefully investigated. In particular, the stability issue is addressed via an approach that has not been previously employed in the context of wormholes. This method, which represents an improved version of the so-called Herrera cracking technique, has the potential to yield novel insights in the field of wormhole geometries.</description>

      <title>Photon Ring Dimming as a Signature of Photon-Axion Conversion in Janis-Newman-Winicour Naked Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possible existence of axions in the universe introduces the intriguing possibility of photon-axion conversion in strong magnetic fields, particularly near compact objects like supermassive black holes or even naked singularity. In this study, we investigate the conversion of photons into axions in the vicinity of a Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) spacetime, a well-known naked singularity solution. Our analysis reveals that photons can efficiently convert into axions with masses less than $100 \rm \ neV$. We calculate the conversion probability and find that it is significantly influenced by the characteristic parameter of the JNW spacetime. The potential observational signatures of this conversion, would be the dimming of photon ring in the X-ray and gamma-ray spectrum. Our findings suggest that compact objects like M87* could be prime candidates for detecting photon-axion conversion effects, provided future advances in high-resolution observations.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes of Dilaton Black Holes: Analytic approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have derived precise analytic expressions for the quasinormal modes of test scalar, and Dirac fields in the background of the dilaton black hole. To achieve this, we employ the higher-order WKB expansion in terms of $1/\ell$. A comparison between the analytic formulas and time-domain integration reveals that the analytic approach generally yields more accurate results than the numerical results previously published using the lower-order WKB approach. We demonstrate that in the eikonal regime, test fields adhere to the correspondence between null geodesics and eikonal quasinormal modes.</description>

      <title>Rindler Wigner distributions for non-vacuum Minkowski states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1970s, Fulling, Davies, and Unruh demonstrated that the vacuum state perceived by an inertial observer in Minkowski space appears as a thermal bath to a uniformly accelerated observer. We explore the transformation of the Wigner distribution of a real scalar field from an inertial to a Rindler frame, utilizing both Minkowski and Unruh modes. We present a general expression for the reduced Wigner distribution for a specific set of massless scalar field configurations, and validate it against known distributions within this set. This includes arbitrary Gaussian states of Unruh-Minkowski modes, the Minkowski vacuum state, the Rindler vacuum, and the thermal bath of Unruh particles. Additionally, we analyze several other distributions, such as a uniform momentum distribution, a slight deviation from the Minkowski vacuum, and a distribution with a Fermionic component in the Rindler frame. The conclusions are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering calculations in curved spacetime are technically complicated and, in the case of a general spacetime metric, quite impossible. Even in the cases where perturbative scattering calculations can be done one has to be careful about what kind of particles are sensible to measure. Curved spacetime quantum field theories are then less conceptually clear than those in flat spacetime. In this article, we investigate an aspect of this conceptual confusion - the use of wave packets in defining the S-matrix. Wave packets are used in most standard textbook treatments to construct particle states and remove certain singularities in the definition of the S-matrix. We show that this method does not completely work in curved spacetimes first in a general way and then by way of a specific model. We also discuss related effects and suggest a method for doing curved spacetime scattering calculations. Our conclusion is that the most general method for scattering calculations in curved spacetimes requires the use of wave packets, which are typically absent in the literature.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the numerical relativity module within AthenaK, an open source performance-portable astrophysics code designed for exascale computing applications. This module employs the Z4c formulation to solve the Einstein equations. We demonstrate its accuracy through a series of standard numerical relativity tests, including convergence of the gravitational waveform from binary black hole coalescence. Furthermore, we conduct scaling tests on OLCF Frontier and NERSC Perlmutter, where AthenaK exhibits excellent weak scaling efficiency of 80% on up to 65,536 AMD MI250X GPUs on Frontier (relative to 4 GPUs) and strong scaling efficiencies of 84% and 77% on AMD MI250X and NVIDIA A100 GPUs on Frontier and Perlmutter respectively. Additionally, we observe a significant performance boost, with two orders of magnitude speedup ($\gtrsim 200\times$) on a GPU compared to a single CPU core, affirming that AthenaK is well-suited for exascale computing, thereby expanding the potential for breakthroughs in numerical relativity research.</description>

      <title>Initial data for a deformed isolated horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the isolated horizon formalism, we investigate a static axisymmetric space-time of a black hole influenced by matter in its neighborhood. To illustrate the role of ingredients and assumptions in this formalism, we first show how, in spherical symmetry, the field equations and gauge conditions imply the isolated horizon initial data leading to the Schwarzschild space-time. Then, we construct the initial data for a static axisymmetric isolated horizon representing a deformed black hole. The space-time description in the Bondi-like coordinates is then found as a series expansion in the vicinity of the horizon. To graphically illustrate this construction, we also find a numerical solution for a black hole deformed by a particular analytic model of a thin accretion disk. We also discuss how an accretion disk affects the analytical properties of the horizon geometry.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Dark Photons on Gravitational Wave Polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study conversion processes between gravitons and dark photons and reveal the effects of dark photons on the polarization of gravitational waves. Considering cosmological dark magnetic fields, we investigate the evolution of the intensity and polarization of gravitational waves through the conversion. Specifically, we demonstrate that for minimal coupling between gravitons and dark photons, the intensity, circular polarization, and linear polarization evolve separately. We derive explicit formulas for the statistical mean and variance of the intensity and polarization when the gravitational waves pass through magnetic fields with random orientation. The formulas capture how the initial polarization of dark photons will be imprinted on the observed gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>Hanging on the cliff: EMRI formation with local two-body relaxation and post-Newtonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are anticipated to be primary gravitational wave sources for LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna). They form in dense nuclear clusters when a compact object (CO) is captured by the central massive black holes (MBHs) due to frequent two-body interactions among orbiting objects. We present a novel Monte Carlo approach to evolve the post-Newtonian (PN) equations of motion of a CO orbiting an MBH accounting for two-body relaxation locally on the fly, without the assumption of orbit-averaging. We estimate the fraction $S(a_0)$ of EMRIs to total captures (including direct plunges, DPs) as a function of the initial semi-major axis $a_0$ for COs around MBHs of $M_\bullet\in[10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot,4\times10^6\,{\rm M}_\odot]$. Previous results indicate $S(a_0)\rightarrow 0$ at large $a_0$, with a sharp transition from EMRIs to DPs around a critical scale $a_{\rm c}$. This notion has been recently challenged for low-mass MBHs, with EMRIs forming at $a\gg a_{\rm c}$, the so-called "cliffhangers''. Our simulations confirm their existence, at larger numbers than previously expected. Cliffhangers start to appear for $M_\bullet\lesssim3\times 10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and can account for up to 55% of the overall EMRIs formed. We find $S(a_0)\gg 0$ for $a\gg a_{\rm c}$, reaching values as high as 0.6 for $M_\bullet=10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot$, much larger than previously found. We find that the PN description of the system greatly enhances the number of EMRIs by shifting $a_{\rm c}$ to larger values at all MBH masses, and that the local treatment of relaxation significantly boosts the number of cliffhangers for small MBHs. Our work shows the limitations of standard assumptions for estimating EMRI formation rates, most importantly their dynamical models. Future estimates of rates and properties of EMRIs detectable by LISA should account for these improvements.</description>

      <title>Fixed Points of Quantum Gravity from Dimensional Regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate $\beta$-functions of quantum gravity using dimensional regularisation. In contrast to minimal subtraction, a non-minimal renormalisation scheme is employed which is sensitive to power-law divergences from mass terms or dimensionful couplings. By construction, this setup respects global and gauge symmetries, including diffeomorphisms, and allows for systematic extensions to higher loop orders. We exemplify this approach in the context of four-dimensional quantum gravity. By computing one-loop $\beta$-functions, we find a non-trivial fixed point. It shows two real critical exponents and is compatible with Weinberg's asymptotic safety scenario. Moreover, the underlying structure of divergences suggests that gravity becomes, effectively, two-dimensional in the ultraviolet. We discuss the significance of our results as well as further applications and extensions to higher loop orders.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase assisted detection of Lorentz-invariance violation from modified dispersion at high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many theories of quantum gravity propose Lorentz-violating dispersion relations of the form $\omega_{|\mathbf{k}|}=|\mathbf{k}|f(|\mathbf{k}|/M_\star)$, which approximately recover to the Lorentz invariance, $\omega_{|\mathbf{k}|}\approx|\mathbf{k}|$, at the energy scales much below $M_\star$. However, usually such a scale is assumed to be near the Planck scale, thus the feature of the Lorentz-violating theory is weak and its experimental test becomes extremely challenging. Since the geometric phase (GP) is of accumulative and sensitive nature to weak effects, here we explore the GP acquired by an inertial atomic detector that is coupled to a quantum field with this kind of Lorentz-violating dispersion. We show that for the Lorentz-violating field theory case the GP depends on the velocity of the detector, which is quite different from the Lorentz symmetry case where the GP is independent of the detector's velocity. In particular, we show that the GP may present a drastic low-energy Lorentz violation for any $f$ that dips below unity somewhere. We apply our analysis to detecting the polymer quantization motivated by loop quantum gravity, and show the detector acquires an experimentally detectable GP with the assist of detector's velocity that below current ion collider rapidities. Furthermore, the accumulative nature of GP might facilitate the relevant detection significantly.</description>

      <title>Dissipative dynamics of an open quantum battery in the BTZ spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider how charging performances of a quantum battery, modeled as a two-level system, are influenced by the presence of vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field satisfying the Dirichlet, transparent, and Neumann boundary conditions in the BTZ spacetime. The quantum battery is subjected to an external static driving which works as a charger. Meanwhile, the quantum field is assumed to be coupled to both longitudinal and transverse spin components of the quantum battery including decoherence and pure dephasing mechanisms. Charging and discharging dynamics of the quantum battery are derived by extending the previous open quantum system approach in the relativistic framework to this more general scenario including both the driving and multiple coupling. Analytic expressions for the time evolution of the energy stored are presented. We find that when the driving amplitude is stronger/weaker than the energy-level spacing of the quantum battery the pure dephasing dissipative coupling results in better/worse charging performances than the decoherence dissipative coupling case. We also find that higher Hawking temperature helps to improve the charging performance under certain conditions compared with the closed quantum buttery case, implying the feasibility of energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations in curved spacetime via dissipation in charging protocol. Different boundary conditions for quantum field may lead to different charging performance. Furthermore, we also address the charging stability by monitoring the energy behaviour after the charging protocol has been switched off. Our study presents a general framework to investigate relaxation effects in curved spacetime, and reveals how spacetime properties and field boundary condition affect the charging process, which in turn may shed light on the exploration of the spacetime properties and thermodynamics via the charging protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chern-Simons gravity is known to suffer from graviton ghost production during inflation, which suppresses the parity-violating power spectrum at scales relevant to cosmic microwave background observations. In this work, we show that allowing the initial conditions of inflation to deviate from the standard Bunch-Davies state can enhance parity-violating non-Gaussianity in the scalar-tensor cross-bispectra. Our results reveal a significant additional contribution to the cross-bispectra in the flattened configuration, offering a new avenue to constrain parity-violating gravity.</description>

      <title>Off-diagonal coupling of supersymmetric SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the off-diagonal coupling between two supersymmetric SYK models, which preserves both supersymmetry and solvability. We found that the interaction terms of the N=2 supersymmetric SYK have a holographic interpretation as a possible supersymmetric traversable wormhole. First we introduce the coupling in the trivial Homologic N=1 SYK model as a simplified example. Similar couplings can be implied in N=2 chiral SYK model with BPS states. We propose a special form of N=4 SYK by introducing supermultiplets, and which also naturally include the coupling terms. The holographic picture of N=4 SYK does not have an eternal solution in the low energy limit. And the effective actions are studied in both thermal limit and low energy limit. We also investigate the SYK-like thermal field double states of the supersymmetric SYK and the transmission amplitude between single-side N=2 models in Lorentz time. Additionally, the multi-side N=2,4 OTOCs are also studied.</description>

      <title>Performance-Portable Binary Neutron Star Mergers with AthenaK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extension to the AthenaK code for general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) in dynamical spacetimes using a 3+1 conservative Eulerian formulation. Like the fixed-spacetime GRMHD solver, we use standard finite-volume methods to evolve the fluid and a constrained transport scheme to preserve the divergence-free constraint for the magnetic field. We also utilize a first-order flux correction (FOFC) scheme to reduce the need for an artificial atmosphere and optionally enforce a maximum principle to improve robustness. We demonstrate the accuracy of AthenaK using a set of standard tests in flat and curved spacetimes. Using a SANE accretion disk around a Kerr black hole, we compare the new solver to the existing solver for stationary spacetimes using the so-called "HARM-like" formulation. We find that both formulations converge to similar results. We also include the first published binary neutron star (BNS) mergers performed on graphical processing units (GPUs). Thanks to the FOFC scheme, our BNS mergers maintain a relative error of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11})$ or better in baryon mass conservation up to collapse. Finally, we perform scaling tests of AthenaK on OLCF Frontier, where we show excellent weak scaling of $\geq 80\%$ efficiency up to 32768 GPUs and $74\%$ up to 65536 GPUs for a GRMHD problem in dynamical spacetimes with six levels of mesh refinement. AthenaK achieves an order-of-magnitude speedup using GPUs compared to CPUs, demonstrating that it is suitable for performing numerical relativity problems on modern exascale resources.</description>

      <title>Minimally coupled $\beta$-exponential inflation with an $R^2$ term in the Palatini formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on the inflationary predictions of $\beta$-exponential potential models, in which the inflaton is a representation of the field delineating the size of extra-dimension. Since it offers a well-motivated starting point for the study of physics at very high energies, we incorporate an $R^2$ term in the Palatini gravity. In addition, afterward the inflation, the inflaton oscillates about the minimum of the inflation potential, and reheats the universe. This occurs during the reheating phase, at which the inflaton decays into the standard model particles, which fill the universe. We extend our examination by considering the reheating effects on inflationary observables by employing the different scenarios of the reheat temperature. Supposing the standard thermal history after inflation, we display the inflationary predictions, $n_s, r, \mathrm{d}n_s/\mathrm{d}\ln k$ of $\beta$-exponential potential with minimal coupling in Palatini $R^2$ gravity. Also, different kinds of constraints from a variety of observations, such as BICEP/Keck, Planck 2018, as well as future possible detectable sensitivities that might be reached by CMB experiments: CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD are taken into account in this work. We indicate that our results are consistent with both the latest data and the future sensitivity forecasts of LiteBIRD/Planck and CMB-S4. Finally, the results in this study highlight the viability of our model even in the case of the existence of more stringent constraints expected from future achievable confidence level limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulations of self-consistent, rotating neutron stars with mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields. Specifically, we investigate the role of resistivity in the dynamical evolution of neutron stars over a period of up to 100 ms and its effects on their quasi-equilibrium configurations. Our results demonstrate that resistivity can significantly influence the development of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, resulting in markedly different magnetic field geometries. Additionally, resistivity suppresses the growth of these instabilities, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of emitted gravitational waves. Despite the variations in magnetic field geometries, the ratio of poloidal to toroidal field energies remains consistently 9:1 throughout the simulations, for the models we investigated.</description>

Abstract: In non-extreme Kerr-Newman-AdS spacetime, we prove that there is no nontrivial Dirac particle which is $L^p$ for $0&lt;p\leq\frac{4}{3}$ with arbitrary eigenvalue $\lambda$, and for $\frac{4}{3}&lt;p\leq\frac{4}{3-2q}$, $0&lt;q&lt;\frac{3}{2}$ with eigenvalue $|\lambda|&gt;q \kappa $, outside and away from the event horizon. By taking $q=\frac{1}{2}$, we show that there is no normalizable massive Dirac particle with mass greater than $\frac{\kappa}{2} $ outside and away from the event horizon in non-extreme Kerr-Newman-AdS spacetime, and they must either disappear into the black hole or escape to infinity, and this recovers the same result of Belgiorno and Cacciatori in the case of $Q=0$ obtained by using spectral methods. Furthermore, we prove that any Dirac particle with eigenvalue $|\lambda|&lt;\frac{\kappa}{2}$ must be $L^2$ outside and away from the event horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.01138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Einstein-Maxwell theory has black hole solutions with electric and magnetic charges. In the standard model for particle physics, dyons with electric and magnetic charges would have been formed in the early universe. We derive the equations of motion of black hole binaries with electric and magnetic charges and explore some features of static orbits. We calculate the total emission rates of energy and angular momentum due to gravitational and electromagnetic radiations from dyonic binary black holes in different cases. It is shown that the emission rates of energy and angular momentum due to gravitational and electromagnetic radiations have the same dependence on the conic angle for different orbits. Moreover, we obtain the evolutions of orbits and find that a circular orbit remains circular while an elliptic orbit becomes quasi-circular due to electromagnetic and gravitational radiations. Our results provide rich information about black hole binaries with electric and magnetic charges and can be used to test black holes with magnetic charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations provide sensitive tests of parity and Lorentz symmetries of gravity. Any violation of these fundamental symmetries induces possible deviations in the GW propagations. Through a systematic parametrization for characterizing possible derivations from GW propagations in general relativity, we construct the modified GW waveforms generated by the coalescence of compact binaries with the effects of the parity and Lorentz violations as predicted by many parity- and Lorentz-violating gravities and then analyze them with the open data of compact binary merging events detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. No signature of gravitational parity and Lorentz violations are found for most GW events, thereby allowing us to place several of the most stringent constraints on parity and Lorentz violations in gravity and a first constraint on the Lorentz-violating damping effect in GW.</description>

      <title>Testing whether gravity acts as a quantum entity when measured</title>

Abstract: A defining signature of classical systems is "in principle measurability" without disturbance: a feature manifestly violated by quantum systems. We describe a multi-interferometer experimental setup that can, in principle, reveal the nonclassicality of a spatial superposition-sourced gravitational field if an irreducible disturbance is caused by a measurement of gravity. While one interferometer sources the field, the others are used to measure the gravitational field created by the superposition. This requires neither any specific form of nonclassical gravity, nor the generation of entanglement between any relevant degrees of freedom at any stage, thus distinguishing it from the experiments proposed so far. This test, when added to the recent entanglement-witness based proposals, enlarges the domain of quantum postulates being tested for gravity. Moreover, the proposed test yields a signature of quantum measurement induced disturbance for any finite rate of decoherence, and is device independent.</description>

      <title>Comparing gravitational waveform models for binary black hole mergers through a hypermodels approach</title>

Abstract: The inference of source parameters from gravitational-wave signals relies on theoretical models that describe the emitted waveform. Different model assumptions on which the computation of these models is based could lead to biases in the analysis of gravitational-wave data. In this work, we sample directly on four state-of-the-art binary black hole waveform models from different families, in order to investigate these systematic biases from the 13 heaviest gravitational-wave sources with moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios in the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC- 3). All models include spin-precession as well as higher-order modes. Using the "hypermodels" technique, we treat the waveform models as one of the sampled parameters, therefore directly getting the odds ratio of one waveform model over another from a single parameter estimation run. From the joint odds ratio over all 13 sources, we find the model NRSur7dq4 to be favoured over SEOBNRv4PHM, with an odds ratio of 29.43; IMRPhenomXPHM and IMRPhenomTPHM have an odds ratio, respectively, of 4.70 and 5.09 over SEOBNRv4PHM. However, this result is mainly determined by three events that show a strong preference for some of the models and that are all affected by possible data quality issues. If we do not consider these potentially problematic events, the odds ratio do not exhibit a significant preference for any of the models. Although further work studying a larger set of signals will be needed for robust quantitative results, the presented method highlights one possible avenue for future waveform model development.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of the dispersion law in three-dimensional quantum space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of a quantum structure underlying space has been proposed for quite some time, yet it has largely eluded direct observation. There is a prevailing notion that the minuscule effects stemming from quantum space could, under certain astronomical conditions, accumulate to an observable magnitude. Typically, these effects are perturbative, limited to the first one or two orders. This study presents a full dispersion law derived from a three-dimensional quantum space model. Our primary focus is investigating the in-vacuo dispersion phenomenon and the threshold anomaly. Furthermore, we briefly explore the implications of additional spatial dimensions within this framework and suggest a way of distinguishing between various theories that agree in the leading order approximation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signal Extraction Against Non-Stationary Instrumental Noises with Deep Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sapce-borne gravitational wave antennas, such as LISA and LISA-like mission (Taiji and Tianqin), will offer novel perspectives for exploring our Universe while introduce new challenges, especially in data analysis. Aside from the known challenges like high parameter space dimension, superposition of large number of signals etc., gravitational wave detections in space would be more seriously affected by anomalies or non-stationarities in the science measurements. Considering the three types of foreseeable non-stationarities including data gaps, transients (glitches), and time-varying noise auto-correlations, which may come from routine maintenance or unexpected disturbances during science operations, we developed a deep learning model for accurate signal extractions confronted with such anomalous scenarios. Our model exhibits the same performance as the current state-of-the-art models do for the ideal and anomaly free scenario, while shows remarkable adaptability in extractions of coalescing massive black hole binary signal against all three types of non-stationarities and even their mixtures. This also provide new explorations into the robustness studies of deep learning models for data processing in space-borne gravitational wave missions.</description>

      <title>Conformal structure of singularities in some varying fundamental constants bimetric cosmologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the conformal structure of singularities arising from varying fundamental constants using the method of Penrose diagrams. We employ a specific type of bimetric model featuring two different metrics. One metric describes the causal structure for matter, while the other characterizes the causal structure for gravitational interactions, which is related to variations in fundamental constants such as the gravitational constant and the speed of light. For this reason, we focused on the gravitational metric to calculate the conformal transformation and compose Penrose diagrams for the singularities arising from the varying fundamental constants. We have shown that, in one case, the parameter such as the scale factor, the density and the pressure resemble those of the finite scale factor singularity (FSF). Despite singularity appears in constant conformal time in our case and in the case of FSF the Misner-Sharp horizon looks different. Our another case is similar to sudden future singularity (SFS), but there are differences in the conformal structures. We have also shown that in our cases the behavior of Misner-Sharp horizon strongly depends on initial conditions. The last analytical solution which we introduced is identical to conformal structure of the standard exotic singularity for the matter.</description>

      <title>Cavity Detection of Gravitational Waves: Where Do We Stand?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) are predicted in various exotic scenarios involving both cosmological and astrophysical sources. These elusive signals have recently sparked the interest of a diverse community of researchers, due to the possibility of HFGW detection in the laboratory through graviton-photon conversion in strong magnetic fields. Notable examples include the redesign of the resonant cavities currently under development to detect the cosmic axion. In this work, we derive the sensitivities of some existing and planned resonant cavities to detect a HFGW background. As a concrete scenario, we consider the collective signals that originate from the merging of compact objects, such as two primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid mass window. Our findings improve over existing work by explicitly discussing and quantifying the loss in the experimental reach due to the actual coherence of the source. We elucidate on the approach we adopt in relation with recent literature on the topic. Most notably, we give a recipe for the estimate of the stochastic background that focuses on the presence of the signal in the cavity at all times and showing that, in the relevant PBH mass region, the signal is dominated by coherent binary mergers.</description>

      <title>Improved Moving-Puncture Techniques for Compact Binary Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To fully unlock the scientific potential of upcoming gravitational wave (GW) interferometers, numerical relativity (NR) simulation accuracy will need to be greatly enhanced. We present three infrastructure-agnostic improvements to the moving-puncture approach for binary black hole (BBH) simulations, aimed at greatly reducing constraint violation and improving GW predictions. Although these improvements were developed within the highly efficient NR code BlackHoles@Home, we demonstrate their effectiveness in the widely-adopted Einstein Toolkit/Carpet AMR framework. Our improvements include a modified Kreiss-Oliger dissipation prescription, a Hamiltonian-constraint-damping adjustment to the BSSN equations, and an extra term to the 1+log lapse evolution equation that slows the development of the sharp lapse feature, which dominates numerical errors in BBH simulations. With minimal increase in computational cost, these improvements greatly reduce GW noise, enabling the extraction of high-order GW modes previously obscured by numerical noise. They also improve convergence properties near and inside the convergent regime, reduce Hamiltonian (momentum) constraint violations in the strong-field region by roughly two (three) orders of magnitude, and in the GW-extraction zone by five (two) orders of magnitude. To promote community adoption, we have open-sourced the improved Einstein Toolkit thorn BaikalVacuum used in this work. Although our focus is on BBH evolutions and the BSSN formulation, these improvements may also benefit compact binary simulations involving matter and other formulations, a focus for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Nonradial instabilities in anisotropic neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-radial oscillation modes of a neutron star possess valuable information about its internal structure and nuclear physics. Starting from the quadrupolar order, such modes under general relativity are known as quasi-normal modes since they dissipate energy through gravitational radiation and their frequencies are complex. The stability of these modes is governed by the sign of the imaginary part of the frequency, which determines whether the mode would decay or grow over time. In this Letter, we develop a fully consistent framework in general relativity to study quasi-normal modes of neutron stars with anisotropic pressure, whose motivation includes strong internal magnetic fields and non-vanishing shear or viscosity. We employ parametrized models for the anisotropy and solve the perturbed Einstein field equations numerically. We find that, unlike the case for isotropic neutron stars, the imaginary parts of some of the pressure ($p$-)modes flip signs as the degree of anisotropy deviates from zero, depicting a transition from stable modes to unstable modes. This finding indicates that some anisotropic neutron star models are unstable, potentially restricting the form of sustained anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several approaches to quantum gravity lead to nonlocal modifications of fields' dynamics. This, in turn, can give rise to nonlocal modifications of quantum mechanics at non-relativistic energies. Here, we analyze the nonlocal Schr\"{o}dinger evolution of a quantum harmonic oscillator in one such scenario, where the problem can be addressed without the use of perturbation theory. We demonstrate that although deviations from standard quantum predictions occur at low occupation numbers, where they could potentially be detected or constrained by high-precision experiments, the classical limits of quantum probability densities and free energy remain unaffected up to energies comparable with the nonlocality scale. These results provide an example of nonlocal quantum dynamics compatible with classical predictions, suggesting massive quantum objects as a promising avenue for testing some phenomenological aspects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virbhadra and Ellis have proposed a very accurate equation (referred to as VE equation) for the gravitational lens in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime [Phys. Rev. D 62,084003 (2000)], whereas an improved equation (referred to as OB equation) has been derived by Bozza [Phys. Rev. D 78, 103005 (2008)] based on a relation found by Ohanian [Am. J. Phys. 55, 428 (1987)]. The OB equation was rediscovered later by Takizawa, Ono and Asada [Phys. Rev. D, 102, 064060 (2020)]. VE and OB equations seem to be very different from each other. The present paper shows that there exists an unphysical branch in the VE equation. Consequently, the VE equation can be improved by removing the unphysical branch. The improved version of the VE equation is found to be the same as the OB equation when a suitable transformation is made between the deflection angles defined differently in the two formulations. An explicit expression of the transformation is found. We also argue possible numerical differences when the transformation between the deflection angles is ignored.</description>

Abstract: This work focuses on gravitational perturbations of black holes in the self-accelerating branch of the Minimal Theory of Massive Gravity (MTMG). This theory is a healthy extension of GR which displays the feature of massive tensor modes, without additional polarizations, strong-coupling issues nor requiring screening mechanisms. We proceed by implementing a newly developed technique that, instead of considering a second-order Schr\"odinger-like reformulation of perturbation equations, relies on a first-order formulation and solves it asymptotically, before numerically deriving the quasi-normal modes. We find that the black holes of MTMG are stable, and that their quasi-normal modes smoothly differ from the GR ones, for non-vanishing values of the graviton mass. This work hence confirms the fact that GR is a smooth limit of MTMG, and opens the exciting possibility of a clean test, performed for instance by the LISA detector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gravitational perturbations of the Schwarzschild metric in the context of noncommutative gravity. $r-\varphi$ and $r-t$ noncommutativity are introduced through a Moyal twist of the Hopf algebra of diffeomorphisms. Differential geometric structures such as curvature tensors are also twisted. Noncommutative equations of motion are derived from the recently proposed NC vacuum Einstein equation. Here, in addition to previously calculated axial NC potential, we present the polar solution which generalizes the work done by Zerilli. Quasinormal mode frequencies of the two potentials are calculated using three methods: WKB, P\"oschl-Teller and Rosen-Morse. Notably, we apply the WKB method up to the 13th order and determine the optimal order for each noncommutative parameter value individually. Additionally, we provide comprehensive error estimations for the higher-order WKB calculations, offering insights into the accuracy of our results. By comparing the spectra, we conclude that the classical isospectrality of axial and polar modes is broken upon spacetime quantization. Isospectrality is restored in the eikonal limit.</description>

      <title>Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter (I): tr-symmetric metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are usually assumed to be described by the Schwarzschild or Kerr metrics, which however feature unwelcome singularities. We study the possibility that PBHs are non-singular objects, considering four phenomenological, regular tr-symmetric space-times, featuring either de Sitter or Minkowski cores. We characterize the evaporation of these PBHs and constrain their abundance from $\gamma$-ray observations. For three of the metrics, including the well-known Bardeen and Hayward ones, we show that constraints on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs, weaken with respect to the Schwarzschild limits, because of modifications to the PBH temperature and greybody factors. This moves the lower edge of the asteroid mass window down by up to an order of magnitude, leading to a much larger region of parameter space where PBHs can make up all the DM. A companion paper is instead devoted to non-tr-symmetric metrics, including loop quantum gravity-inspired ones. Our work provides a proof-of-principle for the interface between the DM and singularity problems being a promising arena with a rich phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: It is a common belief that a theory of quantum gravity should ultimately cure curvature singularities which are inevitable within General Relativity, and plague for instance the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, usually considered as prototypes for primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates. We continue our study, initiated in a companion paper, of non-singular objects as PBHs, considering three regular non-tr-symmetric metrics, all of which are one-parameter extensions of the Schwarzschild space-time: the Simpson-Visser, Peltola-Kunstatter, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times, with the latter two motivated by loop quantum gravity. We study evaporation constraints on PBHs described by these regular metrics, deriving upper limits on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of DM in the form of PBHs. Compared to their Schwarzschild counterparts, these limits are weaker, and result in a larger asteroid mass window where all the DM can be in the form of PBHs. Our work demonstrates as a proof-of-principle that quantum gravity-inspired space-times can simultaneously play an important role in the resolution of singularities and in the DM problem.</description>

      <title>Higher-derivative corrections to the Kerr quasinormal mode spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the most complete analysis so far of quasinormal modes of rotating black holes in a general higher-derivative extension of Einstein's theory. By finding the corrections to the Teukolsky equation and expressing them in a simple form, we are able to apply a generalized continued fraction method that allows us to find the quasinormal mode frequencies including overtones. We obtain the leading-order corrections to the Kerr quasinormal mode frequencies of all the $(l,m,n)$ modes with $l=2,3,4$, $-l\le m\le l$ and $n=0,1,2$, and express them as a function of the black hole spin $\chi$ using polynomial fits. We estimate that our results remain accurate up to spins between $\chi\sim 0.7$ and $\chi\sim 0.95$, depending on the mode. We report that overtones are overall more sensitive to corrections, which is expected from recent literature on this topic. We also discuss the limit of validity of the linear corrections to the quasinormal mode frequencies by estimating the size of nonlinear effects in the higher-derivative couplings. All our results are publicly available in an online repository.</description>

      <title>On the Weyl Tensor for a Curved Spacetime Endowed with a Torsionful Affinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We transcribe into the framework of the {\epsilon}-formalism of Infeld and van der Waerden the world definition of the Weyl tensor for a curved spacetime that occurs in the realm of Einstein-Cartan's theory. The resulting expression shows us that it is not possible to attain any general condition for conformal flatness in such a spacetime even if wave functions for gravitons are eventually taken to vanish identically. A short discussion on the situation concerning the limiting case of general relativity is presented thereafter.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Gravity Effects with Eccentric Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of loop quantum gravity (LQG) on extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), and the results indicate that LQG effects cause the orbital decay to occur faster compared to the Schwarzschild case. Furthermore, we use the augmented analytic kludge approach to generate EMRI waveforms and study the LISA's capability to detect the LQG effect with faithfulness. Additionally, employing the Fisher information matrix method for parameter estimation, we estimate that after one year of observation, the uncertainty in $r_0$ reduces to approximately $6.59\times 10^{-4}$ with a signal-to-noise ratio of $49$.</description>

      <title>Black Holes, Complex Curves, and Graph Theory: Revising a Conjecture by Kasner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ratios $\sqrt{8/9}=2\sqrt{2}/3\approx 0.9428$ and $\sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866$ appear in various contexts of black hole physics, as values of the charge-to-mass ratio $Q/M$ or the rotation parameter $a/M$ for Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr black holes, respectively. In this work, in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om case, I relate these ratios with the quantization of the horizon area, or equivalently of the entropy. Furthermore, these ratios are related to a century-old work of Kasner, in which he conjectured that certain sequences arising from complex analysis may have a quantum interpretation. These numbers also appear in the case of Kerr black holes, but the explanation is not as straightforward. The Kasner ratio may also be relevant for understanding the random matrix and random graph approaches to black hole physics, such as fast scrambling of quantum information, via a bound related to Ramanujan graph. Intriguingly, some other pure mathematical problems in complex analysis, notably complex interpolation in the unit disk, appear to share some mathematical expressions with the black hole problem and thus also involve the Kasner ratio.</description>

      <title>Relaxing CMB bounds on Primordial Black Holes: the role of ionization fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accretion of matter onto primordial black holes (PBHs) during the dark ages and the subsequent energy injection in the medium should have left imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Recent works have claimed stringent CMB limits on the PBH abundance, hardly compatible with a PBH interpretation of the gravitational-wave observations of binary BH mergers. By using a more realistic accretion model based on hydrodynamical simulations and conservative assumptions for the emission efficiency, we show that CMB limits on the PBH abundance are up to two orders of magnitude less stringent than previously estimated between $10$ and $10^4$ M$_\odot$. This reopens the possibility that PBHs might explain at the same time (at least a fraction of) the dark matter, some of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binary BH mergers and the existence of super-massive BHs. More generally, we emphasize that PBH accretion can be a rather complex physical process with velocity dependences that are hard to assess, which introduces large uncertainties in accretion-based limits on the PBH abundance.</description>

      <title>On the negative-result experiments in quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We comment on the so-called negative-result experiments (also known as null measurements, interaction-free measurements, and so on) in quantum mechanics (QM), in the light of the new general understanding of the quantum-measurement processes, proposed recently. All experiments of this kind (null-measurements) can be understood as improper measurements with an intentionally biased detector set up, which introduces exclusion or selection of certain events. The prediction on the state of a microscopic system under study based on a null measurement, is sometimes dramatically described as ``wave-function collapse without any microsystem-detector interactions". Though certainly correct, such a prediction is just a consequence of the standard QM laws, not different from the situation in the so-called state-preparation procedure. Another closely related concept is the (first-class or) repeatable measurements. The verification of the prediction made by a null-measurement requires eventually a standard unbiased measurement involving the microsystem-macroscopic detector interactions, which are nonadiabatic, irreversible processes of signal amplification.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Yang-Mills wormholes haunted by a phantom field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study wormhole spacetimes in the framework of the static spherically symmetric SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills theory coupled to a phantom scalar field. We show rigorously the existence of an infinite sequence of symmetric wormhole solutions, labelled by the number of zeros of the Yang-Mills potential. These solutions have previously been discovered numerically. Mathematically, the problem resembles the pure Einstein-Yang-Mills system for black hole initial conditions, which was well-studied in the 90s. The main difference in the present work is that the coupling to the phantom field adds a non-trivial degree of complexity to the analysis. After proving the existence of the symmetric wormhole solutions, we also present numerical evidence for the existence of asymmetric ones.</description>

      <title>An entanglement asymmetry study of black hole radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hawking's discovery that black holes can evaporate through radiation emission has posed a number of questions that with time became fundamental hallmarks for a quantum theory of gravity. The most famous one is likely the information paradox, which finds an elegant explanation in the Page argument suggesting that a black hole and its radiation can be effectively represented by a random state of qubits. Leveraging the same assumption, we ponder the extent to which a black hole may display emergent symmetries, employing the entanglement asymmetry as a modern, information-based indicator of symmetry breaking. We find that for a random state devoid of any symmetry, a $U(1)$ symmetry emerges and it is exact in the thermodynamic limit before the Page time. At the Page time, the entanglement asymmetry shows a finite jump to a large value. Our findings imply that the emitted radiation is symmetric up to the Page time and then undergoes a sharp transition. Conversely the black hole is symmetric only after the Page time.</description>

      <title>Silk Damping in Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves: A Novel Probe for New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silk damping is well known in the study of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and accounts for suppression of the angular power spectrum of CMB on large angular multipoles. In this Letter, we study the effect of Silk damping on the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). Resulting from the dissipation of cosmic fluid, the Silk damping notably suppresses the energy-density spectrum of SIGWs on scales comparable to a diffusion scale at the decoupling time of feebly-interacting particles. The effect offers a novel observable for probing the underlying particle interaction, especially for those mediated by heavy gauge bosons beyond the standard model of particles. We anticipate that pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to gauge bosons with mass $\sim10^{3}-10^{4}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, while space- and ground-based interferometers to those with mass $\sim10^7-10^{12}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, leading to essential complements to on-going and future experiments of high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Modular Invariant Starobinsky Inflation and the Species Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Potentials in cosmological inflation often involve scalars with trans-Planckian ranges. As a result, towers of states become massless and their presence pushes the fundamental scale not to coincide with $M_{\rm P}$ but rather with the $species\, scale$, $\Lambda$. This scale transforms as an automorphic form of the theory's duality symmetries. We propose that the inflaton potential should be 1) an automorphic invariant form, non-singular over all moduli space, 2) depending only on $\Lambda$ and its field derivatives, and 3) approaching constant values in the large moduli to ensure a long period of inflation. These conditions lead to the proposal $V \sim \lambda(\phi, \phi^*)$, with $\lambda = G^{i\bar{j}} (\partial_i \Lambda)(\partial_{\bar{j}} \Lambda) / \Lambda^2$, determining the 'species scale convex hull'. For a single elliptic complex modulus with $SL(2, Z)$ symmetry, this results in an inflaton potential $V \simeq (\text{Im} \tau)^2 |\tilde{G}_2|^2 / N^2$, with $N \simeq -\log(\text{Im} \tau |\eta(\tau)|^4)$, where $\eta$ is the Dedekind function and $\tilde{G}_2$ the Eisenstein modular form of weight 2. Surprisingly, this potential at large modulus resembles that of the Starobinsky model. We compute inflation parameters yielding results similar to Starobinsky's, but extended to modular invariant expressions. Interestingly, the number of e-folds is proportional to the number of species in the tower, $N_e \simeq N$, and $\epsilon \simeq \Lambda^4$ at large moduli, suggesting that the tower of states plays an important role in the inflation process.</description>

      <title>Entropy and Spectrum of Near-Extremal Black Holes: semiclassical brane solutions to non-perturbative problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The black hole entropy has been observed to generically turn negative at exponentially low temperatures $T\sim e^{-S_0}$ in the extremal Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S_0$, a seeming pathology often attributed to missing non-perturbative effects. In fact, we show that this negativity must happen for any effective theory of quantum gravity with an ensemble description. To do so, we identify the usual gravitational entropy as an annealed entropy $S_a$, and prove that this quantity gives $S_0$ at extremality if and only if the ground-state energy is protected by supersymmetry, and diverges negatively otherwise. The actual thermodynamically-behaved quantity is the average or quenched entropy $S_q$, whose calculation is poorly understood in gravity: it involves replica wormholes in a regime where the topological expansion breaks down. Using matrix integrals we find new instanton saddles that dominate gravitational correlators at $T\sim e^{-S_0}$ and are dual to semiclassical wormholes involving dynamical branes. These brane solutions give the leading contribution to any black hole very near extremality, and a duality with matrix ensembles would not make sense without them. In the non-BPS case, they are required to make $S_q$ non-negative and also enhance the negativity of $S_a$, both effects consistent with matrix integrals evaluated exactly. Our instanton results are tested against the on-shell action of D3-branes dual to multiply wrapped Wilson loops in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-YM, and a precise match is found. Our analysis of low-energy random matrix spectra also explains the origin of spectral gaps in supersymmetric theories, not only when there are BPS states at zero energy, but also for purely non-BPS supermultiplets. In the former, our prediction for the gap in terms of the degeneracy of BPS states agrees with the R-charge scaling in gapped multiplets of $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-JT gravity.</description>

      <title>Higher derivative SVT theories from Kaluza-Klein reductions of Horndeski theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently pointed out that some precise Photon-Galileon couplings in four dimensions (4D) -- inspired by a higher dimensional reduction -- are enough to obtain a Horndeski theory that is less constrained by the stringent experimental bounds on the speed of Gravitational Waves. They imply the constancy of the ratio of speed of gravity to light throughout cosmic evolution. This holds without fine tuning, even if one includes the general $G_4 (\pi,X)$ and $G_5 (\pi)$ scalar potentials. In this paper we go into the details of this 4D Luminal extension of Horndeski theory including its scalar sector. We also present the complete action including the general $G_5(\pi,X),\, G_6(\pi,X)$ scalar potentials. Thus we show all the $U(1)$ gauge invariant vector Galileons in 4D that result from a Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction from 5D Horndeski. They provide a consistent coupling of a higher derivative vector to scalar modifications of gravity -- namely, without inducing Ostrogradsky ghosts and keeping gauge invariance -- in the aim to explore more universal couplings of dark energy to other matter, such as vectors and in particular the Photon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a coupled system consisting of a complex scalar field, a U(1) gauge field, a complex Higgs scalar field, and Einstein gravity. We present nontopological soliton star solutions in which the interior geometry is described by the de Sitter metric, the exterior by the Schwarzschild metric, and these two regions are attached by a spherical surface layer with a finite thickness. This structure is the same as the so-called gravastars, so we refer to these solutions as \lq solitonic gravastars\rq . We demonstrate that compact solitonic gravastars that possessing photon spheres can appear. Additionally, we study the mass and compactness of solitonic gravastars for various sets of parameters that characterize the system.</description>
