      <title>Quantitative estimates of $L^p$ maximal regularity for nonautonomous operators and global existence for quasilinear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain quantitative estimates of the continuity constant for the $L^p$ maximal regularity of relatively continuous nonautonomous operators $\mathbb{A} : I \longrightarrow \mathcal{L}(D,X)$, where $D \subset X$ densely and compactly. They allow in particular to establish a new general growth condition for the global existence of strong solutions of Cauchy problems for nonlocal quasilinear equations for a certain class of nonlinearities $u \longrightarrow \mathbb{A}(u)$. The estimates obtained rely on the precise asymptotic analysis of the continuity constant with respect to perturbations of the operator of the form $\mathbb{A}(\cdot) + \lambda I$ as $\lambda \longrightarrow \pm \infty$. A complementary work in preparation supplements this abstract inquiry with an application of these results to nonlocal parabolic equations in noncylindrical domains depending on the time variable.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of a class of linear hyperbolic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of linear hyperbolic partial differential equations, sometimes called networks of waves, is considered. For this class of systems, necessary and sufficient conditions are formulated for the operator dynamics to generate a $C_0$-group. This property turns out to be equivalent to the Riesz-spectral nature of that operator. In that case, its spectrum is computed explicitly, leading to easily checkable stability conditions. We apply our results to characterize exponential stability of a co-current heat exchanger.</description>

      <title>Quantum Time-Frequency Analysis and Pseudodifferential Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Quantum Time-Frequency Analysis, which expands the approach of Quantum Harmonic Analysis to include modulations of operators in addition to translations. This is done by a projective representation of double-phase space, and we consider the associated matrix coefficients and integrated representation. This leads to the polarised Cohen's class, which is an isomorphism from Hilbert-Schmidt operators to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and has orthogonality relations similar to many objects in classical time-frequency analysis. By considering a class of windows for the polarised Cohen's class that is smaller than the class of Hilbert-Schmidt operators, then we find spaces of modulation spaces of operators, and we consider the properties of these spaces, including discretisation results and mapping properties between function modulation spaces. We also compare modulation spaces of operators to known symbol classes for pseudodifferential operators. In many cases, using rank-one examples of operators, we recover familiar objects and results from classical time-frequency analysis and the theory of pseudodifferential operators.</description>

      <title>Properties of Lipschitz smoothing heat semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove several functional and geometric inequalities only assuming the linearity and a quantitative $\mathrm{L}^\infty$-to-Lipschitz smoothing of the heat semigroup in metric-measure spaces. Our results comprise a Buser inequality, a lower bound on the size of the nodal set of a Laplacian eigenfunction, and different estimates involving the Wasserstein distance. The approach works in large variety settings, including Riemannian manifolds with a variable Kato-type lower bound on the Ricci curvature tensor, $\mathsf{RCD}(K,\infty)$ spaces, and some sub-Riemannian structures, such as Carnot groups, the Grushin plane and the $\mathbb{SU}(2)$ group.</description>

      <title>Generalized Carleson Embeddings of M{\"u}ntz Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes Carleson embeddings of M{\"u}ntz spaces $M^q_{\Lambda}$ into weighted Lebesgue spaces $L^p(\mathrm{d}\mu)$, where $\mu$ is a Borel regular measure on $[0,1]$ satisfying $\mu([1-\varepsilon])\lesssim \varepsilon^{\beta}$. In the case $\beta \geqslant 1$ we show that such measures are exactly the ones for which Carleson embeddings $L^{\frac{p}{\beta}} \hookrightarrow L^p(\mathrm{d}\mu)$ hold. The case $\beta \in (0,1)$ is more intricate but we characterize such measures $\mu$ in terms of a summability condition on their moments. Our proof relies on a generalization of $L^p$ estimates {\`a} la Gurariy-Macaev in the weighted $L^p$ spaces setting, which we think can be of interest in other contexts.</description>

      <title>Fubini's Theorem for Daniell Integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.00762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in the theory of Daniell integration iterated integrals may always be formed, and the order of integration may always be interchanged. By this means, we discuss product integrals and show that the related Fubini theorem holds in full generality. The results build on a density theorem on Riesz tensor products due to Fremlin, and on the Fubini-Stone Theorem.</description>

      <title>Equality in some symplectic eigenvalue inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last decade, numerous works have investigated several properties of symplectic eigenvalues. Remarkably, the results on symplectic eigenvalues have been found to be analogous to those of eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices with appropriate interpretations. In particular, symplectic analogs of famous eigenvalue inequalities are known today such as Weyl's inequalities, Lidskii's inequalities, and Schur--Horn majorization inequalities. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for equality in the symplectic analogs of the aforementioned inequalities. The equality conditions for the symplectic Weyl's and Lidskii's inequalities turn out to be analogous to the known equality conditions for eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Abstract dissipative Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations are everywhere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the representation of partial differential equations (PDEs) as abstract differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) with dissipative Hamiltonian structure (adHDAEs). We show that these systems not only arise when there are constraints coming from the underlying physics, but many standard PDE models can be seen as an adHDAE on an extended state space. This reflects the fact that models often include closure relations and structural properties. We present a unifying operator theoretic approach to analyze the properties of such operator equations and illustrate this by several applications.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and study the notion of (e,y)-conjugate for a proper and e-convex function in locally convex spaces, which is an extension of the concept of the conjugate. The mutual relationships between the concepts of (e,y)-conjugacy and e-subdifferential are presented. Moreover, some applications of these notions in optimization are established.</description>

      <title>Global universal approximation of functional input maps on weighted spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03303v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce so-called functional input neural networks defined on a possibly infinite dimensional weighted space with values also in a possibly infinite dimensional output space. To this end, we use an additive family to map the input weighted space to the hidden layer, on which a non-linear scalar activation function is applied to each neuron, and finally return the output via some linear readouts. Relying on Stone-Weierstrass theorems on weighted spaces, we can prove a global universal approximation result on weighted spaces for continuous functions going beyond the usual approximation on compact sets. This then applies in particular to approximation of (non-anticipative) path space functionals via functional input neural networks. As a further application of the weighted Stone-Weierstrass theorem we prove a global universal approximation result for linear functions of the signature. We also introduce the viewpoint of Gaussian process regression in this setting and emphasize that the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the signature kernels are Cameron-Martin spaces of certain Gaussian processes. This paves a way towards uncertainty quantification for signature kernel regression.</description>

      <title>A short proof of Tomita's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tomita-Takesaki theory associates a positive operator called the "modular operator" with a von Neumann algebra and a cyclic-separating vector. Tomita's theorem says that the unitary flow generated by the modular operator leaves the algebra invariant. I give a new, short proof of this theorem which only uses the analytic structure of unitary flows, and which avoids operator-valued Fourier transforms (as in van Daele's proof) and operator-valued Mellin transforms (as in Zsid\'{o}'s and Woronowicz's proofs). The proof is similar to one given by Bratteli and Robinson in the special case that the modular operator is bounded.</description>
