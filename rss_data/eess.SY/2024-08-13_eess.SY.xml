      <title>Beyond the Neural Fog: Interpretable Learning for AC Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem is essential for power system operations, but its non-convex nature makes it challenging to solve. A widely used simplification is the linearized DC optimal power flow (DC-OPF) problem, which can be solved to global optimality, but whose optimal solution is always infeasible in the original AC-OPF problem. Recently, neural networks (NN) have been introduced for solving the AC-OPF problem at significantly faster computation times. However, these methods necessitate extensive datasets, are difficult to train, and are often viewed as black boxes, leading to resistance from operators who prefer more transparent and interpretable solutions. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning-based approach that merges simplicity and interpretability, providing a bridge between traditional approximation methods and black-box learning techniques. Our approach not only provides transparency for operators but also achieves competitive accuracy. Numerical results across various power networks demonstrate that our method provides accuracy comparable to, and often surpassing, that of neural networks, particularly when training datasets are limited.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of renewable energy sources into power systems, highlighting the resulting complexities such as variability and intermittency that challenge traditional power flow dynamics. We delve into innovative Optimal Power Flow (OPF) strategies designed to manage the unpredictability of renewable sources while ensuring economically viable and stable grid operations. A thorough review of state-of-the-art OPF algorithms, particularly those that enhance systems with substantial renewable integration, is presented. The discussion spans fundamental OPF principles, adaptations to renewable energies, and categorization of the latest advancements in areas such as energy uncertainty management, energy storage integration, linearization techniques application, and data-driven strategy utilization. Each sector's application benefits and limitations are critically analyzed. The paper concludes by pinpointing ongoing challenges and suggesting future research trajectories to foster adaptable and robust power system operations in the renewable-dominant energy era.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Parameterized Barrier Function for Safety-Critical Control of Unknown Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing complexity of real-world systems and varying environmental uncertainties, it is difficult to build an accurate dynamic model, which poses challenges especially for safety-critical control. In this paper, a learning-based control policy is proposed to ensure the safety of systems with unknown disturbances through control barrier functions (CBFs). First, the disturbance is predicted by Gaussian process (GP) regression, whose prediction performance is guaranteed by a deterministic error bound. Then, a novel control strategy using GP-based parameterized high-order control barrier functions (GP-P-HOCBFs) is proposed via a shrunk original safe set based on the prediction error bound. In comparison to existing methods that involve adding strict robust safety terms to the HOCBF condition, the proposed method offers more flexibility to deal with the conservatism and the feasibility of solving quadratic problems within the CBF framework. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulations on Franka Emika manipulator.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Metropolitan Carbon Emissions with Dynamic Eco-driving at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sheer scale and diversity of transportation make it a formidable sector to decarbonize. Here, we consider an emerging opportunity to reduce carbon emissions: the growing adoption of semi-autonomous vehicles, which can be programmed to mitigate stop-and-go traffic through intelligent speed commands and, thus, reduce emissions. But would such dynamic eco-driving move the needle on climate change? A comprehensive impact analysis has been out of reach due to the vast array of traffic scenarios and the complexity of vehicle emissions. We address this challenge with large-scale scenario modeling efforts and by using multi-task deep reinforcement learning with a carefully designed network decomposition strategy. We perform an in-depth prospective impact assessment of dynamic eco-driving at 6,011 signalized intersections across three major US metropolitan cities, simulating a million traffic scenarios. Overall, we find that vehicle trajectories optimized for emissions can cut city-wide intersection carbon emissions by 11-22%, without harming throughput or safety, and with reasonable assumptions, equivalent to the national emissions of Israel and Nigeria, respectively. We find that 10% eco-driving adoption yields 25%-50% of the total reduction, and nearly 70% of the benefits come from 20% of intersections, suggesting near-term implementation pathways. However, the composition of this high-impact subset of intersections varies considerably across different adoption levels, with minimal overlap, calling for careful strategic planning for eco-driving deployments. Moreover, the impact of eco-driving, when considered jointly with projections of vehicle electrification and hybrid vehicle adoption remains significant. More broadly, this work paves the way for large-scale analysis of traffic externalities, such as time, safety, and air quality, and the potential impact of solution strategies.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Wireless MAC Protocol Design and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a novel Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) framework for MAC protocol design. Unlike centralized approaches, which rely on a single entity for decision-making, MADRL empowers individual network nodes to autonomously learn and optimize their MAC based on local observations. Leveraging ns3-ai and RLlib, as far as we are aware of, our framework is the first of a kind that enables distributed multi-agent learning within the ns-3 environment, facilitating the design and synthesis of adaptive MAC protocols tailored to specific environmental conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the MADRL MAC framework through extensive simulations, showcasing superior performance compared to legacy protocols across diverse scenarios. Our findings highlight the potential of MADRL-based MAC protocols to significantly enhance Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for future wireless applications.</description>

      <title>Time-limited H2-optimal Model Order Reduction of Linear Systems with Quadratic Outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important class of dynamical systems with several practical applications is linear systems with quadratic outputs. These models have the same state equation as standard linear time-invariant systems but differ in their output equations, which are nonlinear quadratic functions of the system states. When dealing with models of exceptionally high order, the computational demands for simulation and analysis can become overwhelming. In such cases, model order reduction proves to be a useful technique, as it allows for constructing a reduced-order model that accurately represents the essential characteristics of the original high-order system while significantly simplifying its complexity.
  In time-limited model order reduction, the main goal is to maintain the output response of the original system within a specific time range in the reduced-order model. To assess the error within this time interval, a mathematical expression for the time-limited $\mathcal{H}_2$-norm is derived in this paper. This norm acts as a measure of the accuracy of the reduced-order model within the specified time range. Subsequently, the necessary conditions for achieving a local optimum of the time-limited $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm error are derived. The inherent inability to satisfy these optimality conditions within the Petrov-Galerkin projection framework is also discussed. After that, a stationary point iteration algorithm based on the optimality conditions and Petrov-Galerkin projection is proposed. Upon convergence, this algorithm fulfills three of the four optimality conditions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a numerical example is provided that showcases its ability to effectively approximate the original high-order model within the desired time interval.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Stability Analysis of Microgrids with Converter-Interfaced Distributed Energy Resources, Part I: Modelling and Theoretical Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method for the Harmonic Stability Assessment (HSA) of power systems with a high share of Converter-Interfaced Distributed Energy Resources (CIDERs). To this end, the Harmonic State-Space (HSS) model of a generic power system is formulated by combining the HSS models of the resources and the grid in closed-loop configuration. The HSS model of the resources is obtained from the Linear Time Periodic (LTP) models of the CIDER components transformed to frequency domain using Fourier theory and Toeplitz matrices. Notably, the HSS of a CIDER is capable of representing the coupling between harmonic frequencies in detail. The HSS model of the grid is derived from the dynamic equations of the individual branch and shunt elements. The system matrix of the HSS models on power-system or resource level is employed for eigenvalue analysis in the context of HSA. A sensitivity analysis of the eigenvalue loci w.r.t. changes in model parameters, and a classification of eigenvalues into control-design variant, control-design invariant, and design invariant eigenvalues is proposed. A case of harmonic instability is identified by the HSA and validated via Time-Domain Simulations (TDS) in Simulink.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Stability Analysis of Microgrids with Converter-Interfaced Distributed Energy Resources, Part II: Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Part I of this paper a method for the Harmonic Stability Assessment (HSA) of power systems with a high share of Converter-Interfaced Distributed Energy Resources (CIDERs) was proposed. Specifically, the Harmonic State-Space (HSS) model of a generic power system is derived through combination of the components HSS models. The HSS models of CIDERs and grid are based on Linear Time-Periodic (LTP) models, capable of representing the coupling between different harmonics. In Part II, the HSA of a grid-forming, and two grid-following CIDERs (i.e., ex- and including the DC-side modelling) is performed. More precisely, the classification of the eigenvalues, the impact of the maximum harmonic order on the locations of the eigenvalues, and the sensitivity curves of the eigenvalues w.r.t. to control parameters are provided. These analyses allow to study the physical meaning and origin of the CIDERs eigenvalues. Additionally, the HSA is performed for a representative example system derived from the CIGRE low-voltage benchmark system. A case of harmonic instability is identified through the system eigenvalues, and validated with Time-Domain Simulations (TDS) in Simulink. It is demonstrated that, as opposed to stability analyses based on Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) models, the HSA is suitable for the detection of harmonic instability.</description>

      <title>Peaking into the Black-box: Prediction Intervals Give Insight into Data-driven Quadrotor Model Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the reliability and validity of data-driven quadrotor model predictions is essential for their accepted and practical use. This is especially true for grey- and black-box models wherein the mapping of inputs to predictions is not transparent and subsequent reliability notoriously difficult to ascertain. Nonetheless, such techniques are frequently and successfully used to identify quadrotor models. Prediction intervals (PIs) may be employed to provide insight into the consistency and accuracy of model predictions. This paper estimates such PIs for polynomial and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) quadrotor aerodynamic models. Two existing ANN PI estimation techniques - the bootstrap method and the quality driven method - are validated numerically for quadrotor aerodynamic models using an existing high-fidelity quadrotor simulation. Quadrotor aerodynamic models are then identified on real quadrotor flight data to demonstrate their utility and explore their sensitivity to model interpolation and extrapolation. It is found that the ANN-based PIs widen considerably when extrapolating and remain constant, or shrink, when interpolating. While this behaviour also occurs for the polynomial PIs, it is of lower magnitude. The estimated PIs establish probabilistic bounds within which the quadrotor model outputs will likely lie, subject to modelling and measurement uncertainties that are reflected through the PI widths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method for controlling a DC-DC converter is proposed to ensures the high quality control at large fluctuations in load currents by using differential gain control coefficients and second derivative control. Various implementations of balancing the currents of a multiphase DC-DC converter are discussed, with a focus on achieving accurate current regulation without introducing additional delay in the control system. Stochastic particle swarm optimization method is used to find optimal values of the PID controller parameters. An automatic constraint-handling in optimization are also discussed as relevant techniques in the field.</description>

      <title>Modelling of measuring systems -- From white box models to cognitive approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical models of measuring systems and processes play an essential role in metrology and practical measurements. They form the basis for understanding and evaluating measurements, their results and their trustworthiness. Classic analytical parametric modelling is based on largely complete knowledge of measurement technology and the measurement process. But due to digital transformation towards the Internet of Things (IIoT) with an increasing number of intensively and flexibly networked measurement systems and consequently ever larger amounts of data to be processed, data-based modelling approaches have gained enormous importance. This has led to new approaches in measurement technology and industry like Digital Twins, Self-X Approaches, Soft Sensor Technology and Data and Information Fusion. In the future, data-based modelling will be increasingly dominated by intelligent, cognitive systems. Evaluating of the accuracy, trustworthiness and the functional uncertainty of the corresponding models is required.
  This paper provides a concise overview of modelling in metrology from classical white box models to intelligent, cognitive data-driven solutions identifying advantages and limitations. Additionally, the approaches to merge trustworthiness and metrological uncertainty will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Hi-SAM: A high-scalable authentication model for satellite-ground Zero-Trust system using mean field game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As more and more Internet of Thing (IoT) devices are connected to satellite networks, the Zero-Trust Architecture brings dynamic security to the satellite-ground system, while frequent authentication creates challenges for system availability. To make the system's accommodate more IoT devices, this paper proposes a high-scalable authentication model (Hi-SAM). Hi-SAM introduces the Proof-of-Work idea to authentication, which allows device to obtain the network resource based on frequency. To optimize the frequency, mean field game is used for competition among devices, which can reduce the decision space of large-scale population games. And a dynamic time-range message authentication code is designed for security. From the test at large population scales, Hi-SAM is superior in the optimization of authentication workload and the anomaly detection efficiency.</description>

      <title>Event-triggered moving horizon estimation for nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes an event-triggered moving horizon estimation (ET-MHE) scheme for general nonlinear systems. The key components of the proposed scheme are a novel event-triggering mechanism (ETM) and the suitable design of the MHE cost function. The main characteristic of our method is that the MHE's nonlinear optimization problem is only solved when the ETM triggers the transmission of measured data to the remote state estimator. If no event occurs, then the current state estimate results from an open-loop prediction using the system dynamics. Furthermore, we show robust global exponential stability of the ET-MHE under a suitable detectability condition. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of the proposed method in terms of a nonlinear benchmark example, where we achieved similar estimation performance compared to standard MHE using 86% less computational resources.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Prediction of Minimum Operating Voltage via Inter- and Intra-Wafer Variation Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the minimum operating voltage ($V_{min}$) of chips stands as a crucial technique in enhancing the speed and reliability of manufacturing testing flow. However, existing $V_{min}$ prediction methods often overlook various sources of variations in both training and deployment phases. Notably, the neglect of wafer zone-to-zone (intra-wafer) variations and wafer-to-wafer (inter-wafer) variations, compounded by process variations, diminishes the accuracy, data efficiency, and reliability of $V_{min}$ predictors. To address this gap, we introduce a novel data-efficient $V_{min}$ prediction flow, termed restricted bias alignment (RBA), which incorporates a novel variation alignment technique. Our approach concurrently estimates inter- and intra-wafer variations. Furthermore, we propose utilizing class probe data to model inter-wafer variations for the first time. We empirically demonstrate RBA's effectiveness and data efficiency on an industrial 16nm automotive chip dataset.</description>

      <title>Moving past point-contacts: Extending the ALIP model to humanoids with non-trivial feet using hierarchical, full-body momentum control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Angular-Momentum Linear Inverted Pendulum (ALIP) model is a promising motion planner for bipedal robots. However, it relies on two assumptions: (1) the robot has point-contact feet or passive ankles, and (2) the angular momentum around the center of mass, known as centroidal angular momentum, is negligible. This paper addresses the question of whether the ALIP paradigm can be applied to more general bipedal systems with complex foot geometry (e.g., flat feet) and nontrivial torso/limb inertia and mass distribution (e.g., non-centralized arms). In such systems, the dynamics introduce non-negligible centroidal momentum and contact wrenches at the feet, rendering the assumptions of the ALIP model invalid. This paper presents the ALIP planner for general bipedal robots with non-point-contact feet through the use of a task-space whole-body controller that regulates centroidal momentum, thereby ensuring that the robot's behavior aligns with the desired template dynamics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conduct simulations using the Sarcos Guardian XO robot, which is a hybrid humanoid/exoskeleton with large, offset feet. The results demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of our approach in achieving stable and versatile bipedal locomotion.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Computing for Chemical Applications</title>

Abstract: In recent years, interest in quantum computing has increased due to technological advances in quantum hardware and algorithms. Despite the promises of quantum advantage, the applicability of quantum devices has been limited to few qubits on hardware that experiences decoherence due to noise. One proposed method to get around this challenge is distributed quantum computing (DQC). Like classical distributed computing, DQC aims at increasing compute power by spreading the compute processes across many devices, with the goal to minimize the noise and circuit depth required by quantum devices. In this paper, we cover the fundamental concepts of DQC and provide insight into where the field of DQC stands with respect to the field of chemistry -- a field which can potentially be used to demonstrate quantum advantage on noisy-intermediate scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>On Noise Resiliency of Neuromorphic Inferential Communication in Microgrids</title>

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing leveraging spiking neural network has emerged as a promising solution to tackle the security and reliability challenges with the conventional cyber-physical infrastructure of microgrids. Its event-driven paradigm facilitates promising prospect in resilient and energy-efficient coordination among power electronic converters. However, different from biological neurons that are focused in the literature, microgrids exhibit distinct architectures and features, implying potentially diverse adaptability in its capabilities to dismiss information transfer, which remains largely unrevealed. One of the biggest drawbacks in the information transfer theory is the impact of noise in the signaling accuracy. Hence, this article hereby explores the noise resiliency of neuromorphic inferential communication in microgrids through case studies and underlines potential challenges and solutions as extensions beyond the results, thus offering insights for its implementation in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Convergence Guarantee of Dynamic Programming for LTL Surrogate Reward</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is a formal way of specifying complex objectives for planning problems modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The planning problem aims to find the optimal policy that maximizes the satisfaction probability of the LTL objective. One way to solve the planning problem is to use the surrogate reward with two discount factors and dynamic programming, which bypasses the graph analysis used in traditional model-checking. The surrogate reward is designed such that its value function represents the satisfaction probability. However, in some cases where one of the discount factors is set to $1$ for higher accuracy, the computation of the value function using dynamic programming is not guaranteed. This work shows that a multi-step contraction always exists during dynamic programming updates, guaranteeing that the approximate value function will converge exponentially to the true value function. Thus, the computation of satisfaction probability is guaranteed.</description>

      <title>ICGMM: CXL-enabled Memory Expansion with Intelligent Caching Using Gaussian Mixture Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compute Express Link (CXL) emerges as a solution for wide gap between computational speed and data communication rates among host and multiple devices. It fosters a unified and coherent memory space between host and CXL storage devices such as such as Solid-state drive (SSD) for memory expansion, with a corresponding DRAM implemented as the device cache. However, this introduces challenges such as substantial cache miss penalties, sub-optimal caching due to data access granularity mismatch between the DRAM "cache" and SSD "memory", and inefficient hardware cache management. To address these issues, we propose a novel solution, named ICGMM, which optimizes caching and eviction directly on hardware, employing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based approach. We prototype our solution on an FPGA board, which demonstrates a noteworthy improvement compared to the classic Least Recently Used (LRU) cache strategy. We observe a decrease in the cache miss rate ranging from 0.32% to 6.14%, leading to a substantial 16.23% to 39.14% reduction in the average SSD access latency. Furthermore, when compared to the state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based cache policies, our GMM algorithm on FPGA showcases an impressive latency reduction of over 10,000 times. Remarkably, this is achieved while demanding much fewer hardware resources.</description>

Abstract: Recently, machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, have demonstrated superior performance over traditional time series forecasting methods across various applications, including both single-variable and multi-variable predictions. This study aims to investigate the capability of i) Next Generation Reservoir Computing (NG-RC) ii) Reservoir Computing (RC) iii) Long short-term Memory (LSTM) for predicting chaotic system behavior, and to compare their performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. These methods are applied to predict time series obtained from four representative chaotic systems including Lorenz, R\"ossler, Chen, Qi systems. In conclusion, we found that NG-RC is more computationally efficient and offers greater potential for predicting chaotic system behavior.</description>

      <title>High Probability Low Latency Sequential Change Detection over an Unknown Finite Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A finite horizon variant of the quickest change detection problem is studied, in which the goal is to minimize a delay threshold (latency), under constraints on the probability of false alarm and the probability that the latency is exceeded. In addition, the horizon is not known to the change detector. A variant of the cumulative sum (CuSum) test with a threshold that increasing logarithmically with time is proposed as a candidate solution to the problem. An information-theoretic lower bound on the minimum value of the latency under the constraints is then developed. This lower bound is used to establish certain asymptotic optimality properties of the proposed test in terms of the horizon and the false alarm probability. Some experimental results are given to illustrate the performance of the test.</description>

      <title>Identifying Feedforward and Feedback Controllable Subspaces of Neural Population Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is overwhelming evidence that cognition, perception, and action rely on feedback control. However, if and how neural population dynamics are amenable to different control strategies is poorly understood, in large part because machine learning methods to directly assess controllability in neural population dynamics are lacking. To address this gap, we developed a novel dimensionality reduction method, Feedback Controllability Components Analysis (FCCA), that identifies subspaces of linear dynamical systems that are most feedback controllable based on a new measure of feedback controllability. We further show that PCA identifies subspaces of linear dynamical systems that maximize a measure of feedforward controllability. As such, FCCA and PCA are data-driven methods to identify subspaces of neural population data (approximated as linear dynamical systems) that are most feedback and feedforward controllable respectively, and are thus natural contrasts for hypothesis testing. We developed new theory that proves that non-normality of underlying dynamics determines the divergence between FCCA and PCA solutions, and confirmed this in numerical simulations. Applying FCCA to diverse neural population recordings, we find that feedback controllable dynamics are geometrically distinct from PCA subspaces and are better predictors of animal behavior. Our methods provide a novel approach towards analyzing neural population dynamics from a control theoretic perspective, and indicate that feedback controllable subspaces are important for behavior.</description>

Abstract: While FL is a widely popular distributed ML strategy that protects data privacy, time-varying wireless network parameters and heterogeneous system configurations of the wireless device pose significant challenges. Although the limited radio and computational resources of the network and the clients, respectively, are widely acknowledged, two critical yet often ignored aspects are (a) wireless devices can only dedicate a small chunk of their limited storage for the FL task and (b) new training samples may arrive in an online manner in many practical wireless applications. Therefore, we propose a new FL algorithm called OSAFL, specifically designed to learn tasks relevant to wireless applications under these practical considerations. Since it has long been proven that under extreme resource constraints, clients may perform an arbitrary number of local training steps, which may lead to client drift under statistically heterogeneous data distributions, we leverage normalized gradient similarities and exploit weighting clients' updates based on optimized scores that facilitate the convergence rate of the proposed OSAFL algorithm. Our extensive simulation results on two different tasks -- each with three different datasets -- with four popular ML models validate the effectiveness of OSAFL compared to six existing state-of-the-art FL baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Close-proximity exploration of small celestial bodies is crucial for the comprehensive and accurate characterization of their properties. However, the complex and uncertain dynamical environment around them contributes to a rapid dispersion of uncertainty and the emergence of non-Gaussian distributions. Therefore, to ensure safe operations, a precise understanding of uncertainty propagation becomes imperative. In this work, the dynamical environment is analyzed around two asteroids, Apophis, which will perform a close flyby to Earth in 2029, and Eros, which has been already explored by past missions. The performance of different uncertainty propagation methods (Linear Covariance Propagation, Unscented Transformation, and Polynomial Chaos Expansion) are compared in various scenarios of close-proximity operations around the two asteroids. Findings are discussed in terms of propagation accuracy and computational efficiency depending on the dynamical environment. By exploring these methodologies, this work contributes to the broader goal of ensuring the safety and effectiveness of spacecraft operations during close-proximity exploration of small celestial bodies.</description>

      <title>A novel metric for detecting quadrotor loss-of-control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming an integral part of both industry and society. In particular, the quadrotor is now invaluable across a plethora of fields and recent developments, such as the inclusion of aerial manipulators, only extends their versatility. As UAVs become more widespread, preventing loss-of-control (LOC) is an ever growing concern. Unfortunately, LOC is not clearly defined for quadrotors, or indeed, many other autonomous systems. Moreover, any existing definitions are often incomplete and restrictive. A novel metric, based on actuator capabilities, is introduced to detect LOC in quadrotors. The potential of this metric for LOC detection is demonstrated through both simulated and real quadrotor flight data. It is able to detect LOC induced by actuator faults without explicit knowledge of the occurrence and nature of the failure. The proposed metric is also sensitive enough to detect LOC in more nuanced cases, where the quadrotor remains undamaged but nevertheless losses control through an aggressive yawing manoeuvre. As the metric depends only on system and actuator models, it is sufficiently general to be applied to other systems.</description>

      <title>The Distributionally Robust Infinite-Horizon LQR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the infinite-horizon Distributionally Robust (DR) linear-quadratic control. While the probability distribution of disturbances is unknown and potentially correlated over time, it is confined within a Wasserstein-2 ball of a radius $r$ around a known nominal distribution. Our goal is to devise a control policy that minimizes the worst-case expected Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) cost among all probability distributions of disturbances lying in the Wasserstein ambiguity set. We obtain the optimality conditions for the optimal DR controller and show that it is non-rational. Despite lacking a finite-order state-space representation, we introduce a computationally tractable fixed-point iteration algorithm. Our proposed method computes the optimal controller in the frequency domain to any desired fidelity. Moreover, for any given finite order, we use a convex numerical method to compute the best rational approximation (in $H_\infty$-norm) to the optimal non-rational DR controller. This enables efficient time-domain implementation by finite-order state-space controllers and addresses the computational hurdles associated with the finite-horizon approaches to DR-LQR problems, which typically necessitate solving a Semi-Definite Program (SDP) with a dimension scaling with the time horizon. We provide numerical simulations to showcase the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for multi-agent learning in a nonstationary dynamic network environment. More specifically, we examine projected gradient play in smooth monotone repeated network games in which the agents' participation and connectivity vary over time. We model this changing system with a stochastic network which takes a new independent realization at each repetition. We show that the strategy profile learned by the agents through projected gradient dynamics over the sequence of network realizations converges to a Nash equilibrium of the game in which players minimize their expected cost, almost surely and in the mean-square sense. We then show that the learned strategy profile is an almost Nash equilibrium of the game played by the agents at each stage of the repeated game with high probability. Using these two results, we derive non-asymptotic bounds on the regret incurred by the agents.</description>

      <title>Structures of M-Invariant Dual Subspaces with Respect to a Boolean Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the following research findings on Boolean networks (BNs) and their dual subspaces.First, we establish a bijection between the dual subspaces of a BN and the partitions of its state set. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a dual subspace is $M$-invariant if and only if the associated partition is equitable (i.e., for every two cells of the partition, every two states in the former have the same number of out-neighbors in the latter) for the BN's state-transition graph (STG). Here $M$ represents the structure matrix of the BN.Based on the equitable graphic representation, we provide, for the first time, a complete structural characterization of the smallest $M$-invariant dual subspaces generated by a set of Boolean functions. Given a set of output functions, we prove that a BN is observable if and only if the partition corresponding to the smallest $M$-invariant dual subspace generated by this set of functions is trivial (i.e., all partition cells are singletons). Building upon our structural characterization, we also present a method for constructing output functions that render the BN observable.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Based Minimum State-flipped Control for the Reachability of Boolean Control Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes model-free reinforcement learning methods for minimum-cost state-flipped control in Boolean control networks (BCNs). We tackle two questions: 1) finding the flipping kernel, namely the flip set with the smallest cardinality ensuring reachability, and 2) deriving optimal policies to minimize the number of flipping actions for reachability based on the obtained flipping kernel. For question 1), Q-learning's capability in determining reachability is demonstrated. To expedite convergence, we incorporate two improvements: i) demonstrating that previously reachable states remain reachable after adding elements to the flip set, followed by employing transfer learning, and ii) initiating each episode with special initial states whose reachability to the target state set are currently unknown. Question 2) requires optimal control with terminal constraints, while Q-learning only handles unconstrained problems. To bridge the gap, we propose a BCN-characteristics-based reward scheme and prove its optimality. Questions 1) and 2) with large-scale BCNs are addressed by employing small memory Q-learning, which reduces memory usage by only recording visited action-values. An upper bound on memory usage is provided to assess the algorithm's feasibility. To expedite convergence for question 2) in large-scale BCNs, we introduce adaptive variable rewards based on the known maximum steps needed to reach the target state set without cycles. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated on both small- and large-scale BCNs.</description>

      <title>Offline and Online Use of Interval and Set-Based Approaches for Control and State Estimation: A Selection of Methodological Approaches and Their Application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control and state estimation procedures need to be robust against imprecisely known parameters, uncertainty in initial conditions, and external disturbances. Interval methods and other set-based techniques form the basis for the implementation of powerful approaches that can be used to identify parameters of dynamic system models in the presence of the aforementioned types of uncertainty. Moreover, they are applicable to a verified feasibility and stability analysis of controllers and state estimators. In addition to these approaches which are typically used offline for analysis of system models designed with classical floating point procedures, interval and set-based methods have also been developed in recent years, which allow to directly solve the associated design tasks and to implement reliable techniques that are applicable online, i.e., during system operation. The latter approaches include set-based model predictive control, online parameter adaptation techniques for nonlinear variable-structure and backstepping controllers, interval observers, and fault diagnosis techniques. This paper provides an overview of the methodological background and reviews numerous practical applications for which interval and other set-valued approaches have been employed successfully.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Abnormal Node Detection with Adversary Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel probabilistic detection scheme called Cooperative Statistical Detection~(CSD) for abnormal node detection while defending against adversarial attacks in cluster-tree wireless sensor networks. The CSD performs a two-phase process: 1) designing a likelihood ratio test~(LRT) for a non-root node at its children from the perspective of packet loss; 2) making an overall decision at the root node based on the aggregated detection data of the nodes over tree branches. In most adversarial scenarios, malicious children knowing the detection policy can generate falsified data to protect the abnormal parent from being detected. To resolve this issue, a mechanism is presented in the CSD to remove untrustworthy information. Through theoretical analysis, we show that the LRT-based method achieves the perfect detection. Furthermore, the optimal removal threshold is derived for falsifications with uncertain strategies and guarantees perfect detection of the CSD. As our simulation results shown, the CSD approach is robust to falsifications and can rapidly reach $99\%$ detection accuracy, even in existing adversarial scenarios, which outperforms the state-of-the-art technology.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Carbon-Efficient Planning for Geographically Shiftable Resources: A Monte Carlo Tree Search Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global climate challenge is demanding urgent actions for decarbonization, while electric power systems take the major roles in clean energy transition. Due to the existence of spatially and temporally dispersed renewable energy resources and the uneven distribution of carbon emission intensity throughout the grid, it is worth investigating future load planning and demand management to offset those generations with higher carbon emission rates. Such techniques include inter-region utilization of geographically shiftable resources and stochastic renewable energy. For instance, data center is considered to be a major carbon emission producer in the future due to increasing information load, while it holds the capability of geographical load balancing. In this paper, we propose a novel planning and operation model minimizing the system-level carbon emissions via sitting and operating geographically shiftable resources. This model decides the optimal locations for shiftable resources expansion along with power dispatch schedule. To accommodate future system operation patterns and a wide range of operating conditions, we incorporate 20-year fine-grained load and renewables scenarios for grid simulations of realistic sizes (e.g., up to 1888 buses). To tackle the computational challenges coming from the combinatorial nature of such large-scale planning problem, we develop a customized Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method, which can find reasonable solutions satisfying solution time limits. Besides, MCTS enables flexible time window settings and offline solution adjustments. Extensive simulations validate that our planning model can reduce more than 10\% carbon emission across all setups. Compared to off-the-shelf optimization solvers such as Gurobi, our method achieves up to 8.1X acceleration while the solution gaps are less than 1.5\% in large-scale cases.</description>

      <title>Inferring Ingrained Remote Information in AC Power Flows Using Neuromorphic Modality Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we infer remote measurements such as remote voltages and currents online with change in AC power flows using spiking neural network (SNN) as grid-edge technology for efficient coordination of power electronic converters. This work unifies power and information as a means of data normalization using a multi-modal regime in the form of spikes using energy-efficient neuromorphic learning and event-driven asynchronous data collection. Firstly, we organize the synchronous real-valued measurements at each edge and translate them into asynchronous spike-based events to collect sparse data for training of SNN at each edge. Instead of relying on error-dependent supervised data-driven learning theory, we exploit the latency-driven unsupervised Hebbian learning rule to obtain modulation pulses for switching of power electronic converters that can now comprehend grid disturbances locally and adapt their operation without requiring explicit infrastructure for global coordination. Not only does this philosophy block exogenous path arrival for cyber attackers by dismissing the cyber layer, it also entails converter adaptation to system reconfiguration and parameter mismatch issues. We conclude this work by validating its energy-efficient and effective online learning performance under various scenarios in different system sizes, including modified IEEE 14-bus system and under experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Culsans: An Efficient Snoop-based Coherency Unit for the CVA6 Open Source RISC-V application processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) based on cache coherency is crucial for high-end embedded systems like automotive applications. RISC-V is gaining traction, and open-source hardware (OSH) platforms offer solutions to issues such as IP costs and vendor dependency. Existing multi-core cache-coherent RISC-V platforms are complex and not efficient for small embedded core clusters. We propose an open-source SystemVerilog implementation of a lightweight snoop-based cache-coherent cluster of Linux-capable CVA6 cores. Our design uses the MOESI protocol via the Arm's AMBA ACE protocol. Evaluated with Splash-3 benchmarks, our solution shows up to 32.87% faster performance in a dual-core setup and an average improvement of 15.8% over OpenPiton. Synthesized using GF 22nm FDSOI technology, the Cache Coherency Unit occupies only 1.6% of the system area.</description>

      <title>Composite Learning Adaptive Control without Excitation Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on excitation collection and composite learning adaptive control design for uncertain nonlinear systems. By adopting the spectral decomposition technique, a linear regression equation is constructed to collect previously appeared excitation information, establishing a relationship between unknown parameters and the system's historical data. A composite learning term, developed using the linear regression equation, is incorporating into the Lyapunov-based parameter update law. In comparison to the existing results, all spectrums of previously appeared excitation information are collected, with the matrices in linear regression equation guaranteed to be bounded. This paper introduces concepts of excited and unexcited subspaces for analyzing the parameter estimation errors, and a novel Lyapunov function is developed for stability analysis. It is demonstrated that, without imposing any excitation condition, the state and excited parameter estimation error component converge to zero, while the unexcited component remains unchanged. Simulation results are provided to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Genie: Smart ROS-based Caching for Connected Autonomous Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the promising future of autonomous robots, several key issues currently remain that can lead to compromised performance and safety. One such issue is latency, where we find that even the latest embedded platforms from NVIDIA fail to execute intelligence tasks (e.g., object detection) of autonomous vehicles in a real-time fashion. One remedy to this problem is the promising paradigm of edge computing. Through collaboration with our industry partner, we identify key prohibitive limitations of the current edge mindset: (1) servers are not distributed enough and thus, are not close enough to vehicles, (2) current proposed edge solutions do not provide substantially better performance and extra information specific to autonomous vehicles to warrant their cost to the user, and (3) the state-of-the-art solutions are not compatible with popular frameworks used in autonomous systems, particularly the Robot Operating System (ROS).
  To remedy these issues, we provide Genie, an encapsulation technique that can enable transparent caching in ROS in a non-intrusive way (i.e., without modifying the source code), can build the cache in a distributed manner (in contrast to traditional central caching methods), and can construct a collective three-dimensional object map to provide substantially better latency (even on low-power edge servers) and higher quality data to all vehicles in a certain locality. We fully implement our design on state-of-the-art industry-adopted embedded and edge platforms, using the prominent autonomous driving software Autoware, and find that Genie can enhance the latency of Autoware Vision Detector by 82% on average, enable object reusability 31% of the time on average and as much as 67% for the incoming requests, and boost the confidence in its object map considerably over time.</description>

      <title>Efficient Discovery of Actual Causality using Abstraction-Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causality is the relationship where one event contributes to the production of another, with the cause being partly responsible for the effect and the effect partly dependent on the cause. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective method to formally reason about the causal effect of events in engineered systems, with application for finding the root-cause of safety violations in embedded and cyber-physical systems. We are motivated by the notion of em actual causality by Halpern and Pearl, which focuses on the causal effect of particular events rather than type-level causality, which attempts to make general statements about scientific and natural phenomena. Our first contribution is formulating discovery of actual causality in computing systems modeled by transition systems as an SMT solving problem.
  Since datasets for causality analysis tend to be large, in order to tackle the scalability problem of automated formal reasoning, our second contribution is a novel technique based on abstraction-refinement that allows identifying for actual causes within smaller abstract causal models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach (by several orders of magnitude) using three case studies to find the actual cause of violations of safety in (1) a neural network controller for a Mountain Car, (2) a controller for a Lunar Lander obtained by reinforcement learning, and \revision{(3) an MPC controller for an F-16 autopilot simulator.</description>

      <title>An Alternative to Multi-Factor Authentication with a Triple-Identity Authentication Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every user authentication scheme involves three login credentials, i.e. a username, a password and a hash value, but only one of them is associated with a user identity. However, this single identity is not robust enough to protect the whole system and the login entries (i.e., the username and password forms) have not been effectively authenticated. Therefore, a multi-factor authentication service is utilized to help guarantee the account security by transmitting an extra factor to the user to use. If more identities can be employed for the two login forms to associate with the corresponding login credentials, and if the identifiers are neither transmitted through the network nor accessible to users, such a system can be more robust even without relying on a third-party service. To achieve this, a triple-identity authentication scheme is designed within a dual-password login-authentication system, by which the identities for the username and the login password can be defined respectively. Therefore, in addition to the traditional server verification, the system can also verify the identity of a user at the username and password forms simultaneously. In the triple-identity authentication, the identifiers are entirely managed by the system without involvement of users or any third-party service, and they are concealed, incommunicable, inaccessible and independent of personal information. Thus, such truly unique identifiers are useless in online attacks.</description>
