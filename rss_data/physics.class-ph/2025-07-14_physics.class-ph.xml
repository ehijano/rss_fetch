      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Basic principles of mathematical modeling are reviewed in this book, with the focus on physics and its practical applications, and examples of selected mathematical methods are presented. Most of the models have been imported from physics and applied for scientific and engineering problems. More specifically, the accent is placed on the theory of dynamical systems being used to produce evolutionary models. Classes of different models are presented and the relationship of mathematical modeling to other disciplines is outlined. The aim of the paper is to bridge together mathematical methods and basic ideas proved to be useful in science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Thermoacoustic Waves: A Variational Approach Consistent with Thermodynamics and the Navier-Stokes Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes an in-depth investigation into the emergence of thermoacoustic waves from a variational formalism rooted in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Differing from traditional approaches based on linear simplifications, this work explores the possibility of deriving wave equations for pressure and density through the extremization of thermodynamic functionals, with special attention to entropy production. We address the inherent complexities in applying variational principles to dissipative systems, incorporating the nuances of Prigogine\'s minimum and maximum entropy production principles. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of nonholonomic constraints, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, through concepts of vakonomic mechanics, and explore how thermoacoustic solutions can offer ansatzes valuable for the existence and smoothness problem of Navier-Stokes solutions, one of the Clay Math Institute\'s Millennium Problems. The objective is to provide a robust theoretical foundation that can shed new light on the interconnection between thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and wave phenomena</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Rigid-Body Impact Mechanics for Automobile Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (planar) rigid-body impact mechanics for application in automobile collisions have been described by a number of researchers over the last several decades. Little has been discussed, however, regarding three-dimensional rigid-body impact mechanics in this regard. Two commercially available accident simulation programs, PC-Crash and Virtual CRASH, offer three-dimensional rigid-body impact mechanics as one of their collision models but documentation of the complete development of their three-dimensional equations, particularly with respect to necessary constraint strategies at the impulse center, are not readily available. In this paper, a three-dimensional rigid-body impact mechanics derivation is presented. In order to solve the set of impact mechanics equations of motion it is necessary to develop constraint relationships. The constraint strategy described in the literature pertaining to the PC-Crash Full-Impact/Sliding-Impact scenarios for two dimensions is extended to the three-dimensional case and the ramifications regarding post-impact relative velocity at the impulse center is discussed. A second strategy in which an impulse component is aligned with the contact plane component of the initial relative velocity at the impulse center is presented and compared to the PC-Crash scenarios. Lastly, while these two strategies incorporate a single impulse ratio/friction parameter for the contact plane, a strategy involving two independent impulse ratio/friction parameters is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Gedanken experiment to test Bell's spaceship paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Bell's spaceship paradox, a thread connects two spaceships moving with identical accelerations. As the ships accelerate in lockstep, the tension in the string increases due to the relativistic contraction and the string eventually breaks. What happens if instead of exactly matched accelerations, the changing tension in the string introduces small fluctuations that disrupt the lockstep acceleration? This relaxation of the requirement of lockstep acceleration dramatically changes the motion of the two ships. At a surprisingly small velocity, the two ships begin to move in a manner that maintains a constant proper distance between them. This allows the ships to accelerate indefinitely without breaking the string.</description>

      <title>Comment on work of Yang and Nevels "Direct, analytic solution for the electromagnetic vector potential in any gauge" (arXiv:2507.02104)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Comment the procedure for obtaining a solution for the electromagnetic potential, presented in the cited work arxiv.org:2507.02104, is analyzed. It is shown that the solution obtained by the authors is based on some mathematically illegal operations. This argument is supported by a counterexample to equation (10) of the cited work. Direct calculations of the potentials in the Lorenz and Coulomb gauges show that equation (10) is not satisfied.</description>

      <title>Recoil-Constrained Scheduling of Non-Propulsive Payload Deployment for Mega-Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the significant challenge of recoil momentum accumulation during non-propulsive payload deployment for low-Earth-orbit mega-constellations. An efficient phase-based approximation algorithm is introduced, leading to over 90% faster computation while maintaining maximum ejection velocity errors below 1%. The analysis highlights that cumulative recoil velocity is the primary factor governing deployment capability, with excess velocity being approximately half of the cumulative recoil velocity. An analytical expression for predicting the maximum ejection velocity is derived, enabling rapid mission planning with less than 2% error. This framework establishes crucial operational boundaries concerning altitude differences, mass ratios, and deployment quantities for near-Earth orbits (up to 2,000 km), providing essential tools for the sustainable servicing of future constellations comprising over 200 satellites per orbital plane.</description>

      <title>Mod\`ele physique variationnel pour l'estimation de r\'eponses impulsionnelles de salles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Room impulse response estimation is essential for tasks like speech dereverberation, which improves automatic speech recognition. Most existing methods rely on either statistical signal processing or deep neural networks designed to replicate signal processing principles. However, combining statistical and physical modeling for RIR estimation remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a novel approach integrating both aspects through a theoretically grounded model. The RIR is decomposed into interpretable parameters: white Gaussian noise filtered by a frequency-dependent exponential decay (e.g. modeling wall absorption) and an autoregressive filter (e.g. modeling microphone response). A variational free-energy cost function enables practical parameter estimation. As a proof of concept, we show that given dry and reverberant speech signals, the proposed method outperforms classical deconvolution in noisy environments, as validated by objective metrics.</description>

      <title>Enhanced dispersion of active microswimmers in confined flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of a laminar shear flow, the diffusion of passive colloidal particles is enhanced in the direction parallel to the flow. This classical phenomenon is known as Taylor-Aris dispersion. Besides, microorganisms, such as active microswimmers, exhibit an effective diffusive behavior at long times. Combining the two ingredients above, a natural question then emerges on how the effective diffusion of active microswimmers is altered in shear flows - a widespread situation in natural environments with practical implications, e.g. regarding biofilm formation. In this Letter, we investigate the motility and dispersion of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii microalgae, within a rectangular microfluidic channel subjected to a sinusoidal Poiseuille flow. Using high-resolution optical microscopy and a particle-tracking algorithm, we reconstruct individual trajectories in various flow conditions and statistically analyze them through moment theory and wavelet decomposition. We find that the velocity fluctuations and the dispersion coefficient increase as the flow amplitude is increased, with only weak dependencies on the flow periodicity. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the generalization of Taylor-Aris law to active particles is valid.</description>

      <title>Metamaterial two-sphere Newton's cradle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Locally resonant metamaterials are among the most studied types of elastic/acoustic metamaterials, with significant research focused on wave propagation in a continuum of "meta-atoms" Here we investigate the collision dynamics of two identical pendulum-suspended mass-in-mass resonators, essentially a two-sphere Newton's cradle, emphasizing the readily realizable scenario where the internal resonator frequency is much greater than the pendulum frequency. We first show that the dynamics of a collision can be described using effective parameters, similar to how previous metamaterials research has characterized wave propagation through effective material properties. Non-conventional collision dynamics -- observed in two colliding mass-in-mass systems where one is initially at rest -- include behaviors such as the moving sphere rebounding as if from a fixed wall while the other remains essentially stationary, the spheres coupling and moving forward in near-unison, and the spheres recoiling in opposite directions. These responses can be achieved by tuning the effective parameters. We demonstrate that these parameters can take on values that differ significantly from those in a conventional Newton's cradle. Additionally, we investigate multiple collisions of the two spheres, revealing complex dynamics. This work paves the way for the development and study of new "collision-based metamaterial" structures.</description>
