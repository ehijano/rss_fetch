      <title>On the Unprovability of Circuit Size Bounds in Intuitionistic $\mathsf{S}^1_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there is a constant $k$ such that Buss's intuitionistic theory $\mathsf{IS}^1_2$ does not prove that SAT requires co-nondeterministic circuits of size at least $n^k$. To our knowledge, this is the first unconditional unprovability result in bounded arithmetic in the context of worst-case fixed-polynomial size circuit lower bounds. We complement this result by showing that the upper bound $\mathsf{NP} \subseteq \mathsf{coNSIZE}[n^k]$ is unprovable in $\mathsf{IS}^1_2$.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Computation for All the Fun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent 10 million dollar AIMO challenge, this paper targets the problem of finding all functions conforming to a given specification. This is a popular problem at mathematical competitions and it brings about a number of challenges, primarily, synthesizing the possible solutions and proving that no other solutions exist. Often, there are infinitely many solutions and then the set of solutions has to be captured symbolically. We propose an approach to solving this problem and evaluate it on a set of problems that appeared in mathematical competitions and olympics.</description>

      <title>A minimal base or a direct base? That is the question!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit the problem of computing the closure of a set of attributes, given a set of Armstrong dependencies. This problem is of main interest in logics, in the relational database model, in lattice theory and in Formal Concept Analysis as well. We consider here three main closure algorithms, namely Closure, LinClosure and Wild's Closure, which are combined with implication bases which may have different characteristics, among which being "minimal", e.g., the Duquenne-Guigues basis, and being "direct", e.g., the Canonical Basis and the D-basis. The impacts of minimality and directness on the closure algorithms are then deeply studied also experimentally. The results are extensively analyzed and propose a different and fresh look at computing the closure of a set of attributes.

      <title>Satisfiability of commutative vs. non-commutative CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mermin-Peres magic square is a celebrated example of a system of Boolean linear equations that is not (classically) satisfiable but is satisfiable via linear operators on a Hilbert space of dimension four. A natural question is then, for what kind of problems such a phenomenon occurs? Atserias, Kolaitis, and Severini answered this question for all Boolean Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs): For 2-SAT, Horn-SAT, and Dual Horn-SAT, classical satisfiability and operator satisfiability is the same and thus there is no gap; for all other Boolean CSPs, the two notions differ as there is a gap, i.e., there are unsatisfiable instances that are satisfied via operators on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. We generalize their result to CSPs on arbitrary finite domains: CSPs of so-called bounded-width have no satisfiability gap, whereas all other CSPs have a satisfiability gap.</description>

      <title>Incremental Bootstrapping and Classification of Structured Scenes in a Fuzzy Ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We foresee robots that bootstrap knowledge representations and use them for classifying relevant situations and making decisions based on future observations. Particularly for assistive robots, the bootstrapping mechanism might be supervised by humans who should not repeat a training phase several times and should be able to refine the taught representation. We consider robots that bootstrap structured representations to classify some intelligible categories. Such a structure should be incrementally bootstrapped, i.e., without invalidating the identified category models when a new additional category is considered. To tackle this scenario, we presented the Scene Identification and Tagging (SIT) algorithm, which bootstraps structured knowledge representation in a crisp OWL-DL ontology. Over time, SIT bootstraps a graph representing scenes, sub-scenes and similar scenes. Then, SIT can classify new scenes within the bootstrapped graph through logic-based reasoning. However, SIT has issues with sensory data because its crisp implementation is not robust to perception noises. This paper presents a reformulation of SIT within the fuzzy domain, which exploits a fuzzy DL ontology to overcome the robustness issues. By comparing the performances of fuzzy and crisp implementations of SIT, we show that fuzzy SIT is robust, preserves the properties of its crisp formulation, and enhances the bootstrapped representations. On the contrary, the fuzzy implementation of SIT leads to less intelligible knowledge representations than the one bootstrapped in the crisp domain.</description>

      <title>Lewis and Brouwer meet Strong L\"ob</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the principle phi implies box phi, known as `Strength' or `the Completeness Principle', over the constructive version of L\"ob's Logic. We consider this principle both for the modal language with the necessity operator and for the modal language with the Lewis arrow, where L\"ob's Logic is suitably adapted.
  Central insights of provability logic, like the de Jongh-Sambin Theorem and the de Jongh-Sambin-Bernardi Theorem, take a simple form in the presence of Strength. We present these simple versions. We discuss the semantics of two salient systems and prove uniform interpolation for both. In addition, we sketch arithmetical interpretations of our systems. Finally, we describe the various connections of our subject with Computer Science.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Unmanned Aircraft: Specification, Integration, and Lessons-learned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports on the integration of runtime monitoring into fully-electric aircraft designed by Volocopter, a German aircraft manufacturer of electric multi-rotor helicopters. The runtime monitor recognizes hazardous situations and system faults. Since the correct operation of the monitor is critical for the safety of the aircraft, the development of the monitor must follow strict aeronautical standards. This includes the integration of the monitor into different development environments, such as log-file analysis, hardware/software-in-the-loop testing, and test flights. We have used the stream-based monitoring framework RTLola to generate monitors for a range of requirements. In this paper, we present representative monitoring specifications and our lessons learned from integrating the generated monitors. Our main finding is that the specification and the integration need to be decoupled, because the specification remains stable throughout the development process, whereas the different development stages require a separate integration of the monitor into each environment. We achieve this decoupling with a novel abstraction layer in the monitoring framework that adapts the monitor to each environment without affecting the core component generated from the specification. The decoupling of the integration has also allowed us to react quickly to the frequent changes in the hardware and software environment of the monitor due to the fast-paced development of the aircraft in a startup company.</description>

      <title>Combining swap structures: the case of Paradefinite Ivlev-like modal logics based on FDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15426v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to combine several Ivlev-like modal systems characterized by 4-valued non-deterministic matrices (Nmatrices) with IDM4, a 4-valued expansion of Belnap-Dunn's logic FDE with an implication introduced by Pynko in 1999. In order to do this, we introduce a new methodology for combining logics which are characterized by means of swap structures, based on what we call superposition of snapshots. In particular, the combination of IDM4 with Tm, the 4-valued Ivlev's version of KT, will be analyzed with more details. From the semantical perspective, the idea is to combine the 4-valued swap structures (Nmatrices) for Tm (and several of its extensions) with the 4-valued twist structure (logical matrix) for IDM4. This superposition produces a universe of 6 snapshots, with 3 of them being designated. The multioperators over the new universe are defined by combining the specifications of the given swap and twist structures. This gives rise to 6 different paradefinite Ivlev-like modal logics, each one of them characterized by a 6-valued Nmatrix, and conservatively extending the original modal logic and IDM4. This important feature allows to consider the proposed construction as a genuine technique for combining logics. In addition, it is possible to define in the combined logics a classicality operator in the sense of logics of evidence and truth (LETs). A sound and complete Hilbert-style axiomatization is also presented for the 6 combined systems, as well as a Prolog program which implements the swap structures semantics for the 6 systems, producing a decision procedure for satisfiability, refutability and validity of formulas in these logics.</description>

      <title>DRAT Proofs of Unsatisfiability for SAT Modulo Monotonic Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating proofs of unsatisfiability is a valuable capability of most SAT solvers, and is an active area of research for SMT solvers. This paper introduces the first method to efficiently generate proofs of unsatisfiability specifically for an important subset of SMT: SAT Modulo Monotonic Theories (SMMT), which includes many useful finite-domain theories (e.g., bit vectors and many graph-theoretic properties) and is used in production at Amazon Web Services. Our method uses propositional definitions of the theory predicates, from which it generates compact Horn approximations of the definitions, which lead to efficient DRAT proofs, leveraging the large investment the SAT community has made in DRAT. In experiments on practical SMMT problems, our proof generation overhead is minimal (7.41% geometric mean slowdown, 28.8% worst-case), and we can generate and check proofs for many problems that were previously intractable.</description>
