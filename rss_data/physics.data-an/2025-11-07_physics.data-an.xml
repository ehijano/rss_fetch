      <title>P\'olya urn model for analysis of football passes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study analyzes pass networks in football (soccer) using a stochastic model known as the P\'olya urn. By focusing on preferential selection, it theoretically demonstrates that the time evolution of networks can be characterized by a single parameter. Building on this result, a data analysis method is proposed and applied to a large-scale public dataset of professional football matches. The statistical properties of the preferential-selection parameter are examined, demonstrating its correlation with pass accuracy and with mean pass difficulty. This method is applicable to various evolving networks.</description>

      <title>The Moving Beam Diffraction Geometry: the DIAD Application of a Diffraction Scanning-Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions between microstructure, strain, phase, and material behavior is crucial in many scientific fields. However, quantifying these correlations is challenging, as it requires the use of multiple instruments and techniques, often separated by space and time. The Dual Imaging And Diffraction (DIAD) beamline at Diamond is designed to address this challenge. DIAD allows its users to visualize internal structures, identify compositional/phase changes, and measure strain. DIAD provides two independent beams combined at one sample position, allowing quasi-simultaneous X-ray Computed Tomography and X-ray Powder Diffraction. A unique functionality of the DIAD configuration is the ability to perform image-guided diffraction, where the micron-sized diffraction beam is scanned over the complete area of the imaging field of view without moving the specimen. This moving beam diffraction geometry enables the study of fast-evolving and motion-susceptible processes and samples. Here, we discuss the novel moving beam diffraction geometry presenting the latest findings on the reliability of both geometry calibration and data reduction routines used. Our measures confirm diffraction is most sensitive to the moving geometry for the detector position downstream normal to the incident beam. The observed data confirm that the motion of the KB mirror coupled with a fixed aperture slit results in a rigid translation of the beam probe, without affecting the angle of the incident beam path to the sample. Our measures demonstrate a nearest-neighbour calibration can achieve the same accuracy as a self-calibrated geometry when the distance between calibrated and probed sample region is smaller or equal to the beam spot size. We show the absolute error of the moving beam diffraction geometry remains below 0.0001, which is the accuracy we observe for the beamline with stable beam operation.</description>

      <title>Information-driven design of imaging systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20559v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imaging systems have traditionally been designed to mimic the human eye and produce visually interpretable measurements. Modern imaging systems, however, process raw measurements computationally before or instead of human viewing. As a result, the information content of raw measurements matters more than their visual interpretability. Despite the importance of measurement information content, current approaches for evaluating imaging system performance do not quantify it: they instead either use alternative metrics that assess specific aspects of measurement quality or assess measurements indirectly with performance on secondary tasks.
  We developed the theoretical foundations and a practical method to directly quantify mutual information between noisy measurements and unknown objects. By fitting probabilistic models to measurements and their noise characteristics, our method estimates information by upper bounding its true value. By applying gradient-based optimization to these estimates, we also developed a technique for designing imaging systems called Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL). Our information estimates accurately captured system performance differences across four imaging domains (color photography, radio astronomy, lensless imaging, and microscopy). Systems designed with IDEAL matched the performance of those designed with end-to-end optimization, the prevailing approach that jointly optimizes hardware and image processing algorithms. These results establish mutual information as a universal performance metric for imaging systems that enables both computationally efficient design optimization and evaluation in real-world conditions.
