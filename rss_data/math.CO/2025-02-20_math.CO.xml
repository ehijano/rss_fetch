      <title>A new reducibility results for minihypers in finite projective geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a new reducibility result for mini-hypers in projective geometries over finite fields. It is further used to characterize the minihypers with parameters (70, 22) in PG(4, 3). The latter can be used to attack the existence problem for some hypothetical ternary Griesmer codes of dimension 6.</description>

      <title>Pattern avoidance in non-crossing and non-nesting permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-crossing and non-nesting permutations are variations of the well-known Stirling permutations. A permutation $\pi$ on $\{1,1,2,2,\ldots, n,n\}$ is called non-crossing if it avoids the crossing patterns $\{1212,2121\}$ and is called non-nesting if it avoids the nesting patterns $\{1221,2112\}.$ Pattern avoidance in these permutations has been considered in recent years, but it has remained open to enumerate the non-crossing and non-nesting permutations that avoid a single pattern of length 3. In this paper, we provide generating functions for those non-crossing and non-nesting permutations that avoid the pattern 231 (and, by symmetry, the patterns 132, 213, or 312).</description>

      <title>On Bass' conjecture of the small Davenport constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. The small Davenport constant $\mathsf d(G)$ of $G$ is the maximal integer $\ell$ such that there is a sequence of length $\ell$ over $G$ which has no nonempty product-one subsequence. In 2007, Bass conjectured that $\mathsf d(G_{m,n})=m+n-2$, where $G_{m,n}=\langle x, y| x^m=y^n=1, x^{-1}yx=y^s\rangle$, and $s$ has order $m$ modulo $n$. In this paper, we confirm the conjecture for any group $G_{m,n}$ with additional conditions that $s$ has order $m$ modulo $q$, for every prime divisor $q$ of $n$. Moreover, we solve the associated inverse problem characterizing the structure of any product-one free sequence with extremal length $\mathsf d(G_{m,n})$. Our results generalize some obtained theorems on this problem.</description>

      <title>The resistance distance of a dual number weighted graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G=(V,E)$, assigning each edge $e\in E$ a weight of a dual number $w(e)=1+\widehat{a}_{e}\varepsilon$, the weighted graph $G^{w}=(V,E,w)$ is called a dual number weighted graph, where $-\widehat{a}_{e}$ can be regarded as the perturbation of the unit resistor on edge $e$ of $G$. For a connected dual number weighted graph $G^{w}$, we give some expressions and block representations of generalized inverses of the Laplacian matrix of $G^{w}$. And using these results, we derive the explicit formulas of the resistance distance and Kirchhoff index of $G^{w}$. We give the perturbation bounds for the resistance distance and Kirchhoff index of $G$. In particular, when only the edge $e=\{i,j\}$ of $G$ is perturbed, we give the perturbation bounds for the Kirchhoff index and resistance distance between vertices $i$ and $j$ of $G$, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The codegree Tur\'an density $\gamma(F)$ of a $k$-graph $F$ is the smallest $\gamma\in[0,1)$ such that every $k$-graph $H$ with $\delta_{k-1}(H)\geq(\gamma+o(1))\vert V(H)\vert$ contains a copy of $F$. We prove that for all $k,r\in\mathbb{N}$ with $k\geq3$, $\frac{r-1}{r}$ is an accumulation point of $\Gamma^{(k)}=\{\gamma(F):F\text{ is a }k\text{-graph}\}$.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the Rubik's cube, together with its group of configurations, to any abstract regular polytope. After discussing general aspects, we study the Rubik's simplex of arbitrary dimension and provide a complete description of the associated group.

      <title>Quotients of skew polynomial rings: new constructions of division algebras and MRD codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We achieve new results on skew polynomial rings and their quotients, including the first explicit example of a skew polynomial ring where the ratio of the degree of a skew polynomial to the degree of its bound is not extremal. These methods lead to the construction of new (not necessarily associative) division algebras and maximum rank distance (MRD) codes over both finite and infinite division rings. In particular, we construct new non-associative division algebras whose right nucleus is a central simple algebra having degree greater than 1. Over finite fields, we obtain new semifields and MRD codes for infinitely many choices of parameters. These families extend and contain many of the best previously known constructions.</description>

      <title>On Strongly Regular Graphs and the Friendship Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an alternative proof of the celebrated friendship theorem, originally established by Erd\H{o}s, R\'{e}nyi, and S\'{o}s (1966). The proof is based on a closed-form expression for the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$-function of strongly regular graphs, which was recently derived by the author. Leveraging this expression, the paper also establishes new necessary conditions for a strongly regular graph to be a spanning subgraph or an induced subgraph of another strongly regular graph. In the case of induced subgraphs, the analysis further incorporates a property of graph energies.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-involutions in the Riordan group and Chebyshev polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing the results in our previous paper, we consider pseudo-involutions in the Riordan group where the generating function $g$ for the first column of a Riordan array satisfies a functional equation of certain types involving a polynomial. For those types of equations, we find the pseudo-involutory companion of $g$. We also develop a general method for finding B-functions of Riordan pseudo-involutions in the cases we consider, and show that these B-functions involve Chebyshev polynomials. We apply our method for several families of Riordan arrays, obtaining new results and deriving known results more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Ramsey-type problems for tilings in dense graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $H$, the Ramsey number $R(H)$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that every $2$-edge-colouring of $K_n$ yields a monochromatic copy of $H$. We write $mH$ to denote the union of $m$ vertex-disjoint copies of $H$. The members of the family $\{mH:m\ge1\}$ are also known as $H$-tilings. A well-known result of Burr, Erd\H{o}s and Spencer states that $R(mK_3)=5m$ for every $m\ge2$. On the other hand, Moon proved that every $2$-edge-colouring of $K_{3m+2}$ yields a $K_3$-tiling consisting of $m$ monochromatic copies of $K_3$, for every $m\ge2$. Crucially, in Moon's result, distinct copies of $K_3$ might receive different colours.
  In this paper, we investigate the analogous questions where the complete host graph is replaced by a graph of large minimum degree. We determine the (asymptotic) minimum degree threshold for forcing a $K_3$-tiling covering a prescribed proportion of the vertices in a $2$-edge-coloured graph such that every copy of $K_3$ in the tiling is monochromatic. We also determine the largest size of a monochromatic $K_3$-tiling one can guarantee in any $2$-edge-coloured graph of large minimum degree. These results therefore provide dense generalisations of the theorems of Moon and Burr-Erd\H{o}s-Spencer.
  It is also natural to consider generalisations of these problems to $r$-edge-colourings (for $r \geq 2$) and for $H$-tilings (for arbitrary graphs $H$). We prove some results in this direction and propose several open questions.</description>

      <title>The least balanced graphs and trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a connected graph, the principal eigenvector of the adjacency matrix (often called the Perron vector) can be used to assign positive weights to the vertices. A natural way to measure the homogeneousness of this vector is by considering the ratio of its $\ell^1$ and $\ell^2$ norms.
  It is easy to see that the most balanced graphs in this sense (i.e., the ones with the largest ratio) are the regular graphs. What about the least balanced graphs with the smallest ratio? It was conjectured by R\"ucker, R\"ucker and Gutman that, for any given $n \geq 6$, among $n$-vertex connected graphs the smallest ratio is achieved by the complete graph $K_4$ with a single path $P_{n-4}$ attached to one of its vertices. In this paper we confirm this conjecture.
  We also verify the analogous conjecture for trees: for any given $n \geq 8$, among $n$-vertex trees the smallest ratio is achieved by the star graph $S_5$ with a path $P_{n-5}$ attached to its central vertex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a rectangular grid graph with a special vertex at a corner called base station, we study the problem of covering the vertices of the entire graph with tours that start and end at the base station and whose lengths do not exceed a given threshold, while minimizing a quality measure. We consider two objective functions: minimizing the number of tours and minimizing the sum of their lengths. We present an algorithm that computes the optimal solution for both objectives in linear time with respect to the grid size.</description>

      <title>On limiting distributions of Graham, Knuth, Patashnik recurrences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graham, Knuth and Patashnik in their book Concrete Mathematics called for development of a general theory of the solutions of recurrences defined by $$\left|{ n\atop k}\right|=(\alpha n+\beta k+\gamma)\left|{n-1\atop k}\right|+(\alpha' n+\beta' k+\gamma')\left|{n-1\atop k-1}\right|+I_{n=k=0}$$ for $0\le k\le n$ and six parameters $\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\alpha'\beta',\gamma'$. Since then, a number of authors investigated various properties of the solutions of these recurrences. In this note we consider a probabilistic aspect, namely we consider the limiting distributions of sequences of integer valued random variables naturally associated with the solutions of such recurrences. We will give a complete description of the limiting behavior when $\alpha'=0$ and the remaining five parameters are non--negative.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Bound on Large Planar Signed Vector Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a sharp lower bound to the largest possible Euclidean norm of signed sums of $n$ vectors in the plane. This is achieved by connecting the signed vector sum problem to the isoperimetric problem for the circumradius of polygons. In turn, we apply the sharp bound for the signed vector sum problem to establish a sharp lower bound to the circumradius of the Minkowski sum of $n$ planar symmetric convex bodies. We also determine a tight lower bound to the circumradius of the Minkowski sum of general convex bodies in any dimension independent of their number.</description>

      <title>Ribbon blocks for centraliser algebras of symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose $l,m$ are natural numbers with $l\le m$, and $\mathbb{F}$ a field of characteristic $p$, and let $\mathcal{C}_{l,m}^{\mathbb{F}}$ denote the centraliser of the group algebra $\mathbb{F}S_l$ inside $\mathbb{F}S_m$. Ellers and Murray give a conjectured classification of the blocks of $\mathcal{C}_{l,m}^{\mathbb{F}}$, in terms of the $p$-blocks of $S_l$ and $S_m$. We prove this conjecture for a family of blocks that we call ribbon blocks and belt blocks. These are the blocks containing Specht modules labelled by skew partitions having no repeated entries in their $p$-content.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal List-Recovery of Linear Code Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove several results on linear codes achieving list-recovery capacity. We show that random linear codes achieve list-recovery capacity with constant output list size (independent of the alphabet size and length). That is, over alphabets of size at least $\ell^{\Omega(1/\varepsilon)}$, random linear codes of rate $R$ are $(1-R-\varepsilon, \ell, (\ell/\varepsilon)^{O(\ell/\varepsilon)})$-list-recoverable for all $R\in(0,1)$ and $\ell$. Together with a result of Levi, Mosheiff, and Shagrithaya, this implies that randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes also achieve list-recovery capacity. We also prove that our output list size is near-optimal among all linear codes: all $(1-R-\varepsilon, \ell, L)$-list-recoverable linear codes must have $L\ge \ell^{\Omega(1/\varepsilon)}$.
  Our simple upper bound combines the Zyablov-Pinsker argument with recent bounds from Kopparty, Ron-Zewi, Saraf, Wootters, and Tamo on the maximum intersection of a "list-recovery ball" and a low-dimensional subspace with large distance. Our lower bound is inspired by a recent lower bound of Chen and Zhang.</description>

      <title>Vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quasimap vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties. When the quiver varieties have isolated torus fixed points, we compute the coefficients of the vertex functions in the $K$-theoretic fixed point basis. We also give an explicit combinatorial description of zero-dimensional type $D$ quiver varieties and their vertex functions using the combinatorics of minuscule posets. Using Macdonald polynomials, we prove that these vertex functions can be expressed as products of $q$-binomial functions, which proves a degeneration of the conjectured 3d mirror symmetry of vertex functions. We provide an interpretation of type $D$ spin vertex functions as the partition functions of the half-space Macdonald processes of Barraquand, Borodin, and Corwin. This hints that the geometry of quiver varieties may provide new examples of integrable probabilistic models.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture that strengthens Kundu's $k$-factor Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.01645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\pi=(d_{1},\ldots,d_{n})$ be a non-increasing degree sequence with even $n$. In 1974, Kundu showed that if $\mathcal{D}_{k}(\pi)=(d_{1}-k,\ldots,d_{n}-k)$ is graphic, then some realization of $\pi$ has a $k$-factor. For $r\leq 2$, Busch et al. and later Seacrest for $r\leq 4$ showed that if $r\leq k$ and $\mathcal{D}_{k}(\pi)$ is graphic, then there is a realization with a $k$-factor whose edges can be partitioned into a $(k-r)$-factor and $r$ edge-disjoint $1$-factors. We improve this to any $r\leq \min\{\lceil\frac{k+5}{3}\big\rceil,k\}$. In 1978, Brualdi and then Busch et al. in 2012, conjectured that $r=k$. The conjecture is still open for $k\geq6$. However, Busch et al. showed the conjecture is true when $d_{1}\leq \frac{n}{2}+1$ or $d_{n}\geq \frac{n}{2}+k-2$. We explore this conjecture by first developing new tools that generalize edge-exchanges. With these new tools, we can drop the assumption $\mathcal{D}_{k}(\pi)$ is graphic and show that if $d_{d_{1}-d_{n}+k}\geq d_{1}-d_{n}+k-1,$ then $\pi$ has a realization with $k$ edge-disjoint $1$-factors. From this we confirm the conjecture when $d_{n}\geq \frac{d_{1}+k-1}{2}$ or when $\mathcal{D}_{k}(\pi)$ is graphic and $d_{1}\leq \max \{n/2+d_{n}-k,(n+d_{n})/2\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schur's theorem states that in any $k$-colouring of the set of integers $[n]$ there is a monochromatic solution to $a+b=c$, provided $n$ is sufficiently large. Abbott and Wang studied the size of the largest subset of $[n]$ such that there is a $k$-colouring avoiding a monochromatic $a+b=c$. In other directions, the minimum number of $a+b=c$ in $k$-colourings of $[n]$ and the probability threshold in random subsets of $[n]$ for the property of having a monochromatic $a+b=c$ in any $k$-colouring were investigated. In this paper, we study natural generalisations of these streams to products $ab=c$, in a deterministic, random, and randomly perturbed environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Csikv\'{a}ri constructed a poset on trees to prove that several graph functions attain extreme values at the star and the path among the trees on a fixed number of vertices. Reiner and Smith proved that the Tutte polynomials $T(1,y)$ of cones over trees, which are the graphs obtained by attaching a cone vertex to a tree, have the described extreme behavior. They further conjectured that the result can be strengthened in terms of Csikv\'{a}ri's poset. We solve this conjecture affirmatively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Woodall (and Seymour independently) in 2001 proposed a conjecture that every graph $G$ contains every complete bipartite graph on $\chi(G)$ vertices as a minor, where $\chi(G)$ is the chromatic number of $G$. In this paper, we prove that for each positive integer $\ell$ with $2\ell \leq \chi(G)$, each graph $G$ with independence number two contains a $K^{\ell}_{\ell,\chi(G)-\ell}$-minor, implying that Seymour and Woodall's conjecture holds for graphs with independence number two, where $K^{\ell}_{\ell,\chi(G)-\ell}$ is the graph obtained from $K_{\ell,\chi(G)-\ell}$ by making every pair of vertices on the side of the bipartition of size $\ell$ adjacent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Maker-Breaker domination game (MBD game) is a two-player game played on a graph $G$ by Dominator and Staller. They alternately select unplayed vertices of $G$. The goal of Dominator is to form a dominating set with the set of vertices selected by him while that of Staller is to prevent this from happening. In this paper MBD game critical graphs are studied. Their existence is established and critical graphs are characterized for most of the cases in which the first player can win the game in one or two moves.</description>

      <title>A conjecture on descents, inversions and the weak order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we discuss the notion of partition of elements in an arbitrary Coxeter system $(W,S)$: a partition of an element $w$ is a subset $\mathcal P\subseteq W$ such that the left inversion set of $w$ is the disjoint union of the left inversion set of the elements in $\mathcal P$. Partitions of elements of $W$ arises in the study of the Belkale-Kumar product on the cohomology $H^*(X,\mathbb Z)$, where $X$ is the complete flag variety of any complex semi-simple algebraic group. Partitions of elements in the symmetric group $\mathcal S_n$ are also related to the {\em Babington-Smith model} in algebraic statistics or to the simplicial faces of the Littlewood-Richardson cone.
  We state the conjecture that the number of right descents of $w$ is the sum of the number of right descents of the elements of $\mathcal P$ and prove that this conjecture holds in the cases of symmetric groups (type $A$) and hyperoctahedral groups (type $B$).</description>

      <title>Mutations and (Non-)Euclideaness in oriented matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We call an oriented matroid Mandel if it has an extension in general position which makes all programs with that extension Euclidean. If $L$ is the minimum number of mutations adjacent to an element of the groundset, we call an oriented matroid Las Vergnas if $L &gt; 0$. If $\frak{O}_{\mathcal{property}}$ is the class of oriented matroids having a certain property, it holds $\frak{O} \supset \frak{O}_{\mathcal{Las Vergnas}} \supset \frak{O}_{\mathcal{Mandel}} \supset \frak{O}_{\mathcal{Euclidean}} \supset \frak{O}_{\mathcal{realizable}}.$ All these inclusions are proper, we give explicit proofs/examples for the parts of this chain that were not known.
  For realizable hyperplane arrangements of rank $r$ we have $L = r$ which was proved by Shannon. Under the assumption that a (modified) intersection property holds we give an analogon to Shannons proof and show that uniform rank $4$ Euclidean oriented matroids with that property have $L = 4$. Using the fact that the lexicographic extension creates and destroys certain mutations, we show that for Euclidean oriented matroids holds $L \ge 3$.
  We give a survey of preservation of Euclideaness and prove that Euclideaness remains after a certain type of mutation-flips. This yields that a path in the mutation graph from a Euclidean oriented matroid to a totally non-Euclidean oriented matroid (which has no Euclidean oriented matroid programs) must have at least three mutation-flips. Finally, a minimal non-Euclidean or rank $4$ uniform oriented matroid is Mandel if it is connected to a Euclidean oriented matroid via one mutation-flip, hence we get many examples for Non-Euclidean but Mandel oriented matroids and have $L \le 3$ for those of rank $4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14209v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A finite group $G$ is called a Schur group if every $S$-ring over $G$ is schurian, i.e. associated in a natural way with a subgroup of $Sym(G)$ that contains all right translations. One of the crucial questions in the $S$-ring theory is the question on schurity of nonabelian groups, in particular, on existence of an infinite family of nonabelian Schur groups. In this paper, we study schurity of dihedral groups. We show that any generalized dihedral Schur group is dihedral and obtain necessary conditions of schurity for dihedral groups. Further, we prove that a dihedral group of order $2p$, where $p$ is a Fermat prime or prime of the form $p=4q+1$, where $q$ is also prime, is Schur. Towards this result, we prove nonexistence of a difference set in a cyclic group of order $p\neq 13$ and classify all $S$-rings over some dihedral groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Chow form encodes any projective variety by one equation. We here introduce the Chow-Lam form for subvarieties of a Grassmannian. By evaluating the Chow-Lam form at twistor coordinates, we obtain universal projection formulas. These were pioneered by Thomas Lam for positroid varieties in the study of amplituhedra, and we develop his approach further. Universal formulas for branch loci are obtained from Hurwitz-Lam forms. Our focus is on computations and applications in geometry.</description>

      <title>The golf model on $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ and on $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a particle model, that we call the $\textit{golf model}$. Initially, on a graph $G$, balls and holes are placed at random on some distinct vertices. The balls then move one by one, doing a random walk on $G$, starting from their initial vertex and stopping at the first empty hole they encounter, which they fill. On finite graphs, under reasonable assumptions (if there are more holes than balls, and if the Markov chain characterizing the random walks is irreducible) a final configuration is reached almost surely. In the paper, we are mainly interested in ${\bf H}^1$, the set of remaining holes. We give the distribution of ${\bf H}^1$ on $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, and describe a phase transition for the largest distance between two consecutive holes when the number of remaining holes is of order $\sqrt{n}$. We show that the model on $\mathbb{Z}$ is well-defined if every vertex contains either a ball with probability $d_{\sf b}$, a hole with probability $d_{\sf h}$, or nothing, independently from the other vertices, as long as $d_{\sf b} \leq d_{\sf h}$, and we describe the law of ${\bf H}^1$ in this case.</description>

      <title>Steiner trees with infinitely many terminals on the sides of an angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Euclidean Steiner problem is the problem of finding a set $St$, with the shortest length, such that $St \cup A$ is connected, where $A$ is a given set in a Euclidean space. The solutions $St$ to the Steiner problem will be called Steiner sets while the set $A$ will be called input. Since every Steiner set is acyclic we call it Steiner tree in the case when it is connected. We say that a Steiner tree is indecomposable if it does not contain any Steiner tree for a subset of the input.
  We are interested in finding the Steiner set when the input consists of infinitely many points distributed on two lines. In particular we would like to find a configuration which gives an indecomposable Steiner tree.
  We consider a self-similar input, namely the set $A_{\alpha,\lambda}$ of points with coordinates $(\lambda^{k-1}\cos \alpha,$ $\pm \lambda^{k-1}\sin \alpha)$, where $\lambda&gt;0$ and $\alpha&gt;0$ are small fixed values. These points are distributed on the two sides of an angle of size $2\alpha$ in such a way that the distances from the points to the vertex of the angle are in a geometric progression.
  To our surprise, we show that in this case the solutions to the Steiner problem for $A_{\alpha,\lambda}$, when $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are small enough, are always decomposable trees. More precisely, any Steiner tree for $A_{\alpha,\lambda}$ is a countable union of Steiner trees, each one connecting 5 points from the input. By considering only a finite number of components we obtain many solutions to the Steiner problem for finite sets composed of $4k+1$ points distributed on the two lines ($2k+1$ on a line and $2k$ on the other line). These solutions are very similar to the ladders of Chung and Graham.</description>

Abstract: Let $R=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ denote the polynomial ring in $n$ variables over a field $K$ and $I$ be a polymatroidal ideal of $R$. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive classification of all unmixed polymatroidal ideals. This work addresses a question raised by Herzog and Hibi in [10]</description>

      <title>Rapid mixing of the flip chain over non-crossing spanning trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the flip chain for non-crossing spanning trees of $n+1$ points in convex position mixes in time $O(n^8\log n)$. We use connections between Fuss-Catalan structures to construct a comparison argument with a chain similar to Wilson's lattice path chain (Wilson 2004).</description>

      <title>Crystals and Double Quiver Algebras from Jeffrey-Kirwan Residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct statistical mechanical models of crystal melting describing the flavoured Witten indices of $\mathcal{N}\ge 2$ supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. Our results can be derived from the Jeffrey-Kirwan (JK) residue formulas, and generalize the previous results for quivers corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds to a large class of quivers satisfying the no-overlap condition, including those corresponding to some non-toric Calabi-Yau manifolds. We construct new quiver algebras which we call the double quiver Yangians/algebras, as well as their representations in terms of the aforementioned crystals. For theories with four supercharges, we compare the double quiver algebras with the existing quiver Yangians/BPS algebras, which we show can also be constructed from the JK residues. For theories with two supercharges, the double quiver algebras provide an algebraic description of the BPS states, including the information of the fixed points and their relative coefficients in the full partition functions.</description>

      <title>Frobenius--Perron dimension via $\tau$-tilting theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the perspective of $\tau$-tilting theory, we study Frobenius--Perron dimensions of finite-dimensional algebras. First, we evaluate the Frobenius--Perron dimensions of $\tau$-tilting finite algebras by a combinatorial method in $\tau$-tilting theory. Secondly, we give the upper bound for the Frobenius--Perron dimension for $\tau$-tilting finite algebras of tame representation type. Thirdly, we determine the Frobenius--Perron dimensions of Nakayama algebras and generalized preprojective algebras of Dynkin type in the sense of Geiss--Leclerc--Schr\"oer.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hostadter functions $G, H$ and beyond: numeration systems and discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hofstadter's G function is recursively defined via $G(0)=0$ and then $G(n)=n-G(G(n-1))$. Following Hofstadter, a family $(F_k)$ of similar functions is obtained by varying the number $k$ of nested recursive calls in this equation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected with these functions $F_k$. In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be adapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On these digital expansions, the functions $F_k$ are acting as right shifts of the digits. The Fibonacci-like sequences are then expressed in terms of zeros of the polynomial $X^k{-}X^{k-1}{-}1$. Thanks to that, we estimate the discrepancy of each function $F_k$, i.e., the maximal distance between $F_k$ and its linear equivalent. This discrepancy is finite exactly when $k \le 4$. This also solves some related questions, in particular two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures stating how close the functions $F_3$ and $F_4$ are from the integer parts of their linear equivalents. Moreover $F_k$ can coincide exactly with such an integer part only when $k\le 2$, while $F_k$ is almost additive exactly when $k \le 4$. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been encountered when investigating the discrepancy of $F_3$.</description>

      <title>On Preserving or Reversing Higher-Order Unimodality and Convexity by Sign-Regular Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates preserving and reversing unimodality and convexity properties for sequences under transformations defined by sign-regular kernels. It is shown that these transformations only preserve these properties if the kernels are totally positive of order three or their additive inverse is totally negative of order three. In contrast, these transformations reverse these properties if the underlying kernel is totally negative or if its additive inverse is a totally positive kernel, both of order three. Furthermore, these results are extended to higher-order convex and multimodal sequences. These findings, which expand upon Karlin's earlier results on convexity, form the basis for deriving sufficient conditions for the preservation or reversal of higher-order convexity or generalised unimodality of a quotient of sequences, where both the numerator and denominator are transformations by the same sign-regular kernel.</description>
