      <title>How to use Gaia parallaxes for stars with poor astrometric fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia parallax measurements for stars with poor astrometric fits -- as evidenced by high renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) -- are often assumed to be unreliable, but the extent and nature of their biases remain poorly quantified. High RUWE is usually a consequence of binarity or higher-order multiplicity, so the parallaxes of sources with high RUWE are often of greatest astrophysical interest. Using realistic simulations of Gaia epoch astrometry, we show that the parallax uncertainties of sources with elevated RUWE are underestimated by a factor that ranges from 1 to 4 and can be robustly predicted from observables. We derive an empirical prescription to inflate reported uncertainties based on a simple analytic function of RUWE, apparent magnitude, and parallax. We validate the correction using (a) single-star solutions for Gaia sources with known orbital solutions and (b) wide binaries containing one component with elevated RUWE. The same uncertainty corrections are expected to perform well in DR4 and DR5. Our results demonstrate that Gaia parallaxes for high-RUWE sources can still yield robust distance estimates if uncertainties are appropriately inflated, enabling distance constraints for triples, binaries with periods too long or too short to be fit astrometrically, and sources blended with neighboring sources.</description>

      <title>Short-range ordering and equilibrium structure of binary crystal mixtures of atomic nuclei in white dwarf cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixtures of bare atomic nuclei on a nearly uniform degenerate electron background are a realistic model of matter in the interior of white dwarfs. Despite tremendous progress in understanding their phase diagrams achieved mainly via first-principle simulations, structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties of such mixtures are poorly understood. We develop a semi-analytic model of the crystal state of binary mixtures based on the concept of mutual short-range ordering of ions of different sorts. We derive analytic formulas for electrostatic energy of crystal mixtures, including the effect of static ion displacements from the lattice nodes, and estimate their residual entropy. Then we perform free energy minimization with respect to the order parameters for a C/O mixture at all relevant compositions and temperatures. The resulting C/O phase diagram is in a reasonable agreement with that obtained in the most recent first-principle study. The equilibrium microstructure of a crystallized mixture is shown to evolve with decrease of temperature which, in principle, can induce structural transitions. The latter will be accompanied by thermal energy release. The proposed theory opens up a path to analyze ordering and construct phase diagrams of ternary mixtures, which are of great practical interest in astrophysics, as well as to improve calcuations of electron-ion scattering rates and kinetic properties of dense crystallized matter.</description>

      <title>Extended scenarios for solar radio emissions with downshifted electron beam plasma excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principle studies of radiative processes aimed at explaining the origin of type II and type III solar radio bursts raise questions on the implications of downshifted electron beam plasma excitations with frequency (slightly) below the plasma frequency ($\omega\lesssim\omega_{pe}$) in the generation of radio emissions. Unlike the beam-induced Langmuir waves ($\omega \gtrsim \omega_{pe}$) in the standard radio emission plasma model, the primary wave excitations of cooler and/or denser beams have predominantly downshifted frequencies. Broadbands of such downshifted excitations are also confirmed by in situ observations in association with terrestrial foreshock and electron beams (in contrast to narrowband Langmuir waves), but their involvement in radiative processes has not been examined so far. We revisit three radiative scenarios specific to downshifted primary excitations, and the results demonstrate their direct or indirect involvement in plasma radio emission. Downshifted excitations of an electron beam primarily play an indirect role, contributing to the relaxation to a plateau-on-tail still able to induce Langmuir beam waves that satisfy conditions for nonlinear wave-wave interactions leading to free radio waves. At longer time scales, the primary excitations can become predominantly downshifted, and then directly couple with the secondary (backscattered) Langmuir waves to generate the second harmonic of radio emissions. Two counterbeams are more efficient and lead to faster radiative mechanisms, involving counterpropagating downshifted excitations, which couple to each other and generate intense, broadband and isotropic radio spectra of downshifted second harmonics. Such a long-lasting (second) radio harmonic can thus be invoked to distinguish regimes with downshifted ($\omega \gtrsim \omega_{pe}$) primary excitations.</description>

      <title>ALMASOP. Detection of Turbulence-induced Mass Assembly Shocks in Starless Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation is a series of mass assembly processes and starless cores, those cold and dense condensations in molecular clouds, play a pivotal role as initial seeds of stars. With only a limited sample of known starless cores, however, the origin and growth of such stellar precursors had not been well characterized previously. Meanwhile, the recent discovery of CH$_3$OH emission, which is generally associated with desorbed icy mantle in warm regions, particularly at the periphery of starless cores also remains puzzling. We present sensitive ALMA (Band~3) observations (at 3~mm) toward a sample of newly identified starless cores in the Orion Molecular Cloud. The spatially resolved images distinctly indicate that the observed CH$_3$OH and N$_2$H$^+$ emission associated with these cores are morphologically anti-correlated and kinematically offset from each other. We postulate that the CH$_3$OH emission highlights the desorption of icy mantle by shocks resulting from gas piling onto dense cores in the filaments traced by N$_2$H$^+$. Our magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of star formation in turbulent clouds combined with radiative transfer calculations and imaging simulations successfully reproduced the observed signatures and reaffirmed the above scenario at work. Our result serves as an intriguing and exemplary illustration, a snapshot in time, of the dynamic star-forming processes in turbulent clouds. The results offer compelling insights into the mechanisms governing the growth of starless cores and the presence of gas-phase complex organic molecules associated with these cores.</description>

      <title>Detection of wave activity within a realistic 3D MHD quiet sun simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Tracing wave activity from the photosphere to the corona has important implications for coronal heating and prediction of the solar wind. Despite extensive theory and simulations, the detection of waves in realistic MHD simulations still presents a large challenge due to wave interaction, mode conversion, and damping mechanisms. Aims. We conducted this study to detect localised wave activity within a realistic MHD simulation of the solar atmosphere by the Bifrost code. Methods. We present a new method of detecting the most significant contributions of wave activity within localised areas of the domain, aided by Discrete Fourier Transforms and frequency filtering. We correlate oscillations in the vertical &amp; horizontal magnetic field, velocities parallel &amp; perpendicular to the magnetic field, and pressure to infer the nature of the dominant wave modes. Results. Our method captures the most powerful frequencies and wavenumbers, as well as providing a new diagnostic for damping processes. We infer the presence of magnetoacoustic waves in the boundaries of prominent chromospheric/coronal swirling features. We find these waves are likely damped by viscous heating in the swirl boundaries, contributing to heating in the upper atmosphere. Conclusions. Using the most significant frequencies decomposition, we highlight that energy can be transported from the lower atmosphere to the upper atmosphere through waves and fluctuations along the swirl boundaries. Although further analysis is needed to confirm these findings, our new method provides a path forward to investigate wave activity in the solar atmosphere</description>

      <title>Orbital Parameters of 665 Double-lined Spectroscopic Binaries in the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The period, mass ratio, eccentricity, and other orbital parameters are fundamental for investigating binary star evolution. However, the number of binaries with known orbital parameters remains limited. Utilizing the LAMOST-MRS survey, we derived orbital solutions for 665 SB2 binaries by fitting the radial velocities of 1119 SB2 systems with at least six observations, employing a modified version of Thejoker optimized for SB2 binaries. To ensure the reliability of the results, four selection criteria were applied: reduced chi-square, normalized mean absolute error, maximum phase gap, and RV distribution metric. After applying these criteria, 665 reliable orbits were retained. Comparison with Kepler, TESS, and ZTF light curve data shows excellent agreement, with discrepancies in some cases attributed to shorter pulsation periods observed in light curves. Additionally, good consistency is found between our periods and those of SB1 systems in Gaia data. These orbital solutions contribute to understanding binary star evolution and the statistical properties of binary populations.</description>

      <title>The Dynamic Inner Disk of a Planet Forming Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets are a natural byproduct of the stellar formation process, resulting from local aggregations of material within the disks surrounding young stars. Whereas signatures of gas-giant planets at large orbital separations have been observed and successfully modeled within protoplanetary disks, the formation pathways of planets within their host star's future habitable zones remain poorly understood. Analyzing multiple nights of observations conducted over a short, two-month span with the MIRC-X and PIONIER instruments at the CHARA Array and VLTI, respectively, we uncover a highly active environment at the inner-edge of the planet formation region in the disk of HD 163296. In particular, we localize and track the motion of a disk feature near the dust-sublimation radius with a pattern speed of less than half the local Keplerian velocity, providing a potential glimpse at the planet formation process in action within the inner astronomical unit. We emphasize that this result is at the edge of what is currently possible with available optical interferometric techniques and behooves confirmation with a temporally dense followup observing campaign.</description>

      <title>Magnetically driven outflows in 3D common-envelope evolution of massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the common-envelope interaction revealed the self-consistent formation of bipolar magnetically driven outflows launched from a toroidal structure resembling a circumbinary disk. So far, the dynamical impact of bipolar outflows on the common-envelope phase remains uncertain and we aim to quantify its importance. We illustrate the impact on common-envelope evolution by comparing two simulations -- one with magnetic fields and one without -- using the three-dimensional moving-mesh hydrodynamics code AREPO. We focus on the specific case of a $10 M_\odot$ red supergiant star with a $5 M_\odot$ black hole companion. By the end of the magnetohydrodynamic simulations (after $\sim 1220$ orbits of the core binary system), about $6.4 \%$ of the envelope mass is ejected via the bipolar outflow, contributing to angular momentum extraction from the disk structure and core binary. The resulting enhanced torques reduce the final orbital separation by about $24 \%$ compared to the hydrodynamical scenario, while the overall envelope ejection remains dominated by recombination-driven equatorial winds. We analyze field amplification and outflow launching mechanisms, confirming consistency with earlier studies: magnetic fields are amplified by shear flows, and outflows are launched by a magneto-centrifugal process, supported by local shocks and magnetic pressure gradients. These outflows originate from $\sim 1.1$ times the orbital separation. We conclude that the magnetically driven outflows and their role in the dynamical interaction are a universal aspect, and we further propose an adaptation of the $\alpha_\mathrm{CE}$-formalism by adjusting the final orbital energy with a factor of $1+ M_\mathrm{out}/\mu$, where $M_\mathrm{out}$ is the mass ejected through the outflows and $\mu$ the reduced mass of the core binary.

      <title>The Discovery of Two Quadruple Star Systems with the Second and Third Shortest Outer Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of two quadruple star systems -- TIC 285853156 and TIC 392229331 -- each consisting of two bound eclipsing binary stars. Among the most compact quadruples known, TIC 392229331 and TIC 285853156 have the second and third shortest outer orbital periods (145 days and 152 days, respectively) after BU Canis Minoris (122 days, Pribulla et al. 2023). We demonstrate that both systems are long-term dynamically stable despite substantial outer orbital eccentricities (0.33 for TIC 285853156 and 0.56 for TIC 392229331). We previously reported these systems in Kostov et al. (2022) and Kostov et al. (2024) as 2+2 hierarchical quadruple candidates producing two sets of primary and secondary eclipses in TESS data, as well as prominent eclipse timing variations on both binary components. We combine all available TESS data and new spectroscopic observations into a comprehensive photodynamical model, proving that the component binary stars are gravitationally bound in both systems and finding accurate stellar and orbital parameters for both systems, including very precise determinations of the outer periods. TIC 285853156 and TIC 392229331 represent the latest addition to the small population of well-characterized proven quadruple systems dynamically interacting on detectable timescales.</description>

      <title>Scaler rates from the Pierre Auger Observatory: a new proxy of solar activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modulation of low-energy galactic cosmic rays reflects interplanetary magnetic field variations and can provide useful information on solar activity. An array of ground-surface detectors can reveal the secondary particles, which originate from the interaction of cosmic rays with the atmosphere. In this work, we present an investigation of the low-threshold rate (scaler) time series recorded in 16 years of operation by the Pierre Auger Observatory surface detectors in Malargue, Argentina. Through an advanced spectral analysis, we detected highly statistically significant variations in the time series with periods ranging from the decadal to the daily scale. We investigate their origin, revealing a direct connection with solar variability. Thanks to their intrinsic very low noise level, the Auger scalers allow a thorough and detailed investigation of the galactic cosmic-ray flux variations in the heliosphere at different timescales and can, therefore, be considered a new proxy of solar variability.</description>

      <title>Constraining Lens Masses in Moderately to Highly Magnified Microlensing Events from Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microlensing events provide a unique way to detect and measure the masses of isolated, non-luminous objects, particularly dark stellar remnants. Under certain conditions, it is possible to measure the mass of these objects using photometry alone, specifically when a microlensing light curve displays a finite-source (FS) effect. This effect generally occurs in highly magnified light curves, i.e. when the source and the lens are very well aligned. In this study, we analyse Gaia Alerts and Gaia Data Release 3 datasets, identifying four moderate-to-high-magnification microlensing events without a discernible FS effect. The absence of this effect suggests a large Einstein radius, implying substantial lens masses. In each event, we constrain the FS effect and therefore establish lower limits for angular Einstein radius and lens mass. Additionally, we use the DarkLensCode software to obtain mass, distance, and brightness distribution for the lens based on the Galactic model. Our analysis established lower mass limits of $\sim 0.2$ $M_{\odot}$ for one lens and $\sim 0.3-0.5$ $M_{\odot}$ for two others. DarkLensCode analysis supports these findings, estimating lens masses in the range of$\sim 0.42-1.66$ $M_{\odot}$ and dark lens probabilities exceeding 60\%. These results strongly indicate that the lenses are stellar remnants, such as white dwarfs or neutron stars. While further investigations are required to confirm the nature of these lenses, we demonstrate a straightforward yet effective approach to identifying stellar remnant candidates.</description>

      <title>CAMPOS II. The onset of protostellar disk substructures and planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 1.3 mm CAMPOS survey has resolved 90 protostellar disks with $\sim$15 au resolution across the Ophiuchus, Corona Australis, and Chamaeleon star-forming regions. To address the fundamental question, "When does planet formation begin?", we combined the CAMPOS sample with literature observations of Class 0-II disks (bolometric temperature, $T_{\rm bol} \le 1900$ K), all mapped at 1.3 mm with resolutions ranging from 4 to 33 au. To investigate substructure detection rates as a function of bolometric temperature, we restricted the sample to disks observed at the 1.3 mm wavelength, with inclinations below 75$^\circ$, linear resolution $\le 20$ au and resolved with at least four resolution elements ($\theta_{\rm disk}/\theta_{\rm res} \ge 4$). We also considered the effects of extinction correction and the inclusion of Herschel Space Telescope data on the bolometric temperature measurements, to constrain the lower and upper limits of bolometric temperature for each source. We find that by $T_{\rm bol} \sim 200-400\,K$, substructure detection rates increased sharply to $\sim$60%, corresponding to an approximate age of $0.2-0.4$ Myr. No substructures are detected in Class 0 disks. The ratio of disk-averaged brightness temperature to predicted dust temperature shows a trend of increasing values toward the youngest Class 0 disks, suggesting higher optical depths in these early stages. Classifying disks with substructures into those with and without large central cavities, we find both populations coexisting across evolutionary stages, suggesting they are not necessarily evolutionarily linked. Our statistical analysis confirms that substructures similar to those in Class II disks are already common by the Class I stage, and the emergence of these structures at $T_{\rm bol} \sim 200-400\,K$ could represent only an upper limit.</description>

      <title>Trials and Tribulations of Chemodynamical Tagging: Investigating the Recovery of Open Clusters in the Gaia DR3-GALAH DR4 Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11586</link>

Abstract: Chemodynamical tagging has been suggested as a powerful tool to trace stars back to their birth clusters. However, the efficacy of chemodynamical tagging as a means to recover individual stellar clusters is still under debate. In this study, we present a detailed investigation of chemodynamical tagging of open clusters using both dynamical and chemical data from the \textit{Gaia} DR3 and GALAH DR4 surveys, respectively. Using a sample of open clusters and mock field stars, we conduct a bootstrap analysis to evaluate every unique combination of orbital components ($E, J_R, J_\phi, J_Z$) and chemical abundances ([X/Fe] for O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Y, and Ba) on how well they recover open clusters when used as parameters in the clustering algorithm, HBDSCAN. We find that using primarily dynamical orbital parameters leads to the highest recovery rate of open cluster stars. Nevertheless, even employing the best performing parameter combinations leads to low open cluster recovery rates. We find that, in most cases, chemodynamical tagging of open clusters using blind clustering algorithms is not efficient, which is in line with previous theoretical and observational work. However, we show that the addition of cuts based on metallicity, age, and birth radii in order to reduce the size of the clustering catalog can marginally improve the recovery rate of open clusters.</description>

      <title>The Cocytos Stream: A Disrupted Globular Cluster from our Last Major Merger?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The census of stellar streams and dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way provides direct constraints on galaxy formation models and the nature of dark matter. The DESI Milky Way survey (with a footprint of 14,000$~deg{^2}$ and a depth of $r&lt;19$ mag) delivers the largest sample of distant metal-poor stars compared to previous optical fiber-fed spectroscopic surveys. This makes DESI an ideal survey to search for previously undetected streams and dwarf galaxies. We present a detailed characterization of the Cocytos stream, which was re-discovered using a clustering analysis with a catalog of giants in the DESI year 3 data, supplemented with Magellan/MagE spectroscopy. Our analysis reveals a relatively metal-rich ([Fe/H]$=-1.3$) and thick stream (width$=1.5^\circ$) at a heliocentric distance of $\approx 25$ kpc, with an internal velocity dispersion of 6.5-9 km s$^{-1}$. The stream's metallicity, radial orbit, and proximity to the Virgo stellar overdensities suggest that it is most likely a disrupted globular cluster that came in with the Gaia-Enceladus merger. We also confirm its association with the Pyxis globular cluster. Our result showcases the ability of wide-field spectroscopic surveys to kinematically discover faint disrupted dwarfs and clusters, enabling constraints on the dark matter distribution in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a polar circumbinary exoplanet orbiting a pair of eclipsing brown dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One notable example of exoplanet diversity is the population of circumbinary planets, which orbit around both stars of a binary star system. There are so far only 16 known circumbinary exoplanets, all of which lie in the same orbital plane as the host binary. Suggestions exist that circumbinary planets could also exist on orbits highly inclined to the binary, close to 90$^{\circ}$, polar orbits. No such planets have been found yet but polar circumbinary gas and debris discs have been observed and if these were to form planets then those would be left on a polar orbit. We report strong evidence for a polar circumbinary exoplanet, which orbits a close pair of brown dwarfs which are on an eccentric orbit. We use radial-velocities to measure a retrograde apsidal precession for the binary, and show that this can only be attributed to the presence of a polar planet.</description>

      <title>Exploring GRBs and supernovae connection: does a superluminous hypernova population exist?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of several gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that are temporally and spatially compatible with energetic supernovae (hypernovae) has established their common origin. In one case (GRB 111209A/SN 2011kl) the associated supernova was classified as superluminous (SN 2011kl). The exceptional duration of the observed gamma-ray prompt emission of GRB 111209A (about 7 hours) is widely considered key to unlocking the physics behind the still mysterious origin of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). We review the main observational and theoretical findings that may link some ultra-long GRBs to SLSNe. Specifically, we examine notable events, the role of progenitors and host galaxies in shaping these phenomena, and focus on the proposed models. While a magnetar central engine is a plausible mechanism for both luminous and long-duration GRBs, a conclusive answer remains elusive, as alternative explanations are still viable. Further observational and theoretical work is required to clarify progenitor pathways and explosion mechanisms, potentially extending the classical GRB-SN connection to rare superluminous hypernovae.</description>

      <title>Assessing the validity of the anelastic and Boussinesq approximations to model solar inertial modes</title>

Abstract: Global-scale inertial modes of oscillations have been recently observed on the Sun. They might play an important dynamic and diagnostic role for the Sun. This work aims to assess the validity of simplifying assumptions in the equation of continuity, which have often been used in the linear models of solar inertial modes. We compute the linear eigenmodes of the Sun's convection zone in the inertial frequency range using the Dedalus code. This single framework enables us to compare the sensitivity of the modes to different model setups, such as the compressible setup and the Boussinesq and anelastic approximations. We consider both the cases of uniform rotation and solar differential rotation (as given by helioseismology). We find that the compressible and anelastic models have almost identical eigenmodes under uniform rotation and solar differential rotation. On the other hand, the absence of density stratification in the Boussinesq model results in significantly different eigenmodes under these setups. The differences are most prominent for the non-toroidal modes with significant radial motions mainly due to the absence of the compressional $\beta$ effect. The anelastic approximation simplifies the calculations and reduces the numerical cost without affecting the solar inertial modes. The Boussinesq or incompressible approximations cannot be used to model the solar inertial modes accurately. Given the strong influence of differential rotation on the eigenmodes, an acceptable setup is to use the anelastic approximation together with the solar differential rotation.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Nova Simulations with an Extended Buffer and Lower Initial Mixing Temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical nova is a thermonuclear runaway initiated on a white dwarf accreting solar-like material from its stellar companion. Once the white dwarf accretes enough mass, the pressure at the base of the accreted layer reaches a critical point, leading to the ignition of the hydrogen fuel at their interface. This paper presents a set of two-dimensional CO classical nova simulations with an extended buffer zone of a fixed low density and temperature between the top of the accreted layer and the upper boundary, allowing us to capture the thermonuclear outburst in the domain. Our domain reduces the role of the upper-outflow boundary condition that has affected previous simulations and allows us to explore the nucleosynthesis evolution in detail. We also study the effects of the initial temperature perturbation and buffer size to explore their sensitivity in our simulations. Finally, we start our simulations with a lower temperature at the base of the accreted layer ($7\times 10^7\,\mathrm{K}$) than previous work, allowing us to capture mixing earlier in the evolution, reducing the effects of the mixing-length-theory assumptions. This allows for a more realistic description of convective transport in our models.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the role of merger histories in the population of In~situ stars: linking IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to H3 survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We undertake a comprehensive investigation into the distribution of in~situ stars within Milky Way-like galaxies, leveraging TNG50 simulations and comparing their predictions with data from the H3 survey. Our analysis reveals that 28\% of galaxies demonstrate reasonable agreement with H3, while only 12\% exhibit excellent alignment in their profiles, regardless of the specific spatial cut employed to define in~situ stars. To uncover the underlying factors contributing to deviations between TNG50 and H3 distributions, we scrutinise correlation coefficients among internal drivers(e.g., virial radius, star formation rate [SFR]) and merger-related parameters (such as the effective mass-ratio, mean distance, average redshift, total number of mergers, average spin-ratio and maximum spin alignment between merging galaxies). Notably, we identify significant correlations between deviations from observational data and key parameters such as the median slope of virial radius, mean SFR values, and the rate of SFR change across different redshift scans. Furthermore, positive correlations emerge between deviations from observational data and parameters related to galaxy mergers. We validate these correlations using the Random Forest Regression method. Our findings underscore the invaluable insights provided by the H3 survey in unravelling the cosmic history of galaxies akin to the Milky Way, thereby advancing our understanding of galactic evolution and shedding light on the formation and evolution of Milky Way-like galaxies in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Equation of State from Neutron Star Observables via Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have conducted an extensive study using a diverse set of equations of state (EoSs) to uncover strong relationships between neutron star (NS) observables and the underlying EoS parameters using symbolic regression method. These EoS models, derived from a mix of agnostic and physics-based approaches, considered neutron stars composed of nucleons, hyperons, and other exotic degrees of freedom in beta equilibrium. The maximum mass of a NS is found to be strongly correlated with the pressure and baryon density at an energy density of approximately 800 MeV.fm$^{-3}$. We have also demonstrated that the EoS can be expressed as a function of radius and tidal deformability within the NS mass range 1-2$M_\odot$. These insights offer a promising and efficient framework to decode the dense matter EoS directly from the accurate knowledge of NS observables.</description>

      <title>Spin evolution modeling for a newly-formed white dwarf resulting from binary white dwarf merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Merger of two white dwarfs (WDs) has been proposed to form an isolated WD having high magnetization and rapid rotation. We study the influence of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind on spin evolution of the newly-formed merger product. We consider the scenario that the merger product appears as a giant-star-like object with a radius of $&gt; 10^{10}$ cm and a luminosity of the order of an Eddington value. We solve a structure of the merger product under the hydrostatic equilibrium and identify the position of the slow-point in the hot envelope. It is found that if such a giant-star-like object is spinning with an angular speed of the order of the Keplerian value, the MHD wind can be produced. The mass-loss rate is estimated to be of the order of $\sim 10^{20-21}~\mathrm{g~s^{-1}}$, and the timescale of the spin down is $\sim 10\text{-}10^{3}$ years, which depends on stellar magnetic field. We discuss that the final angular momentum when the MHD wind is terminated is related to the magnetic flux and initial radiation luminosity of the merger product. We apply our model to three specific magnetic WD sources ZTF J190132.9+145808.7, SDSS J221141.8+113604.4, and PG 1031+234 by assuming that those WDs were as a result of the merger product. We argue that the current periods of ZTF J190132.9+145808.7 and PG 1031+234 that are strongly magnetized WDs are related to the initial luminosity at the giant phase. For SDSS J221141.8+113604.4, which is mildly magnetized WD, its angular momentum was almost determined when the spin-down timescale due to MHD wind is comparable to the cooling timescale in the giant phase.</description>
