      <title>Stationary states of aggregation-diffusion equations with compactly supported attraction kernels: radial symmetry and mass-independent boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nonlocal aggregation diffusion equation incorporating repulsion modelled by nonlinear diffusion and attraction modelled by nonlocal interaction. When the attractive interaction kernel is radially symmetric and strictly increasing on its domain it is previously known that all stationary solutions are radially symmetric and decreasing up to a translation; however, this result has not been extended to accommodate attractive kernels that are non-decreasing, for instance, attractive kernels with bounded support. For the diffusion coefficient $m&gt;1$, we show that, for attractive kernels that are radially symmetric and non-decreasing, all stationary states are radially symmetric and decreasing up to a translation on each connected subset of their support. Furthermore, for $m&gt;2$, we prove analytically that stationary states have an upper-bound independent of the initial data, confirming previous numerical results given in the literature.</description>

      <title>Gevrey Regularity for a Fluid-Structure Interaction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A result of Gevrey regularity is ascertained for a semigroup which models a fluid-structure interaction problem. In this model, the fluid evolves in a piecewise smooth or convex geometry $\mathcal{O}$. On a portion of the boundary, a fourth order plate equation is coupled with the fluid through pressure and matching velocities. The key to obtaining the conclusion of Gevrey regularity is an appropriate estimation of the resolvent of the associated $C_0$-semigroup operator. Moreover, a numerical scheme and example is provided which empirically demonstrates smoothing of the fluid-structure semigroup.</description>

      <title>On certain classes of mild solutions of the scalar Li\'enard equation revised</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we revisit the existence, uniqueness and exponential decay of some classes of mild solutions which are almost periodic (AP-), asymptotically almost periodic (AAP-) and pseudo almost periodic (PAP-) of the scalar Lin\'eard equation by employing the notion of Green function and Massera-type principle. First, by changing variable we convert this equation to a system of first order differential equations. Then, we transform the problem into a framework of an abstract parabolic evolution equation which associates with an evolution family equipped an exponential dichtonomy and the corresponding Green function is exponentially almost periodic. After that, we prove a Massera-type principle that the corresponding linear equation has a uniqueness AP-, AAP- and PAP- mild solution if the right hand side and the coefficient functions are AP-, AAP- and PAP- functions, respectively. The well-posedness of semilinear equation is proved by using fixed point arguments and the exponential decay of mild solutions are obtained by using Gronwall's inequality and the exponentially stable assumption of evolution family. Although our work revisits some previous works on well-posedness of the Lin\'eard equation on these type solutions but provide a difference view by using Green function and go farther on the aspects of asymptotic behaviour of solutions and the construction of abstract theory. Our abstract results can be also applied to other parabolic evolution equations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Homogenization of Parabolic Equations with Lower-order Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of homogenization results has long been a central focus in the field of mathematical analysis, particularly for equations without lower-order terms. However, the importance of studying homogenization results for parabolic equations with lower-order terms cannot be understated. In this study, we aim to extend the analysis to homogenization for the general parabolic equation with random coefficients:
  \begin{equation*}
  \partial_{t}p^\epsilon-\nabla\cdot\left(\mathbf{a}\left( \dfrac{x}{\epsilon},\dfrac{t}{\epsilon^2}\right)\nabla p^\epsilon\right)-\mathbf{b}\left( \dfrac{x}{\epsilon},\dfrac{t}{\epsilon^2}\right)\nabla p^\epsilon -\mathbf{d}\left( \dfrac{x}{\epsilon},\dfrac{t}{\epsilon^2}\right) p^\epsilon=0.
  \end{equation*}
  Moreover, we establish the Caccioppoli inequality and Meyers estimate for the generalized parabolic equation. By using the generalized Meyers estimate, we get the weak convergence of $p^\epsilon$ in $H^1$.</description>

      <title>Analysis of linear elliptic equations with general drifts and $L^1$-zero-order terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a detailed analysis of the Dirichlet boundary value problem for linear elliptic equations in divergence form with $L^p$-general drifts, where $p \in (d, \infty)$, and non-negative $L^1$-zero-order terms. Specifically, by transforming the general drifts into weak divergence-free drifts, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a bounded weak solution, showing that the zero-order term does not influence the quantity of the unique weak solution. Additionally, by imposing the $ VMO$ condition and mild differentiability on the diffusion coefficients and assuming an $L^s$-zero-order terms with $s \in (1, \infty)$, we demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution for the corresponding non-divergence type equations. An important feature of this paper is that, due to the weak divergence-free property of the drifts in the transformed equations, the constants appearing in our estimates can be explicitly calculated, which is expected to offer significant applications in error analysis.</description>

Abstract: We show small and large Carleson perturbation results for the parabolic regularity boundary value problem with boundary data in $\dot{L}_{1,1/2}^p$. The operator we consider is $L:=\partial_t -\mathrm{div}(A\nabla\cdot)$ and the domains are parabolic cylinders $\Omega=\mathcal{O}\times\mathbb{R}$, where $\mathcal{O}$ is a chord arc domain or Lipschitz domain.</description>

      <title>Analysis of nearly planar defects using the Thomas--Fermi--von Weiszacker model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of the electron density and relative energy with respect to a perfect crystal of a class of volume defects that are compactly contained along one direction while being of infinite extent along the other two using the Thomas-Fermi-von Weiszacker (TFW) model. We take advantage of prior work on the thermodynamic limit and stability estimates in the TFW setting, and specialize it to the case of nearly planar defects. In particular, we prove that the relative energy of the defective crystal, with respect to a perfect crystal, is finite, and in fact conforms to a well-posed minimization problem. We also establish convergence of the electronic fields to the perturbation caused by the nearly planar defect. Our main finding is that perturbations to both the density and electrostatic potential due to the presence of the nearly planar defect decay exponentially away from the defect, in agreement with the known locality property of the TFW model. We use these results to infer bounds on the generalized stacking fault energy, in particular the finiteness of this energy, and discuss its implications for numerical calculations. We conclude with a brief presentation of numerical results on the (non-convex) Thomas-Fermi-von Weiszacker-Dirac (TFWD) model that includes the Dirac exchange in the universal functional, and discuss its implications for future work.</description>

      <title>BKL bounces outside homogeneity: Gowdy symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of bounces, as predicted by Belinski, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz (BKL), as an instability mechanism within the setting of the Einstein vacuum equations in Gowdy symmetry. In particular, for a wide class of inhomogeneous initial data we prove that the dynamics near the $t = 0$ singularity are well-described by ODEs reminiscent of Kasner bounces. Unlike previous works regarding bounces, our spacetimes are not necessarily spatially homogeneous, and a crucial step is proving so-called asymptotically velocity term dominated (AVTD) behaviour, even in the presence of nonlinear BKL bounces and other phenomena such as spikes. (A similar phenomenon involving bounces and AVTD behaviour, though not spikes, can also be seen in our companion paper "BKL bounces outside homogeneity: Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field in surface symmetry", albeit in the context of the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field model in surface symmetry.) One particular application is the study of (past) instability of certain polarized Gowdy spacetimes, including some Kasner spacetimes. Perturbations of such spacetimes are such that the singularity persists, but the intermediate dynamics -- between initial data and the singularity -- feature BKL bounces.</description>

      <title>BKL bounces outside homogeneity: Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field in surface symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of bounces, as predicted by Belinski, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz (BKL) in the study of singularities arising from Einstein's equations, as an instability mechanism within the setting of the (inhomogeneous) Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system in surface symmetry. This article can be viewed as a companion to our other article "BKL bounces outside homogeneity: Gowdy symmetric spacetimes" [27], where we study bounces for the Einstein vacuum equations in Gowdy symmetry. That is, we show many features of such bounces generalize to the matter model described, albeit in a different symmetry class. The articles may be read independently.
  In analogy to [27], we describe a wide class of inhomogeneous initial data which permit formation of a spacelike singularity, but such that the dynamics towards different spatial points at the singularity are well-described by independent nonlinear ODEs reminiscent of BKL bounces. A major ingredient is the proof of so-called Asymptotically Velocity Term Dominated behaviour even in the presence of such bounces, though one difference from [27] is that our model does not permit the existence of so-called "spikes".
  One particular application is the study of (past) instability of certain generalized Kasner spacetimes with no electromagnetic field present. Perturbations of such spacetimes are such that the singularity persists, but for perturbations with electromagnetism turned on the intermediate dynamics - between data and the singularity - features up to one BKL-like bounce. This is in analogy with the instability of polarized Gowdy spacetimes due to non-polarized perturbations in [27].</description>

      <title>Global existence and decay estimates of strong solutions for compressible non-isentropic magnetohydrodynamic flows with vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.06726v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem of three-dimensional compressible non-isentropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) fluids with both interior and far field vacuum states. Applying delicate energy estimates, initial layer analysis, and continuation theory, we establish the global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions, which may be of possibly large oscillations, provided that the initial data are of small total energy. Furthermore, we also derive algebraic decay estimates of the solution. This improves our previous results (Z. Angew. Math. Phys. 71: Paper No. 188, 2020; J. Differential Equations 336: 456--478, 2022) where viscosity coefficients should additionally satisfy $3\mu&gt;\lambda$. To our best knowledge, this is the first result on time-decay rates of solutions to the Cauchy problem of multi-dimensional compressible non-isentropic MHD equations with vacuum.</description>

      <title>Perturbation Theory for Second Order Elliptic Operators with BMO Antisymmetric Part</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper we study perturbation theory for the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem on bounded chord arc domains for elliptic operators in divergence form with potentially unbounded antisymmetric part in BMO. Specifically, given elliptic operators $L_0 = \mbox{div}(A_0\nabla)$ and $L_1 = \mbox{div}(A_1\nabla)$ such that the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem for $L_0$ is solvable for some $p&gt;1$; we show that if $A_0 - A_1$ satisfies certain Carleson condition, then the $ L^q$ Dirichlet problem for $L_1$ is solvable for some $q \geq p$. Moreover if the Carleson norm is small then we may take $q=p$. We use the approach first introduced in Fefferman-Kenig-Pipher '91 on the unit ball, and build on Milakis-Pipher-Toro '11 where the large norm case was shown for symmetric matrices on bounded chord arc domains. We then apply this to solve the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem on a bounded Lipschitz domain for an operator $L = \mbox{div}(A\nabla)$, where $A$ satisfies a Carleson condition similar to the one assumed in Kenig-Pipher '01 and Dindo\v{s}-Petermichl-Pipher '07 but with unbounded antisymmetric part.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to contribute to the folklore of function spaces on Lipschitz domains. We prove the boundedness of the trace operator for homogeneous Sobolev and Besov spaces on a special Lipschitz domain with sharp regularity. To achieve this, we provide appropriate definitions and properties, ensuring our construction of these spaces is suitable for non-linear partial differential equations and boundary value problems. The trace theorem holds with the sharp range $s \in (\frac{1}{p}, 1 + \frac{1}{p})$. While the case of inhomogeneous function spaces is well-known, the case of homogeneous function spaces appears to be new, even for a smooth half-space. We refine several arguments from a previous paper on function spaces on the half-space and include a treatment for the endpoint cases $p=1$ and $p=+\infty$.</description>

Abstract: We address the inverse problem of recovering the stiffness tensor and density of mass from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. We study the invariance of the Euclidean and Riemannian elastic wave equation under coordinate transformations. Furthermore, we present gauge freedoms between the parameters that leave the elastic wave equations invariant. We use these results to present gauge freedoms in the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map associated to the Riemannian elastic wave equation.</description>

      <title>New asymptotics for strong solutions of the strongly stratified Boussinesq system without rotation and for large ill-prepared initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous work dedicated to the strongly stratified Boussinesq system, we obtained for the first time a limit system (when the froude number $\epsilon$ goes to zero) that depends on the thermal diffusivity $\nu$ ' (other works obtained a limit system only depending on the visosity $\nu$). To reach those richer asymptotics we had to consider an unusual initial data which is the sum of a function depending on the full space variable and a function only depending on the vertical coordinate, and we studied the convergence of the weak Leray-type solutions. In the present article we extend these results to the strong Fujita-Kato-type solutions. We obtain far better convergence rates (in $\epsilon$) for ill-prepared initial data with very large oscillating part of size some negative power of the small parameter $\epsilon$. The main difficulties come from the anisotropy induced by the presence of x3-depending functions.</description>

In each of these results, we provide sufficient conditions on a sequence of kernel functions that guarantee the asymptotic compact embedding of the associated nonlocal function spaces into the class of square-integrable functions. Moreover, we will demonstrate that the sequence of nonlocal function spaces converges in an appropriate sense to a limiting function space. As an application, we prove uniform Poincar\'e-type inequalities for sequence of half-space gradient operators. We also apply the compactness result to demonstrate the convergence of appropriately parameterized nonlocal heterogeneous anisotropic diffusion problems. We will construct asymptotically compatible schemes for these type of problems. Another application concerns the convergence and robust discretization of a nonlocal optimal control problem.</description>

      <title>Ill-posedness of the Boltzmann-BGK model in the exponential class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BGK (Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook) model is a relaxation-type model of the Boltzmann equation, which is popularly used in place of the Boltzmann equation in physics and engineering. In this paper, we address the ill-posedness problem for the BGK model, in which the solution instantly escapes the initial solution space. For this, we propose two ill-posedness scenarios, namely, the homogeneous and the inhomogeneous ill-posedness mechanisms. In the former case, we find a class of spatially homogeneous solutions to the BGK model, where removing the small velocity part of the initial data triggers ill-posedness by increasing temperature. For the latter, we construct a spatially inhomogeneous solution to the BGK model such that the local temperature constructed from the solution has a polynomial growth in spatial variable. These ill-posedness properties for the BGK model pose a stark contrast with the Boltzmann equation for which the solution map is, at least for a finite time, stable in the corresponding solution spaces.</description>

      <title>Sobolev inequality and its applications to nonlinear PDE on noncommutative Euclidean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Sobolev inequality on noncommutative Euclidean spaces. As a simple consequence, we obtain the Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequality and as its application we show global well-posedness of nonlinear PDEs in the noncommutative Euclidean space. Moreover, we show that the logarithmic Sobolev inequality is equivalent to the Nash inequality for possibly different constants in this noncommutative setting by completing the list in noncommutative Varopoulos's theorem in [37]. Finally, we present a direct application of the Nash inequality to compute the time decay for solutions of the heat equation in the noncommutative setting.</description>

      <title>Global existence and uniqueness of the density-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system with variable capillarity and viscosity coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the global well-posedness of the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system with a general capillary term. Based on the maximal regularity property, we obtain the global existence and uniqueness of solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system with variable viscosity and capillary terms. By assuming the initial density $\rho_0$ is close to a positive constant, additionally, the initial velocity $u_0$ and the initial density $\nabla \rho_0$ are small in critical space $\dot B^{-1+d/p}_{p,1}(\mathbb R^{d})$ $(1&lt;p&lt;d).$ This work relies on the maximal regularity property of the heat equation, of the Stokes equation, and of the Lam\'e equation.</description>

      <title>Convexity of weakly regular surfaces of distributional nonnegative intrinsic curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.09224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the image of an isometric embedding into ${\mathbb R}^3$ of a two dimensionnal complete Riemannian manifold $(\Sigma, g)$ without boundary is a convex surface provided both the embedding and the metric $g$ enjoy a $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity for some $\alpha&gt;2/3$ and the distributional Gaussian curvature of $g$ is nonnegative and nonzero. The analysis must pass through some key observations regarding solutions to the very weak Monge-Amp\`ere equation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal control in Hilbert spaces: $C^{1,1}$ regularity of the value function and optimal synthesis via viscosity solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study optimal control problems governed by abstract infinite dimensional stochastic differential equations using the dynamic programming approach. In the first part, we prove Lipschitz continuity, semiconcavity and semiconvexity of the value function under several sets of assumptions, and thus derive its $C^{1,1}$ regularity in the space variable. Based on this regularity result, we construct optimal feedback controls using the notion of the $B$-continuous viscosity solutions for the associated Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation. This is done in the case when the noise coefficient is independent of the control variable. We also discuss applications of our results to optimal control problems for controlled stochastic reaction-diffusion equations and, under economic motivations, to stochastic delay differential equations.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Neumann Waveform Relaxation Methods for PDEs with Time Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and compare two domain decomposition based numerical methods, namely the Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Neumann Waveform Relaxation methods (DNWR and NNWR respectively), tailored for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) incorporating time delay. Time delay phenomena frequently arise in various real-world systems, making their accurate modeling and simulation crucial for understanding and prediction. We consider a series of model problems, ranging from Parabolic, Hyperbolic to Neutral PDEs with time delay and apply the iterative techniques DNWR and NNWR for solving in parallel. We present the theoretical foundations, numerical implementation, and comparative performance analysis of these two methods. Through numerical experiments and simulations, we explore their convergence properties, computational efficiency, and applicability to various types of PDEs with time delay.</description>
