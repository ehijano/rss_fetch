      <title>On $NP \cap coNP$ proof complexity generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the theory of proof complexity generators we consider the following $\Sigma^p_2$ search problem $\mbox{DD}_P$ determined by a propositional proof system $P$: given a $P$-proof $\pi$ of a disjunction $\bigvee_i \alpha_i$, no two $\alpha_i$ having an atom in common, find $i$ such that $\alpha_i \in \mbox{TAUT}$.
  We formulate a hypothesis (ST) that for some strong proof system $P$ the problem $\mbox{DD}_P$ is not solvable in the student-teacher model with a p-time student and a constant number of rounds. The hypothesis follows from the existence of hard one-way permutations.
  We prove, using a model-theoretic assumption, that (ST) implies $NP \neq coNP$. The assumption concerns the existence of extensions of models of a bounded arithmetic theory and it is open at present if it holds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Period finding and phase estimation are fundamental in quantum computing. Prior work has established lower bounds on their success probabilities. We improve these results by deriving tight upper and lower bounds on the success probability that converge to 1.</description>

      <title>Inapproximability of Finding Sparse Vectors in Codes, Subspaces, and Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding sparse vectors is a fundamental problem that arises in several contexts including codes, subspaces, and lattices. In this work, we prove strong inapproximability results for all these variants using a novel approach that even bypasses the PCP theorem. Our main result is that it is NP-hard (under randomized reductions) to approximate the sparsest vector in a real subspace within any constant factor; the gap can be further amplified using tensoring. Our reduction has the property that there is a Boolean solution in the completeness case. As a corollary, this immediately recovers the state-of-the-art inapproximability factors for the shortest vector problem (SVP) on lattices. Our proof extends the range of $\ell_p$ (quasi) norms for which hardness was previously known, from $p\geq 1$ to all $p\geq 0$, answering a question raised by [Khot05].
  Previous hardness results for SVP, and the related minimum distance problem (MDP) for error-correcting codes, all use lattice/coding gadgets that have an abundance of codewords in a ball of radius smaller than the minimum distance. In contrast, our reduction only needs many codewords in a ball of radius slightly larger than the minimum distance. This enables an easy derandomization of our reduction for finite fields, giving a new elementary proof of deterministic hardness for MDP. We believe this weaker density requirement might offer a promising approach to showing deterministic hardness of SVP, a long elusive goal. The key technical ingredient underlying our result for real subspaces is a proof that in the kernel of a random Rademacher matrix, the support of any two linearly independent vectors have very little overlap.
  A broader motivation behind this work is the development of inapproximability techniques for problems over the reals. We hope that the approach we develop could enable progress on analytic variants of sparsest vector.</description>

      <title>Optimal Inapproximability of Promise Equations over Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A celebrated result of Hastad established that, for any constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, it is NP-hard to find an assignment satisfying a $(1/|G|+\varepsilon)$-fraction of the constraints of a given 3-LIN instance over an Abelian group $G$ even if one is promised that an assignment satisfying a $(1-\varepsilon)$-fraction of the constraints exists. Engebretsen, Holmerin, and Russell showed the same result for 3-LIN instances over any finite (not necessarily Abelian) group. In other words, for almost-satisfiable instances of 3-LIN the random assignment achieves an optimal approximation guarantee. We prove that the random assignment algorithm is still best possible under a stronger promise that the 3-LIN instance is almost satisfiable over an arbitrarily more restrictive group.</description>

      <title>Multicut Problems in Almost-Planar Graphs: The Dependency of Complexity on the Demand Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, a set $T$ of terminal vertices, and a demand graph $H$ on $T$, the \textsc{Multicut} problem asks for a set of edges of minimum weight that separates the pairs of terminals specified by the edges of $H$.
  The \textsc{Multicut} problem can be solved in polynomial time if the number of terminals and the genus of the graph is bounded (Colin de Verdi\`ere [Algorithmica, 2017]).
  Focke et al.~[SoCG 2024] characterized which special cases of Multicut are fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the number of terminals on planar graphs. Moreover, they precisely determined how the parameter genus influences the complexity and presented partial results of this form for graphs that can be made planar by the deletion of $\pi$ edges. We complete the picture on how this parameter $\pi$ influences the complexity of different special cases and precisely determine the influence of the crossing number.
  Formally, let $\mathcal{H}$ be any class of graphs (satisfying a mild closure property) and let Multicut$(\mathcal{H})$ be the special case when the demand graph $H$ is in $\mathcal{H}$. Our first main result is showing that if $\mathcal{H}$ has the combinatorial property of having bounded distance to extended bicliques, then Multicut$(\mathcal{H})$ on unweighted graphs is FPT parameterized by the number $t$ of terminals and $\pi$. For the case when $\mathcal{H}$ does not have this combinatorial property,
  Focke et al.~[SoCG 2024] showed that $O(\sqrt{t})$ is essentially the best possible exponent of the running time; together with our result, this gives a complete understanding of how the parameter $\pi$ influences complexity on unweighted graphs.
  Our second main result is giving an algorithm whose existence shows that the parameter crossing number behaves analogously if we consider weighted graphs.</description>

      <title>Transcendental Encoding conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the Transcendental Encoding Conjecture for decision problems, which asserts that every language in complexity class P encodes to an algebraic real (possibly rational or algebraic irrational) under its binary characteristic encoding or other relevant encodings, whereas every NP-complete language encodes to a transcendental real. In particular, we exhibit languages whose encodings are provably rational (hence algebraic), discuss the status of encodings for other "natural" languages such as PRIMES (its encoding is irrational but not known to be algebraic).</description>

      <title>The Alignment Trap: Complexity Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper argues that AI alignment is not merely difficult, but is founded on a fundamental logical contradiction. We first establish The Enumeration Paradox: we use machine learning precisely because we cannot enumerate all necessary safety rules, yet making ML safe requires examples that can only be generated from the very enumeration we admit is impossible. This paradox is then confirmed by a set of five independent mathematical proofs, or "pillars of impossibility." Our main results show that: (1) Geometric Impossibility: The set of safe policies has measure zero, a necessary consequence of projecting infinite-dimensional world-context requirements onto finite-dimensional models. (2) Computational Impossibility: Verifying a policy's safety is coNP-complete, even for non-zero error tolerances. (3) Statistical Impossibility: The training data required for safety (abundant examples of rare disasters) is a logical contradiction and thus unobtainable. (4) Information-Theoretic Impossibility: Safety rules contain more incompressible, arbitrary information than any feasible network can store. (5) Dynamic Impossibility: The optimization process for increasing AI capability is actively hostile to safety, as the gradients for the two objectives are generally anti-aligned. Together, these results demonstrate that the pursuit of safe, highly capable AI is not a matter of overcoming technical hurdles, but of confronting fundamental, interlocking barriers. The paper concludes by presenting a strategic trilemma that these impossibilities force upon the field. A formal verification of the core theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Model-Checking Quantum Pushdown Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of model-checking quantum pushdown systems from a computational complexity point of view. We arrive at the following equally important, interesting new results:
  We first extend the notions of the {\it probabilistic pushdown systems} and {\it Markov chains} to their quantum analogues and investigate the question of whether it is necessary to define a quantum analogue of {\it probabilistic computational tree logic} to describe the probabilistic and branching-time properties of the {\it quantum Markov chain}. We study its model-checking question and show that model-checking of {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems (qBPA)} against {\it probabilistic computational tree logic (PCTL)} is generally undecidable, i.e., there exists no algorithm for model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\it probabilistic computational tree logic}.
  We then study in which case there exists an algorithm for model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} and show that the problem of model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\it bounded probabilistic computational tree logic} (bPCTL) is decidable, and further show that this problem is in $NP$-complete. Our reduction is from the {\it bounded Post Correspondence Problem} for the first time, a well-known $NP$-complete problem.</description>
