      <title>On estimates for the discrete eigenvalues of two-dimensional quantum waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give upper estimates for the number and sum of eigenvalues below the bottom of the essential spectrum counting multiplicities of quantum waveguides in two dimensions. We consider both straight and curved waveguides of constant width, and the estimates are presented in terms of norms of the potential. For curved quantum waveguide, we assume that the waveguide is not self-intersecting and its curvature is a continuous and bounded function on R. The estimates are new, particularly for the case of curved quantum waveguides and this opens a window for their extension to different configurations such as waveguides with local defamations.</description>

      <title>On an infinitesimal Polyakov formula for genus zero polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a genus zero compact polyhedral surface (the Riemann sphere equipped with a flat conical metric $m$). We derive the variational formulas for the determinant of the Laplacian, ${\rm det}\,\Delta^m$, on $X$ under infinitesimal variations of the positions of the conical points and the conical angles (i. e. infinitesimal variations of $X$ in the class of polyhedra with the same number of vertices). Besides having an independent interest, this derivation may serve as a somewhat belated mathematical counterpart of the well-known heuristic calculation of ${\rm det}\,\Delta^m$ performed by Aurell and Salomonson in the 90-s.</description>

      <title>Universal Methods for Nonlinear Spectral Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear spectral problems arise across a range of fields, including mechanical vibrations, fluid-solid interactions, and photonic crystals. Discretizing infinite-dimensional nonlinear spectral problems often introduces significant computational challenges, particularly spectral pollution and invisibility, which can distort or obscure the true underlying spectrum. We present the first general, convergent computational method for computing the spectra and pseudospectra of nonlinear spectral problems. Our approach uses new results on nonlinear injection moduli and requires only minimal continuity assumptions: specifically, continuity with respect to the gap metric on operator graphs, making it applicable to a broad class of problems. We use the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) hierarchy, which has recently been used to resolve the classical linear problem, to systematically classify the computational complexity of nonlinear spectral problems. Our results establish the optimality of the method and reveal that Hermiticity does not necessarily simplify the computational complexity of these nonlinear problems. Comprehensive examples -- including nonlinear shifts, Klein--Gordon equations, wave equations with acoustic boundary conditions, time-fractional beam equations, and biologically inspired delay differential equations -- demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and broad applicability of our methodology.</description>

      <title>Sombor index and eigenvalues of weakly zero-divisor graph of commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weakly zero-divisor graph $W\Gamma(R)$ of a commutative ring $R$ is the simple undirected graph whose vertices are nonzero zero-divisors of $R$ and two distinct vertices $x$, $y$ are adjacent if and only if there exist $w\in {\rm ann}(x)$ and $ z\in {\rm ann}(y)$ such that $wz =0$. In this paper, we determine the Sombor index for the weakly zero-divisor graph of the integers modulo ring $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Furthermore, we investigate the Sombor spectrum and establish bounds for the Sombor energy of the weakly zero-divisor graph of $\mathbb{Z}_n$.</description>

      <title>A Rellich-type theorem for the Helmholtz equation in a junction of stratified media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that there are no non-zero square-integrable solutions to a two-dimensional Helmholtz equation in some unbounded inhomogeneous domains which represent junctions of stratified media. More precisely, we consider domains that are unions of three half-planes, where each half-plane is stratified in the direction orthogonal to its boundary. As for the well-known Rellich uniqueness theorem for a homogeneous exterior domain, our result does not require any boundary condition. Our proof is based on half-plane representations of the solution which are derived through a generalization of the Fourier transform adapted to stratified media. A byproduct of our result is the absence of trapped modes at the junction of open waveguides as soon as the angles between branches are greater than $\pi$/2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a relativistic version of the non-self-adjoint operator obtained by a dilation analytic transformation of the quantum harmonic oscillator. While the spectrum is real and discrete, we show that the eigenfunctions do not form a basis and that the pseudospectra are highly non-trivial.</description>

      <title>Analytic Microlocal Bohr-Sommerfeld Expansions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is devoted to Gevrey-analytic estimates in ___, of the Bohr-Sommerfeld expansion of the eigenvalues of self-adjoint pseudo-differential operators acting on L^2(R) in the regular case. We consider an interval of energies in which the spectrum of P is discrete and such that the energy sets are regular connected curves. Under some assumptions on the holomorphy of the symbol p, we will use the isometry between L^2(R) and the Bargmann space to obtain an exponentially sharp description of the spectrum in the energy window . More precisely it is possible to build exponentially sharp WKB quasimodes in the Bargmann space. A precise examination of the principal symbols will provide an interpretation to the Maslov correction $\pi$___ in the Bargmann space.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandomness of the Sticky Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the pseudorandomness of random walks on expander graphs using the sticky random walk. Building on prior works, it was recently shown that expander random walks can fool all symmetric functions in total variation distance (TVD) upto an $O(\lambda(\frac{p}{\min f})^{O(p)})$ error, where $\lambda$ is the second largest eigenvalue of the expander, $p$ is the size of the arbitrary alphabet used to label the vertices, and $\min f = \min_{b\in[p]} f_b$, where $f_b$ is the fraction of vertices labeled $b$ in the graph. Golowich and Vadhan conjecture that the dependency on the $(\frac{p}{\min f})^{O(p)}$ term is not tight. In this paper, we resolve the conjecture in the affirmative for a family of expanders. We present a generalization of the sticky random walk for which Golowich and Vadhan predict a TVD upper bound of $O(\lambda p^{O(p)})$ using a Fourier-analytic approach. For this family of graphs, we use a combinatorial approach involving the Krawtchouk functions to derive a strengthened TVD of $O(\lambda)$. Furthermore, we present equivalencies between the generalized sticky random walk, and, using linear-algebraic techniques, show that the generalized sticky random walk parameterizes an infinite family of expander graphs.</description>

      <title>Spectral Multipliers II: Elliptic and Parabolic Operators and Bochner-Riesz Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish estimates for the Poisson kernel, the heat kernel, and Bochner--Riesz means defined in terms of $H=-\Delta+V$, where $V$ is a possibly large rough real-valued scalar potential and $H$ can have negative eigenvalues. All results are in three space dimensions.
  We eliminate several unnecessary conditions on $V$, leaving just $V \in \mathcal K_0$, meaning that $V$ is locally integrable and $(-\Delta)^{-1}|V|$ is bounded.
  For the spectral multiplier bounds, we assume that $H$ has no zero or positive energy bound states. For $V \in \mathcal K_0$, we prove that $H$ has at most a finite number of negative bound states. If in addition $V \in \dot W^{-1/4, 4/3}$, then by [GoSc] and [KoTa] there are no positive energy bound states.</description>

      <title>The Resonance Bias Framework: Resonance, Structure, and Arithmetic in Quadrature Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the trapezoidal rule for periodic functions on uniform grids and show that the quadrature error exhibits a rich deterministic structure, beyond traditional asymptotic or statistical interpretations. Focusing on the prototype function f(x) = sin^2(2 pi k x), we derive an analytical expression for the error governed by a resonance function chi_P(y), closely related to the Dirichlet kernel, roots of unity, and discrete Fourier analysis on the group Z/PZ. This function acts as a spectral filter, connecting the integration error to arithmetic properties such as k/P and geometric phase cancellation, visualized as vector averaging on the unit circle. We introduce the Resonance Bias Framework (RBF), a generalization to arbitrary smooth periodic functions, leading to the error representation B_P[f] = sum_{k != 0} c_k chi_P(k/P). Although this is mathematically equivalent to the classical aliasing sum, it reveals a deeper mechanism: the quadrature error arises from structured resonance rather than random aliasing noise. The RBF thus provides an interpretable framework for understanding integration errors at finite resolution, grounded in number theory and geometry.</description>
