      <title>The Hubble's Law in Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolution of the "microscopic" Hubble parameter related to the expansion of matter born in heavy ion collisions is obtained for nucleons and pions. Calculations are done within PHSD transport model. Au+Au collisions with $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.8$ GeV at $b~=~2.5,\ 5.0,\ 7.5$ and $10.0$ fm are considered. A new method for determination the "microscopic" Hubble parameter from simulated data is used. The ballistic motion is obtained for the longitudinal direction after separation out of the nuclei. At earlier times the evolution of the "microscopic" Hubble parameter in this direction is more complicated. For transverse directions, an exponential low-time asymptotics of the Hubble parameter is observed. The obtained values of the "microscopic" Hubble parameter are $\sim 40$ orders of magnitude higher, than the cosmological Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>An Undergraduate Approach to the Quantum Hadrodynamics and the Physics of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this tutorial, I discuss how to model a neutron star from the Quantum Hadrodynamics microscopic approach. After a brief discussion about hydrostatic equilibrium, I discuss the role of each meson of the model and how to calculate the corresponding equation of state and the expected values. Each meson is introduced individually. Its effects are analyzed from both an analytical and a numerical point of view. To explicitly show the effects of a given meson, the coupling constant is varied in an arbitrary range before being fixed to reproduce well-known constraints. This work is intended for late undergraduate students as well as early graduate students. The equation of states is obtained from the statistical mechanics formalism, which is more familiar to students at this stage of their research career, instead of the traditional quantum field theory formalism.</description>

      <title>Probing Dynamical Electrical Conductivity via Dilepton Emission: A Kinetic theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dileptons serve as a clean and penetrating probe of the Quark--Gluon Plasma created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. In this work, we investigate thermal dilepton spectra and their elliptic flow through the dynamical conductivity that governs the production rate. The conductivity is obtained from the trace of the spectral function within relativistic kinetic theory using the Relaxation Time Approximation. This allows us to derive for the first time an analytical expression for the dilepton rate with explicit dependence on the relaxation time of quark-antiquark interactions. We find a non-monotonic dependence of the dilepton rate on the relaxation time and compare the resulting transverse momentum, invariant mass spectra and elliptic flow with previous quantum field theory results. The spectra and elliptic flow are obtained by integrating the rate over the full spacetime volume of the evolving medium, using temperature and flow profiles from realistic MUSIC hydrodynamic simulations without considering the effect of magnetic fields in the profiles itself. However, we study the role of an external space-time dependent magnetic field by making the conductivity anisotropic. At small relaxation times, magnetic fields have negligible impact, while for larger relaxation times and stronger initial fields, modifications of up to $\sim$20\% appear in both spectra and elliptic flow. Assuming instead a constant magnetic field of $\sim 1\,m_{\pi}^2$ at large relaxation times yields more modest effects, with changes of about 10\% in spectra and 5\% in elliptic flow.</description>

      <title>Properties of Isoscalar Giant Multipole Resonances in medium-mass one-closed-shell nuclei: A semi-microscopic description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semi-microscopic particle-hole dispersive optical model, having unique abilities in describing main properties of various giant resonances in medium-heavy-mass spherical nuclei, is applied to a number of Isoscalar Giant Multipole Resonances in one-closed-shell nuclei 58Ni, 120Sn, and 142Nd. Some of the calculation results are compared with respective experimental data, including those obtained just recently. Special attention is paid to a comparison of calculated isoscalar multipole strength functions with the respective experimental strength distributions in a wide excitation-energy interval.</description>

      <title>Effects of Geometric configuration in relativistic isobaric collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a study on the effects of nuclear deformation ($\beta_2$,$\beta_3$) and surface diffuseness ($a$) on the charged hadron multiplicity ($N_{\mathrm{ch}}$) and elliptic flow ($v_2$), obtained in symmetric isobaric collisions of ${}^{96}_{44}\mathrm{Ru} + {}^{96}_{44}\mathrm{Ru}$ and ${}^{96}_{40}\mathrm{Zr} + {}^{96}_{40}\mathrm{Zr}$. The two extreme configurations (tip-tip and body-body) were used to determine the correlation between the final state observables and initial geometry using the HYDJET++ model. The octupole deformation parameter ($\beta_3$) enhances $N_{\mathrm{ch}}$ in central tip-tip Zr+Zr collisions and suppresses it in peripheral ones. In mid-central to peripheral body-body Zr+Zr collisions, $\beta_3$ leads to a reduction in charged hadron production. Surface-diffuseness ($a$), along with quadrapole deformation ($\beta_2$), also shows a significant impact on multiplicity and elliptic flow. The octupole deformation enhances elliptic flow in Zr's body-body collisions. Results are compared with the STAR blind-analysis data where available.</description>

      <title>Probing In-Medium Effect via Giant Dipole Resonance in the Extended Quantum Molecular Dynamics Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article uses a stochastic approach to analyze the collision term, rather than the geometric method used in the original EQMD model, to examine the width of the isovector giant dipole resonance (GDR) in ${}^{208}$Pb. Based on the ``soft" EQMD model, the response and strength functions are self-consistently determined for various symmetry energy coefficient and in-medium reduction factor values. The results confirm that the peak position and GDR width in ${}^{208}$Pb are highly sensitive to the symmetry energy and the in-medium nucleon-nucleon ({\it NN}) cross section. This provides an opportunity to study the nuclear equation of state (EoS) and the medium effect. A significant reduction in free {\it NN} elastic cross sections within the medium is necessary to accurately reproduce the GDR width, as demonstrated by a comparison with evaluation data.</description>

      <title>Validity of relativistic hydrodynamics beyond local equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the applicability of relativistic hydrodynamics far from equilibrium by constructing formal solutions of the Boltzmann moment equations in the relaxation time approximation. These solutions naturally decompose into a divergent gradient series and exponentially decaying non-perturbative modes that encode initial conditions. The non-perturbative contributions are essential for understanding causality, the divergence of the gradient series, and the unexpected effectiveness of relativistic hydrodynamics far from equilibrium.
  In the 0+1D Bjorken scenario, we demonstrate that the exact evolution of non-equilibrium terms shares the same structural form as the gradient expansion, differing only through modified transport coefficients that reflect both initial data and free-streaming dynamics. Extending to 3+1D, we find that hydrodynamics remains effective not because the system is close to equilibrium, but because it interpolates smoothly between free streaming and collective behavior. This perspective offers a natural explanation for the remarkable success of hydrodynamics in modeling quark-gluon plasma evolution.</description>

      <title>Assessing Convergence Patterns Across Modern Nucleon-Nucleon Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BUQEYE model for correlated effective field theory (EFT) truncation errors assumes a regular pattern of dimensionless coefficients extracted from order-by-order observable calculations. This enables results from lower orders to inform statistical predictions for error estimates of omitted higher orders. We test the model for multiple chiral EFT ($\chi$EFT) nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials using a suite of six common NN scattering observables represented as functions of relative momentum and scattering angle. First, we flag irregularity in the convergence patterns of potentials with so-called "soft" regulator scales, namely that the sizes of the coefficients in the observables' expansions are mismatched between the even and odd orders. Second, we test the BUQEYE model's assumption of Gaussian process (GP) stationarity against the data and find that the GP's correlation structure as encoded in its length scale is nonstationary: The GP length scale in the angular dimension $\ell_{\theta}$ is approximately inversely proportional to the relative momentum of the scattering process. After we remediate this issue by allowing $\ell_{\theta}$ to vary with momentum, diagnostics show significant improvement, validating the application of the BUQEYE model after this modification. Third, we find that good performance of the BUQEYE model relies on properly choosing the $\chi$EFT breakdown scale $\Lambda_{b}$. With $m_{\text{eff}}$ held fixed at the physical pion mass we find $\Lambda_{b}=600$--$750$ MeV for various N$^{3}$LO interactions. Statistically consistent distributions for $\Lambda_{b}$ across orders are only found for the SMS potential at a regulator scale of 450 or 500 MeV. All our results can be reproduced using a publicly available Jupyter notebook, which can be straightforwardly modified to analyze other $\chi$EFT NN potentials.</description>

      <title>Stationary States for Fermions in an External Electric Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a relativistic analysis of fermions in an external electric field by non-perturbatively solving the Dirac equation with a static gauge. Different from the magnetic field effect, the fermion wave function in an electric field oscillates asymptotically, which reflects the Klein paradox in the relativistic case and results in the absence of bound states in an infinite system. For a confined fermion, the confinement is gradually canceled by the electric field, and the fermion becomes deconfined when the electric coupling is stronger than the confinement coupling. However, a fermion in an electric field can be confined to a finite system by applying the MIT bag boundary condition, namely, the disappearing normal component of the probability current at the boundary. The result of this work can be applied to the physics of relativistic heavy ion collisions, where the strongest electric field in nature is expected to be created.</description>

      <title>New shell-model calculations of the $\delta_C$ correction to superallowed $0^+\rightarrow0^+$ nuclear $\beta$ decay and standard-model implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refined calculations of the radial mismatch correction, $\delta_{C2}$, to superallowed $0^+\rightarrow0^+$ nuclear $\beta$ decay are performed using the shell model with realistic Woods-Saxon radial wave functions. Two important improvements are introduced: i) charge radii used to constrain the length parameter are evaluated within a generalized formula, where proton occupation numbers are substituted by sums of spectroscopic factors, while radial wave functions are required to match separation energies with respect to the intermediate $(A-1)$-nucleon states by adjusting parameters such as the potential depth; ii) configuration mixing wave functions and energies for many-particle states are obtained through the diagonalization of well-established effective interactions in large configuration spaces without truncation. Furthermore, a variation of $\pm0.1$\,fm in the surface diffuseness parameter is now incorporated as a source of uncertainty. The present results are generally in fairly good agreement with those from previous studies. As an exception, the $\delta_{C2}$ value obtained for $^{18}$Ne is smaller by approximately a factor of two, principally due to the updated charge-radius treatment. A reduction is also observed in most cases with $A\ge38$, through the deviations generally remain within the newly assigned error bars. The smaller isospin-mixing counterpart, $\delta_{C1}$, is strongly interaction-dependent, roughly following an inverse-square law with respect to the energy separation between the lowest admixed levels. Therefore, an additional procedure to ensure isobaric displacements within the isospin multiplets appears to be indispensable. Our results for $\delta_{C2}$ lead to a new averaged $\overline{\mathcal{F}t}$ value of $3073.11(99)_{stat}(36)_{\delta_R'}(173)_{\delta_{NS}}$~s with $\chi^2/\nu=0.624$. The corresponding $|V_{ud}|$ value is 0.97359(33).</description>

      <title>Two-flavored heavy mesons' nuclear bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the $B_c$- and $B_s$-nucleus bound state energies and coordinate space radial wave functions by solving the Klein-Gordon equation in momentum space. The attractive strong potentials for the $B_c$ and $B_s$ mesons in nuclei are calculated from the respective mass shifts of these mesons in nuclear matter using a local density approximation. This negative mass shift may be regarded as a signature of partial restoration of chiral symmetry in medium in an empirical sense, because the origin of the negative mass shift in the present study is not directly related to the chiral symmetry mechanism.</description>

      <title>$r$-process Heating Feedback on Disk Outflows from Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron star mergers produce $r$-process elements, with yields that are sensitive to the kinematic and thermodynamic properties of the ejecta. These ejecta properties are potentially affected by dynamically-important feedback from $r$-process heating, which is usually not coupled to the hydrodynamics in post-merger simulations modeling the ejecta launching and expansion. The multi-messenger detection of GW170817 showed the importance of producing reliable ejecta predictions, to maximize the diagnostic potential of future events. In this paper, we develop a prescription for including $r$-process heating as a source term in the hydrodynamic equations. This prescription depends on local fluid properties and on the $Y_{e}$ history as recorded by dedicated tracer particles, which exchange information with the grid using the Cloud-in-Cell method. The method is implemented in long-term viscous hydrodynamic simulations of accretion disk outflows to investigate its feedback on ejecta properties. We find that $r$-process heating can increase the unbound disk ejecta mass by $\sim 10\%$ relative to a baseline case that only considers alpha particle recombination. Nuclear heating also enhances the radial velocity of the ejecta with $Y_e &lt; 0.25$ by up to a factor of two, while concurrently suppressing marginally-bound convective ejecta.</description>

      <title>A Journey of Seeking Pressures and Forces in the Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested by M. Polyakov et al. that the QCD momentum current density (MCD) $T^{ij}$ in the nucleon, characterized by the form factor $C/D$ of the QCD energy-momentum tensor, can be interpreted as the pressure and shear force distributions inside the nucleon because its interior seems to approximate a continuous mechanical medium. By examining the physics content of MCDs in various classical and quantum systems, we find that momentum current flow originates from both kinetic motion of particles and forces between them, and furthermore, the forces alone cannot determine the interaction MCDs unambiguously, same as the interaction energy potentials and consistent with Noether's theorem. Only in special cases where there are short-range forces between different elements of a system, or short-range interactions with external boundaries that result in discontinuities of MCDs, can the relevant components be interpreted as surface forces, i.e., mechanical pressures and shear forces. For the nucleon in QCD, the range of quark and gluon interactions is comparable to its size and far from short, and we fail to identify any interaction component of the MCD as pressure/shear forces between different parts of the nucleon, nor the total through the form factor $C/D$ which merely depicts the total momentum flux seen through gravity. Following our previous study of the forces through divergences of kinetic MCDs, we affirm that the gluon scalar field in the QCD trace anomaly provides a confining force potential on the quarks, with a strength consistent with that between heavy quarks.</description>

      <title>Baryon Electric Charge Correlation as QCD Magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of strong magnetic fields in peripheral heavy-ion collisions is crucial for observing effects such as the chiral magnetic effect but has proven exceptionally difficult. To address this, we propose the baryon electric charge correlation $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ and the chemical potential ratio $\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$ as sensitive probes of magnetic fields, based on (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations at the physical pion mass. Along the transition line, $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ and $(\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B})_{\rm LO}$ in Pb-Pb collisions increase by factors of 2.1 and 2.4 at $eB \simeq 8M_\pi^2$, respectively. To bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observables, we implement systematic kinematic cuts that emulate detector acceptances of the STAR and ALICE experiments within the hadron resonance gas model. This allows us to construct experimentally relevant proxy observables. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $(\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B})_{\rm LO}$ is also sensitive to the collision system, showing a $1.5$-fold increase from Zr-Zr to Ru-Ru isobar collisions. Our findings offer new insights into thermo-magnetic effects and provide experimentally relevant guidance for the detection of magnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous breaking of global U(1) symmetry in an interacting Bose gas under rigid rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of rigid rotation on the spontaneous breaking of U(1) symmetry in a Bose gas, which is described by a self-interacting complex scalar field Lagrangian. Rigid rotation is introduced through a specific metric that explicitly depends on the angular velocity $\Omega$. We begin by determining the free propagator for this model at finite temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu$. Using this propagator, we calculate the thermodynamic potential in terms of an energy dispersion relation $\epsilon_{k}$. It is found that in both the U(1) symmetric phase and the symmetry-broken phase, two energy branches emerge. In the symmetry-broken phase, they are identified with a massive phonon and a massless roton mode. Notably, rotation does not alter $\epsilon_{k}$ at low momentum. Setting $\mu=0$, we use the total thermodynamic potential, which includes classical, thermal, vacuum, and nonperturbative ring contributions, to explore how the condensate depends on $T$ and $\Omega$. We first focus on the classical and thermal parts of the thermodynamic potential and find that the critical temperature of the U(1) phase transition scales as $\Omega^{1/3}$. By identifying the (pseudo-)Goldstone and non-Goldstone modes of this model with $\pi$ and $\sigma$ mesons, we calculate the $T$ and $\Omega$ dependence of masses $m_{\pi}$ and $m_{\sigma}$. We demonstrate that the Goldstone theorem holds only when the one-loop (thermal) corrections to $m_{\sigma}$ and $m_{\pi}$ are taken into account. We further explore the $T$ and $\Omega$ dependence of the condensate, determine the $\sigma$ dissociation temperatures for fixed $\Omega$, and compare them with the critical temperature of the phase transition. Additionally, we emphasize the role played by the nonperturbative ring potential, especially in altering the order of the phase transition with and without rotation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the sensitivity of neutrinoless double beta decays via combined multi-transition analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments, with projected half-life sensitivities approaching $10^{28}$ years, aim to fully probe the parameter space associated with the inverted neutrino mass ordering. However, this discovery potential remains uncertain, as it depends sensitively on the nuclear matrix element, which exhibits significant model dependence. In this work, we propose a novel strategy to enhance experimental sensitivity by performing a combined analysis of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay to both the ground state and the first excited $0^+$ state of the daughter nucleus. This approach is particularly promising for large liquid xenon detectors, such as the proposed PandaX-xT and XLZD experiments, which are capable of identifying decays of $^{136}$Xe to excited states with high efficiency. Our analysis demonstrates that such a combined multi-transition analysis can improve the sensitivity to $|m_{\beta\beta}|$ by more than a factor of two for a nominal xenon detector setup, and by up to an order of magnitude in an ideal scenario, potentially accelerating access to the entire inverted ordering regime. These findings underscore the importance of probing multiple decay channels simultaneously in future $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay searches to maximize discovery potential.</description>

      <title>An introduction to relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin polarization and spin transport are common phenomena in many quantum systems. Relativistic spin hydrodynamics provides an effective low-energy framework to describe these processes in quantum many-body systems. The fundamental symmetry underlying relativistic spin hydrodynamics is angular momentum conservation, which naturally leads to inter-conversion between spin and orbital angular momenta. This inter-conversion is a key feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics, closely related to entropy production and introducing ambiguity in the construction of constitutive relations. In this article, we present a pedagogical introduction to relativistic spin hydrodynamics. We demonstrate how to derive the constitutive relations by applying local thermodynamic laws and explore several distinctive aspects of spin hydrodynamics. These include the pseudo-gauge ambiguity, the behavior of the system in the presence of strong vorticity, and the challenges of modeling the freeze-out of spin in heavy-ion collisions. We also outline some future prospects for spin hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Refinement of an analytical capture cross section formula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An analytical formula with high accuracy is proposed for a systematic description of the capture cross sections at near-barrier energies from light to superheavy reaction systems. Based on the empirical barrier distribution (EBD) method, three key input quantities are refined by introducing nuclear surface correction to the Coulomb parameter $z$ for calculating the barrier height, incorporating the reaction $Q$-value and shell correction into the barrier distribution width calculations, and considering the deep inelastic scattering effects of superheavy systems on the barrier radius. With these refinements, not only the accuracy of the calculated barrier height but also the accuracy of the predicted capture cross sections, is substantially improved. The average deviation (in logarithmic scale) between the predicted cross sections and the experimental data for a total of 426 reaction systems with $ 35 &lt; Z_1 Z_2 &lt; 2600$ is sharply reduced from 3.485 to 0.113.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic spin distributions in multinucleon transfer reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-dependent covariant density functional theory (TD-CDFT) combined with angular momentum projection is developed and applied to study multinucleon transfer (MNT) reactions, with a focus on the intrinsic angular momentum distributions of the final fragments. Using the illustrative reaction $^{40}$Ca + $^{208}$Pb across a range of impact parameters, we find that the MNT process generates broad distributions of intrinsic spins. These distributions arise from the conversion of relative orbital angular momentum into intrinsic spin due to frictional interactions between the colliding nuclei. Additionally, mutual information (entanglement Shannon entropy) is employed to analyze correlations between the intrinsic spins of the fragments.</description>

      <title>Second-order spin hydrodynamics from Zubarev's nonequilibrium statistical operator formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Zubarev's nonequilibrium statistical operator formalism, we derive the second-order expression for the dissipative tensors in relativistic spin hydrodynamics, {\em viz.} rotational stress tensor ($\tau_{\mu\nu}$), boost heat vector ($q_\mu$), shear stress tensor ($\pi_{\mu\nu}$), and bulk viscous pressure ($\Pi$). The first two ($\tau_{\mu\nu}$ and $q_\mu$) emerge due to the inclusion of the antisymmetric part in the energy-momentum tensor, which, in turn, governs the conservation of spin angular momentum ($\Sigma^{\alpha\mu\nu}$). As a result, new thermodynamic forces, generated due to the antisymmetric part of $T_{\mu \nu}$, contain the spin chemical potential. In this work, we have also taken the spin density ($S^{\mu \nu}$) as an independent thermodynamic variable, in addition to the energy density and particle density, thereby resulting in two novel transport coefficients given by the correlation between spin density tensor and rotational stress tensor and vice versa. Additionally, the newly found terms in $\pi_{\mu\nu}$ and $\Pi$ are the artifacts of the new thermodynamic forces that arise due to the antisymmetric part of $T^{\mu \nu}$. Finally, we have derived the evolution equations for the aforesaid tensors: $\tau_{\mu\nu}$, $q_\mu$, $\pi_{\mu\nu}$, and $\Pi$.</description>

      <title>JuliaQCD: Portable lattice QCD package in Julia language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new lattice gauge theory code set JuliaQCD using the Julia language. Julia is well-suited for integrating machine learning techniques and enables rapid prototyping and execution of algorithms for four dimensional QCD and other non-Abelian gauge theories. The code leverages LLVM for high-performance execution and supports MPI for parallel computations. Julia's multiple dispatch provides a flexible and intuitive framework for development. The code implements existing algorithms such as Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC), many color and flavor, supports lattice fermions, smearing techniques, and full QCD simulations. It is designed to run efficiently across various platforms, from laptops to supercomputers, allowing for seamless scalability. The code set is currently available on GitHub https://github.com/JuliaQCD.</description>

      <title>Deep learning of phase transitions with minimal examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past several years, there have been many studies demonstrating the ability of deep neural networks to identify phase transitions in many physical systems, notably in classical statistical physics systems. One often finds that the prediction of deep learning methods trained on many ensembles below and above the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ behaves similarly to an order parameter, and this analogy has been successfully used to locate $T_{\rm c}$ and estimate universal critical exponents. In this work, we pay particular attention to the ability of a convolutional neural network to capture these critical parameters for the 2-$d$ Ising model when the network is trained on configurations at $T=0$ and $T=\infty$ only. We directly compare its output to the same network trained at multiple temperatures below and above $T_{\rm c}$ to gain understanding of how this extreme restriction of training data can impact a neural network's ability to classify phases. We find that the network trained on two temperatures is still able to identify $T_{\rm c}$ and $\nu$, while the extraction of $\gamma$ becomes more challenging.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20699v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</description>
