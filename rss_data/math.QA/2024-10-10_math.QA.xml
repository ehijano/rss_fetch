      <title>Skein Theory for Affine A Subfactor Planar Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kuperberg Program asks to find presentations of planar algebras and use these presentations to prove results about their corresponding categories purely diagrammatically. This program has been completed for index less than 4 and is ongoing research for index greater than 4. We give generators-and-relations presentations for the affine A subfactor planar algebras of index 4. Exclusively using the planar algebra language, we give new proofs to how many such planar algebras exist. Categories corresponding to these planar algebras are monoidally equivalent to cyclic pointed fusion categories. We give a proof of this by defining a functor yielding a monoidal equivalence between the two categories. The categories are also monoidally equivalent to a representation category of a cyclic subgroup of SU(2). We give a new proof of this fact, explicitly using the diagrammatic presentations found. This gives novel diagrammatics for these representation categories.</description>

      <title>Frobenius-Perron dimensions of conjugacy classes in fusion categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of how certain arithmetical conditions on the sizes of conjugacy classes of a finite group influence the group structure was extensively studied in the last decade. In this paper we study some analogue of these properties for fusion categories.</description>

      <title>Unitarity and strong graded locality of holomorphic vertex operator superalgebras with central charge at most 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that all nice holomorphic vertex operator superalgebras (VOSAs) with central charge at most 24 and with non-trivial odd part are unitary, apart from the hypothetical ones arising as fake copies of the shorter moonshine VOSA or of the latter tensorized with a real free fermion VOSA. Furthermore, excluding the ones with central charge 24 of glueing type III and with no real free fermion, we show that they are all strongly graded-local. In particular, they naturally give rise to holomorphic graded-local conformal nets. In total, we are able to prove that 910 of the 969 nice holomorphic VOSAs with central charge 24 and with non-trivial odd part are strongly graded-local, without counting hypothetical fake copies of the shorter moonshine VOSA tensorized with a real free fermion VOSA.</description>

      <title>$L$-function invariants for 3-manifolds and relations between generalized Bernoulli polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce $ L $-functions attached to negative definite plumbed manifolds as the Mellin transforms of homological blocks. We prove that they are entire functions and their values at $ s=0 $ are equal to the Witten--Reshetikhin--Turaev invariants by using asymptotic techniques developed by the author in the previous papers. We also prove that linear relations between special values at negative integers of some $ L $-functions, which are common generalizations of Hurwitz zeta functions, Barnes zeta functions and Epstein zeta functions.</description>

      <title>The Conjecture of Dixmier for the first Weyl algebra is true</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero, let $A_1=K[x][\partial ]$ be the first Weyl algebra. In this paper we prove that the Dixmier conjecture for the first Weyl algebra is true, i.e. each algebra endomorphism of the algebra $A_1$ is an automorphism.</description>

      <title>Kontsevich graphs act on Nambu--Poisson brackets, II. The tetrahedral flow is a coboundary in 4D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kontsevich constructed a map from suitable cocycles in the graph complex to infinitesimal deformations of Poisson bi-vector fields. Under the deformations, the bi-vector fields remain Poisson. We ask, are these deformations trivial, meaning, do they amount to a change of coordinates along a vector field? We examine this question for the tetrahedron, the smallest nontrivial suitable graph cocycle in the Kontsevich graph complex, and for the class of Nambu--Poisson brackets on $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  Within Kontsevich's graph calculus, we use dimension-specific micro-graphs, in which each vertex represents an ingredient of the Nambu--Poisson bracket. For the tetrahedron, Kontsevich knew that the deformation is trivial for $d = 2$ (1996). In 2020, Buring and the third author found that the deformation is trivial for $d = 3$. Building on these discoveries, we now establish that the deformation is trivial for $d = 4$.</description>

      <title>Floer homology and non-fibered knot detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove for the first time that knot Floer homology and Khovanov homology can detect non-fibered knots, and that HOMFLY homology detects infinitely many such knots; these theories were previously known to detect a mere six knots, all fibered. These results rely on our main technical theorem, which gives a complete classification of genus-1 knots in the 3-sphere whose knot Floer homology in the top Alexander grading is 2-dimensional. We discuss applications of this classification to problems in Dehn surgery which are carried out in two sequels. These include a proof that $0$-surgery characterizes infinitely many knots, generalizing results of Gabai from his 1987 resolution of the Property R Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Generalised Quantum Gates for Qudits and their Application in Quantum Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing with qudits, quantum systems with $d &gt; 2$ levels, offers a powerful extension beyond qubits, expanding the computational possibilities of quantum systems, allowing the simplification of the implementation of several algorithms and, possibly, providing a foundation for optimised error correction. In this work, we propose a novel formulation of qudit gates that is universally applicable for any number of levels $d$, without restrictions on the dimensionality. By extending the mathematical framework of quantum gates to arbitrary dimensions, we derive explicit gate operations that form a universal set for quantum computation on qudits of any size. We demonstrate the validity of our approach through the implementation of the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) for arbitrary $d$, verifying both the correctness and utility of our generalized gates. This novel methodology broadens the design space for quantum algorithms and fault-tolerant architectures, paving the way for advancements in qudit-based quantum computing.</description>
