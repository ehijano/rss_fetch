      <title>Fractional Newton-Raphson Method Accelerated with Aitken's Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08445</link>
      <description>arXiv:1804.08445v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the following document, we present a way to obtain the order of convergence of the Fractional Newton-Raphson (F N-R) method, which seems to have an order of convergence at least linearly for the case in which the order $\alpha$ of the derivative is different from one. A simplified way of constructing the Riemann-Liouville (R-L) fractional operators, fractional integral and fractional derivative, is presented along with examples of its application on different functions. Furthermore, an introduction to the Aitken's method is made and it is explained why it has the ability to accelerate the convergence of the iterative methods, to finally present the results that were obtained when implementing the Aitken's method in the F N-R method.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear system related to investment under uncertainty solved using the fractional pseudo-Newton method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.05412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonlinear algebraic equation system of two variables is numerically solved, which is derived from a nonlinear algebraic equation system of four variables, that corresponds to a mathematical model related to investment under conditions of uncertainty. The theory of investment under uncertainty scenarios proposes a model to determine when a producer must expand or close, depending on his income. The system mentioned above is solved using a fractional iterative method, valid for one and several variables, that uses the properties of fractional calculus, in particular the fact that the fractional derivatives of constants are not always zero, to find solutions of nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Fractional flow equations. A model for pressure deficit in an oil well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.09068v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a novel system of flow equations that models the pressure deficit of a reservoir considered as a triple continuous medium formed by the rock matrix, vugular medium and fracture. In non-conventional reservoirs, the velocity of the fluid particles is altered due to physical and chemical phenomena caused by the interaction of the fluid with the medium, this behavior is defined as anomalous. A more exact model can be obtained with the inclusion of the memory formalism concept that can be expressed through the use of fractional derivatives. Using Laplace transform of the Caputo fractional derivative and Bessel functions, a semi-analytical solution is reached in the Laplace space.</description>

      <title>Sets of fractional operators and numerical estimation of the order of convergence of a family of fractional fixed point methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.02088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering the large number of fractional operators that exist, and since it does not seem that their number will stop increasing soon at the time of writing this paper, it is presented for the first time, as far as the authors know, a simplified and compact way to work the fractional calculus through the classification of fractional operators using sets. This new way of working with fractional operators, which may be called as fractional calculus of sets, allows to generalize objects of the conventional calculus such as tensor operators, the diffusion equation, the heat equation, the Taylor series of a vector-valued function, and the fixed point method in several variables which allows to generate the method known as the fractional fixed point method. It is also shown that each fractional fixed point method that generates a convergent sequence has the ability to generate an uncountable family of fractional fixed point methods that generate convergent sequences. So, it is shown one way to estimate numerically the mean order of convergence of any fractional fixed point method in a region $\Omega$ through the problem of determining the critical points of a scalar function, and it is shown how to construct a hybrid fractional iterative method to determine the critical points of a scalar function.</description>

      <title>On the Lattice Ground State of Densely Packed Hard Ellipses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among lattice configurations of densely packed hard ellipses, Monte Carlo simulations are used to identify the so-called parallel and diagonal lattices as the two favourable states. The free energies of these two states are computed for several system sizes employing the Einstein Crystal method. An accurate calculation of the free energy difference between the two states reveals the parallel lattice as the state with lowest free energy. The origin of the entropic difference between the two states is further elucidated by assessing the roles of the translational and rotational degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Heating Induced Suppression of $d$-band Dominance in the Electronic Excitation Spectrum of Cuprum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of isochoric heating of solids by free electron lasers (FEL) and in situ diagnostics by X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) allows for measurements of material properties at warm dense matter (WDM) conditions relevant for astrophysics, inertial confinement fusion, and material science. In the case of metals, the FEL beam pumps energy directly into electrons with the lattice structure of ions being nearly unaffected. This leads to a unique transient state that gives rise to a set of interesting physical effects, which can serve as a reliable testing platform for WDM theories. In this work, we present extensive linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) results for the electronic dynamic structure factor of isochorically heated copper with a face-centered cubic lattice. At ambient conditions, the plasmon is heavily damped due to the presence of $d$-band excitations, and its position is independent of the wavenumber. In contrast, the plasmon feature starts to dominate the excitation spectrum and has a Bohm-Gross type plasmon dispersion for temperatures $T \geq 4~{\rm eV}$, where the quasi-free electrons in the interstitial region are in the WDM regime. In addition, we analyze the thermal changes in the $d$-band excitations and outline the possibility to use future XRTS measurements of isochorically heated copper as a controlled testbed for WDM theories.</description>

      <title>Shotgun crystal structure prediction using machine-learned formation energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stable or metastable crystal structures of assembled atoms can be predicted by finding the global or local minima of the energy surface defined on the space of the atomic configurations. Generally, this requires repeated first-principles energy calculations that are impractical for large systems, such as those containing more than 30 atoms in the unit cell. Here, we have made significant progress in solving the crystal structure prediction problem with a simple but powerful machine-learning workflow; using a machine-learning surrogate for first-principles energy calculations, we performed non-iterative, single-shot screening using a large library of virtually created crystal structures. The present method relies on two key technical components: transfer learning, which enables a highly accurate energy prediction of pre-relaxed crystalline states given only a small set of training samples from first-principles calculations, and generative models to create promising and diverse crystal structures for screening. Here, first-principles calculations were performed only to generate the training samples, and for the optimization of a dozen or fewer finally narrowed-down crystal structures. Our shotgun method proved to be computationally less demanding compared to conventional methods, which heavily rely on iterations of first-principles calculations, and achieved an exceptional prediction accuracy, reaching 92.2\% in a benchmark task involving the prediction of 90 different crystal structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial, frustrated synchronization and chimera-like states are expected to occur in Kuramoto-like models if the spectral dimension of the underlying graph is low: $d_s &lt; 4$. We provide numerical evidence that this really happens in case of the high-voltage power grid of Europe ($d_s &lt; 2$), a large human connectome (KKI113) and in case of the largest, exactly known brain network corresponding to the fruit-fly (FF) connectome ($d_s &lt; 4$), even though their graph dimensions are much higher, i.e.: $d^{EU}_g\simeq 2.6(1)$ and $d^{FF}_g\simeq 5.4(1)$, $d^{\mathrm{KKI113}}_g\simeq 3.4(1)$. We provide local synchronization results of the first- and second-order (Shinomoto) Kuramoto models by numerical solutions on the FF and the European power-grid graphs, respectively, and show the emergence of \red{chimera-like} patterns on the graph community level as well as by the local order parameters.</description>

      <title>Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N : A $\mathcal{O}(N)$ software for N-body integration in collisional and fragmenting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is a $N$-body software developed for the time-efficient integration of collisional and fragmenting systems of planetesimals or moonlets orbiting a central mass. It features a fragmentation model, based on crater scaling and ejecta models, able to realistically simulate a violent impact. The user of Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N can choose between four different built-in modules to compute self-gravity and detect collisions. One of these makes use of a mesh-based algorithm to treat mutual interactions in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time. Another module, much more efficient than the standard Barnes-Hut tree code, is a $\mathcal{O}(N)$ tree-based algorithm called FalcON. It relies on fast multipole expansion for gravity computation and we adapted it to collision detection as well. Computation time is reduced by building the tree structure using a three-dimensional Hilbert curve. For the same precision in mutual gravity computation, Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is found to be up to 25 times faster than the famous software REBOUND. Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is written entirely in the C language and only needs a C compiler to run. A python add-on, that requires only basic python libraries, produces animations of the simulations from the output files. The name Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N, reminding of a scorpion, comes from the French $N$-corps, meaning $N$-body, and from the mathematical notation $\mathcal{O}(N)$, due to the running time of the software being almost linear in the total number $N$ of moonlets. Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is designed for the study of accreting or fragmenting disks of planetesimal or moonlets. It detects collisions and computes mutual gravity faster than REBOUND, and unlike other $N$-body integrators, it can resolve a collision by fragmentation. The fast multipole expansions are implemented up to order six to allow for a high precision in mutual gravity computation.</description>

      <title>A new HOC scheme for computation of flow and heat transfer in nonuniform polar grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, a higher order compact (HOC) discretization is developed on the nonuniform polar grid. The discretization conceptualized using the unsteady convection-diffusion equation (CDE) is further extended to flow problems governed by the Navies-Stokes (N-S) equations as well as the Boussinesq equations. The scheme developed here combines the advantages of body-fitted mesh with grid clustering, thereby making it efficient to capture flow gradients on polar grids. The scheme carries a spatial convergence of order three with temporal order of convergence being almost two. Diverse flow problems are being investigated using the scheme. Apart from two verification studies we validate the scheme by time marching simulation for the benchmark problem of driven polar cavity and the problem of natural convection in the horizontal concentric annulus. In the process, a one-sided approximation for the Neumann boundary condition for vorticity is also presented. Finally, the benchmark problem of forced convection around a circular cylinder is tackled. The results obtained in this study are analyzed and compared with the well-established numerical and experimental data wherever available in the literature. The newly developed scheme is found to generate accurate solutions in each case.</description>

      <title>Electron-Tunnelling-Noise Programmable Random Variate Accelerator for Monte Carlo Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents an electron tunneling noise programmable random variate accelerator for accelerating the sampling stage of Monte Carlo simulations. We used the LiteX framework to generate a FemtoRV imfc RISC-V instruction set soft processor and deploy it on a Digilent Arty-100T FPGA development board. The RISC-V soft processor augmented with our programmable random variate accelerator achieves an average speedup of 8.70 times and a median speedup of 8.68 times for a suite of twelve different benchmark applications when compared to GNU Scientific Library software random number generation. These speedups are achievable because the benchmarks spend an average of 90.0 % of their execution time generating random samples. The results of the Monte Carlo benchmark programs run over the programmable random variate accelerator have an average Wasserstein distance of 1.48 times and a median Wasserstein distance of 1.41 times$that of the results produced by the GNU Scientific Library random number generators. The soft processor samples the electron tunneling noise source using the hardened XADC block in the FPGA. The flexibility of the LiteX framework allows for the deployment of any LiteX-supported soft processor with an electron tunneling noise programmable random variate accelerator on any LiteX-supported development board that contains an FPGA with an XADC.</description>
