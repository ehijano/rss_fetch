      <title>Uncertainty assessment of spatial dynamic microsimulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial dynamic microsimulations probabilistically project geographically referenced units with individual characteristics over time. Like any projection method, their outcomes are inherently uncertain and sensitive to multiple factors. However, such factors are rarely addressed. Applying variance-based sensitivity analysis to both direct and indirect effects within the employment module of the MikroSim model for Germany, we show that commonly considered sources of uncertainty, namely coefficient and parameter uncertainty, are less influential than qualitative modeling choices. Because dynamic microsimulations are inherently complex and are computationally intensive, it is crucial to consider potential factors of uncertainty and their influence on simulation outputs in order to more carefully design simulation setups and better communicate results. We find, that simple summary measures insufficiently capture overall model uncertainty and urge modelers to account for these broader sources when designing microsimulations and their results.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal Hawkes point processes: statistical inference and simulation strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal Hawkes point processes are a particularly interesting class of stochastic point processes for modeling self-exciting behavior, in which the occurrence of one event increases the probability of other events occurring. These processes are able to handle complex interrelationships between stochastic and deterministic components of spatio-temporal phenomena. However, despite its widespread use in practice, there is no common and unified formalism and every paper proposes different views of these stochastic mechanisms. With this in mind, we implement two simulation techniques and three unified, self-consistent inference techniques, which are widely used in the practical modeling of spatio-temporal Hawkes processes. Furthermore, we provide an evaluation of the practical performance of these methods, while providing useful code for reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Spatial and Temporal Autoregressive Effects using LASSO - An Example of Hourly Particulate Matter Concentrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an estimation procedure of spatial and temporal effects in spatiotemporal autoregressive panel data models using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996). We assume that the spatiotemporal panel is drawn from a univariate random process and that the data follows a spatiotemporal autoregressive process which includes a regressive term with space-/ time-varying exogenous regressor, a temporal autoregressive term and a spatial autoregressive term with an unknown weights matrix. The aim is to estimate this weight matrix alongside other parameters using a constraint penalised maximum likelihood estimator. Monte Carlo simulations showed a good performance with the accuracy increasing with an increasing number of time points. The use of the LASSO technique also consistently distinguishes between meaningful relationships (non-zeros) from those that are not (existing zeros) in both the spatial weights and other parameters. This regularised estimation procedure is applied to hourly particulate matter concentrations (PM10) in the Bavaria region, Germany for the years 2005 to 2020. Results show some stations with a high spatial dependency, resulting in a greater influence of PM10 concentrations in neighbouring monitoring stations. The LASSO technique proved to produce a sparse weights matrix by shrinking some weights to zero, hence improving the interpretability of the PM concentration dependencies across measurement stations in Bavaria</description>

      <title>Convex relaxation approaches for high dimensional optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a powerful tool in mathematics and data science but faces severe computational and statistical challenges in high dimensions. We propose convex relaxation approaches based on marginal and cluster moment relaxations that exploit locality and correlative sparsity in the distributions. These methods approximate high-dimensional couplings using low-order marginals and sparse moment statistics, yielding semidefinite programs that provide lower bounds on the OT cost with greatly reduced complexity. For Gaussian distributions with sparse correlations, we prove reductions in both computational and sample complexity, and experiments show the approach also works well for non-Gaussian cases. In addition, we demonstrate how to extract transport maps from our relaxations, offering a simpler and interpretable alternative to neural networks in generative modeling. Our results suggest that convex relaxations can provide a promising path for dimension reduction in high-dimensional OT.</description>

      <title>A Closed-Form Framework for Schr\"odinger Bridges Between Arbitrary Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Score-based generative models have recently attracted significant attention for their ability to generate high-fidelity data by learning maps from simple Gaussian priors to complex data distributions. A natural generalization of this idea to transformations between arbitrary probability distributions leads to the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem. However, SB solutions rarely admit closed-form expressios and are commonly obtained through iterative stochastic simulation procedures, which are computationally intensive and can be unstable. In this work, we introduce a unified closed-form framework for representing the stochastic dynamics of SB systems. Our formulation subsumes previously known analytical solutions including the Schr\"odinger F\"ollmer process and the Gaussian SB as specific instances. Notably, the classical Gaussian SB solution, previously derived using substantially more sophisticated tools such as Riemannian geometry and generator theory, follows directly from our formulation as an immediate corollary. Leveraging this framework, we develop a simulation-free algorithm that infers SB dynamics directly from samples of the source and target distributions. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach in two settings: (i) modeling developmental trajectories in single-cell genomics and (ii) solving image restoration tasks such as inpainting and deblurring. This work opens a new direction for efficient and scalable nonlinear diffusion modeling across scientific and machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Sharp detection of low-dimensional structure in probability measures via dimensional logarithmic Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional probability measures is an essential pre-processing step for efficient sampling. We introduce a method for identifying and approximating a target measure $\pi$ as a perturbation of a given reference measure $\mu$ along a few significant directions of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. The reference measure can be a Gaussian or a nonlinear transformation of a Gaussian, as commonly arising in generative modeling. Our method extends prior work on minimizing majorizations of the Kullback--Leibler divergence to identify optimal approximations within this class of measures. Our main contribution unveils a connection between the \emph{dimensional} logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) and approximations with this ansatz. Specifically, when the target and reference are both Gaussian, we show that minimizing the dimensional LSI is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence restricted to this ansatz. For general non-Gaussian measures, the dimensional LSI produces majorants that uniformly improve on previous majorants for gradient-based dimension reduction. We further demonstrate the applicability of this analysis to the squared Hellinger distance, where analogous reasoning shows that the dimensional Poincar\'e inequality offers improved bounds.</description>

      <title>Zeroes and Extrema of Functions via Random Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present methods that provide all zeroes and extrema of a function that do not require differentiation. Using point process theory, we are able to describe the locations of zeroes or maxima, their number, as well as their distribution over a given window of observation. The algorithms in order to accomplish the theoretical development are also provided, and they are exemplified using many illustrative examples, for real and complex functions.</description>
