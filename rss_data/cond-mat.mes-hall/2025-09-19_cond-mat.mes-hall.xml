      <title>Mixed Quantum-Classical Approaches to Spin Current and Polarization Dynamics in Chiral Molecular Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral molecular junctions offer a promising platform for realizing chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where spin filtering occurs without external magnetic fields. Here, we investigate spin transport in such junctions by combining quantum master equation (QME) methods for purely electronic dynamics with surface hopping (SH) and mean-field Ehrenfest (MF) approaches to incorporate electron-phonon coupling. Our results show that transient spin polarization arises but ultimately decays to zero at long times. We find that bias voltage, molecular length, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strongly influence the spin current dynamics: higher bias enhances spin current but reduces polarization, while longer molecules and stronger SOC amplify transient polarization. Including electron-phonon coupling modifies current-voltage characteristics, enhancing spin currents at intermediate bias but suppressing them at high bias, while leaving the polarization dynamics largely unchanged. These findings highlight the interplay between electronic and vibrational effects in CISS and provide guidance for designing molecular spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Theory of Sondheimer magneto-oscillations beyond semiclassical limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conducting films subjected to an out-of-plane magnetic field, electron motion along the field direction gives rise to conductance oscillations periodic in field intensity - a phenomenon known as Sondheimer oscillations. Traditionally, these oscillations were understood within the semiclassical framework of kinetic theory. However, their behavior in the quantum regime (i.e. at strong fields and weak disorder) remains unclear, particularly due to potential interference with quantum Shubnikov-de Haas magneto-oscillations. In this work, we develop a comprehensive theory of quantum magnetoconductivity oscillations in metallic films of finite thickness, fully capturing the interplay between the Sondheimer and Shubnikov-de Haas effects beyond the semiclassical limit. By treating surface scattering, in-plane Landau quantization, and dimensional confinement along the magnetic field direction on equal footing, we reveal an intricate hierarchy of oscillation patterns and characterize how their amplitudes and frequencies depend on various physical parameters. Our results pave the way for systematic characterization of thin metallic films with boundary-dominated transport properties.</description>

      <title>Density Dependence of the Phases of the $\nu = 1$ Integer Quantum Hall Plateau in Low Disorder Electron Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent magnetotransport measurements in low-disorder electron systems confined to GaAs/AlGaAs samples revealed that the $\nu = 1$ integer quantum Hall plateau is broken into three distinct regions. These three regions were associated with two phases with different types of bulk localization: the Anderson insulator is due to random quasiparticle localization, and the integer quantum Hall Wigner solid is due to pinning of a stiff quasiparticle lattice. We highlight universal properties of the $\nu = 1$ plateau: the structure of the stability diagram, the non-monotonic dependence of the activation energy on the filling factor, and the alignment of features of the activation energy with features of the stability regions of the different phases are found to be similar in three samples spanning a wide range of electron densities. We also discuss quantitative differences between the samples, such as the dependence of the onset temperature and the activation energy of the integer quantum Hall Wigner solid on the electron density. Our findings provide insights into the localization behavior along the $\nu = 1$ integer quantum Hall plateau in the low disorder regime.</description>

      <title>Laughlin charge pumping from interplay of chiral Dirac and chiral Majorana modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laughlin charge pumping has provided critical insights into the topological classification of individual materials, but remains largely unexplored in topological junctions. We explore Laughlin charge pumping in junctions composed of a chiral topological superconductor sandwiched between two quantum anomalous Hall insulators, driven by an adiabatically varying magnetic flux. Here, charge pumping can be mediated merely by chiral Dirac modes or by the interplay of chiral Dirac and chiral Majorana modes (CMMs). In the former case, a variation of one magnetic flux quantum induces the pumping of a unit charge, as the chiral Dirac mode accumulates the full flux-induced phase. In contrast, in the latter case, pumping a unit charge requires a variation of fractional magnetic flux quanta, determined by the device geometry and the parity of the number of enclosed superconducting vortices. This unique feature results from the charge-neutral and zero-momentum nature of zero-energy CMMs. Our work offers an experimentally viable pathway toward detecting CMMs and could also inspire further research into Laughlin charge or spin pumping in diverse topological junctions, which are now within experimental reach.</description>

      <title>Controlled Polarization Switch in a Polariton Josephson Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between a particle's spin and momentum -- known as spin-orbit (SO) coupling -- is the cornerstone of modern spintronics. In Bose-Einsten condensates of ultracold atoms, SO coupling can be implemented and precisely controlled experimentally; photonic systems, on the other hand, possess an intrinsic SO interaction due to the longitudinal-transverse splitting of the photon modes. In this work, we focus on such spinor, SO-coupled exciton-polariton condensates on a ring, where the strength of the synthetic magnetic field is controlled by the geometrical dimensions of the structure. Inspired by recent experiments, we investigate the dynamics of a weakly-nonlinear four-mode bosonic Josephson junction within this geometry. We discover a narrow parameter range in which the interplay of the tunneling dynamics with polariton-specific SO coupling leads to a new regime, with dynamical switching of the fluid's circular polarization degree to the opposite, along the entire ring or on just one of its halves. Our results demonstrate polariton condensates in ring configurations as excellent candidates for all-optical controllable spin-switch applications, with prospects for scalability and observing non-trivial polarization patterns.</description>

      <title>Emergent momentum-space topological pseudospin defects in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological defects are central to modern physics, from spintronics to photonics, due to their robustness and potential application in information processing. In this work, we discuss topological point defects that spontaneously emerge at the imaginary Fermi arcs (degeneracy lines) in momentum space of two-dimensional systems described by non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonians. In particular, we consider a generic non-Hermitian Dirac model and a phenomenological model describing hybrid light-matter quasiparticles - exciton polaritons hosted in an optical microcavity. In both cases, the eigenenergies of the system have both real and imaginary parts and form two distinct bands corresponding to two (pseudo-)spin states. We describe the trajectories of the point defects characterized by integer-valued topological winding (vorticity) analytically and show that the defects with opposite vorticity annihilate with each other in the fully gapped phases, but are protected from annihilation by the non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies (exceptional and hybrid points) in the gapless phases. We also suggest that the signatures of these defects can be experimentally measured in an exciton-polariton system.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Domain-Wall Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional magnetic textures, such as Hopfions, torons, and skyrmion tubes, possess rich geometric and topological structure, but their detailed energetics, deformation modes, and collective behavior are yet to be fully understood. In this work, we develop an effective geometric theory for general three-dimensional textures by representing them as embedded two-dimensional orientable domain-wall membranes. Using a local ansatz for the magnetization in terms of membrane coordinates, we integrate out the internal domain-wall profile to obtain a reduced two-dimensional energy functional. This functional captures the coupling between curvature, topology, and the interplay of micromagnetic energies, and is expressed in terms of a small set of soft-mode fields: the local wall thickness and in-plane magnetization angle. Additionally, we construct a local formula for the Hopf index which sheds light on the coupling between geometry and topology for nontrivial textures. We analyze the general properties of the theory and demonstrate its utility through the example of a flat membrane hosting a vortex as well as a toroidal Hopfion, obtaining analytic solutions for the wall thickness profile, associated energetics, and a confirmation of the Hopf index formula. The framework naturally extends to more complex geometries and can accommodate additional interactions such as Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, Zeeman, and other anisotropies, making it a versatile tool for exploring the interplay between geometry, topology, and micromagnetics in three-dimensional spin systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-photon coupling using circular double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a microwave spin-photon interface based on a circular double quantum dot, inspired by recent experimental observations of anisotropic g-factors and ring states in InAs nanowires. We develop an effective theoretical model capturing the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and the magnetic flux through the ring and show how ring states form at crossings of odd and even geometrical parity orbital states. Similar to bonding and antibonding states of conventional double quantum dots, the ring eigenstates can be changed into single dot states by detuning the dots, which enables a high degree of control over the system's properties. Applying a tilted magnetic field induces spin-charge hybridization which enables spin-photon coupling. For low disorder, the photons couple states of simultaneously (almost) opposite spin and angular momentum. With increasing disorder, the spin-photon coupling becomes analogous to the flopping mode mechanism of conventional double quantum dots where the spin is hybridized with the bonding and antibonding orbital states without angular momentum. We show that the system exhibits a second-order charge-noise sweet spot at a specific magnetic field angle, which lowers the system's sensitivity to dephasing while retaining a substantial spin-photon coupling strength. Moreover, the photon coupling mechanism can be switched off either electrically, by detuning to the single-dot regime, or magnetically, by rotating the field to disable the spin-charge hybridization.</description>

      <title>Layer-Dependent Spin Properties of Charge Carriers in Vertically Coupled Telecom Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin properties of charge carriers in vertically coupled InAs/InAlGaAs quantum dots grown by molecular beam epitaxy, emitting at telecom C-band wavelengths, with a silicon $\delta$-doped layer. Using time-resolved pump-probe Faraday ellipticity measurements, we systematically study single-, two-, and four-layer quantum dot (QD) configurations to quantify how vertical coupling affects key spin-coherence parameters. Our measurements reveal distinct layer-dependent effects: (1) Adding a second QD layer flips the resident charge from electrons to holes, consistent with optically induced electron tunneling into lower-energy dots and resultant hole charging. (2) Starting from the four-layer sample, the pump-probe signal develops an additional non-oscillating, decaying component absent in single- and two-layer samples, attributed to multiple layer growth changing the strain environment, which reduces heavy-hole and light-hole mixing. (3) With four-layers or more, hole spin mode locking (SML) can be observed, enabling quantitative extraction of the hole coherence time $T_2 \approx 13$\,ns from SML amplitude saturation. We also extract longitudinal spin relaxation ($T_1$) and transverse ($T_2^*$) spin dephasing times, g-factors, and inhomogeneous dephasing parameters for both electrons and holes across all layer configurations. The hole spin dephasing times $T_2^*$ remain relatively constant (2.26-2.73\,ns) across layer counts, while longitudinal relaxation times $T_1$ decrease with increasing layers (from 1.03\,$\mu$s for single-layer to 0.31\,$\mu$s for four-layer samples). These findings provide potential design guidelines for engineering spin coherence in telecom-band QDs for quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Sub-tesla on-chip nanomagnetic metamaterial platform for angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetically controlled states in quantum materials are central to their unique electronic and magnetic properties. However, direct momentum-resolved visualization of these states via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has been hindered by the disruptive effect of magnetic fields on photoelectron trajectories. Here, we introduce an \textit{in-situ} method that is, in principle, capable of applying magnetic fields up to 1 T. This method uses substrates composed of nanomagnetic metamaterial arrays with alternating polarity. Such substrates can generate strong, homogeneous, and spatially confined fields applicable to samples with thicknesses up to the micron scale, enabling ARPES measurements under magnetic fields with minimal photoelectron trajectory distortion. We demonstrate this minimal distortion with ARPES data taken on monolayer graphene. Our method paves the way for probing magnetic field-dependent electronic structures and studying field-tunable quantum phases with state-of-the-art energy-momentum resolutions.</description>

      <title>Zero Indirect Band Gap in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero indirect gaps in band models are typically viewed as unstable and achievable only through fine-tuning. Recent works, however, have revealed robust semimetallic phases in Hermitian systems where the indirect gap remains pinned at zero over a finite parameter range. Here, we extend this paradigm to non-Hermitian lattice models by studying a one-dimensional diamond-like system with gain and loss. We show that a zero indirect band gap can remain stable against non-Hermitian perturbations and identify the regimes where this robustness persists. Remarkably, we find that the zero indirect gap induces a suppression of the non-Hermitian skin effect distinct from other physical mechanics already discussed in the literature. Our results reveal new connections between indirect gaps, exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effect, opening avenues for experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Bichromatic Moir\'{e} Superlattices for Tunable Quadrupolar Trions and Correlated States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'{e} superlattices in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures provide a platform to engineer many-body interactions. Here, we realize a bichromatic moir\'{e} superlattice in an asymmetric WSe$_2$/WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterotrilayer by combining R- and H-stacked bilayers with mismatched moir\'{e} wavelengths. This structure hosts fermionic quadrupolar moir\'{e} trions--interlayer excitons bound to an opposite-layer hole--with vanishing dipole moments. These trions arise from hybridized moir\'{e} potentials enabling multiple excitonic orbitals with tunable interlayer coupling, allowing control of excitonic and electronic ground states. We show that an out-of-plane electric field could effectively reshape moir\'{e} excitons and interlayer-intralayer electron correlations, driving a transition from interlayer to intralayer Mott states with enhanced Coulomb repulsion. The asymmetric stacking further enriches excitonic selection rules, broadening opportunities for spin-photon engineering. Our results demonstrate bichromatic moir\'{e} superlattices as a reconfigurable platform for emergent quantum states, where quadrupolar moir\'{e} trion emission may enable coherent and entangled quantum light manipulation.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Discovery of Topological Conductors for Nanoscale Interconnects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sharp increase in resistivity of copper interconnects at ultra-scaled dimensions threatens the continued miniaturization of integrated circuits. Topological semimetals (TSMs) with gapless surface states (Fermi arcs) provide conduction channels resistant to localization. Here we develop an efficient computational framework to quantify 0K surface-state transmission in nanowires derived from Wannier tight-binding models of topological conductors that faithfully reproduce relativistic density functional theory results. Sparse matrix techniques enable scalable simulations incorporating disorder and surface roughness, allowing systematic materials screening across sizes, chemical potentials, and transport directions. A dataset of 3000 surface transmission values reveals TiS, ZrB$_{2}$, and nitrides AN where A=(Mo, Ta, W) as candidates with conductance matching or exceeding copper and benchmark TSMs NbAs and NbP. This dataset further supports machine learning models for rapid interconnect compound identification. Our results highlight the promise of topological conductors in overcoming copper's scaling limits and provide a roadmap for data-driven discovery of next-generation interconnects.</description>

Abstract: We propose the Semiconductor-Quantum-Well Axion Radiometer Experiment ($\texttt{SQWARE}$) -- a new experimental platform for direct detection of axion dark matter in the meV mass range -- based on resonantly enhanced axion-photon conversion through the inverse Primakoff effect in engineered quantum semiconductor heterostructures. The core of the radiometer is a GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well structure forming a magnetoplasmonic cavity, containing an ultrahigh-mobility two-dimensional electron gas, which realizes a tunable epsilon-near-zero resonance in the terahertz frequency range. By controlling the orientation of the cavity within a strong external magnetic field, both the resonance frequency and the axion-induced current are optimized $\textit{in situ}$, enabling efficient scanning across a broad mass range without complex mechanical adjustment. The axion-induced electromagnetic signal radiatively emitted from the magnetoplasmonic cavity is detected by a state-of-the-art photodetector. We present the theoretical basis for resonant enhancement, detail the experimental design and benchmarks through extensive simulations, and project the sensitivity of $\texttt{SQWARE}$ for several realistic configurations. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{SQWARE}$ can probe the well-motivated quantum chromodynamics axion parameter space and close a critical gap in direct searches at meV masses.</description>

      <title>Coherent Control of Quantum-Dot Spins with Cyclic Optical Transitions</title>

Abstract: Solid-state spins are promising as interfaces from stationary qubits to single photons for quantum communication technologies. Semiconductor quantum dots have excellent optical coherence, exhibit near unity collection efficiencies when coupled to photonic structures, and possess long-lived spins for quantum memory. However, the incompatibility of performing optical spin control and single-shot readout simultaneously has been a challenge faced by almost all solid-state emitters. To overcome this, we leverage light-hole mixing to realize a highly asymmetric lambda system in a negatively charged heavy hole exciton in Faraday configuration. By compensating GHz-scale differential Stark shifts, induced by unequal coupling to Raman control fields, and by performing nuclear-spin cooling, we achieve quantum control of an electron-spin qubit with a $\pi$-pulse contrast of 97.4% while preserving spin-selective optical transitions with a cyclicity of 409. We demonstrate this scheme for both GaAs and InGaAs quantum dots, and show that it is compatible with the operation of a nuclear quantum memory. Our approach thus enables repeated emission of indistinguishable photons together with qubit control, as required for single-shot readout, photonic cluster-state generation, and quantum repeater technologies.</description>

Abstract: Electrons bound to the surface of superfluid helium have been proposed for scalable charge and spin-based quantum computing. However single electron quantum measurement in this system has remained elusive. Here we use a hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamic (cQED) device that comprises a quantum dot and a high-impedance superconducting resonator to demonstrate, for the first time, strong coupling between the resonator microwave field and the motional quantum state of the electron. We find a coupling strength between the electron motion and a resonator photon of $g/2\pi=118$ MHz, exceeding both the electron motional state decoherence and the resonator loss. These experiments open new avenues for investigating light-matter interaction at the single electron level, and are a key step towards measurement and control of electrons on helium-based spin qubits.</description>

Abstract: Decoherence errors arising from noisy environments remain a central obstacle to progress in quantum computation and information processing. Quantum error correction (QEC) based on the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) protocol offers a powerful strategy to overcome this challenge, with successful demonstrations in trapped ions, superconducting circuits, and photonics. Beyond active QEC, a compelling alternative is to engineer Hamiltonians that intrinsically enforce stabilizers, offering passive protection akin to topological models. Inspired by the GKP encoding scheme, we implement a superconducting qubit whose eigenstates form protected grid states - long envisioned but not previously realized - by integrating an effective Cooper-quartet junction with a quantum phase-slip element embedded in a high-impedance circuit. Spectroscopic measurements reveal pairs of degenerate states separated by large energy gaps, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Remarkably, our observations indicate that the circuit tolerates small disorders and gains robustness against environmental noise as its parameters approach the ideal regime, establishing a new framework for exploring superconducting hardware. These findings also showcase the versatility of the superconducting circuit toolbox, setting the stage for future exploration of advanced solid-state devices with emergent properties.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic characteristic radius drives phonon anomalies in Janus transition metal dichalcogenide nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides and their derivatives offer a versatile platform for exploring novel structural and functional properties in low-dimensional materials. In particular, Janus monolayers possess an intrinsic out-of-plane asymmetry that induces a built-in bending radius, which can strongly influence their physical behavior. In this work, we investigate the tubular structures formed by rolling Janus monolayers into the Janus nanotube with an extrinsic radius. Using a combination of atomistic simulations and continuum mechanics, we identify that the total energy of the Janus nanotube is minimized when the tube radius equals to the intrinsic bending radius of the Janus monolayer. An analytical expression for this characteristic radius is derived, providing a theoretical basis for understanding the stability of Janus nanotubes. Furthermore, we find that the optical phonon modes in these Janus nanotubes exhibit an anomalous dependence on the tube radius; i.e., their frequencies reach a maximum value near the characteristic radius, in contrast to the monotonic increase of optical phonon frequencies with radius in conventional nanotubes. The phonon anomaly is due to the soft phonon mode effect induced by the deviation from the most stable tubular configuration with the characteristic radius. These results uncover a unique coupling between intrinsic and extrinsic curvature in Janus systems and open new pathways for tuning vibrational and other properties in curved low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Computational uncertainties in lattice thermal conductivity prediction of crystalline solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report computational uncertainties in Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE)-based lattice thermal conductivity prediction of 50 diverse semiconductors from the use of different BTE solvers (ShengBTE, Phono3Py, and in-house code) and interatomic forces. The interatomic forces are obtained either using the density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in packages Quantum Espresso and VASP employing commonly used exchange correlation functionals (PBE, LDA, PBEsol, and rSCAN) or using the pre-trained foundational machine learning forcefields trained on two different material datasets.
  We find that the considered BTE solvers introduce minimal uncertainties and, using the same interatomic force constants, all solvers result in an excellent agreement with each other, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of only 1%. While this error increases to around 10% with the use of different DFT packages, the error is still small and can be reduced further with the use of stringent planewave energy cutoffs. On the other hand, the differences in thermal conductivity due to the use of different exchange correlation functionals are large, with a MAPE of more than 20%. The currently available pre-trained foundational ML models predict the right trend for thermal conductivity, but the associated errors are high, limiting their applications for coarse screening of materials.</description>

      <title>Thickness Dependence and Fundamental Limitations for Ion Permeation in Nanoscale Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale films play a central role in biology and osmotic separations. Their water/salt selectivity is often regarded as intrinsic property, favoring thinner membranes for faster permeation. Here we highlight and quantify a fundamental limitation arising from the dependence of ion self-energy on film thickness, governed by its ratio to Bjerrum length. The resulting relation factors out this dependence from intrinsic ion permeability, which agrees well with available data and enables evaluation of dielectric properties of ultrathin films, advancing understanding of ion transport in membranes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) are currently being studied for potential applications in energy conversion. In this work, we used the Landauer approach to relate the various effects contributing to the thermoelectric efficiency of scandium nitride (ScN) to their microscopic origins. We model the impact of electronic and structural modifications induced by oxygen impurities and spatial vacancies on electronic transport in ScN nanostructures. Taking advantage of the results of our calculations, we propose a theoretical interpretation of recent experimental results revealing a strong dependence of the thermoelectric properties of ScN thin films on procedural variations during fabrication. The thermoelectric properties of ScN are decisively influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects or impurities. Our findings highlight the potential of this theoretical approach in studying thermoelectricity and uncovering future strategies to improve thermoelectric efficiency.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Ferroelectric Potential Landscape of 3R-MoS$_2$ through Optical Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, sliding ferroelectricity has emerged as a topic of significant interest due to its possible application in non-volatile random access memory. This phenomenon is unique to two-dimensional van der Waals materials, where vertical ferroelectric polarization switching is induced by relative in-plane sliding of the constituent layers. The intrinsic stacking order influences the resulting polarization, creating distinct polarization regions separated by domain walls. These regions and the domain walls can be manipulated using an applied vertical electric field, enabling a switchable system that retains the environmental robustness of van der Waals materials under ambient conditions. This study investigates 3R-MoS$_2$ using various optical measurement techniques at room temperature. The spatially resolved optical measurements reveal apparent signal changes corresponding to different ferroelectric stacking orders and variations in layer count. Our findings demonstrate that fast optical mapping at room temperature is a reliable method for probing ferroelectric potential steps in 3R-stacked MoS$_2$ samples, thereby facilitating the identification of the ferroelectric configuration. This approach does not require a conductive substrate or an electrical contact to the sample, making it more versatile than traditional atomic force probe techniques.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-Field and Temperature Limits of a Kinetic-Inductance Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic-inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (KI-TWPAs) offer broadband near-quantum-limited amplification with high saturation power. Due to the high critical magnetic fields of high-kinetic-inductance materials, KI-TWPAs should be resilient to magnetic fields. In this work, we study how magnetic field and temperature affect the performance of a KI-TWPA based on a thin-NbTiN inverse microstrip with a Nb ground plane. This KI-TWPA can provide substantial signal-to-noise ratio improvement ($\Delta SNR$) up to in-plane magnetic fields of 0.35T and out-of-plane fields of 50mT, considerably higher than what has been demonstrated with TWPAs based on Josephson junctions. The field compatibility can be further improved by incorporating vortex traps and by using materials with higher critical fields. We also find that the gain does not degrade when the temperature is raised to 3K (limited by the Nb ground plane) while $\Delta SNR$ decreases with temperature consistently with expectation. This demonstrates that KI-TWPAs can be used in experiments that need to be performed at relatively high temperatures. The operability of KI-TWPAs in high magnetic field opens the door to a wide range of applications in spin qubits, spin ensembles, topological qubits, low-power NMR, and the search for axion dark matter.</description>

Abstract: Due to their robustness, the implementation of geometric phases provides a reliable and controllable way to manipulate the phase of a spin wave, thereby paving the way towards functional magnonics-based data processing devices. Moreover, geometric phases in spin waves are interesting from a fundamental perspective as they contain information about spin wave band structures and play an important role in magnon Hall effects. In this paper we propose to directly measure geometric phases in spin wave systems using the magnetic field sensing capabilities of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. We demonstrate the general principles of this method on two systems in which spin waves acquire a geometric phase, namely a wire with a magnetic domain wall and a system with position-dependent anisotropy axes, and explicitly show how this phase can be deduced from the NV center signal.</description>

      <title>Precise correspondence between the p-wave chiral superfluid and the spinless bosonic superfluid in the lowest Landau level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a precise formal correspondence between a spinless p-wave chiral fermionic superfluid and a spinless bosonic superfluid in a strong magnetic field by correctly accounting for superfluid vorticity in the effective theory of the former. In the literature, this vorticity term incompletely manifests as the magnetic field. This paper demonstrates this substitution can be understood as a truncation within the relevant expansion scheme, accompanied by field redefinitions. The components discarded in this truncation are critical for restoring the Berry phase term in the effective theory, encapsulating both systems in the same master Lagrangian. Beyond clarifying the structure of the Berry phase, this formalism allows for solving the bosonic system in the lowest Landau level (LLL) by analogy. Specifically, we show that, in the linear regime, the Maxwell equations governing these systems are identical when the vortex crystal is reformulated using an auxiliary electromagnetic field. This approach offers a unified perspective on these systems and yields solutions that are rotationally covariant, gauge invariants, and physically interpretable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driving coherent lattice motion with THz pulses has emerged as a novel pathway for achieving dynamic stabilization of exotic phases that are inaccessible in equilibrium quantum materials. In this work, we present a previously unexplored mechanism for THz excitation of Raman-active phonons in semimetals. We show that intense THz pulses centered at 1 THz can excite the Raman-active $A_{1g}$ phonon mode at 2.9 THz in a bismuth film. We rule out the possibilities of the phonon being excited through conventional anharmonic coupling to other modes or via a THz sum frequency process. Instead, we demonstrate that the THz-driven tunnel ionization provides a plausible means of creating a displacive driving force to initiate the phonon oscillations. Our work highlights a new mechanism for exciting coherent phonons, offering potential for dynamic control over the electronic and structural properties of semimetals and narrow-band semiconductors on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Collapse of edge reconstruction in compressible Quantum Hall fluid within filling fraction range 2/3 to 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The edge structure of a gate-defined compressible quantum Hall fluids in the filling fraction range 2/3 to 1 is studied using the three reconstructed $e^2/3h$ fractional edge modes of unity filling integer quantum Hall state. We find that the individually excited partially resolved $e^2/3h$ edge modes of the bulk state equilibrate completely even at higher magnetic field when passing through the gate defined compressible fluid with filling between 2/3 and 1. This result is unexpected because edge reconstruction at the smooth boundary is generally expected due to dominant incompressibility at filling 2/3 and 1/3. Recently such reconstructed edge mode has been reported for the compressible fluid in the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3. In contrary, equilibration of fractional edge modes in the compressible fluid within the filling fraction range 2/3 to 1 becomes faster with increasing magnetic field. This anomalous results will stimulate further investigations on edge structure in these complex many body systems.</description>

Abstract: We have theoretically studied the G-center in bulk silicon material using the empirical tight-binding model for calculations of unfolded band structures with configuration interaction correction for the exciton at $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone. The G-center in B configuration (emissive) being a candidate structure as the telecom single- and entangled-photon source has two substitutional carbons and one interstitial atom embedded into the bulk in six equally possible configurations. Taking the advantage of the low computation effort of the tight-binding and unfolding approach, it is possible to calculate and analyze the behavior of a variety of the electronic configurations. Our tight-binding model is able to describe not only the behavior of the G-center in the silicon bulk but using the unfolding approach it can also pinpoint the contributions of different elements of the supercell on the final pseudo-band structure. Moreover, the configuration interaction correction with single-particle basis states computed by our unfolded tight-binding model predicts a very small fine-structure splitting of the ground state exciton both for bright and dark doublet in the studied system. That underscores the possibility of the silicon G-center to become a very good emitter of single and entangled photons for quantum communication and computation applications.</description>

      <title>Superconducting bistability in floating Al islands of hybrid Al/InAs nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a non-equilibrium aspect of the current-driven superconducting-normal phase transition in floating Al islands of epitaxial full-shell Al/InAs nanowires. Within a transition region discontinuous voltage jumps and hysteretic behaviour of the I-V characteristics are observed, associated with the destruction and recovery of the superconducting order parameter in the island. The strength of the two features varies strongly in different devices in a mutually correlated way and can be suppressed by a small magnetic field. Numerical calculation explains this behaviour in terms of a tiny non-equilibrium correction to the electronic energy distribution at low energies. The experiment demonstrates a critical failure of a two-temperature non-equilibrium model of the superconductor-normal transition in floating islands of hybrid nanowire devices.</description>

      <title>Theory of nonlinear magnetoelectric transport effects in normal-metal $-$ magnetic-insulator heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterostructures of normal metals (N) and magnetic insulators (F) show paradigmatic effects, such as spin-Hall magnetoresistance and electric drag currents. These effects are linear in the applied electric field $E(\omega)$. Normal-metal $-$ magnetic-insulator heterostructures also exhibit a characteristic nonlinear response quadratic in $E(\omega)$, referred to as unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance or spin-torque diode effect. In this article, we develop a theory of the bilinear response of FN bilayers and NFN trilayers for finite frequencies $\omega$ of the driving field and for four contributions that have been previously considered in the literature: Joule heating, phonon-mediated unidirectional magnetoresistance, the spin-torque diode effect, and magnonic unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance. We identify their distinct dependencies on frequency and the magnetization direction of the magnetic insulator and examine their scaling with magnetic field and system geometry, providing a framework for experimental differentiation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall Antidot as a Fractional Coulombmeter</title>

Abstract: The detection of fractionally charged quasiparticles, which arise in the fractional quantum Hall regime, is of fundamental importance for probing their exotic quantum properties. While electronic interferometers have been central to probe their statistical properties, their interpretation is often complicated by bulk-edge interactions. Antidots, potential hills in the quantum Hall regime, are particularly valuable in this context, as they overcome the geometric limitations of conventional designs and act as controlled impurities within a quantum point contact. Furthermore, antidots allow for quasiparticle charge detection through straightforward conductance measurements, replacing the need for more demanding techniques. In this work, we employ a gate-defined bilayer graphene antidot operating in the Coulomb-dominated regime to study quasiparticle tunneling in both integer and fractional quantum Hall states. We show that the gate-voltage period and the oscillation slope directly reveal the charge of the tunneling quasiparticles, providing a practical method to measure fractional charge in graphene. We report direct measurements of fractional charge, finding $q = e/3$ at $\nu = 4/3$, 5/3 and 7/3, $q = 2e/3$ at $\nu = 2/3$ and $q = 3e/5$ at $\nu = 3/5$, while at $\nu = 8/3$ we observe signatures of both $e/3$ and $2e/3$ tunneling charge. The simplicity and tunability of this design open a pathway to extend antidot-based charge measurements to other van der Waals materials, establishing antidots as a powerful and broadly applicable platform to study the quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Non-universal Thermal Hall Responses in Fractional Quantum Hall Droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically compute the thermal Hall conductance (THC) of fractional quantum Hall droplets under realistic conditions that go beyond the idealized linear edge theory with conformal symmetry. Specifically, we consider finite-size effects at low temperature, nonzero self-energies of quasiholes, and general edge dispersions. We derive measurable corrections in THC that align well with the experimental observables. Although the quantized THC is commonly regarded as a topological invariant that is independent of edge confinement, our results show that this quantization remains robust only for arbitrary edge dispersion in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, the THC contributed by Abelian modes can become extremely sensitive to finite-size effects and irregular confining potentials in any realistic experimental system. In contrast, non-Abelian modes show robust THC signatures under perturbations, indicating an intrinsic stability of non-Abelian anyons.</description>

      <title>Tomography of entangling two-qubit logic operations in exchange-coupled donor electron spin qubits</title>

Abstract: Scalable quantum processors require high-fidelity universal quantum logic operations in a manufacturable physical platform. Donors in silicon provide atomic size, excellent quantum coherence and compatibility with standard semiconductor processing, but no entanglement between donor-bound electron spins has been demonstrated to date. Here we present the experimental demonstration and tomography of universal 1- and 2-qubit gates in a system of two weakly exchange-coupled electrons, bound to single phosphorus donors introduced in silicon by ion implantation. We surprisingly observe that the exchange interaction has no effect on the qubit coherence. We quantify the fidelity of the quantum operations using gate set tomography (GST), and we use the universal gate set to create entangled Bell states of the electrons spins, with fidelity ~ 93%, and concurrence 0.91 +/- 0.08. These results form the necessary basis for scaling up donor-based quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: The use of nuclear spins for quantum computation is limited by the difficulty in creating genuine quantum entanglement between distant nuclei. Current demonstrations of nuclear entanglement in semiconductors rely upon coupling the nuclei to a common electron, which is not a scalable strategy. Here we demonstrate a two-qubit Control-Z logic operation between the nuclei of two phosphorus atoms in a silicon device, separated by up to 20 nanometers. Each atoms binds separate electrons, whose exchange interaction mediates the nuclear two-qubit gate. We prepare and measure a nuclear Bell state with a fidelity of 76 +/- 5 $\%$ and a concurrence of 0.67 +/- 0.05. With this method, future progress in scaling up semiconductor spin qubits can be extended to the development of nuclear-spin based quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: The superconducting diode effect has garnered significant interest due to its prospective applications in cryogenic electronics and computing, enabling directional supercurrent transport. This phenomenon has been demonstrated across various superconducting platforms, which typically necessitate unconventional materials with broken spatial symmetries or external magnetic fields, posing scalability and integration challenges. This work introduces an innovative method to realize the superconducting diode effect by disrupting spatiotemporal symmetries in a conventional Josephson junction utilizing a biharmonic alternating-current (AC) drive signal. We achieve wireless modulation of the diode's polarity and efficiency with an antenna. Our findings indicate a diode efficiency reaching the ideal $100%$ over a broad frequency range, with a temperature resilience of up to 800 mK, and efficient AC signal rectification. This versatile and platform-independent superconducting diode signifies a promising component for advancing future superconducting digital electronics, including efficient logic gates, ultrafast switches, and dynamic half-wave supercurrent rectifiers.</description>

Abstract: Atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) dopes silicon with enough carriers to change its electronic structure, and can be used to create novel devices by defining metallic regions whose boundaries have single-atom abruptness. Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process requirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited exploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance, and how transistor manufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts. In this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into the middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that combines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining characteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility limit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with manufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor with an APAM resistor show the APAM module has only affected the transistor through the addition of a resistance, and not by altering the transistor. This proof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations of a unified APAM tool which could be introduced into manufacturing environments, greatly expanding access to this technology, and inspiring a new generation of devices with it.</description>

      <title>Sign competing sources of Berry curvature and anomalous Hall conductance humps in topological ferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of Berry-phase concepts has established a strong link between the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and the topological character of the Hall currents. However, the occurrence of sign competition in the Berry curvature often hinders the topological origin of the observed anomalous Hall effects. Here, we study a two-dimensional topological ferromagnet with coupled spin and orbital degrees of freedom to assess the anomalous Hall effects in the presence of sign-competing sources of Berry curvature. We show that 2D itinerant topological ferromagnets described by t2g electronic states can generally lead to topological metallic bands marked by a non-zero Chern number. We find that the resulting Berry curvature at the Fermi level exhibits a characteristic anisotropic profile with a non-monotonous angular dependence when the magnetization is reversed. The sign change of the intrinsic contribution to the anomalous Hall conductance can occur together with topological transitions or be driven by the population imbalance of the topological bands. The breaking of the inversion symmetry introduces the orbital Rashba coupling in the system. The interplay between the orbital Rashba and sign competing sources of Berry curvature leads to anomalies in the anomalous Hall conductance at values of magnetic fields for which the magnetization switches its orientation. The humps in topological ferromagnets arise when the anomalous Hall conductivity is small in absolute value and they can be detected only close to the sign-change of the AHE and far from half-filling. This study could be relevant for the family of the topological 2D ferromagnets as well as Weyl ferromagnets, and can particularly account for the variety of unconventional behaviors observed in ultrathin films of SrRuO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Visualizing a Terahertz Superfluid Plasmon in a Two-Dimensional Superconductor</title>

Abstract: The superconducting gap defines the fundamental energy scale for the emergence of dissipationless transport and collective phenomena in a superconductor. In layered high-temperature cuprate superconductors, where the Cooper pairs are confined to weakly coupled two-dimensional copper-oxygen planes, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy at sub-gap millielectronvolt energies has provided crucial insights into the collective superfluid response perpendicular to the superconducting layers. However, within the copper-oxygen planes the collective superfluid response manifests as plasmonic charge oscillations at energies far exceeding the superconducting gap, obscured by strong dissipation. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence of a below-gap, two-dimensional superfluid plasmon in few-layer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x and spatially resolve its deeply sub-diffractive THz electrodynamics. By placing the superconductor in the near-field of a spintronic THz emitter, we reveal this distinct resonance-absent in bulk samples and observed only in the superconducting phase-and determine its plasmonic nature by mapping the geometric anisotropy and dispersion. Crucially, these measurements offer a direct view of the momentum- and frequency dependent superconducting transition in two dimensions. These results establish a new platform for investigating superfluid phenomena at finite momenta and THz frequencies, highlighting the potential to engineer and visualize superconducting devices operating at ultrafast THz rates.</description>
