      <title>On Carrollian and Celestial Correlators in General Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carrollian holography is a framework for flat space holography, suggesting that gravity in asymptotically flat spacetime in $D$ dimensions is dual to a conformal Carrollian field theory in $D - 1$ dimensions living at null infinity. In this work, we elaborate on the definition of Carrollian amplitudes for massless scalar fields in general dimensions and provide explicit expressions for the two-, three-, and four-point functions. We show that these amplitudes naturally arise from Lorentzian holographic correlators in AdS/CFT through a correspondence between the flat space limit in the bulk and the Carrollian limit at the boundary. Finally, we use the relation between Carrollian and celestial holography to derive explicit expressions for celestial amplitudes in $D$ dimensions, which are reinterpreted as correlators of the celestial CFT in $D - 2$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Genera of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,1)$ Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an exact residue formula for the elliptic genera of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,1)$ gauge theories. We find a new residue prescription which recovers the Jeffery-Kirwan residue prescription for $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ theories. We apply the formula to the Gukov-Pei-Putrov model and analyze the phase structure of the theory.</description>

      <title>Liouville CFT, Matrix Models and constrained WZW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study matrix model realizations of Liouville conformal blocks with degenerate and irregular operators. The corresponding matrix model is Hermitian with a $\beta$-deformed measure and the degree of the potential corresponds to the degree of the irregular operator in the CFT conformal block. We then show how such matrix integrals can be obtained from an $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ WZW model with a conformal constraint giving rise to Liouville theory. The corresponding conformal blocks satisfy irregular versions of Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations and we provide a matrix model realization in terms of generalized resolvents.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative creation operators for symmetric polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider in modern terms the old discovery by A. Kirillov and M. Noumi, who devised peculiar operators adding columns to Young diagrams enumerating the Schur, Jack and Macdonald polynomials. In this sense, these are a kind of ``creation'' operators, representing Pieri rules in a maximally simple form, when boxes are added to Young diagrams in a regular way and not to arbitrary ``empty places'' around the diagram. Instead the operators do not commute, and one should add columns of different lengths one after another. We consider this construction in different contexts. In particular, we build up the creation operators $\hat B_m$ in the matrix and Fock representations of the $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra, and in the Fock representation of the affine Yangian algebra $Y(\widehat{gl}_1)$.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric M2-Brane Matrix Model with Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformations: Lorentz Covariance and BPS Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel supersymmetric Lorentz-covariant matrix model for M2-branes in M-theory, constructed via the framework of Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformations (RVPD) which is a residual symmetry from gauge-fixed volume-preserving diffeomorphisms. The model reformulates the supermembrane action entirely in terms of Nambu brackets, whose decomposition into Poisson brackets allows for a consistent matrix regularization that preserves both the Fundamental Identity and Lorentz covariance. Under the RVPD gauge structure, $\kappa$-symmetry is reduced to a restricted form ($\tilde{\kappa}$) that closes with RVPD transformations into a novel symmetry algebra. This algebra enables a systematic classification of BPS configurations: particle states (1/2-BPS), noncommutative membranes (1/4-BPS), and extended configurations in 4, 6, and 8 dimensions (1/8-, 1/16-, and 1/32-BPS), while the 10-dimensional case is non-BPS. The construction provides a natural lift of D2-brane matrix theory to M-theory and offers a pathway toward Lorentz-covariant matrix models for higher branes such as M5-branes.</description>

      <title>Gravitostatic black hole Love numbers from Membrane Paradigm at large $D$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes, like any other object - respond to external fields like background electric and gravitational fields. At lowest order, the response of a black hole to, (e.g.) a gravitational wave in the $l^{th}$ spherical harmonic mode is to develop a generalized `quadrupole moment' in the same symmetry channel. The induced moment of the black hole is proportional to the external forcing field. The constant of proportionality between the field and the response is a function of the frequency $\omega$ of the incident perturbation. These constants of proportionality are sometimes called `Love' numbers in the study of astrophysical black holes. Using the `Large $D$ Membrane Paradigm' formalism, we compute gravitostatic black hole `Love' numbers (at $\omega \to 0$ limit), in large $D$. This work opens the road of using Large $D$ Membrane Paradigm formalism to extend the computation of these black hole `Love' numbers for all values of $\omega$ in large $D$ - which we announce in this paper.</description>

      <title>On R\'enyi Microstructural Aspects of Asymptotically Flat Charged Black Holes: A Novel Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the microstructure of asymptotically flat charged black holes through the lens of nonextensive R\'enyi statistics. A modified form of the R\'enyi entropy is proposed to incorporate compressibility effects, and geometrothermodynamics is applied within such a framework. Besides, by quantizing the black hole horizon area, we derive a microscopic description in terms of discrete degrees of freedom, with R\'enyi entropy providing a nonextensive generalization of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We compute the R\'enyi partition function and probability distribution in the canonical ensemble, highlighting significant deviations from Boltzmann-Gibbs behavior at finite temperature due to nonextensive effects. The black hole undergoes a first-order Van der Waals-like phase transition between small and large configurations, characterized by discontinuities in entropy and latent heat, both of which are shown to depend on the number of area quanta. A critical threshold emerges beyond which the transition becomes athermal. Additionally, we establish a thermodynamic duality between charged-AdS black holes in Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics and charged-flat R\'enyi black holes, expressed via a conformal transformation of state variables. This duality extends naturally to higher dimensions. Our results provide new insights into the microstructure of black holes.</description>

      <title>Two types of boson stars in $U(1)$ gauged $3+1$-dimensional $O(3)$ sigma-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate boson stars in an $O(3)$ scalar field theory with a symmetry-breaking potential. By constructing numerically spherically symmetric solutions, we demonstrate that the model gives rise to a rich set of field configurations. The negative coupling constant of the scalar self-interactions allows for two types of boson stars: Type I solutions represent the usual boson stars, that emerge from the vacuum as the boson frequency is decreased below the boson mass, whereas type II boson stars emerge from a set of static soliton solutions. Depending on the strengths of the gravitational and the electric coupling constants, both types or only one type is present. At a critical set of coupling constants, both types undergo a bifurcation. There the spirals of both types disconnect from their branches and reconnect with each other, while the remaining branches of both types also reconnect with each other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact formulas (1), (28) presented in this paper permit to formulate the Kallen-Lehmann harmonic decompositions of the products of two spinor and of spinor and scalar harmonic functions in AdS and Wightman functions in dS spaces; the correct flat space limit of the corresponding Kallen-Lehmann densities is demonstrated. Also in Sec. 4 the relatively simple, suitable for calculations Kallen-Lehmann representations of the real parts of spinor and scalar one-loop self-energies in Yukawa model in dS space-time are proposed, and corresponding spectral equations in the chain approximation are written down.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the special extremal slice inside an AdS black hole is dual to an absolutely maximally entangled (AME) state. We demonstrate this by confirming the $n$-independence of holographic $n$-th Renyi entropies for any bi-partite subsystems. Our result gives an AME state in an infinite-volume system, where the local bond dimension is set by the black hole entropy. In particular, our construction provides concrete support from the gravity side for the emergence of random structures and an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space in recent non-isometric holographic codes.</description>

      <title>Time Ordering Effects and Destruction of Quasiparticles in Two-dimensional Holographic CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the entanglement dynamics induced by a composite operator, defined as the local operator evolved with the time evolution operator constructed of the Euclidean and Lorentzian ones. The systems under consideration are described by two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories (2d holographic CFTs), the theories described by gravity. Then, we find that the time ordering of Euclidean and Lorentzian time evolutions affects the behavior of bipartite entanglement and non-local correlation, especially their late-time ones. We also establish the relation between entanglement entropy and energy-momentum densities. This relation states that the late-time behaviors of bipartite entanglement and non-local correlation strongly depend on the energy distribution. We also examine how the decay of the quasiparticle influences the bipartite entanglement and non-local correlation. Furthermore, we investigate the gravity dual of the systems considered in this paper.</description>

      <title>On classification of rank two theories with eight supercharges Part III: Seiberg-Witten geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Seiberg-Witten (SW) geometries for rank-two theories, encompassing 4D field theories as well as 5D and 6D Kaluza-Klein (KK) theories. The singular model for each SW geometry is derived from a one-parameter family of algebraic curves $y^2 = f(x,t)$, where $t$ parametrizes one dimension of Coulomb branch moduli space. The functional form of $f(x,t)$ is systematically determined through analysis of singular fibers at $t=\infty$. Two powerful computational methods enable this determination: a): Liu's algorithm for determining singular fibers from local equation; b): The canonical resolution method for fiber degeneration. Our construction provides not only a complete description of known solutions but also establishes a robust framework for generating new theories. This methodology proves particularly valuable for the systematic exploration of 5D and 6D theories.</description>

      <title>Quantized Quiver Varieties and the Quantum Spin Ruijsenaars-Schneider Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the long-standing problem of quantizing the rational spin Ruijsenaars--Schneider model originating in the work of Krichever and Zabrodin. We make use of the technique of quantum Hamiltonian reduction to construct a quantized quiver variety $\mathfrak{A}_{N,\ell}$ associated to the framed Jordan quiver. This quantized quiver variety is simultaneously the algebra of quantum observables of the rational spin Ruijsenaars--Schneider model of $N$ particles with $\ell$ spin polarizations. Inside this algebra, we find a loop algebra and Yangian of $\mathfrak{gl}_\ell$ and conjecture that in the limit of infinitely many particles, the algebra $\mathfrak{A}_{N,\ell}$ becomes a shifted affine Yangian. We also exhibit a difference equation for eigenstates of the lowest Hamiltonian that reduces to the spinless case when $\ell=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider supersymmetric solutions of $D=5$ Euclidean gauged supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of vector multiplets. We consider solutions that admit both the R-symmetry Killing vector, $\mathcal{K}$, constructed as a bilinear in the Killing spinor, as well as an additional Killing vector $\ell$. Using $\ell$ to perform a dimensional reduction to $D=4$, $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauged supergravity, we show how the $D=5$ on-shell action can be computed using equivariant localization. We illustrate the formalism with some examples, computing the supersymmetric Casimir energy and the supersymmetric index of the dual SCFT without using the explicit supergravity solutions.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills Flux Tube in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of flux tubes in confining gauge theories placed in a rigid AdS background, which serves as an infrared regulator. Varying the AdS radius from large to small allows us to interpolate between the flat space confining string, and a weakly coupled string-like object which is held together by the AdS gravitational potential. At any radius, the string preserves a subgroup of AdS isometries equivalent to the one-dimensional conformal group and hence, from the boundary point of view, can be thought of as a conformal defect. The defect hosts a protected operator, called displacement, which nonlinearly realizes the broken AdS isometries. At small radius the displacement corresponds to the gauge field strength inserted at the boundary, while at large radius it is mapped to the Goldstone mode living on the string worldsheet. This relates gauge field and worldsheet degrees of freedom. We propose a hypothesis according to which the large and small radius perturbative expansions can be smoothly matched with each other. As a test, we calculate the leading order corrections to the scaling dimensions and OPE coefficients of a set of defect operators at weak coupling in planar 3D Yang-Mills.</description>

      <title>Inverse Hamiltonian Reconstruction from Gravitational Energy Density in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for reconstructing effective Hamiltonians from known gravitational energy density profiles in curved spacetime. Starting from local thermal equilibrium and Liouville dynamics, we establish an inverse procedure that relates the macroscopic energy density \( \rho(x) \) to a distribution function \( f(x,p) \sim e^{-\beta H(x,p)} \), and recovers the underlying Hamiltonian \( H(x,p) \) via functional inversion. This approach synthesizes tools from relativistic kinetic theory, statistical mechanics, and covariant gravitational thermodynamics, offering a systematic way to extract microscopic dynamics from coarse-grained energy observables. Applications include FLRW cosmology, Loop Quantum Gravity corrections, AdS/CFT holography, and the SYK model. Our results provide a novel route for probing emergent spacetime dynamics through observable densities, bridging geometry, entropy, and Hamiltonian flow in curved backgrounds.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we examine the thermodynamics of black holes immersed in perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) by employing the Misner-Sharp energy framework. We extend the analysis to include the thermal fluctuations of these black holes when size reduces to small size, redefining key thermodynamic variables such as pressure, volume, temperature, internal energy, and entropy within the context of PFDM. Using these newly defined variables, we systematically calculate the enthalpy, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat of PFDM black holes, incorporating perturbative thermal corrections. To assess the stability of these black holes, we perform a detailed graphical analysis of the specific heat as a function of the horizon radius, providing insights into the thermal stability of PFDM black holes. This comprehensive approach enhances our understanding of the thermodynamic properties and stability of black holes in the presence of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis and Dirac neutrino masses in SO(10)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the scheme of Baryogenesis through Leptogenesis in the single flavor approximation, we emphasize the role of the Dirac neutrino mass $m_D$ in the SO(10) Grand Unification scheme, using the Higgs representations for the fermions masses ${\bf 10}$ and $\overline{\bf 126}$. Both representations are needed to get relations among the fermion masses, e.g. $m_b = m_\tau$, $m_\mu = 3 m_s$,... Taking these two representations allow to relax the condition $m_D = m_u$ obtained with the representation ${\bf 10}$ alone and to have general Dirac masses $m_D \not = m_u$. On the other hand, we assume that the antisymmetric representation ${\bf 120}$ is absent. Within this hypothesis, the unitary matrices $V^L$ and $V^R$ that diagonalize $m_D$ through $m_D = V^{L \dagger} m_D^{diag} V^R$ still satisfy the relation $V^R = V^{L*}$. Under these conditions, unlike the case of keeping only the ${\bf 10}$ representation, we obtain in parameter space several examples of the heavy neutrino spectrum consistent with the SO(10) unification scale, and a value for the baryon asymmetry $Y_B$ in agreement with data. For illustration, we detail a case that gives the heavy spectrum with masses $M_1 = 6.26 \times 10^{10}\ {\rm GeV}$, $M_2 = 2.23 \times 10^{12}\ {\rm GeV}$, $M_3 = 4.57 \times 10^{14}\ {\rm GeV}$ and, in the strong washout regime, the baryon asymmetry $Y_B = 8.50 \times 10^{-11}$ consistent with the data.</description>

      <title>Deflection of Light and Thermodynamics of Einstein-Dyonic-ModMax Black Holes under GUP and Plasma Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamic and optical properties of Einstein-Dyonic-ModMax (EDM) black holes (BHs) incorporating quantum gravity corrections and plasma effects. The ModMax theory promotes the classical Maxwell theory to a non-linear electrodynamics with a larger symmetry structure (electromagnetic duality plus conformal invariance), and provides dyonic BH solutions characterized by both electric and magnetic charges modulated by the nonlinearity parameter $\gamma$. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi tunneling formalism, we derive the Hawking radiation spectrum and demonstrate how the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) modifies the thermal emission, potentially leading to stable remnants. Our analysis of gravitational lensing employs the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to compute light deflection angles in both vacuum and plasma environments, revealing strong dependencies on the ModMax parameter and plasma density. We extend this to axion-plasmon environments, uncovering frequency-dependent modifications that could serve as dark matter signatures. The photon motion analysis in plasma media shows how the exponential damping term $e^{-\gamma}$ affects electromagnetic backreaction on spacetime geometry. We compute quantum-corrected thermodynamic quantities, including internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, pressure, and heat capacity, using exponentially modified entropy models. The heat capacity exhibits second-order phase transitions with critical points shifting as functions of $\gamma$, indicating rich thermodynamic phase structures. Energy condition analysis reveals violations in near-horizon regions, characteristic of exotic matter supporting these geometries.</description>

      <title>Impact of Primordial Magnetic Fields on the First-Order Electroweak Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study how the primordial magnetic field affects the first-order electroweak phase transition in the early Universe. We observe that: 1) the phase transition process would be slowed down by the magnetic field; 2) the phenomenon of vortex structure of the Higgs condensation appears when the homogenesis hypermagentic field $g'B_Y^{ex}/m_W^2\gtrsim3.63$; and, 3) the helical hypermagnetic field can dramatically enhance the sphaleron rate and validate the generation of the baryon asymmetry through the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild-AdS Black Holes with Cloud of Strings and Quintessence: Geodesics, Thermodynamic Topology, and Quasinormal Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a Schwarzschild-anti de-Sitter black hole (BH) coupled with a cloud of strings (CoS) possessing both electric- and magnetic-like components of the string bivector, embedded in a Kiselev-type quintessence fluid (QF). We analyze the dynamics of photons and test particles, focusing on trajectories, photon spheres, BH shadows, and innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO), highlighting how CoS and QF parameters affect these features. We then examine the thermodynamic topology of the system by analyzing vector field zeros, showing that varying CoS leads to distinct topological configurations with total charges of either $0$ or $+1$, corresponding to known classes like RN and AdS-RN. Additionally, we study scalar field dynamics via the massless Klein-Gordon equation, reformulated into a Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger-like form to derive the effective potential. We compute the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of scalar perturbations, showing how CoS and QF influence oscillation frequencies and damping rates, with implications for gravitational confinement and thermalization in the AdS/CFT context.</description>

      <title>Comparing a Mass Shell Model for Compact Binaries with Observed Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent study modeled coalescing compact binaries as a spinning and contracting mass shell geometry, reinterpreting the effective one-body model. Besides obtaining the respective waveform profiles that include rates of change in binary separation and orbital frequency, an expression for the mass-shell surface energy was derived to compute the anticipated energy radiated as gravitational waves. In this study, we revisit the surface energy derivation using a variational method that was recently used, and we recover the energy's dependence on the compact binary's reduced mass, symmetric mass ratio, and the normalized rotational speed at merger. For 31 out of 93 cataloged GW events within the O1, O2 and O3 observation runs, we compute the anticipated energy radiated as gravitational waves and compare these values with the observed energy, either directly measured or extracted from the total-minus-remnant mass difference. It is shown that the model presented in this work agrees well with observed energy measurements, within the error range and via 1:1 ratios spanning from $0.828$ to $0.997$ across 29 example events (the mean value of these 29 ratios being $0.941$), with GW190403_051519 serving as an outlier with the 1:1 ratio of $0.462$, demonstrating the precision and universality of the energy expression to be applied to current and future detections.</description>

      <title>Conditions for positivity of energy in superrenormalizable polynomial gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the quantum level, the polynomial models of gravity with six and eight derivatives are superrenormalizable, but suffer from higher derivative ghost and/or tachyonic ghost states. On the other hand, these models may have advantages in the control of negative effects of ghosts, compared to the more common fourth-derivative theory. We explore the positiveness of energy of the individual plane wave solutions in the general models with six and eight derivatives. Different from the fourth-order gravity, the part of the energy which may be seen as the leading one in the UV, is positively defined in the tensor sector. We extend this investigation to the scalar sectors of the free theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Black Hole in the accelerating Universe approaching the future singularity -- Possible origin of (super-)massive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and investigate the dynamical black hole spacetime embedded in the expanding universe filled with cosmic fluid, such as dark energy. When the equation of state (EoS) parameter of the fluid is a constant, we find exact solutions of the Einstein equation where the Schwarzschild black hole is embedded in the expanding universe. This solution differs from the well-known McVittie metric, where the EoS parameter is not a constant but rather depends on the radial coordinate. It is shown that a dynamical black hole grows with the expansion of the universe. If primordial black holes are created before or during inflation, above dynamical black holes might be the origin of the supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies, massive black holes suggested by the GW231123 event, and also the dark matter. The case where the cosmic fluid EoS is more general is also considered so that the universe enters the epoch of finite-time future singularity. Thermodynamics and the behaviour of black holes around different future singularities are carefully investigated. It is then demonstrated that the black hole horizon enhances the tidal force, but near the horizon, the tidal force works to press the extended object, which is in contrast with a massive body near to future singularity.
  We also propose a new type of future singularity where the singularity inside the black hole is a sphere with a finite radius. When the radius of the spherical singularity becomes larger than the radius of the black hole horizon, it becomes naked. The universe may end up with a cosmic doomsday when the radius of the singularity becomes infinite.</description>

      <title>Strong gravitational lensing effects of black holes with quantum hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the no-hair theorem, stationary black holes are uniquely characterized by their mass, charge, and angular momentum. In this paper, we explore quantum hair by deriving the quantum-corrected black hole metric within the Barvinsky-Vilkovisky formalism. The quantum-corrected metric is obtained perturbatively around flat spacetime without assuming either the commutativity between the nonlocal operator and covariant derivatives or the nonlocal Gauss-Bonnet theorem, both of which are adopted in previous studies. Using this metric, we evaluate the deflection angle in the strong-field limit and compute the associated strong gravitational lensing observables, such as the angular separation and the relative magnification. Our results show that as the quantum hair, determined by the number of virtual massless quantum fields in the nonlocal effective action, increases, the photon sphere radius, the strong deflection angle, and the relative magnification all increase, whereas the angular separation decreases. In addition, the role of quantum hair is discussed in the weak and strong naked singularities. As a result, we demonstrate that the quantum hair affects not only the black hole geometry but also its strong gravitational lensing effects.</description>

      <title>Memory Effects and Entanglement Dynamics of Finite time Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a smooth trajectory in Minkowski spacetime that is inertial in the asymptotic past and future but undergoes approximately uniform acceleration for a finite duration. In a suitable limit, this trajectory reduces to the standard Rindler trajectory, reproducing the expected Bogoliubov transformations and results consistent with the thermal time hypothesis. We analyze the behavior of an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector following such a trajectory and explore the dependence of complete positivity (CP) divisibility on the detector's frequency, acceleration, and the duration of acceleration. Notably, we find that the detector exhibits a memory effect due to the finite duration of acceleration, which is also quantified by the Fisher information. We further examine two UDW detectors along various trajectory combinations and show that, unlike the transition rate, both the total correlation and the entanglement harvested return smoothly to their initial values after the acceleration/deceleration phase. These correlation measures behave similarly in both accelerating and decelerating segments. Interestingly, negativity and mutual information remain unaffected by the memory effect. We also discuss the physical significance of the sign of the flux of acceleration-induced radiation.</description>

      <title>Information Transport in Classic-Quantum Hybrid System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many important quantities in quantum information science, such as entropy and entanglement, are non-linear functions of the density matrix and cannot be expressed as operator observables. Standard open-system approaches evolve only a single copy of the density matrix, making it impossible to track the dynamics of such quantities. A formalism proposed by some of the present authors addressed this challenge by evolving multiple virtual replicas, but was limited to the weak-coupling regime. Here, we extend this approach to strong coupling between a quantum system and classical environments. The resulting multi-replica master equation enables direct evaluation of entropy flow and related metrics in strongly hybridized quantum-classical systems. Our results show that quantum coherence and hybridization jointly suppress net entropy transfer, creating a thermodynamic bottleneck. This framework provides a general tool for studying entropy dynamics and guiding the design of more robust, resource-efficient quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Topological Strings in SU(3) Gauge Theory at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate string configurations in the deconfined phase of SU(3) gauge theory, which arise from the spontaneous breaking of the $Z_3$ center symmetry. These configurations form at the junctions of domain walls of the theory. The complex phase of the Polyakov loop changes by multiples of $2\pi$ on large spatial loops around the string, rendering them topologically stable. Using the Monte Carlo simulations of the partition function, we compute the free energy associated with these configurations. The simulations are performed on lattices with spatial dimensions $N_{x,y}=60, N_z=4$, and temporal extent $N_\tau=2$. Our results show that the free energy of the $Z_3-$strings is dominated by the domain walls. Further near the transition point, thermal fluctuations cause the decay of domain walls as well as the $Z_3$ strings into confined-deconfined interfaces.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Enriched Topological Phases and Their Gauging: A String-Net Model Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework for constructing exactly-solvable lattice models of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases based on an enlarged version of the string-net model. We also gauge the global symmetries of our SET models to obtain string-net models of pure topological phases. Without invoking externally imposed onsite symmetry actions, our approach promotes the string-net model of a pure topological order, specified by an input unitary fusion category $\mathscr{F}$, to an SET model, specified by a multifusion category together with a set of isomorphisms. Two complementary construction strategies are developed in the main text: (i) promotion via outer automorphisms of $\mathscr{F}$ and (ii) promotion via the Frobenius algebras of $\mathscr{F}$. The global symmetries derived via these two strategies are intrinsic to topological phases and are thus termed blood symmetries, as opposed to adopted symmetries, which can be arbitrarily imposed on topological phases. We propose the concept of symmetry-gauging family of topological phases, which are related by gauging their blood symmetries. With our approach, we construct the first explicit lattice realization of a nonabelian-symmetry-enriched topological phase -- the $S_3$ symmetry-enriched $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum-double phase. The approach further reveals the role of local excitations in SET phases and establishes their symmetry constraints.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Gravitational Waves from Anisotropic Axion Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a powerful probe of the early universe due to their ability to free-stream across cosmic history. We study GW production in a compelling scenario where a rotating axion(-like) field becomes relevant for a brief period in the early universe before transitioning into a kination fluid and rapidly dissipating its energy through cosmic expansion. During this short epoch, the curvature perturbation can be predominantly sourced by the rotating axion and may significantly exceed the adiabatic component. Moreover, axion field perturbations grow on superhorizon scales during this phase. These effects can generate a strong stochastic background of induced GWs. This GW background also exhibits a pronounced large-scale anisotropy inherited from the axion fluctuations, serving as a distinctive signature of the scenario. Importantly, the transient nature of axion relevance enables this scenario to evade stringent bounds on large-scale perturbations. We analyze various observational constraints and find that both the amplitude and anisotropy of the resulting GW signal could be accessible to future detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an exact version of the Schwinger Proper Time Renormalisation Group flow equation from first principles from the complete path integral, without using any perturbative expansion. We study the advantages of this flow equation as compared to the canonical Exact Renormalisation Group flow equation, which uses a regulator in momentum space. We use our flow equation to recover the convexity of the effective scalar potential in the IR limit and apply it to the study of false-vacuum decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15484v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that all tree-level $n$-point supergluon (scalar) amplitudes in AdS$_5$ can be recursively constructed, using factorization and flat-space limit. Our method is greatly facilitated by a natural R-symmetry basis for planar color-ordered amplitudes, which reduces the latter to "partial amplitudes" with simpler pole structures and factorization properties. Given the $n$-point scalar amplitude, we first extract spinning amplitudes with $n{-}2$ scalars and one gluon by imposing "gauge invariance", and then use a special "no-gluon kinematics" to determine the $(n{+}1)$-point scalar amplitude completely (which in turn contains the $n$-point single-gluon amplitude). Explicit results of up to 8-point scalar amplitudes and up to 6-point single-gluon amplitudes are included as Supplemental Material.</description>

      <title>Allowed Coulomb branch scaling dimensions of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 2$ SCFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A basic datum of a rank-$r$ $\mathcal{N}{=}2$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) is the $r$-tuple of its Coulomb branch scaling dimensions, i.e., the scaling dimensions of a set of special protected scalar operators whose vevs generate the coordinate ring of the Coulomb branch of the theory. It is well known that when the coordinate ring is freely generated these scaling dimensions can only take values in a small set of rational numbers. But there are further constraints on which $r$-tuples of these numbers can appear. The main aim of this work is to clarify what these are. Along the way we also compute explicitly the $r$-tuples of allowed scaling dimensions for theories of ranks $r = 2, 3, 4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect on cosmological evolution of a strongly coupled quantum field that undergoes renormalization group flow from a UV CFT to an IR CFT. The field theory is defined by perturbation of a holographic CFT by a relevant operator associated with a bulk scalar field that evolves from a local maximum of its potential near the boundary to a local minimum of its potential deep in the bulk. By studying the gravity solutions dual to this theory on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$, we find that the equation of state parameter $w$ for the field theory has the conformal behavior $w=1/3$ for high and low temperatures, but dips to lower values for intermediate temperatures. Thus, at scales where the field theory has significant scale-dependence, its effect on cosmological evolution is intermediate between matter and radiation. Compared to the unperturbed UV CFT (which acts as radiation), the energy density experiences less dilution during the expansion as a result of the RG flow, and the rate of expansion is greater.</description>

      <title>A $3D$ Field-Theoretic Model: Discrete Duality Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the discrete duality symmetry between the Abelian 1-form and 2-form basic gauge fields in the context of a three $(2 + 1)$-dimensional ($3D$) combined system of the field-theoretic model of the free Abelian 1-from and 2-form gauge theories within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism. The classical gauge-fixed Lagrangian density of this theory is generalized to its quantum counterpart as the BRST and co-BRST invariant Lagrangian density. We show clearly the existence of the off-shell nilpotent (co-)BRST symmetry transformations and establish their intimate connection through a set of underlying discrete duality symmetry transformations in our $3D$ BRST-quantized theory. We provide the mathematical basis for the existence of the discrete duality symmetry transformations in our theory through the Hodge duality operator (that is defined on the $3D$ flat Minkowskian spacetime manifold). We briefly mention a bosonic symmetry transformation which is constructed from the anticommutator of the above off-shell nilpotent (co-)BRST symmetry transformations. We lay emphasis on the algebraic structures of the existing continuous and discrete duality symmetry transformations for our $3D$ BRST-quantized theory (where they are treated as operators). We also comment on the appearance of a pseudo-scalar field (with negative kinetic term). This field happens to be one of the possible candidates for the phantom field of the cosmological models.</description>

Abstract: We find a holographic reconstruction formula for gravitational Wilson line network operators in AdS$_2$ evaluated between Ishibashi states of the algebra $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$. It is given in integral form where the integrand is the global conformal block multiplied by a smearing function which is the product of the scalar bulk-to-boundary propagators. The integral can be explicitly calculated as multidimensional series of which arguments are rational functions of endpoint coordinates. In the case of two and three endpoints the resulting expressions allow one to establish a number of relations between the gravitational Wilson line networks and Witten diagrams for massive scalar fields in AdS$_2$.</description>

Abstract: We study null hypersurfaces approaching null infinity in asymptotically flat spacetimes within the Bondi-Sachs gauge. The null Raychaudhuri constraint is shown to asymptote to the Bondi mass-loss formula, interpreted as a stress tensor conservation law. This stress tensor, the null Brown-York tensor, yields a Carrollian stress tensor at null infinity from the bulk. Furthermore, we establish that the canonical phase space on finite-distance null hypersurfaces asymptotes to the Ashtekar-Streubel phase space. This connection between finite-distance null physics and null infinity unveils promising insights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using real-time holography, we investigate fluctuation-dissipation relations in holographic systems at finite density. In the bulk, it corresponds to the study of scattering of a charged scalar field against a charged black hole background, leading to an exterior field theory outside the AdS Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. This theory captures dissipation (from infalling Quasi-normal modes) and fluctuations (from Hawking radiation). Here, we also develop a Witten diagrammatic framework for computing $n$-point functions for interacting charged scalars. From the boundary perspective, it gives real-time correlations of the dual CFT held at finite temperature and finite chemical potential. Our results yield (non)-linear holographic fluctuation-dissipation relations at small but finite density, which are shown to recover the correct behaviour in the zero-density limit.</description>

Abstract: A class of higher-spin gauge theories on $AdS_4$ associated with various Coxeter groups $\mathcal{C}$ is analyzed at the linear order. For a general $\mathcal{C}$, a solution corresponding to the $AdS_4$ space and the form of the free unfolded equations are established. A disentanglement criterion has been formulated for Coxeter HS modules. The shifted homotopy technique is uplifted to the general Coxeter HS models. In case of the Coxeter group $B_2$ classification of unitary HS modules and a consistent truncation to them are determined, the dynamical content is discussed briefly.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the general analytic solution space for relativistic $(1+1)$-dimensional hydrodynamics for a perfect fluid flowing along the longitudinal direction. We work out the explicit one-parameter family of interpolating flows between boost-invariant and boost-non-invariant regimes, where a direct and simple dialing of the parameter at the level of solutions is possible. We also discuss the construction of generalised rapidity distribution of entropy for such interpolating flows at the level of potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider correlation functions of two maximal giant gravitons and two light $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS operators in 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. Viewed as two-point correlators in the presence of a zero dimensional defect, they can be completely fixed at strong coupling using analytic bootstrap techniques. We determine all infinitely such correlators for arbitrary light $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS operators and find that the result can be repackaged into a simple generating function thanks to a hidden higher dimensional symmetry. We also find evidence that the same symmetry holds at weak coupling for loop correction integrands.</description>

      <title>The exact WKB for dynamical and geometric exponents in generalized and non-linear Landau-Zener transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric phases and exponents (complex phases) introduced by Berry have been discussed in wide areas. The themes covered are wide-ranging and include applications of topology to various areas of physics, as well as research into non-perturbative discontinuities. On the other hand, problems arose in conventional calculations because the singular perturbation has been treated as normal approximation. The exact WKB is a mathematical method that treats perturbative expansion with respect to the Planck constant as a rigorous singular perturbation. This method, initiated by Voros, is also a powerful computational tool that can replace conventional approximations with exact results and also makes the analytical computation much easier for mathematical software. The ambiguity regarding the Planck constant, which was an issue in conventional calculations, is completely eliminated in the exact WKB. This allows for a more rigorous verification of consistency between theory and experiment. Changes in the global structure resulting from the deformation of Stokes lines reflect changes in the theoretical structure and are important indicators that facilitate a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. Using the exact WKB, we analyze the derivation of the dynamical and the geometric exponents in generalized Landau-Zener models, highlighting the differences from other calculational methods. The discontinuity of complex geometric factor is a universal phenomenon that manifests itself in phase transitions, boundaries, particle generation, and topology changes. These phenomena are ``non-perturbative'' in physics, while mathematically, these discontinuities can be deeply related to the singular structure of complex analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the maximal gauge groups arising in $E_8$ heterotic string theory on $T^2$. Our analysis proceeds along two approaches. First, we start the moduli space of the supersymmetric heterotic string theory on $T^2$ focusing on points of maximal gauge enhancement. At these special points, the charge lattice can exhibit a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ outer automorphism corresponding to the bulk gauge symmetry. By orbifolding the worldsheet theory by it with the fermion parity, we obtain the maximal gauge group of the $E_8$ theory. Second, we directly study the toroidal compactification of 10d $E_8$ heterotic string. Both approaches agree, yielding a classification of $22$ maximal gauge groups. For each case, we present the corresponding massless spectrum. In light of the no global symmetry/cobordism conjecture in quantum gravity, our result also offer a classification of non-supersymmetric branes in 8d supersymmetric heterotic string theories.</description>

Abstract: We show that a large central charge conformal field theory with $W_3$ symmetry exhibits violation of the conjectured operator growth bound if the Liouvillian is modified to incorporate $W_3$ generators. We get 23 classes of Lanczos coefficients, obtained by the action of the Liouvillian on a descendant state. Among these, 10 classes of Lanczos coefficients violate the conjectured upper bound by exhibiting a faster-than-linear growth with the descendant level $N$. Two classes of them have asymptotic growth saturating at $N^2$, displaying maximal violation.</description>

      <title>Effect of non-conformal deformation on the gapped quasinormal modes and its holographic implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral curve of quasinormal modes for a massive real scalar field in the background of a non-conformal black brane geometry has been obtained by utilizing a Frobenius type near-horizon expansion. The gauge/gravity duality maps this to the computation of spectral curve of a massive scalar operator $\mathcal{O}_{\phi}$ for a large-$N$ conformal field theory with irrelevant type non-conformal deformation. In this context, non-conformality has been holographically introduced by using the Einstein-dilaton theory with Liouville type dilaton potential as the bulk theory. It has been observed that the obtained quasinormal modes are characterized by specific gapped dispersion relations. The pole-skipping points have also been computed and classified based upon different dispersion relations satisfied by them. The effect of non-conformality is evident from these results. Analytic form of the mentioned gapped dispersion relation have been obtained in the long wavelength limit by setting the mass of the scalar field to zero. The coefficients appearing in the momenta of the dispersion relation also captures the signature of non-conformal deformation. The radius of convergence of the derivative expansion in the momentum space is then computed from the critical points of the spectral curve. It has been observed that presence of non-conformality increases the domain of applicability for the derivative expansion in momentum space, as it increases the radius of convergence for a given conformal dimension. The comparison between the convergence radii and the absolute momenta corresponding to lowest order pole-skipping points also leads to some interesting findings.</description>

Abstract: Recently, new superparticle models have been proposed in the $\mathcal{N}$-extended four and five-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspaces, AdS$^{4|4\mathcal{N}}$ and AdS$^{5|8\mathcal{N}}$, making use of a unique quadratic deformation to the AdS supersymmetric interval. In this paper we extend these considerations to the three and two-dimensional cases, and propose new two-derivative models for superparticles propagating in these AdS superspaces.</description>

      <title>Gauge interactions and the Galilean limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gauge invariant minimal couplings for a class of relativistic free matter fields with global symmetry (related to usual charge conservation) have been obtained by incorporating an iterative Noether mechanism. Non-relativistic reduction of both matter and gauge sectors of the obtained interacting theory is then performed simultaneously which in turn yield a set of new effective actions which are invariant under the Galilean relativistic framework. To be precise, we show that one can obtain the Schr\"odinger field theory coupled to Galilean electromagnetism from the scalar quantum electrodynamics theory. Higher derivative corrections have also been included for which the non-relativistic reduction has been carried out once again. Inclusion of higher derivative corrections is also consistent in this context. On the other hand, the action for quantum electrodynamics leads to the Galilean Pauli-Schr\"odinger theory where the gauge field is non-relativistic or Galilean. Further, some novel relations are found (in both the electric and magnetic limits) between various components appearing in the Galilean avatar of electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Holography on Biregular Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a discrete model of holography on biregular trees, which are discrete symmetric spaces associated with the bulk isometry group SU(3) over the unramified quadratic extension of a nonarchimedean field. For a scalar field theory on biregular trees, the bulk-to-bulk and bulk-to-boundary propagators exhibit distinct features absent on the regular tree or continuum AdS spaces, arising from the semihomogeneous nature of the bulk space. We compute the two- and three-point correlators of the putative boundary dual. The three-point correlator exhibits a nontrivial "tensor structure" via dependence on the homogeneity degree of a unique bulk point specified in terms of boundary insertion points. The computed OPE coefficients show dependence on zeta functions associated with the unramified quadratic extension of a nonarchimedean field. This work initiates the formulation of holography on a family of discrete holographic spaces that exhibit features of both flat space and negatively curved space.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Normal Modes and Nonlinear Electrodynamics in Black Hole Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between thermodynamic phase transitions and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in charged black holes with a positive curvature constant, within the framework of $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity. Nonlinear electromagnetic fields lead to rich thermodynamic phase structures and significantly affect the QNMs of massless scalar fields. By analyzing the QNMs spectrum, we find that the transition point marking the disappearance of divergence in the QNMs slope parameter $K$ aligns with the change of the thermodynamic phase structure described by the heat capacity, within the bounds of computational uncertainty. This precise matching holds under variations of curvature parameters and charge. Furthermore, we show that larger angular quantum number $l$ diminishes this correspondence, while higher overtone number $n$ restores it beyond a threshold. These findings demonstrate that thermodynamic phase transitions of black holes carry embedded dynamical information, uncovering a fundamental link between black hole thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a consistent three-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory as a vector-tensor theory within the generalized Proca class by employing a regularization procedure based on the Weyl geometry, which was introduced recently in arXiv:2504.13084. We then obtain an asymptotically AdS$_3$, static, and circularly symmetric black hole solution with primary Proca hair. Afterwards, we investigate the effect of the scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet coupling constructed previously by different regularization schemes. We further generalize these solutions by incorporating an electric charge. As special cases, we find a regular black hole solution in addition to charged and uncharged stealth BTZ black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Phase Transitions in Large $N$ Matrix Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is believed that the theory of quantum gravity describing our universe is unitary. Nonetheless, if we only have access to a subsystem, its dynamics is described by nonequilibrium physics. Motivated by this, we investigate the planar limit of large $N$ one-matrix quantum mechanics obeying the Lindblad master equation with dissipative jump terms, focusing on the existence, uniqueness, and properties of steady states. After showing that Lindblad dissipation is absent in the gauged model at large $N$, we study nonequilibrium phase transitions in planar ungauged matrix quantum mechanics. In the first class of examples, where potentials are unbounded from below, we study nonequilibrium critical points above which strong dissipation allows for the existence of normalizable steady states that would otherwise not exist. In the second class of examples, termed matrix quantum optics, we find evidence of nonequilibrium phase transitions analogous to those recently reported in the quantum optics literature for driven-dissipative Kerr resonators. Preliminary results on two-matrix quantum mechanics are also presented. We implement bootstrap methods to obtain concrete and rigorous results for the nonequilibrium steady states of matrix quantum mechanics in the planar limit.</description>

      <title>Generalization of anomaly formula for time reversal symmetry in (2+1)D abelian bosonic TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study time-reversal symmetry in (2+1)-dimensional abelian bosonic topological phases. Z_2 x Z_2 classifies the time-reversal anomalies in such systems symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in (3+1) dimensions and can be diagnosed via partition functions on manifolds such as RP^4 and CP^2. These partition functions are related by an anomaly formula of the form Z(RP^4) * Z(CP^2) = theta_M, where theta_M is the Dehn twist phase associated with the crosscap state.
  Meanwhile, the existence of gapped boundaries is constrained by so-called higher central charges, denoted xi_n, which serve as computable invariants encoding obstruction data. Motivated by the known relation Z(CP^2) = xi_1, we propose a generalization of the anomaly formula involving both the higher central charges xi_n and a new time-reversal invariant eta_n. By introducing a distinguished subset M^n of the set A of anyons, we establish the relation
  eta_n * xi_n = (sum of theta(a)^n over a in M^n) divided by its absolute value.
  This generalizes the known anomaly formula. We analyze the algebraic structure of the subset M^n, derive consistency relations it satisfies, and clarify its connection to the original anomaly formula.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Phases as a New Window on Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how low-frequency gravitational waves (LFGWs), originating from distant astrophysical or cosmological sources, can induce purely quantum geometric phases in mesoscopic optomechanical systems. These phases represent subtle imprints with no classical counterpart, going beyond standard dynamical or Berry-type contributions that admit Hannay-angle analogues. Such ultra-weak waves couple to the motion of a mechanical mirror and generate distinctive phase shifts in the system's quantum state that cannot arise in any classical description. To access this effect, we propose a Ramsey-type interferometric protocol in which the photon-number states of a quantized optical mode become entangled with the mirror's center-of-mass motion, enabling a direct readout of the LFGW-induced geometric phase. This framework establishes a distinctly quantum approach for probing low-frequency gravitational wave modes, offering an alternative to conventional detection strategies based on spacetime strain.</description>

      <title>Near-Horizon Collisions around Near-Extremal Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black holes have sometimes been described as astrophysical particle accelerators because finite energy particles can collide near the horizon with divergent center-of-mass (CM) energy. The collisions are classified by the radial motion of the constituent particles at the moment of collision, with each class exhibiting a distinct near-horizon behavior. Divergence in the CM energy is sourced by the difference in the rate at which the collision radius approaches the horizon and the rate at which a particle's angular momentum is tuned to a critical value set by the superradiant bound. To produce a high energy collision around a near-extremal BH, at least one particle must approach criticality slower than the collision radius approaches the horizon. When both particles are ingoing or outgoing, it is additionally required that the particles approach criticality at different rates. Using a novel multi-scaling limit, we calculate the explicit form for the divergent CM energy. The angular momentum of some circular orbiters -- including those at the innermost stable circular orbit radius and innermost bound circular orbit radius -- approach criticality as the BH approaches extremality, indicating near-extremal BHs may be a natural environment for these high-energy collisions.</description>

      <title>Possibility of quantum Hall effect in dense quark matter environments: A chiral model approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A high baryon density and strong magnetic fields are expected in peripheral collisions in heavy ion collision experiments, such as the upcoming CBM experiment at FAIR in Germany and NICA in Russia. Such densities are also likely in the core of massive neutron stars, possibly with mixed quark-hadron phases. We employed the chiral effective model to obtain the constituent quark mass in this non-perturbative QCD regime. A quantized version of conductivity and resistivity is found reliable in the quantum domain of low density and high magnetic fields. Landau quantization gives rise to phenomena similar to SdH oscillations and quantum Hall effect in this regime. We have used a density-dependent magnetic field to observe SdH-type oscillations and the possibility of the quantum Hall effect in the interior of neutron stars where the magnetic field varies as a function of the baryon density. Our results indicate the possibility of observing the quantum Hall effect in a neutron star environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a (1+1)D lattice model, inspired by a weak Hopf algebra generalization of the cluster state model, which realizes Haagerup fusion category symmetry and features a tensor product Hilbert space. The construction begins with a reconstruction of the Haagerup weak Hopf algebra $H_3$ from the Haagerup fusion category, ensuring that the representation category of $H_3$ is equivalent to Haagerup fusion category. Utilizing the framework of symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), we develop an ultra-thin weak Hopf quantum double model, characterized by a smooth topological boundary condition. We show that this model supports Haagerup fusion category symmetry. Finally, we solve the ground state of the model in terms of a weak Hopf matrix product state, which serves as a natural generalization of the cluster state, embodying Haagerup fusion category symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Conformal field theory underlies critical ground states of quantum many-body systems. While conventional conformal field theory is associated with positive central charges, nonunitary conformal field theory with complex-valued central charges has recently been recognized as physically relevant. Here, we demonstrate that complex-valued entanglement entropy characterizes complex conformal field theory and critical phenomena of open quantum many-body systems. This is based on non-Hermitian reduced density matrices constructed from the combination of right and left ground states. Applying the density matrix renormalization group to non-Hermitian systems, we numerically calculate the complex entanglement entropy of the non-Hermitian five-state Potts model, thereby confirming the scaling behavior predicted by complex conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Detecting emergent 1-form symmetries with quantum error correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-form symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system and they can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose a quantitative criterion for the existence of 1-form symmetries motivated by quantum error correction (QEC). We show that the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition revealed from the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. The latter can be solved by mapping the ensemble of post-measurement states to the partition sum of a random bond Ising model along the Nishimori line. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to detect 1-form symmetries with a global Minimal-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As an application of our protocol, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transition characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately detected by a disorder parameter. By exploiting ideas from quantum error correction, our work develops an information-theoretic criterion for emergent 1-form symmetries, which furthers our understanding of exotic symmetries and offers practical routes toward their characterization.</description>

      <title>Work Statistics via Real-Time Effective Field Theory: Application to Work Extraction from Thermal Bath with Qubit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermal states are known to be passive, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. This paper investigates the potential for work extraction by coupling a thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermionic, or topological type, which acts as a quantum thermal state at different temperatures. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. Although the work statistics of many-body systems are known to be challenging to calculate explicitly, we propose an effective field theory approach to tackle this problem by assuming the externally driven source couples to a specific quasiparticle operator of the thermal state. We show that the work statistics can be expressed succinctly in terms of this quasiparticle's thermal spectral function. We obtain the non-perturbative work distribution function (WDF) for the pure thermal bath without the qubit coupling. With qubit coupling, we get the second-order WDF, from which the physical regime of work extraction can be pinned down precisely to help devise quantum heat engines or refrigerators. Their efficiency or coefficient of performance (COP) can be inferred from the combination of the fluctuation theorem and the first law, and we find that the spin/topological qubit-bath system generally yields a far better heat engine/refrigerator than the other two alternatives due to the underlying quantum statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we modify the $\Lambda$CDM model by introducing a deformed algebra within the framework of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). We formulate the modified Raychaudhuri equation, where new terms are introduced which describe dynamical pressure components. For the quadratic GUP model, we derive the Hubble function, which leads to a time-dependent dark energy model. The free parameters are determined using late-time observational data, the Pantheon+ SNIa sample, the cosmic chronometers, and the DESI 2025 BAO data. We find that the modified model introduce only one new additional degree of freedom compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. The GUP-Modified $\Lambda$CDM model provides a better fit to the data than the undeformed theory. Furthermore, we compare the same model with the DESI 2024 BAO data and find that the Bayesian evidence becomes stronger with the inclusion of the DESI 2025 release.</description>

      <title>Optimal bound on long-range distillable entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an upper bound on long-range distillable entanglement in $D$ spatial dimensions. Namely, it must decay faster than $1/r$, where $r$ is the distance between entangled regions. For states that are asymptotically rotationally invariant, the bound is strengthened to $1/r^D$. We then find explicit examples of quantum states with decay arbitrarily close to the bound. In one dimension, we construct free fermion Hamiltonians with nearest neighbor couplings that have these states as ground states. Curiously, states in conformal field theory are far from saturation, with distillable entanglement decaying faster than any polynomial.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the Hubble Tension with a Local Void and Transitions of the Absolute Magnitude</title>

Abstract: Nowadays, one of the well-known serious challenges in cosmology is the Hubble tension, namely the discrepancy between the Hubble constants from the local observation of Type Ia supernova (SNIa) and the high-$z$ observation of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Here, we are interested in alleviating the Hubble tension with a local void. The key idea is assuming that we live in a locally underdense void, where one will feel a faster expansion rate compared to the cosmic average. In the literature, it was found that a local void cannot satisfyingly alleviate the Hubble tension, since it is not preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model by the observations such as the Pantheon SNIa sample, especially in terms of the information criteria AIC and BIC. In the present work, we try to alleviate the Hubble tension with a local void and transitions of the absolute magnitude $M$, by using the Pantheon+ SNIa sample alone or jointly with the CMB data of Planck 2018. We find that the Hubble tension can be satisfyingly alleviated, while the $\Lambda$LTB void models are strongly preferred by the observations.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory treatment of the neutrino spin-flavor precession in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spin-flavor precession of neutrinos in a magnetic field within the quantum field theory approach in which neutrinos are virtual particles. Neutrinos are taken to be Majorana particles having a nonzero transition magnetic moment. We derive the dressed propagators of the neutrino mass eigenstates exactly accounting for the magnetic field contribution. The matrix element and the transition probability for the spin-flavor precession are obtained in the approximation of the forwardly scattered charged leptons. The leading term in the transition probability is shown to coincide with the result of the standard quantum mechanical description of neutrino oscillations. We also discuss the quantum field theory contributions to the neutrino dressed propagators and demonstrate that these contributions result in a small correction to the transition probability. The case of charged leptons with arbitrary energies is considered.</description>

      <title>Causality of polarizeable dissipative fluids from Lagrangian hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a causality analysis on the dispersion relation of hydrodynamics with spin well as shear and bulk viscosity, including the relaxation times for all these quantities. We find that the interplay of the three relaxational scales, for shear and bulk viscosity as well as polarization, leads to non-trivial effects on the dispersion relation. Unexpectedly, the presence of polarization leads to lower effective viscosity and a longer relaxation time, and the presence of viscosity leads to lower limits as well as upper ones on the group velocity and constraints relating polarization to viscosity relaxation times. We conclude with a qualitative discussion on how these results impact phenomenology, specifically the low effective viscosity in strongly interacting matter as well as shear-vorticity coupling.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields in the presence of the electroweak bubble wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gauge field theory of the standard electroweak model in the presence of the electroweak bubble wall is investigated with an eye toward its applications to microscopic phenomena, which are supposed to have occurred during the phase transition in the early universe. The asymptotic fields are defined anew so that the effects of the position-dependent Higgs condensate are taken into account through the position-dependent $W$ and $Z$ boson masses. A novel method of massive gauge field quantization in the $R_{\xi}$-gauge with $\xi =1$ is proposed for the case of the position-dependent masses. Our procedure is based on the eigenfunction expansion method associated with second-order differential operators, i.e., a sort of generalized Fourier expansion.The commutation relations of creation and annihilation operators of various wave propagation modes are given in terms of the so-called spectral function. The decoupling of unphysical states from the physical S-matrix is also investigated along the line of Kugo-Ojima's quartet mechanism on the basis of the BRST symmetry. It is pointed out that one of the quartet fields is not merely the unphysical scalar field but should be a linear combination of the unphysical scalar and the gauge fields. The physical and unphysical polarizations of the gauge field waves are unambiguously distinguished and this will help us evaluate the friction caused by the physical polarization states of $W$ and $Z$ boson waves on the bubble wall during the phase transition in the early universe.</description>

      <title>The Mass of the Baryon Junction: a lattice computation in 2 +1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of baryonic flux tubes in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory in (2 + 1) dimensions. A recent next-to-leading-order derivation within the Effective String theory framework has, for the first time, made explicit the correction proportional to the baryon-junction mass $M$, up to order $1/R^2$ (where $R$ id the length of thr confining string), opening the possibility of its non-perturbative determination. One of the main goals of this paper is, through high-precision simulations of the three-point Polyakov loop correlator, to measure for the first time the baryon-junction mass. By isolating the predicted $1/R^2$ term in the open strin channel, we obtain the value $M/\sqrt{\sigma}=0.1355(36)$, similar to the phenomenological value which is used to describe a hadron. In addition, studying th high temperature behaviourof the baryon, we present a new test of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for the SU(3) theory in three dimensions. Focussing on the high temperature regime just below the deconfinement transition, we compare our lattice results for Polyakov loop correlators with the quantitative prediction obtained by applying conformal perturbation theory to the three states Potts model in two dimension, and find excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>New high-frequency gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions in the early Universe are a well-motivated source of gravitational waves (GWs). In this Letter, we identify a previously overlooked GW production mechanism: gravitational transition radiation, arising from graviton emission by particles whose mass changes as they pass through expanding bubble walls. Unlike conventional sources such as bubble collisions or sound waves, this mechanism operates at the microscopic scale set by the Lorentz-contracted wall thickness, leading to GW emission at significantly higher frequencies. The resulting spectrum features a distinctive shape with a peak frequency redshifting to $f_{\rm peak}\sim T_0\sim 10^{10}\,{\rm Hz}$ where $T_0$ is the current temperature of the Universe. This mechanism is generic and is expected to operate similarly for domain walls and other relativistic interfaces.</description>
