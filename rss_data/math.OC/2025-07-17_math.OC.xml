      <title>On the factorization of matrices into products of positive definite ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work revisits and provides a new approach on a result by Charles Ballantine, on the factorization of a square matrix with positive determinant into a product of positive definite factors. {\em Ballantine-type} factorizations, that bound the number of positive definite factors, proved central in solving a basic, yet elusive control problem--the strong controllability of a linear system via control in the form of state feedback. Ballantine's result transcends control engineering, and highlights the little appreciated fact that rotations can be realized by the successive application of irrotational motions. Our approach is constructive and is based on the theory of optimal mass transport, specifically, it relates successive rotations of Gaussian distributions to corresponding optimal transport maps that constitute the sought factors.</description>

      <title>On second-order weak sharp minima of general nonconvex set-constrained optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores local second-order weak sharp minima for a broad class of nonconvex optimization problems. We propose novel second-order optimality conditions formulated through the use of classical and lower generalized support functions. These results are based on asymptotic second-order tangent cones and outer second-order tangent sets. Specifically, our findings eliminate the necessity of assuming convexity in the constraint set and/or the outer second-order tangent set, or the nonemptiness of the outer second-order tangent set. Furthermore, unlike traditional approaches, our sufficient conditions do not rely on strong assumptions such as the uniform second-order regularity of the constraint set and the property of uniform approximation of the critical cones.</description>

      <title>Fast Consensus over Almost Regular Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an open consensus network design problem: identifying the optimal simple directed graphs, given a fixed number of vertices and arcs, that maximize the second smallest real part of all Laplacian eigenvalues, referred to as algebraic connectivity. For sparse and dense graphs, the class of all optimal directed graphs that maximize algebraic connectivity is theoretically identified, leading to the fastest consensus. For general graphs, a computationally efficient sequence of almost regular directed graphs is proposed to achieve fast consensus, with algebraic connectivity close to the optimal value.</description>

      <title>Tensor-Tensor Products, Group Representations, and Semidefinite Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\star_M$-family of tensor-tensor products is a framework which generalizes many properties from linear algebra to third order tensors. Here, we investigate positive semidefiniteness and semidefinite programming under the $\star_M$-product. Critical to our investigation is a connection between the choice of matrix M in the $\star_M$-product and the representation theory of an underlying group action. Using this framework, third order tensors equipped with the $\star_M$-product are a natural setting for the study of invariant semidefinite programs. As applications of the M-SDP framework, we provide a characterization of certain nonnegative quadratic forms and solve low-rank tensor completion problems.</description>

      <title>The complete edge relaxation for binary polynomial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the multilinear polytope defined as the convex hull of the feasible region of a linearized binary polynomial optimization problem. We define a relaxation in an extended space for this polytope, which we refer to as the complete edge relaxation. The complete edge relaxation is stronger than several well-known relaxations of the multilinear polytope, including the standard linearization, the flower relaxation, and the intersection of all possible recursive McCormick relaxations. We prove that the complete edge relaxation is an extension of the multilinear polytope if and only if the corresponding hypergraph is alpha-acyclic; i.e., the most general type of hypergraph acyclicity. This is in stark contrast with the widely-used standard linearization which describes the multilinear polytope if and only if the hypergraph is Berge-acyclic; i.e., the most restrictive type of hypergraph acyclicity. We then introduce a new class of facet-defining inequalities for the multilinear polytope of alpha-cycles of length three, which serve as the generalization of the well-known triangle inequalities for the Boolean quadric polytope.</description>

      <title>Impact Analysis of Optimal EV Bi-directional Charging with Spatial-temporal Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth in Electric Vehicle (EV) market share is expected to increase power demand on distribution networks. Uncoordinated residential EV charging, based on driving routines, creates peak demand at various zone substations depending on location and time. Leveraging smart charge scheduling and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technologies offers opportunities to adjust charge schedules, allowing for load shifting and grid support, which can reduce both charging costs and grid stress. In this work, we develop a charge scheduling optimization method that can be used to assess the impact of spatial power capacity constraints and real-time price profiles. We formulate a mixed-integer linear programming problem to minimize overall charging costs, taking into account factors such as time-varying EV locations, EV charging requirements, and local power demands across different zones. Our analysis uses real data for pricing signals and local power demands, combined with simulated data for EV driving plans. Four metrics are introduced to assess impacts from the perspectives of both EV users and zones. Results indicate that overall EV charging costs are only minimally affected under extreme power capacity constraints.</description>

      <title>Geometric Stability Analysis for Differential Inclusions Governed by Maximally Monotone Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a geometric framework for the stability analysis of differential inclusions governed by maximally monotone operators. A key structural decomposition expresses the operator as the sum of a convexified limit mapping and a normal cone. However, the resulting dynamics are often difficult to analyze directly due to the absence of Lipschitz selections and boundedness. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a regularized system based on a fixed Lipschitz approximation of the convexified mapping. From this approximation, we extract a single-valued Lipschitz selection that preserves the essential geometric features of the original system. This framework enables the application of nonsmooth Lyapunov methods and Hamiltonian-based stability criteria. Instead of approximating trajectories, we focus on analyzing a simplified system that faithfully reflects the structure of the original dynamics. Several examples are provided to illustrate the method's practicality and scope.</description>

      <title>Faster stochastic cubic regularized Newton methods with momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cubic regularized Newton (CRN) methods have attracted signiffcant research interest because they offer stronger solution guarantees and lower iteration complexity. With the rise of the big-data era, there is growing interest in developing stochastic cubic regularized Newton (SCRN) methods that do not require exact gradient and Hessian evaluations. In this paper, we propose faster SCRN methods that incorporate gradient estimation with small, controlled errors and Hessian estimation with momentum-based variance reduction. These methods are particularly effective for problems where the gradient can be estimated accurately and at low cost, whereas accurate estimation of the Hessian is expensive. Under mild assumptions, we establish the iteration complexity of our SCRN methods by analyzing the descent of a novel potential sequence. Finally, numerical experiments show that our SCRN methods can achieve comparable performance to deterministic CRN methods and vastly outperform ffrst-order methods in terms of both iteration counts and solution quality.</description>

      <title>A Nonparallel Support Tensor Machine for Binary Classification based Large Margin Distribution and Iterative Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the tensor-based large margin distribution and the nonparallel support tensor machine, we establish a novel classifier for binary classification problem in this paper, termed the Large Margin Distribution based NonParallel Support Tensor Machine (LDM-NPSTM). The proposed classifier has the following advantages: First, it utilizes tensor data as training samples, which helps to comprehensively preserve the inherent structural information of high-dimensional data, thereby improving classification accuracy. Second, this classifier not only considers traditional empirical risk and structural risk but also incorporates the marginal distribution information of the samples, further enhancing its classification performance. To solve this classifier, we use alternative projection algorithm. Specifically, building on the formulation where in the proposed LDM-NPSTM, the parameters defining the separating hyperplane form a tensor (tensorplane) constrained to be the sum of rank-one tensors, the corresponding optimization problem is solved iteratively using alternative projection algorithm. In each iteration, the parameters related to the projections along a single tensor mode are estimated by solving a typical Support Vector Machine-type optimization problem. Finally, the efficiency and performance of the proposed model and algorithm are verified through theoretical analysis and some numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Ground Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data classification without access to labeled samples remains a challenging problem. It usually depends on an appropriately chosen distance between features, a topic addressed in metric learning. Recently, Huizing, Cantini and Peyr\'e proposed to simultaneously learn optimal transport (OT) cost matrices between samples and features of the dataset. This leads to the task of finding positive eigenvectors of a certain nonlinear function that maps cost matrices to OT distances. Having this basic idea in mind, we consider both the algorithmic and the modeling part of unsupervised metric learning. First, we examine appropriate algorithms and their convergence. In particular, we propose to use the stochastic random function iteration algorithm and prove that it converges linearly for our setting, although our operators are not paracontractive as it was required for convergence so far. Second, we ask the natural question if the OT distance can be replaced by other distances. We show how Mahalanobis-like distances fit into our considerations. Further, we examine an approach via graph Laplacians. In contrast to the previous settings, we have just to deal with linear functions in the wanted matrices here, so that simple algorithms from linear algebra can be applied.</description>

      <title>A meaningful optimal control problem in quantum and classical physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study and solve an optimal control problem motivated by applications in quantum and classical physics. Although apparently simple, this optimal control problem is not easy to solve and we resort to various elaborated methods of optimal control theory. We finally show its relationships to two problems in physics: the computation of the ground state for 1D Schr{\"o}dinger operators with a finite potential well, and the optimal dynamical Kapitza stabilization problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the regularity of quasi-minimal sets (in the sense of David and Semmes) with a boundary condition, which can be interpreted as quasi-minimizers of Plateau's problem in co-dimension one. For these Plateau-quasi-minimizers, we establish the optimal regularity, which is a characterization by bi-John domains with Ahlfors regular boundaries. This requires to investigate the Ahlfors regularity and also the uniform rectifiability of those sets, up to the boundary.</description>

      <title>Distributed Nash Equilibrium Seeking in Non-Monotone Games over the Simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel characterization of approximate Nash equilibria in a class of convex games over the simplex. To achieve this, we regularize the utility functions using the Shannon entropy term, connect the solutions to the regularized game with the set of Nash equilibria, and formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to solve the regularized game. Based on the obtained properties of the stationary points in this optimization problem, we formulate two distributed heuristic algorithms to compute an approximate Nash equilibrium of the original game.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a class of $\alpha$-potential stochastic differential games with random coefficients via the backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) approach. Specifically, we show that the first and second order linear derivatives of the objective function for each player can be expressed through the corresponding first and second-order adjoint equations, which leads to rigorous estimates for $\alpha$. We illustrate the dependence of $\alpha$ on game characteristics through detailed analysis of linear-quadratic games, and with common noise.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Weakly Convex Optimization Under Heavy-Tailed Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing number of studies have focused on stochastic first-order methods (SFOMs) under heavy-tailed gradient noises, which have been observed in the training of practical deep learning models. In this paper, we focus on two types of gradient noises: one is sub-Weibull noise, and the other is noise under the assumption that it has a bounded $p$-th central moment ($p$-BCM) with $p\in (1, 2]$. The latter is more challenging due to the occurrence of infinite variance when $p\in (1, 2)$. Under these two gradient noise assumptions, the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs have been extensively studied in the contexts of convex optimization and standard smooth optimization. However, for weakly convex objectives-a class that includes all Lipschitz-continuous convex objectives and smooth objectives-our understanding of the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs under these two types of noises remains incomplete. We investigate the high-probability convergence of the vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) method under sub-Weibull noises, as well as the high-probability and in-expectation convergence of clipped SsGD under the $p$-BCM noises. Both analyses are conducted in the context of weakly convex optimization. For weakly convex objectives that may be non-convex and non-smooth, our results demonstrate that the theoretical dependence of vanilla SsGD on the failure probability and number of iterations under sub-Weibull noises does not degrade compared to the case of smooth objectives. Under $p$-BCM noises, our findings indicate that the non-smoothness and non-convexity of weakly convex objectives do not impact the theoretical dependence of clipped SGD on the failure probability relative to the smooth case; however, the sample complexity we derived is worse than a well-known lower bound for smooth optimization.</description>

      <title>Coarse Addition and the St. Petersburg Paradox: A Heuristic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The St. Petersburg paradox presents a longstanding challenge in decision theory. It describes a game whose expected value is infinite, yet for which no rational finite stake can be determined. Traditional solutions introduce auxiliary assumptions, such as diminishing marginal utility, temporal discounting, or extended number systems. These methods often involve mathematical refinements that may not correspond to how people actually perceive or process numerical information. This paper explores an alternative approach based on a modified operation of addition defined over coarse partitions of the outcome space. In this model, exact numerical values are grouped into perceptual categories, and each value is replaced by a representative element of its group before being added. This method allows for a phenomenon where repeated additions eventually cease to affect the outcome, a behavior described as inertial stabilization. Although this is not intended as a definitive resolution of the paradox, the proposed framework offers a plausible way to represent how agents with limited cognitive precision might handle divergent reward structures. We demonstrate that the St. Petersburg series can become inert under this coarse addition for a suitably constructed partition. The approach may also have broader applications in behavioral modeling and the study of machine reasoning under perceptual limitations.</description>

      <title>A Stackelberg Game of Demand Response from the Aggregator's Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate on the modeling of demand response activities between the single aggregator and multiple participating consumers. The model incorporates the bilevel structure that naturally occurs in the information structure and decision sequence, where the aggregator assumes the role of a leader and the participating consumers play the role of followers. The proposed model is demonstrated to be effective in load control, helping the aggregator to meet the target reduction while the consumers pay cheaper electricity bill.</description>

      <title>Invariance Guarantees using Continuously Parametrized Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing a control invariant set with an appropriate shape that fits within a given state constraint is a fundamental problem in safety-critical control but is known to be difficult, especially for large or complex spaces. This paper introduces a safe control framework of utilizing PCBF: continuously parametrized control barrier functions (CBFs). In PCBF, each choice of parameter corresponds to a control invariant set of relatively simple shape. Invariance-preserving control is done by dynamically selecting a parameter whose corresponding invariant set lies within the safety bound. This eliminates the need for synthesizing a single complex CBF that matches the entire free space. It also enables easier adaptation to diverse environments. By assigning a differentiable dynamics on the parameter space, we derive a lightweight feedback controller based on quadratic programming (QP), namely PCBF-QP. We also discuss on how to build a valid PCBF for a class of systems and how to constrain the parameter so that the invariant set does not exceed the safety bound. The concept is also extended to cover continuously parametrized high-order CBFs, which is called high-order PCBF. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted to validate the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A 1/2-Approximation for Budgeted $k$-Submodular Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $k$-submodular function naturally generalizes submodular functions by taking as input $k$ disjoint subsets, rather than a single subset. Unlike standard submodular maximization, which only requires selecting elements for the solution, $k$-submodular maximization adds the challenge of determining the subset to which each selected element belongs. Prior research has shown that the greedy algorithm is a 1/2-approximation for the monotone $k$-submodular maximization problem under cardinality or matroid constraints. However, whether a firm 1/2-approximation exists for the budgeted version (i.e., with a knapsack constraint) has remained open for several years. We resolve this question affirmatively by proving that the 1-Guess Greedy algorithm, which first guesses an appropriate element from an optimal solution before proceeding with the greedy algorithm, achieves a 1/2-approximation. This result is asymptotically tight as $((k+1)/(2k)+\epsilon)$-approximation requires exponentially many value oracle queries even without constraints (Iwata et al., SODA 2016). We further show that 1-Guess Greedy is 1/3-approximation for the non-monotone problem. This algorithm is both simple and parallelizable, making it well-suited for practical applications. Using the thresholding technique from (Badanidiyuru and Vondrak, SODA 2014), it runs in nearly $\tilde O(n^2k^2)$ time.
  The proof idea is simple: we introduce a novel continuous transformation from an optimal solution to a greedy solution, using the multilinear extension to evaluate every fractional solution during the transformation. This continuous analysis approach yields two key extensions. First, it enables improved approximation ratios of various existing algorithms. Second, our method naturally extends to $k$-submodular maximization problems under broader constraints, offering a more flexible and unified analysis framework.</description>

      <title>From a Mixed-Policy Perspective: Improving Differentiable Automatic Post-editing Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces two novel modifications to the Differentiable Automatic Post-editing Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, approached from a mixed-policy perspective. Standard policy gradient methods can suffer from instability and sample inefficiency, particularly in sparse reward settings. To address this, we first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding policy ($\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the training of the target policy ($\pion$). This approach improves training stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size. Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods, demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning. The proposed mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and exploitation, promising more stable and efficient policy optimization.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, several notions of non-rigidity of horizontal vectors in Carnot groups have been proposed, motivated, in particular, by the characterization of monotone sets and Whitney extension properties. In this note we compare some of these notions, proving that pliability, strong pliability, and the openness property of the multi-exponential map known as (H)-condition are all equivalent.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic algorithm for computing all local minimizers of Morse functions on a compact domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let K be the unit-cube in Rn and f\,: K $\rightarrow$ R^n be a Morse function. We assume that the function f is given by an evaluation program $\Gamma$ in the noisy model, i.e., the evaluation program $\Gamma$ takes an extra parameter $\eta$ as input and returns an approximation that is $\eta$-close to the true value of f . In this article, we design an algorithm able to compute all local minimizers of f on K . Our algorithm takes as input $\Gamma$, $\eta$, a numerical accuracy parameter $\epsilon$ as well as some extra regularity parameters which are made explicit. Under assumptions of probabilistic nature -- related to the choice of the evaluation points used to feed $\Gamma$ --, it returns finitely many rational points of K , such that the set of balls of radius $\epsilon$ centered at these points contains and separates the set of all local minimizers of f . Our method is based on approximation theory, yielding polynomial approximants for f , combined with computer algebra techniques for solving systems of polynomial equations. We provide bit complexity estimates for our algorithm when all regularity parameters are known. Practical experiments show that our implementation of this algorithm in the Julia package Globtim can tackle examples that were not reachable until now.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Primal-Dual Q-Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:1810.08298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new model-free and off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, that is capable of finding a near-optimal policy with state-action observations from arbitrary behavior policies. Our algorithm, called the stochastic primal-dual Q-learning (SPD Q-learning), hinges upon a new linear programming formulation and a dual perspective of the standard Q-learning. In contrast to previous primal-dual RL algorithms, the SPD Q-learning includes a Q-function estimation step, thus allowing to recover an approximate policy from the primal solution as well as the dual solution. We prove a first-of-its-kind result that the SPD Q-learning guarantees a certain convergence rate, even when the state-action distribution is time-varying but sub-linearly converges to a stationary distribution. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the off-policy learning abilities of the proposed algorithm in comparison to the standard Q-learning.</description>

      <title>Admission Control for A Single Server Waiting Time Process in Heavy Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address a single server queue control problem (QCP) in heavy traffic originating from Lee and Weerasinghe (2011). The state process represents the offered waiting time, the customer arrival has a state-dependent intensity, and the customers' service and patience times are i.i.d with general distributions. We introduce an infinite-horizon discounted cost functional consisting of a control cost generated from the use of control and a penalty for idleness cost. Our primary goal is to tackle the QCP, taking into account a non-trivial control cost and a non-increasing cost function resulting from the control mechanisms in the waiting time. Under mild assumptions, the heavy traffic limit of the QCP yields a stochastic control problem described by a diffusion process, which we call a diffusion control problem (DCP). We find the optimal control of the associated DCP by incorporating the Legendre-Fenchel transform and a formal Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Then, we ``translate'' this optimal strategy to the QCP, of which we obtain an asymptotically optimal policy. Apart from theoretical results, we also examine the REINFORCE algorithm, a Reinforcement learning (RL) approach, for solving stochastic controls motivated by recent literature. We highlight the advantages and limitations of simulation from theoretical results and data-driven algorithms.</description>

      <title>Distributed Truncated Predictive Control for Networked Systems under Uncertainty: Stability and Near-Optimality Guarantee</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of distributed online control of networked systems with time-varying cost functions and disturbances, where each node only has local information of the states and forecasts of the costs and disturbances. We develop a distributed truncated predictive control (DTPC) algorithm, where each node solves a ``truncated'' predictive optimal control problem with horizon $k$, but only involving nodes in a $\kappa$-hop neighborhood (ignoring nodes outside). We show that the DTPC algorithm satisfies input-to-state stability (ISS) bounds and has regret decaying exponentially in $k$ and $\kappa$, meaning a short predictive horizon $k$ and a small truncation radius $\kappa$ is sufficient to achieve near-optimal performance. Furthermore, we show that when the future costs and disturbances are not exactly known, the regret has exponentially decaying sensitivity to the forecast errors in terms of predictive horizon, meaning near-term forecast errors play a much more important role than longer-term forecasts.</description>

      <title>Curve fitting on a quantum annealer for an advanced navigation method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the applicability of quantum annealing to the approximation task of curve fitting. To this end, we consider a function that shall approximate a given set of data points and is written as a finite linear combination of standardized functions, e.g., orthogonal polynomials. Consequently, the decision variables subject to optimization are the coefficients of that expansion. Although this task can be accomplished classically, it can also be formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem, which is suited to be solved with quantum annealing. Given the size of the problem stays below a certain threshold, we find that quantum annealing yields comparable results to the classical solution. Regarding a real-world use case, we discuss the problem to find an optimized speed profile for a vessel using the framework of dynamic programming and outline how the aforementioned approximation task can be put into play.</description>

      <title>A column generation algorithm with dynamic constraint aggregation for minimum sum-of-squares clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimum sum-of-squares clustering problem (MSSC), also known as $k$-means clustering, refers to the problem of partitioning $n$ data points into $k$ clusters, with the objective of minimizing the total sum of squared Euclidean distances between each point and the center of its assigned cluster. We propose an efficient algorithm for solving large-scale MSSC instances, which combines column generation (CG) with dynamic constraint aggregation (DCA) to effectively reduce the number of constraints considered in the CG master problem. DCA was originally conceived to reduce degeneracy in set partitioning problems by utilizing an aggregated restricted master problem obtained from a partition of the set partitioning constraints into disjoint clusters. In this work, we explore the use of DCA within a CG algorithm for MSSC exact solution. Our method is fine-tuned by a series of ablation studies on DCA design choices, and is demonstrated to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art exact approaches available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Nash equilibrium seeking for a class of quadratic-bilinear Wasserstein distributionally robust games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of Wasserstein distributionally robust Nash equilibrium problems, where agents construct heterogeneous data-driven Wasserstein ambiguity sets using private samples and radii, in line with their individual risk-averse behaviour. By leveraging relevant properties of this class of games, we show that equilibria of the original seemingly infinite-dimensional problem can be obtained as a solution to a finite-dimensional Nash equilibrium problem. We then reformulate the problem as a finite-dimensional variational inequality and establish the connection between the corresponding solution sets. Our reformulation has scalable behaviour with respect to the data size and maintains a fixed number of constraints, independently of the number of samples. To compute a solution, we leverage two algorithms, based on the golden ratio algorithm. The efficiency of both algorithmic schemes is corroborated through extensive simulation studies on an illustrative example and a stochastic portfolio allocation game, where behavioural coupling among investors is modeled.</description>

Adapting an approach by Antunes and Freitas, we use gradient descent for the minimization procedure together with the Method of Fundamental solutions for eigenvalue computation. Remarkably, we observe that when the magnetic flux exceeds the index of the target eigenvalue, the minimizer is always a disk.</description>

Abstract: We introduce model-based transition rates for controlled compartmental models in mathematical epidemiology, with a focus on the effects of control strategies applied to interacting multi-agent systems describing contact formation dynamics. In the framework of kinetic control problems, we compare two prototypical control protocols: one additive control directly influencing the dynamics and another targeting the interaction strength between agents. The emerging controlled macroscopic models are derived for an SIR compartmentalization to illustrate their impact on epidemic progression and contact interaction dynamics. Numerical results show the effectiveness of this approach in steering the dynamics and controlling epidemic trends, even in scenarios where contact distributions exhibit an overpopulated tail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17260v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hilbert proved in 1888 that a positive semi-definite (PSD) homogeneous quartic polynomial of three variables always can be expressed as the sum of squares (SOS) of three quadratic polynomials, and a psd homogeneous quartic polynomial of four variables may not be sos. Only after 87 years, in 1975, Choi gave the explicit expression of such a psd-not-sos (PNS) homogeneous quartic polynomial of four variables. An $m \times n$ biquadratic polynomial is a homogeneous quartic polynomial of $m+n$ variables. In this paper, we show that an $m \times n$ biquadratic polynomial can be expressed as a tripartite homogeneous quartic polynomial of $m+n-1$ variables. Therefore, {by Hilbert's theorem}, a $2 \times 2$ PSD biquadratic polynomial can be expressed as the sum of squares of three quadratic polynomials. This improves the result of Calder\'{o}n in 1973, who proved that a $2 \times 2$ biquadratic polynomial can be expressed as the sum of squares of nine quadratic polynomials. Furthermore, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for an $m \times n$ psd biquadratic polynomial to be sos, and show that if such a polynomial is sos, then its sos rank is at most $mn$. Then we give a constructive proof of the sos form of a $2 \times 2$ psd biquadratic polynomial in three cases.</description>

Abstract: We study the convergence rate of a family of inertial algorithms, which can be obtained by discretization of an inertial system combining asymptotic vanishing viscous and Hessian-driven damping. We establish a fast sublinear convergence rate in case the objective function is convex and satisfies Polyak-\L ojasiewicz inequality. We also establish a linear convergence rate for strongly convex functions. The results can provide more insights into the convergence property of Nesterov's accelerated gradient method.</description>

      <title>Parameterized algorithms for block-structured integer programs with large entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two classic variants of block-structured integer programming. Two-stage stochastic programs are integer programs of the form $\{A_i \mathbf{x} + D_i \mathbf{y}_i = \mathbf{b}_i\textrm{ for all }i=1,\ldots,n\}$, where $A_i$ and $D_i$ are bounded-size matrices. On the other hand, $n$-fold programs are integer programs of the form $\{{\sum_{i=1}^n C_i\mathbf{y}_i=\mathbf{a}} \textrm{ and } D_i\mathbf{y}_i=\mathbf{b}_i\textrm{ for all }i=1,\ldots,n\}$, where again $C_i$ and $D_i$ are bounded-size matrices. It is known that solving these kind of programs is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the maximum dimension among the relevant matrices $A_i,C_i,D_i$ and the maximum absolute value of any entry appearing in the constraint matrix.
  We show that the parameterized tractability results for two-stage stochastic and $n$-fold programs persist even when one allows large entries in the global part of the program. More precisely, we prove that:
  - The feasibility problem for two-stage stochastic programs is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the dimensions of matrices $A_i,D_i$ and by the maximum absolute value of the entries of matrices $D_i$. That is, we allow matrices $A_i$ to have arbitrarily large entries.
  - The linear optimization problem for $n$-fold integer programs that are uniform -- all matrices $C_i$ are equal -- is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the dimensions of matrices $C_i$ and $D_i$ and by the maximum absolute value of the entries of matrices $D_i$. That is, we require that $C_i=C$ for all $i=1,\ldots,n$, but we allow $C$ to have arbitrarily large entries.
  In the second result, the uniformity assumption is necessary; otherwise the problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard already when the parameters take constant values. Both our algorithms are weakly polynomial: the running time is measured in the total bitsize of the input.</description>

      <title>DOPL: Direct Online Preference Learning for Restless Bandits with Preference Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) has been widely used to model constrained sequential decision making problems, where the state of each restless arm evolves according to a Markov chain and each state transition generates a scalar reward. However, the success of RMAB crucially relies on the availability and quality of reward signals. Unfortunately, specifying an exact reward function in practice can be challenging and even infeasible. In this paper, we introduce Pref-RMAB, a new RMAB model in the presence of \textit{preference} signals, where the decision maker only observes pairwise preference feedback rather than scalar reward from the activated arms at each decision epoch. Preference feedback, however, arguably contains less information than the scalar reward, which makes Pref-RMAB seemingly more difficult. To address this challenge, we present a direct online preference learning (DOPL) algorithm for Pref-RMAB to efficiently explore the unknown environments, adaptively collect preference data in an online manner, and directly leverage the preference feedback for decision-makings. We prove that DOPL yields a sublinear regret. To our best knowledge, this is the first algorithm to ensure $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T\ln T})$ regret for RMAB with preference feedback. Experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness of DOPL.</description>

      <title>Chorded cycle facets of the clique partitioning polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $q$-chorded $k$-cycle inequalities are a class of valid inequalities for the clique partitioning polytope. It is known that for $q \in \{2, \tfrac{k-1}{2}\}$, these inequalities induce facets of the clique partitioning polytope if and only if $k$ is odd. Here, we characterize such facets for arbitrary $k$ and $q$. More specifically, we prove that the $q$-chorded $k$-cycle inequalities induce facets of the clique partitioning polytope if and only if two conditions are satisfied: $k = 1$ mod $q$, and if $k=3q+1$ then $q=3$ or $q$ is even. This establishes the existence of many facets induced by $q$-chorded $k$-cycle inequalities beyond those previously known.</description>

      <title>Rigidly breaking potential flows and a countable Alexandrov theorem for polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study all the ways that a given convex body in $d$ dimensions can break into countably many pieces that move away from each other rigidly at constant velocity, with no rotation or shearing. The initial velocity field is locally constant, but may be continuous and/or fail to be integrable. For any choice of mass-velocity pairs for the pieces, such a motion can be generated by the gradient of a convex potential that is affine on each piece. We classify such potentials in terms of a countable version of a theorem of Alexandrov for convex polytopes, and prove a stability theorem. For bounded velocities, there is a bijection between the mass-velocity data and optimal transport flows (Wasserstein geodesics) that are locally incompressible.
  Given any rigidly breaking velocity field that is the gradient of a continuous potential, the convexity of the potential is established under any of several conditions, such as the velocity field being continuous, the potential being semi-convex, the mass measure generated by a convexified transport potential being absolutely continuous, or there being a finite number of pieces. Also we describe a number of curious and paradoxical examples having fractal structure.</description>

      <title>On the Linear Speedup of Personalized Federated Reinforcement Learning with Shared Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) enables multiple agents to collaboratively learn a policy without sharing their local trajectories collected during agent-environment interactions. However, in practice, the environments faced by different agents are often heterogeneous, leading to poor performance by the single policy learned by existing FedRL algorithms on individual agents. In this paper, we take a further step and introduce a \emph{personalized} FedRL framework (PFedRL) by taking advantage of possibly shared common structure among agents in heterogeneous environments. Specifically, we develop a class of PFedRL algorithms named PFedRL-Rep that learns (1) a shared feature representation collaboratively among all agents, and (2) an agent-specific weight vector personalized to its local environment. We analyze the convergence of PFedTD-Rep, a particular instance of the framework with temporal difference (TD) learning and linear representations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to prove a linear convergence speedup with respect to the number of agents in the PFedRL setting. To achieve this, we show that PFedTD-Rep is an example of the federated two-timescale stochastic approximation with Markovian noise. Experimental results demonstrate that PFedTD-Rep, along with an extension to the control setting based on deep Q-networks (DQN), not only improve learning in heterogeneous settings, but also provide better generalization to new environments.</description>

      <title>The late-stage training dynamics of (stochastic) subgradient descent on homogeneous neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the implicit bias of constant step stochastic subgradient descent (SGD). We consider the setting of binary classification with homogeneous neural networks - a large class of deep neural networks with ReLU-type activation functions such as MLPs and CNNs without biases. We interpret the dynamics of normalized SGD iterates as an Euler-like discretization of a conservative field flow that is naturally associated to the normalized classification margin. Owing to this interpretation, we show that normalized SGD iterates converge to the set of critical points of the normalized margin at late-stage training (i.e., assuming that the data is correctly classified with positive normalized margin). Up to our knowledge, this is the first extension of the analysis of Lyu and Li (2020) on the discrete dynamics of gradient descent to the nonsmooth and stochastic setting. Our main result applies to binary classification with exponential or logistic losses. We additionally discuss extensions to more general settings.</description>

      <title>On the Effectiveness of the z-Transform Method in Quadratic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The z-transform of a sequence is a classical tool used within signal processing, control theory, computer science, and electrical engineering. It allows for studying sequences from their generating functions, with many operations that can be equivalently defined on the original sequence and its $z$-transform. In particular, the z-transform method focuses on asymptotic behaviors and allows the use of Taylor expansions. We present a sequence of results of increasing significance and difficulty for linear models and optimization algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the z-transform method in deriving new asymptotic results. Starting from the simplest gradient descent iterations in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, we show how the spectral dimension characterizes the convergence behavior. We then extend the analysis to Nesterov acceleration, averaging techniques, and stochastic gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Predictive &amp; Trust-based Multi-Agent Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a trust-based predictive multi-agent consensus protocol that analyses neighbours' anticipation data and makes coordination decisions. Agents in the network share their future predicted data over a finite look-ahead horizon with their neighbours and update their predictions in a rolling-horizon fashion. The prediction data is then used by agents to learn both the trust and the commitment traits exhibited by their neighbours over time. The proposed protocol is named as the Anticipatory Distributed Coordination (ADC) protocol. Lyapunov theory-based agreement convergence between agents is provided, followed by demonstrations using numerical simulations.</description>
