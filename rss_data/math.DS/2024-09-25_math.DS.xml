      <title>Equivalence of Rigid Motions and Relative Equilibria in the N-Body Problem on the Two-Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between rigid motions and relative equilibria in the N-body problem on the two-dimensional sphere, S2. We prove that any rigid motion of the N-body system on S2 must be a relative equilibrium. Our approach extends the classical study of rigid body dynamics by Euler and utilizes a rotating frame attached to the particles to derive the corresponding equations of motion. We further show that our results can be extended to the N-body gravitational system in R3. The results are oriented to a broader understanding of the dynamics of N-body systems on curved surfaces and provide a novel perspective on classical results in rigid body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Removable dynamics in the Nose-Hoover and Moore-Spiegel Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the Nose-Hoover and Moore-Spiegel Oscillators, and in particular, their topological dynamics. We prove the dynamics of both these systems can be reduced to a flow on a solid torus, with at most a finite number of attracting periodic trajectories. As a consequence, we obtain that every periodic trajectory for the Nose-Hoover and the Moore-Spiegel Oscillators is a Torus knot.</description>

Abstract: We show that if $\Gamma$ is a co-compact arithmetic lattice in $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ or $\Gamma=SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ then the horocycle orbit of every non-periodic point $x\in SL(2,\mathbb{R})/\Gamma$ equidistributes (with respect to Haar measure) when sampled at integers having exactly two prime factors.</description>

      <title>Zeta functions and the Fried conjecture for smooth pseudo-Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To a transitive pseudo-Anosov flow $\varphi$ on a $3$-manifold $M$ and a representation $\rho$ of $\pi_1(M)$, we associate a zeta function $\zeta_{\varphi,\rho}(s)$ defined for $\Re s \gg 1$, generalizing the Anosov case. For a class of ``smooth pseudo-Anosov flows'', we prove that $\zeta_{\varphi,\rho}(s)$ has a meromorphic continuation to $\mathbb{C}$. We also prove a version of the Fried conjecture for smooth pseudo-Anosov flows which, under some conditions on $\rho$, relates $\zeta_{\varphi,\rho}(0)$ to the Reidemeister torsion of $M$. Finally we prove a topological analogue of the Dirichlet class number formula. In order to deal with singularities, we use $C^\infty$ versions of the approaches of Rugh and Sanchez--Morgado, based on Markov partitions.</description>

Abstract: We study conjugacy of formal derivations on fields of generalised power series in characteristic 0. Casting the problem of Poincar\'e resonance in terms of asymptotic differential algebra, we give conditions for conjugacy of parabolic flat log-exp transseries, flat grid-based transseries, logarithmic transseries, power series with exponents and coefficients in an ordered field, and formal Puiseux series.</description>

      <title>Kinetically Consistent Coarse Graining using Kernel-based Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how kernel-based approximation to the Koopman generator -- the kgEDMD algorithm -- can be used to identify implied timescales and meta stable sets in stochastic dynamical systems, and to learn a coarse-grained dynamics on reduced variables, which retains the essential kinetic properties of the full model. The centerpiece of this study is a learning method to identify an effective diffusion in coarse-grained space by leveraging the kgEMD model for the Koopman generator. By combining this method with force matching, a complete model for the effective dynamics can be inferred. Using a two-dimensional model system and molecular dynamics simulation data of alanine dipeptide, we demonstrate that the proposed method successfully and robustly recovers the essential theormodynamic and kinetic properties of the full model. The parameters of the method can be determined using standard model validation techniques.</description>

      <title>Is All Learning (Natural) Gradient Descent?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that a wide class of effective learning rules -- those that improve a scalar performance measure over a given time window -- can be rewritten as natural gradient descent with respect to a suitably defined loss function and metric. Specifically, we show that parameter updates within this class of learning rules can be expressed as the product of a symmetric positive definite matrix (i.e., a metric) and the negative gradient of a loss function. We also demonstrate that these metrics have a canonical form and identify several optimal ones, including the metric that achieves the minimum possible condition number. The proofs of the main results are straightforward, relying only on elementary linear algebra and calculus, and are applicable to continuous-time, discrete-time, stochastic, and higher-order learning rules, as well as loss functions that explicitly depend on time.</description>

      <title>Measurements and System Identification for the Characterization of Smooth Muscle Cell Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological tissue integrity is actively maintained by cells. It is essential to comprehend how cells accomplish this in order to stage tissue diseases. However, addressing the complexity of a cell's system of interrelated mechanisms poses a challenge. This necessitates a well-structured identification framework and an effective integration of measurements. Here we introduce the use of state-of-the-art frequency-domain system identification techniques combined with an indentation measurement platform to analyze the underlying mechanisms from the perspective of control system theory. The ultimate goal is to explore how mechanical and biological factors are related in induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived vascular smooth muscle cells. We study on the frequency-domain analysis for the investigation and characterization of cellular dynamics of smooth muscle cells from the measured data. The measurement model in this study exploits the availability of human tissue and samples, enabling fundamental investigations of vascular tissue disease. This approach using human cell lines holds significant potential to decrease the necessity for animal-based safety and efficacy studies. The focus of this review is to investigate the cellular dynamics underlying the myogenic response and to demonstrate the practicability of employing a nano-indentation measurement setup for the broadband frequency-domain characterization of induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived vascular smooth muscle cells.</description>

      <title>Learning phase-space flows using time-discrete implicit Runge-Kutta PINNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a computational framework for obtaining multidimensional phase-space solutions of systems of non-linear coupled differential equations, using high-order implicit Runge-Kutta Physics- Informed Neural Networks (IRK-PINNs) schemes. Building upon foundational work originally solving differential equations for fields depending on coordinates [J. Comput. Phys. 378, 686 (2019)], we adapt the scheme to a context where the coordinates are treated as functions. This modification enables us to efficiently solve equations of motion for a particle in an external field. Our scheme is particularly useful for explicitly time-independent and periodic fields. We apply this approach to successfully solve the equations of motion for a mass particle placed in a central force field and a charged particle in a periodic electric field.</description>

      <title>Smooth discrepancy and Littlewood's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given $\boldsymbol{\alpha} \in [0,1]^d$, we estimate the smooth discrepancy of the Kronecker sequence $(n \boldsymbol{\alpha} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1)_{n\geq 1}$. We find that it can be smaller than the classical discrepancy of $\textbf{any}$ sequence when $d \le 2$, and can even be bounded in the case $d=1$. To achieve this, we establish a novel deterministic analogue of Beck's local-to-global principle (Ann. of Math. 1994), which relates the discrepancy of a Kronecker sequence to multiplicative diophantine approximation. This opens up a new avenue of attack for Littlewood's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Homeostasis Patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homeostasis is a regulatory mechanism that keeps a specific variable close to a set value as other variables fluctuate. The notion of homeostasis can be rigorously formulated when the model of interest is represented as an input-output network, with distinguished input and output nodes, and the dynamics of the network determines the corresponding input-output function of the system. In this context, homeostasis can be defined as an 'infinitesimal' notion, namely, the derivative of the input-output function is zero at an isolated point. Combining this approach with graph-theoretic ideas from combinatorial matrix theory provides a systematic framework for calculating homeostasis points in models and classifying the different homeostasis types in input-output networks. In this paper we extend this theory by introducing the notion of a homeostasis pattern, defined as a set of nodes, in addition to the output node, that are simultaneously infinitesimally homeostatic. We prove that each homeostasis type leads to a distinct homeostasis pattern. Moreover, we describe all homeostasis patterns supported by a given input-output network in terms of a combinatorial structure associated to the input-output network. We call this structure the homeostasis pattern network.</description>

      <title>Approximation of the Koopman operator via Bernstein polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Koopman operator approach provides a powerful linear description of nonlinear dynamical systems in terms of the evolution of observables. While the operator is typically infinite-dimensional, it is crucial to develop finite-dimensional approximation methods and characterize the related approximation errors with upper bounds, preferably expressed in the uniform norm. In this paper, we depart from the traditional use of orthogonal projection or truncation, and propose a novel method based on Bernstein polynomial approximation. Considering a basis of Bernstein polynomials, we construct a matrix approximation of the Koopman operator in a computationally effective way. Building on results of approximation theory, we characterize the rates of convergence and the upper bounds of the error in various contexts including the cases of univariate and multivariate systems, and continuous and differentiable observables. The obtained bounds are expressed in the uniform norm in terms of the modulus of continuity of the observables. Finally, the method is extended to a data-driven setting through a proper change of coordinates, where it is shown to demonstrate good performance for trajectory prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify the finite orbits of the mapping class group action on the character variety of Deroin--Tholozan representations of punctured spheres. In particular, we prove that the action has no finite orbits if the underlying sphere has 7 punctures or more. When the sphere has six punctures, we show that there is a unique 1-parameter family of finite orbits. Our methods also recover Tykhyy's classification of finite orbits for 5-punctured spheres. The proof is inductive and uses Lisovyy--Tykhyy's classification of finite mapping class group orbits for 4-punctured spheres as the base case for the induction.
  Our results on Deroin--Tholozan representations cover the last missing cases to complete the proof of Tykhyy's Conjecture on finite mapping class group orbits for $\mathrm{SL}_2\mathbb{C}$ representations of punctured spheres, after the recent work by Lam--Landesman--Litt.</description>

Abstract: Ammann bars are formed by segments (decorations) on the tiles of a tiling such that forming straight lines with them while tiling forces non-periodicity. Only a few cases are known, starting with Robert Ammann's observations on Penrose tiles, but there is no general explanation or construction. In this article we propose a general method for cut and project tilings based on the notion of subperiods and we illustrate it with an aperiodic set of 36 decorated prototiles related to what we called Cyrenaic tilings.</description>

Abstract: The Kuramoto model is a dynamical system that models the interaction of coupled oscillators. There has been much work to effectively bound the number of equilibria to the Kuramoto model for a given network. By formulating the Kuramoto equations as a system of algebraic equations, we first relate the complex root count of the Kuramoto equations to the combinatorics of the underlying network by showing that the complex root count is generically equal to the normalized volume of the corresponding adjacency polytope of the network. We then give explicit algebraic conditions under which this bound is strict and show that there are networks where the Kuramoto equations have infinitely many equilibria.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16221v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the principal spectral theory and asymptotic behavior of the spectral bound for cooperative nonlocal dispersal systems, specifically focusing on the case where partial diffusion coefficients are zero, referred to as the partially degenerate case. We propose two sufficient conditions that ensure the existence of the principal eigenvalue in these partially degenerate systems. Additionally, we study the asymptotic behavior of the spectral bound for nonlocal dispersal operators with small and large diffusion coefficients, considering both non-degenerate and partially degenerate cases. Notably, we find a threshold-type result as the diffusion coefficients tend towards infinity in the partially degenerate case. Finally, we apply these findings to discuss the asymptotic behavior of the basic reproduction ratio in a viral diffusion model.</description>

Abstract: The scientific method is the cornerstone of human progress across all branches of the natural and applied sciences, from understanding the human body to explaining how the universe works. The scientific method is based on identifying systematic rules or principles that describe the phenomenon of interest in a reproducible way that can be validated through experimental evidence. In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), there are discussions on how AI systems may discover new knowledge. We argue that human complex reasoning for scientific discovery remains of vital importance, at least before the advent of artificial general intelligence. Yet, AI can be leveraged for scientific discovery via explainable AI. More specifically, knowing what data AI systems deemed important to make decisions can be a point of contact with domain experts and scientists, that can lead to divergent or convergent views on a given scientific problem. Divergent views may spark further scientific investigations leading to new scientific knowledge.</description>

Abstract: A classical argument was introduced by Khintchine in 1926 in order to exhibit the existence of totally irrational singular linear forms in two variables. This argument was subsequently revisited and extended by many authors. For instance, in 1959 Jarnik used it to show that for $n \geq 2$ and for any non-increasing positive $f$ there are totally irrational matrices $A \in M_{m,n}({\mathbb R})$ such that for all large enough $t$ there are $\mathbf{p} \in {\mathbb Z}^m, \mathbf{q} \in {\mathbb Z}^n \smallsetminus \{0\}$ with $$\|\mathbf{q}\| \leq t \ \text{ and } \ \|A \mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p}\| \leq f(t).$$ We denote the collection of such matrices by $\mathrm{UA}^*_{m,n}(f)$. We adapt Khintchine's argument to show that the sets $\mathrm{UA}^*_{m,n}(f)$, and their weighted analogues $\mathrm{UA}^*_{m,n}(f, \mathbf{w})$, intersect many manifolds and fractals, and have strong intersection properties. For example, we show that:
  When $n \geq 2$, the set $\bigcap_{\mathbf{w}} \mathrm{UA}^*(f, \mathbf{w}) $, where the intersection is over all weights $\mathbf{w}$, is nonempty, and moreover intesects many manifolds and fractals;
  For $n \geq 2$, there are vectors in ${\mathbb R}^n$ which are simultaneously $k$-singular for every $k$, in the sense of Yu;
  when $n \geq 3$, $\mathrm{UA}^*_{1,n}(f) + \mathrm{UA}^*_{1,n}(f) = {\mathbb R}^n$.
  We also obtain new bounds on the rate of singularity which can be attained by column vectors in analytic submanifolds of dimension at least 2 in ${\mathbb R}^n$.</description>
