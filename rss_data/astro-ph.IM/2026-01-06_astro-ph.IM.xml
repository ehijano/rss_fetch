      <title>Inflight performance and future improvements for the INtegral Field Ultraviolet Spectrographic Experiment, the first far ultraviolet integral field spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integral field spectroscopy allows for spectral mapping of extended sources in a time efficient manner. An integral field unit (IFU) in the ultraviolet on Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) could be used to quickly map extended objects like supernova remnants or galaxies and their surroundings, but there are technical challenges to an ultraviolet IFU. The INtegral Field Ultraviolet Spectrographic Experiment (INFUSE), a sounding rocket project, is the first static configuration far ultraviolet integral field spectrograph. INFUSE features an f/16, 0.49m Cassegrain telescope and a 26-element image slicer feeding 26 replica holographic gratings, with spectra imaged by the largest cross-strip microchannel plate detector flown in space. The first launch of INFUSE occurred from White Sands Missile Range on October 29th, 2023, and demonstrated spectral multiplexing, successfully detecting ionizing gas emission in the XA region of the Cygnus Loop. INFUSE will launch again in fall 2025 to observe NGC 2366, a local analog for Green Pea type galaxies, with several enhancements including a xenon-enhanced lithium fluoride + aluminum coated grating, testing the leading flight coating for HWO for the first time. The INFUSE IFU is designed as a pathfinder for a potential IFU mode on HWO, enabling rapid 3D spectroscopy of extended sources.</description>

      <title>Website with interactive visualization of multivariate astronomical time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light curves represent astronomical time series of flux measured across one or more photometric bands. With the rapid growth of large-scale sky surveys, time-domain astronomy has become an essential area of modern astrophysical research. Interactive visualization of extensive light-curve datasets plays a key role in exploring transient phenomena and in planning large follow-up campaigns. In this work, we introduce two web-based platforms designed for interactive light-curve visualization: Fulu, for transient event studies, and VALC, for investigations of low-mass active galactic nuclei (AGNs). These tools provide a user-friendly interface for examining, comparing, and interpreting vast collections of astronomical light curves, supporting scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>thornado+Flash-X: A Hybrid DG-IMEX and Finite-Volume Framework for Neutrino-Radiation Hydrodynamics in Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present neutrino-transport algorithms implemented in the toolkit for high-order neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics (thornado) and their coupling to self-gravitating hydrodynamics within the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)-based multiphysics simulation framework Flash-X. thornado, developed primarily for simulations of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), employs a spectral, six-species two-moment formulation with algebraic closure and special-relativistic observer corrections accurate to $O(v/c)$, and uses discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for phase-space discretization combined with implicit-explicit time stepping. A key development is a nonlinear neutrino-matter coupling algorithm based on nested fixed-point iteration with Anderson acceleration, enabling fully implicit treatment of collisional processes, including energy-coupling interactions such as neutrino-electron scattering and pair production. Coupling to finite-volume (FV) hydrodynamics is achieved with a hybrid DG-FV representation of the fluid variables and operator-split evolution in Flash-X. The implementation is verified using basic transport tests with idealized opacities and relaxation and deleptonization problems with tabulated microphysics. Spherically symmetric CCSN simulations demonstrate accuracy and robustness of the coupled scheme, including close agreement with the CCSN simulation code Chimera. An axisymmetric CCSN simulation further demonstrates the viability of DG-based neutrino transport for multidimensional supernova modeling within Flash-X. thornado's neutrino-transport solver is GPU-enabled using OpenMP offloading or OpenACC, and all CCSN applications included in this work use the GPU implementation. Together, these results establish a foundation for future enhancements in physics fidelity, numerical algorithms, and computational performance, for increasingly realistic large-scale CCSN simulations.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Multi-Mode Post-Merger Gravitational Wave Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks: Methodology Development for Third-Generation Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection and characterization of post-merger gravitational wave signals from binary neutron star mergers remains challenging with current ground-based detectors. We present a convolutional neural network framework designed for real-time detection and multi-mode frequency extraction of post-merger signals, achieving an inference latency of 3.0 ms and a frequency accuracy of 48.6 Hz on the direct-comparison subsets (53 Hz on the comprehensive test set). The framework is validated on realistic LIGO O4 detector noise including authentic GravitySpy glitch morphologies, demonstrating ROC AUC of 0.999999 and 99.998% detection efficiency at 1% false alarm rate. These exceptional performance metrics arise from an aggressive training augmentation strategy that exposes the network to artificially challenging conditions, enabling robust generalization to our synthetic O4 detector noise model. We compare performance against a simplified matched filtering baseline using Lorentzian templates (23x more accurate despite a 4.7x computational overhead) and Bayesian parameter estimation (1.2 million times faster), establishing complementary trade-offs in the analysis landscape. While current O4 sensitivity limits post-merger detections to ~20 Mpc (~1 detection per century), this methodology provides essential infrastructure for third-generation detectors (Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer) where post-merger detection will become routine with annual detection rates exceeding 100 events. Our validation framework identifies expected behavior in uncertainty scaling that reflects realistic training constraints rather than idealized Fisher information limits, demonstrating honest assessment practices for machine learning applications in gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Accelerating cosmological simulations on GPUs: a step towards sustainability and green-awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity and scale of cosmological N-body simulations, driven by astronomical surveys like Euclid, call for a paradigm shift towards more sustainable and energy-efficient high-performance computing (HPC). The rising energy consumption of supercomputing facilities poses a significant environmental and financial challenge.
  In this work, we build upon a recently developed GPU implementation of pinocchio, a widely-used tool for the fast generation of dark matter (DM) halo catalogues, to investigate energy consumption. Using a different resource configuration, we confirmed the time-to-solution behavior observed in a companion study, and we use these runs to compare time-to-solution with energy-to-solution.
  By profiling the code on various HPC platforms with a newly developed implementation of the Power Measurement Toolkit (PMT), we demonstrate an 8x reduction in energy-to-solution and 8x speed-up in time-to-solution compared to the CPU-only version. Taken together, these gains translate into an overall efficiency improvement of up to 64x. Our results show that the GPU-accelerated pinocchio not only achieves substantial speed-up, making the generation of large-scale mock catalogues more tractable, but also significantly reduces the energy footprint of the simulations. This work represents an step towards ``green-aware" scientific computing in cosmology, proving that performance and sustainability can be simultaneously achieved.</description>

      <title>Prospects for identifying pulsar candidates in radio surveys using scintillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous paper, we developed a technique for identifying pulsar candidates in interferometric radio images using their distinctive scintillation signatures. Building on this technique, the present study simulates a pulsar population using the PsrPopPy Python module to investigate the technique's limitations and detection capabilities. Among pulsars detectable exclusively by this technique, 50% have duty cycles exceeding the mean value of 0.09 observed in time-domain detections. Our pulsar population simulations revealed a set of observational parameters that optimize pulsar detection. An observation frequency of ~ 1420 MHz and a channel width of ~10 kHz emerge as the optimal configuration to maximize the pulsar detection efficiency. By applying a scintillation-based technique to future radio telescopes like DSA-2000, we can detect 56% of normal pulsars and 84% of MSPs in addition to those detected using non-imaging, time-domain surveys. These detected pulsars cannot be verified by time-domain searches.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Hidden Systematics in Extreme-Precision Radial Velocity Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify and correct for small but coherent instrumental drifts in seven years of radial velocity data from the EXtreme PREcision Spectrograph (EXPRES). The systematics are most notable for the six months before and after 2022 January, when EXPRES experienced larger temperature variations, and we see a systematic trough-to-peak amplitude of 2.8 m/s in the radial velocities. This is large enough to mimic or obscure planetary signatures. To isolate and correct these effects, we develop a suite of diagnostics that track two-dimensional \'echellogram shifts, scalings, and rotation, as well as line bisector spans (LBS) derived from laser frequency comb (LFC) lines. By combining these empirical tracers with instrument telemetry in a multi-dimensional regression, we reduce the EXPRES instrument trend traced with solar RVs from an RMS of 1.32 m/s to 0.43 m/s, a 67% improvement, and the aggregate of twelve chromospherically quiet stars show a 26% reduction in velocity scatter. Our injection-recovery simulations further demonstrate a doubling in sensitivity to low-amplitude planetary signals after correction. When applied to the stellar time series of $\rho$ Coronae Borealis ($\rho$CrB), the correction removes a spurious planet d signal, restoring the integrity of the data. These results highlight the need for long-term monitoring and multi-dimensional calibration diagnostics on the path toward true centimeter-per-second precision in next-generation EPRV instruments.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic modeling of Cherenkov emission from particle showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subatomic particles can interact with target nuclei in matter or decay in flight, and an individual high-energy particle can induce a particle shower composed of numerous, lower-energy secondaries. These particle showers broadly exhibit universality across diverse media, including air, water, ice, and other materials, with their development governed by the Standard Model. Full Monte Carlo simulation of particle showers, where each secondary is individually tracked and propagated, can be a computational challenge to perform at scale. Experiments thus resort to parametrized approximations when efficient simulation becomes necessary. Here, we construct distributions of parameters capable of describing the Cherenkov light yield from particle showers in ice, and extensible to other, similar media. Sampling from the distributions allows for a much improved description of event-to-event fluctuations, in amplitude and shape, along the shower axis. Including these effects is essential for a more accurate simulation of signal and background events in current and next-generation neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Compensating Star-Trackers Misalignments with Adaptive Multi-Model Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive multi-model framework for jointly estimating spacecraft attitude and star-tracker misalignments in GPS-denied deep-space CubeSat missions. A Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) estimates attitude, angular velocity, and gyro bias, while a Bayesian Multiple-Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE) layer operates on a discrete grid of body-to-sensor misalignment hypotheses. In the single-misalignment case, the MEKF processes gyroscope measurements and TRIAD-based attitude observations, and the MMAE updates a three-dimensional grid over the misalignment vector. For a dual-misalignment configuration, the same MEKF dynamics are retained, and the MMAE bank is driven directly by stacked line-of-sight measurements from two star trackers, forming a six-dimensional grid over the two misalignment quaternions without augmenting the continuous-state dimension. A novel diversity metric, $\Psi$, is introduced to trigger adaptive refinement of the misalignment grid around a weighted-mean estimate, thereby preventing premature collapse of the model probabilities and concentrating computation in the most likely region of the parameter space. Monte Carlo simulations show arcsecond-level misalignment estimation and sub-degree attitude errors for both estimation problems, with estimation errors remaining well-bounded, proving robustness and consistency. These results indicate that the proposed MEKF--MMAE architecture enables accurate, autonomous, and computationally efficient in-flight calibration for resource-constrained spacecraft, and establishes dual star-tracker misalignment estimation as a practical option for deep-space CubeSat missions.</description>

      <title>Calorimetric Measurement of the Surface Energy of Enstatite, MgSiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface thermodynamics of minerals influence their properties and occurrence in both terrestrial and planetary systems. Using high-temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry, we report the first direct measurement of the surface energy of enstatite, MgSiO$_3$. Enstatite nanoparticles of different sizes were synthesized using the sol-gel method, characterized with X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, infrared spectroscopy, surface area measurements, and electron microscopy. The materials consist of crystallites with sizes of $\sim $10 - 20 nm, which are agglomerated into larger nanoparticles. Thus, both surface and interface terms contribute to the measured enthalpies. Analysis based on calorimetry and calculated surface and interface areas gives the surface enthalpy of enstatite as 4.79 $\pm$ 0.45 J m$^{-2}$. This value is comparable to that of forsterite (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$) and larger than those of many nonsilicate oxide materials. This large surface energy may present a barrier to the nucleation of enstatite in planetary atmospheres and other geochemical and planetary environments. The interfacial energy of enstatite appears to be close to zero. The transition enthalpy from bulk orthoenstatite to bulk clinoenstatite is 0.34 $\pm$ 0.93 kJ mol$^{-1}$, which is in agreement with earlier reports. The methodology developed here can be extended to other materials having complex structures and morphologies to separate surface and interfacial contributions to energetics.</description>

      <title>Turbulence driving in a star-forming Milky-Way-type galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The life-cycle, structure, and dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM) is regulated by turbulence. Complex physical processes, including supernova (SN) explosions, shear, and gravitational collapse, drive and maintain turbulence, but it is still an open question what turbulence driving mode is primarily excited by these different mechanisms. The turbulence driving parameter, b, can be used to quantify the ratio of solenoidal to compressive modes in the acceleration field that drives the turbulence. Compressive driving is characterised by b ~ 1, while purely solenoidal driving gives b ~ 0.3. To quantify the turbulence in the galactic ISM, we investigate the time evolution of b, as well as the turbulent Mach number, and plasma beta (thermal-to-magnetic pressure ratio), and its correlation with star formation in the magnetised warm neutral medium (WNM) of the TIGRESS shearing-box simulations of a kpc-sized patch of a Milky-Way-like galaxy, over a 100 Myr time period (~ half an orbital time). In this simulation the turbulence is driven by a combination of shear, gravitational collapse, and star formation feedback in the form of radiation and SNe. We find that the turbulence driving parameter fluctuates in time between b ~ 0.4 and b ~ 1. We find a time-dependent correlation of b with star formation activity, such that high star formation rates follow about one turbulent turnover time (~ 10 Myr) after phases of highly compressive driving (b &gt; 0.5). About 20 Myr after the peak in star formation, type-B SN feedback drives up the WNM fraction and turbulent Mach numbers, and reduces plasma beta and the driving to b ~ 0.4-0.5.</description>

      <title>A statistical framework for quantitative spectroscopy of luminous blue stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Quantitative spectroscopy of luminous blue stars relies on detailed non-LTE model atmospheres whose increasing physical realism makes direct, iterative analyses computationally demanding. Aims: We introduce MAUI (Machine-learning Assisted Uncertainty Inference), a statistical framework designed for efficient Bayesian inference of stellar parameters using emulator-based spectral models. Methods: MAUI employs Gaussian-process-based emulators trained on a limited set of non-LTE simulations, combined with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to explore posterior distributions. We validate the approach with recovery experiments and demonstrate it on Galactic late-type O dwarf and early-type B dwarf/subgiant stars. Results: The emulator reproduces the predictions of full atmosphere models within quoted uncertainties while reducing computational cost by orders of magnitude. Posterior distributions are well calibrated, with conservative coverage across all stellar parameters. Conclusions: Emulator-driven Bayesian inference retains the accuracy of classical analyses at a fraction of the computational expense, enabling posterior sampling that would be prohibitive with direct model evaluations. This positions emulators as a practical tool for high-fidelity spectroscopy of massive stars as atmosphere models grow more demanding.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel technique to preserve spectral features in lossy compression based on a novel fast Fourier correction algorithm\added{ for regular-grid data}. Preserving both spatial and frequency representations of data is crucial for applications such as cosmology, turbulent combustion, and X-ray diffraction, where spatial and frequency views provide complementary scientific insights. In particular, many analysis tasks rely on frequency-domain representations to capture key features, including the power spectrum of cosmology simulations, the turbulent energy spectrum in combustion, and diffraction patterns in reciprocal space for ptychography. However, existing compression methods guarantee accuracy only in the spatial domain while disregarding the frequency domain. To address this limitation, we propose an algorithm that corrects the errors produced by off-the-shelf ``base'' compressors such as SZ3, ZFP, and SPERR, thereby preserving both spatial and frequency representations by bounding errors in both domains. By expressing frequency-domain errors as linear combinations of spatial-domain errors, we derive a region that jointly bounds errors in both domains. Given as input the spatial errors from a base compressor and user-defined error bounds in the spatial and frequency domains, we iteratively project the spatial error vector onto the regions defined by the spatial and frequency constraints until it lies within their intersection. We further accelerate the algorithm using GPU parallelism to achieve practical performance. We validate our approach with datasets from cosmology simulations, X-ray diffraction, combustion simulation, and electroencephalography demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving critical scientific information in both spatial and frequency domains.</description>

      <title>When the Shadow Meets Its Measure: Assessing the Feasibility of Submillimeter Black Hole Shadow Imaging in Megamaser Disk AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AGN hosting water megamaser disks enable exceptionally precise geometric determinations of Black Hole (BH) mass, distance, inclination, and dynamical center. In anticipation of upcoming space-based very long baseline Interferometry (SVLBI) missions, megamaser disk AGN offer a uniquely valuable probe of strong-gravity regimes through black hole shadow (BHS) imaging beyond Sgr~A* and M87*. In this work, we (1) map the predicted BHS diameters of twenty-one of the most precisely characterized megamaser disk AGN to submillimeter-millimeter (submm-mm) interferometric baseline requirements, (2) estimate their respective AGN-core flux densities at submm-mm wavelengths, accounting for thermal-dust contamination, extended-jet emission, and intrinsic variability, and (3) determine the astrometric precision required to detect spin-dependent positional offsets between the BHS and the megamaser disk dynamical center. NGC~4258 stands out as the only megamaser disk AGN detectable on Earth-L2 baselines in the submm-mm regime, while other megamaser disk AGN in the sample would require baselines approaching Earth-L4/L5 distances; moreover, only a handful exhibit flux densities above $\sim$10~mJy. Our results further indicate a submillimeter excess in NGC~4258, suggesting that the accretion disk remains thin down to a transitional radius of $\lesssim 100$~Schwarzschild radii, within which the flow becomes advection dominated. For a maximally spinning supermassive black hole in NGC~4258, we show that the astrometric precision of the BHS centroid necessary to detect the BHS-dynamical center offset could, in principle, be achieved with Earth-Moon baselines; however, it would also demand astrometric precision of the water maser dynamical center roughly fifty times better than what is currently attainable.</description>

      <title>Can instrumental effects obscure the true photospheric wave spectrum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical aberrations and instrument resolution can affect the observed morphological properties of features in the solar atmosphere. However, little work has been done to study the effects of spatial resolution on the dynamical processes occurring in the Sun's atmosphere. In this work, owing to the availability of high-resolution observations of a magnetic pore captured with the Interferometric BIdimensional Spectrometer mounted at the Dunn Solar Telescope, we studied the impact of the diffraction limit and the sampling of an instrument on line-of-sight Doppler velocity oscillations. We reported a noticeable shift in the dominant frequency band from $5$ to $3$ mHz, as both the angular and detector resolutions of the instruments were degraded. We argue that the observed behaviour is a result of the increased contamination of straylight from neighbouring quiet Sun regions, masking the true behaviour of umbral oscillations. These results suggest that the wave energy contributions reported in the literature and based on low-resolution instrumentation may be fundamentally underestimated. As we move into the era of high-resolution instrumentation such as DKIST and MUSE, this work will offer a critical baseline for interpreting new observations, especially in terms of distinguishing true dynamic behaviours from artefacts introduced by instrument-related limitations.</description>

      <title>Hunting for "Oddballs" with Machine Learning: Detecting Anomalous Exoplanets Using a Deep-Learned Low-Dimensional Representation of Transit Spectra with Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the application of autoencoder-based machine learning techniques for anomaly detection to identify exoplanet atmospheres with unconventional chemical signatures using a low-dimensional data representation. We use the Atmospheric Big Challenge (ABC) database, a publicly available dataset with over 100,000 simulated exoplanet spectra, to construct an anomaly detection scenario by defining CO2-rich atmospheres as anomalies and CO2-poor atmospheres as the normal class. We benchmarked four different anomaly detection strategies: Autoencoder Reconstruction Loss, One-Class Support Vector Machine (1 class-SVM), K-means Clustering, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). Each method was evaluated in both the original spectral space and the autoencoder's latent space using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics. To test the performance of the different methods under realistic conditions, we introduced Gaussian noise levels ranging from 10 to 50 ppm. Our results indicate that anomaly detection is consistently more effective when performed within the latent space across all noise levels. Specifically, K-means clustering in the latent space emerged as a stable and high-performing method. We demonstrate that this anomaly detection approach is robust to noise levels up to 30 ppm (consistent with realistic space-based observations) and remains viable even at 50 ppm when leveraging latent space representations. On the other hand, the performance of the anomaly detection methods applied directly in the raw spectral space degrades significantly with increasing the level of noise. This suggests that autoencoder-driven dimensionality reduction offers a robust methodology for flagging chemically anomalous targets in large-scale surveys where exhaustive retrievals are computationally prohibitive.</description>

      <title>The Sequential Monte Carlo goes NUTS: Boosting Gravitational-Wave Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods have recently been applied to gravitational-wave inference as a powerful alternative to standard sampling techniques, such as Nested Sampling. At the same time, gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, most notably the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), provide an efficient way to explore high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work we present SHARPy, a Bayesian inference framework that combines the parallelism and evidence-estimation capabilities of SMC with the state-of-the-art sampling performance of NUTS. Moreover, SHARPy exploits the local geometric structure of the posterior to further improve efficiency. Built on JAX and accelerated on GPUs, SHARPy performs gravitational-wave inference on binary black-hole events in around ten minutes, yielding posterior samples and Bayesian evidence estimates that are consistent with those obtained through Nested Sampling. This work sets a new milestone in GW inference with likelihood-based methods and paves the way for model comparison tasks to be accomplished in minutes.</description>

      <title>Report on LEO satellite impacts on ground-based optical astronomy for the Rubin Observatory LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In August 2025 a workshop was convened to bring together experts to better understand steps that can be taken to mitigate the impact of satellite constellations on astronomical observations. At the time, just over 12,000 operational satellites were in low-Earth orbit (LEO). Although reflected sunlight and emissions all across the electromagnetic spectrum from artificial satellites impact scientific observations and the sky, the workshop focused on reflected sunlight in the wavelength range 330 nm to 1100 nm. This aligns with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) planned imaging observations over the coming decade. Among other conclusions, we affirm previous recommendations that tracked satellite apparent magnitudes should be no brighter than 7th AB mag. The workshop participants discussed over 30 publications, reports, and presentations, and arrived at the Findings and Recommendations presented here. During the workshop, in addition to affirming many existing recommendations and best practices, the group discovered new issues and devised possible mitigations. These were nearly equally divided between advice to satellite builders and operators and to the observational astronomy community. While the workshop prioritized considerations for LSST, our hope is that many of the Findings and Recommendations will also apply to other observatories and constellations, and that all satellite companies will continue to engage in dialog with sky observers across the globe.</description>

      <title>Linear Image Regridding and Coaddition with Oversampled Point Spread Functions: Lessons from 1D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image regridding and coaddition have a wide range of applications in astronomical observations. {\sc Imcom}, an algorithm that provides control over point spread function (PSF) and noise in coadded images, has been found to meet the stringent requirements of weak gravitational lensing cosmology with the forthcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. In this work, I introduce a new algorithm, Fast {\sc Imcom}, which outperforms traditional {\sc Imcom} in terms of both efficiency and quality. After explaining the underlying philosophy and mathematical formalism, I conduct systematic comparisons between {\sc Imcom} and Fast {\sc Imcom} in terms of PSF reconstruction in 1D. While a 2D implementation is beyond the scope of this paper, I demonstrate how to generalize Fast {\sc Imcom} to 2D and discuss practical issues involved. This new algorithm has the potential of reducing both the computational costs and storage requirements (current estimates are $\sim 100\,{\rm M}$ core-hours and $\sim 1.5 \,{\rm PB}$, respectively) of the Roman High Latitude Imaging Survey (HLIS) by an order of magnitude. Meanwhile, it provides implications for the dithering patterns of Roman surveys (extrapolated from 1D to 2D). I also address potential applications of Fast {\sc Imcom} beyond the Roman HLIS, with focus on other weak lensing programs and Roman time domain surveys; the actual range of use cases is likely beyond what is discussed here.</description>

      <title>Pre-flight Background Estimates for COSI</title>

Abstract: The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a Compton telescope designed to survey the 0.2 - 5 MeV sky, consisting of a compact array of cross-strip germanium detectors. It is planned to be launched in 2027 into an equatorial low-Earth (530 km) orbit with a prime mission duration of 2 years. The observation of MeV gamma rays is dominated by background, mostly from extragalactic and atmospheric photon but also from the activation of the detector materials induced by cosmic-ray interactions. Thus, background simulation and identification are crucial for the data analysis. In this work we perform Monte Carlo simulations of the background for the first 3 months in orbit, and we extrapolate the results to 2 years in orbit, in order to determine the build-up of the activation due to long-lived isotopes. We determine the rates of events induced by the background that are reconstructed as Compton events in the simulated COSI data. We find that the extragalactic background photons dominate at low energies (&lt;660 keV), while delayed activation from cosmic-ray primaries (proton/alpha) and albedo photons dominate at higher energies. As part of this work, a comparison at low latitude (&lt;1 deg) between recent measurement of the SAA by the High-Energy Particle Detector (HEPD-01) on board the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES-01) and the AP9/AE9 model has been made, showing an overestimation of the flux by a factor 9 by the model. The systematic uncertainties associated with these components are quantified. This work marks a major step forward in estimating and understanding the expected background rates for the COSI satellite mission.</description>

      <title>KDP as a thermal blocking filter -- Deep near IR observations with a warm narrow band filter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground-based astronomy suffers from strong atmospheric line- and thermal continuum emission, at the near infrared (NIR, 0.7-1.1$\mu$m), and short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1.1-2.5$\mu$m) wavelengths. The thermal continuum emission increases exponentially towards the red sensitivity cutoff of the state-of-the-art 2.5$\mu$m cutoff SWIR detectors. Given availability of an optical quality shortpass filter material with strong blocking density in the SWIR, lower cost instrumentation, and higher performance filters could be designed. We demonstrate monopotassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP, chemical formula KH$_2$PO$_4$) as a strong candidate for this purpose. KDP is fully transparent at wavelengths from ultraviolet to 1.3$\mu$m, but becomes highly opaque at wavelengths &gt;2$\mu$m. We demonstrate on-sky use of KDP by improving performance of a cryogenic broadband filter with known off-band thermal leak, and using a non-cryogenic narrow band filter for deep observation. KDP reduces the sky background by 4.5 magnitudes in the leaky Z-band filter we use. Our 4nm wide, central wavelength 1.191$\mu$m narrowband filter in combination with KDP reduces the sky surface brightness by three magnitudes compared to a J broadband, although the effect of KDP is minor due to high blocking density of the broadband filter. We find a sky surface brightness of 18.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in our bandpass at 1.191$\mu$m. KDP is an excellent thermal blocker, when its temperature is maintained above its Curie point at 123K. Below Curie point, KDP transforms its crystal structure, degrading its otherwise good imaging properties.</description>

      <title>ESO Expanding Horizon White Paper: Revealing the properties of matter at supranuclear densities with gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding dense matter under extreme conditions is one of the most fundamental puzzles in modern physics. Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena. While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Cartography II: completing galaxy catalogs for gravitational-wave cosmology</title>

Abstract: The dark siren method exploits the complementarity between gravitational-wave binary coalescence signals and galaxy catalogs originating from the same regions of space. However, all galaxy catalogs are incomplete, i.e. they only include a subset of all galaxies, typically being biased towards the bright end of the luminosity distribution. This sub-selection systematically affects the dark siren inference of the Hubble constant $H_0$, so a completeness relation has to be introduced that accounts for the missing objects. In the literature it is standard to assume that the missing galaxies are uniformly distributed across the sky and that the galaxy magnitude distribution is known. In this work we develop a novel method which improves upon these assumptions and reconstructs the underlying true galaxy field, respecting the spatial correlation of galaxies on large scales. In our method the true magnitude distribution of galaxies is inferred alongside the spatial galaxy distribution. Our method results in an improved three-dimensional prior in redshift and sky position for the host galaxy of a GW event, which is expected to make the resulting $H_0$ posterior more robust. Building on our previous work, we make a number of improvements, and validate our method on simulated data based on the Millennium simulation. The inference results can be reproduced through our publicly available code base light.</description>

      <title>Deep Synoptic Array Science: Searching for Long Duration Radio Transients with the DSA-110</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18136</link>

Abstract: We describe the design and commissioning tests for the DSA-110 Not-So-Fast Radio Burst (NSFRB) search pipeline, a 1.4GHz image-plane single-pulse search sensitive to 134ms-160.8s radio bursts. Extending the pulse width range of the FRB search by 3 orders of magnitude, the NSFRB search is sensitive to the recently-discovered Galactic Long Period Radio Transients (LPRTs or LPTs). The NSFRB search operates in real-time, utilizing a custom GPU-accelerated search code, \texttt{cerberus}, implemented in Python with JAX. We summarize successful commissioning sensitivity tests with continuum sources and pulsar B0329+54, estimating the 90% completeness $25\sigma$ flux (fluence) limit to be ~1200mJy (~160Jy ms). Future tests of recovery of longer timescale transients, e.g. CHIME J1634+44, are planned to supplement injection testing and B0329+54 observations. An offline DSA-110 NSFRB Galactic Plane Survey was conducted to search for LPRTs, covering $-3.5^\circ&lt;b&lt;5.7^\circ$ and $141^\circ&lt;l&lt;225^\circ$ (~770 square degrees) in Galactic coordinates. We estimate an upper limit Poissonian burst rate ~2 hr$^{-1}$ per square degree (~17 hr$^{-1}$} per $3^\circ\times3^\circ$ survey grid cell) maximized across the inner $|b|&lt;0.25^\circ$ of the surveyed region. By imposing the ~1200mJy flux limit on two representative models (the magnetar plastic flow model and the White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary model), we reject with 95% confidence the presence of White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary LPRTs (beamed in a detectable direction) with periods between ~10-50s within ~95% of the surveyed region. Combined with the prevalence of LPRTs in the Galactic Plane, our results motivate further consideration of both White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary models and isolated magnetar models. We will continue to explore novel LPRT search strategies during real-time operations, such as triggered periodicity searches and additional targeted surveys.</description>
