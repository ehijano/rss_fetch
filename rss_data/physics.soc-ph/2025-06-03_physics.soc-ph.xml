      <title>Behavioral alignment in social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orderly behaviors observed in large-scale groups, such as fish schooling and the organized movement of crowds, are both ubiquitous and essential for the survival and stability of these systems. Such complex collective behaviors often emerge from simple local interactions and strategy adjustments among individuals. Understanding how these basic rules shape complex group dynamics has long been a significant scientific challenge. Historically, research has predominantly focused on imitation and social learning, where individuals adopt the strategies of more successful peers to refine their behavior. However, in recent years, an alternative learning approach, self-exploration and introspective learning, has garnered increasing attention. In this paradigm, individuals assess their own circumstances and select strategies that best align with their specific conditions. Two primary forms of this learning are coordination and anti-coordination, where individuals align with and diverge from the local majority, respectively. In this study, we analyze networked systems of coordinating and anti-coordinating individuals, exploring the combined effects of system dynamics, network structure, and behavioral patterns. We address several practical questions, including the number of equilibria, their characteristics, the equilibrium time, and the resilience of systems. We find that the number of equilibrium states can be extremely large, even increasing exponentially with minor alternations to the network structure. Moreover, the network structure has a significant impact on the average equilibrium time. Despite the complexity of these findings, variations can be captured by a single, simple network characteristic: the average path length. Our research offers valuable insights into how modifications to the interaction structure can influence behavioral alignment in social networks.</description>

      <title>Finance as Extended Biology: Reciprocity as the Cognitive Substrate of Financial Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in economics and artificial intelligence is explaining how financial behaviors-such as credit, insurance, and trade-emerge from decentralized social interaction. We argue that these functions are not institutionally engineered, but arise from a single behavioral substrate: reciprocity. Observed across primates and foundational to early human societies, reciprocity governed the exchange of goods, regulation of obligation, and maintenance of cooperation-without formal rules. Trade, widely regarded as the origin of financial structure, is reframed here as the canonical form of reciprocity: simultaneous, symmetric, and partner-contingent. Building on this logic, we reconstruct four fundamental financial functions-credit, insurance, token exchange, and investment-as structured extensions of the same interaction principle. By grounding financial behavior in minimal, simulateable social dynamics, this framework shifts the explanatory focus from institutional design to behavioral foundations, offering a new basis for modeling decentralized cooperation in both human and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Epidemic dynamics in physical-information-social multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During epidemic outbreaks, information dissemination enhances individual protection, while social institutions influence the transmission through measures like government interventions, media campaigns, and hospital resource allocation. Here we develop a tripartite physical-information-social epidemic model and derive the corresponding kinetic equations in different scales by using the Microscopic Markov Chain Approach and mean-field approximations. The basic reproduction number and epidemic thresholds are explicitly derived by the next generation matrix method. Our results reveal that (1) active information exchange curbs disease transmission, (2) earlier and stronger government responses reduce the epidemic size, and (3) stronger governmental influence on media and hospitals further decreases disease transmission, particularly in hospital nodes. In fixed community structures, groups with frequent physical contact but weak information access (e.g., students) exhibit higher infection rates. For diverse communities, weaker physical layer heterogeneity but stronger information layer heterogeneity (e.g., high internet penetration in rural areas) inhibits epidemic outbreaks. These findings offer valuable insights for epidemic prevention and control strategies.</description>

      <title>Effects of higher-order interactions and homophily on information access inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spread of information through socio-technical systems determines which individuals are the first to gain access to opportunities and insights. Yet, the pathways through which information flows can be skewed, leading to systematic differences in access across social groups. These inequalities remain poorly characterized in settings involving nonlinear social contagion and higher-order interactions that exhibit homophily. We introduce a enerative model for hypergraphs with hyperedge homophily, a hyperedge size-dependent property, and tunable degree distribution, called the $\texttt{H3}$ model, along with a model for nonlinear social contagion that incorporates asymmetric transmission between in-group and out-group nodes. Using stochastic simulations of a social contagion process on hypergraphs from the $\texttt{H3}$ model and diverse empirical datasets, we show that the interaction between social contagion dynamics and hyperedge homophily -- an effect unique to higher-order networks due to its dependence on hyperedge size -- can critically shape group-level differences in information access. By emphasizing how hyperedge homophily shapes interaction patterns, our findings underscore the need to rethink socio-technical system design through a higher-order perspective and suggest that dynamics-informed, targeted interventions at specific hyperedge sizes, embedded in a platform architecture, offer a powerful lever for reducing inequality.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Higher-Order Analysis of Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying patterns of relations among the units of a complex system from measurements of their activities in time is a fundamental problem with many practical applications. Here, we introduce a method that detects dependencies of any order in multivariate time series data. The method first transforms a multivariate time series into a symbolic sequence, and then extract statistically significant strings of symbols through a Bayesian approach. Such motifs are finally modelled as the hyperedges of a hypergraph, allowing us to use network theory to study higher-order interactions in the original data. When applied to neural and social systems, our method reveals meaningful higher-order dependencies, highlighting their importance in both brain function and social behaviour.</description>

      <title>Transport Network, Graph, and Air Pollution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air pollution can be studied in the urban structure regulated by transport networks. Transport networks can be studied as geometric and topological graph characteristics through designed models. Current studies do not offer a comprehensive view as limited models with insufficient features are examined. Our study finds geometric patterns of pollution-indicated transport networks through 0.3 million image interpretations of global cities. These are then described as part of 12 indices to investigate the network-pollution correlation. Strategies such as improved connectivity, more balanced road types and the avoidance of extreme clustering coefficient are identified as beneficial for alleviated pollution. As a graph-only study, it informs superior urban planning by separating the impact of permanent infrastructure from that of derived development for a more focused and efficient effort toward pollution reduction.</description>

      <title>Modeling temporal hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks representing social, biological, technological or other systems are often characterized by higher-order interaction involving any number of nodes. Temporal hypergraphs are given by ordered sequences of hyperedges representing sets of nodes interacting at given points in time. In this paper we discuss how a recently proposed model family for time-stamped hyperedges - relational hyperevent models (RHEM) - can be employed to define tailored null distributions for temporal hypergraphs. RHEM can be specified with a given vector of temporal hyperedge statistics - functions that quantify the structural position of hyperedges in the history of previous hyperedges - and equate expected values of these statistics with their empirically observed values. This allows, for instance, to analyze the overrepresentation or underrepresentation of temporal hyperedge configurations in a model that reproduces the observed distributions of possibly complex sub-configurations, including but going beyond node degrees. Concrete examples include, but are not limited to, preferential attachment, repetition of subsets of any given size, triadic closure, homophily, and degree assortativity for subsets of any order.</description>

      <title>Alignment Phase Transition in Socially Driven Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective human movement is a hallmark of complex systems, exhibiting emergent order across diverse settings, from pedestrian flows to biological collectives. In high-speed scenarios, alignment interactions ensure efficient flow and navigation. In contrast, alignment in low-speed, socially engaged contexts emerges not from locomotion goals but from interpersonal interaction. Using high-resolution spatial and orientation data from preschool classrooms, we uncover a sharp, distance-dependent transition in pairwise alignment patterns that reflects a spontaneous symmetry breaking between distinct behavioral phases. Below a critical threshold of approximately 0.65\,m, individuals predominantly align side-by-side; beyond this range, face-to-face orientations prevail. We show that this transition arises from a distance-dependent competition among three alignment mechanisms: parallelization, opposition, and reciprocation, whose interplay generates a bifurcation structure in the effective interaction potential. A Fourier-based decomposition of empirical orientation distributions reveals these mechanisms, enabling the construction of a minimal pseudo-potential model that captures the alignment transition as a non-equilibrium phase transition. Monte Carlo simulations using the inferred interaction terms closely reproduce the empirical patterns. These findings establish a quantitative framework for social alignment in low-speed human motion, extending active matter theory to a previously unexplored regime of socially mediated orientation dynamics, with implications for modeling coordination and control in biological collectives and artificial swarms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a first approach towards a neo-Gibbsian thermodynamic theory for social systems, grounded in quantifiable economic and cultural parameters, while deliberately avoiding direct analogies with classical thermodynamic equations of state. Building on previous thermodynamic approaches to economic modeling, we introduce a conceptual basis for defining intensive variables capable of characterizing equilibrium states and evolutionary dynamics in societies. Particular attention is given to cultural and structural diversification of goods and resources, as well as to the phenomenon of multi-currency systems. A non-decreasing function $S$ is defined over all social processes to represent the accumulation of laws, norms, and other quantifiable symbolic elements. Finally, we examine its interpretation in terms of thermodynamic forces, focusing on the case of equilibrium between two simple interacting social systems exchanging resources.</description>

      <title>Whose Name Comes Up? Auditing LLM-Based Scholar Recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of six open-weight LLMs (llama3-8b, llama3.1-8b, gemma2-9b, mixtral-8x7b, llama3-70b, llama3.1-70b) in recommending experts in physics across five tasks: top-k experts by field, influential scientists by discipline, epoch, seniority, and scholar counterparts. The evaluation examines consistency, factuality, and biases related to gender, ethnicity, academic popularity, and scholar similarity. Using ground-truth data from the American Physical Society and OpenAlex, we establish scholarly benchmarks by comparing model outputs to real-world academic records. Our analysis reveals inconsistencies and biases across all models. mixtral-8x7b produces the most stable outputs, while llama3.1-70b shows the highest variability. Many models exhibit duplication, and some, particularly gemma2-9b and llama3.1-8b, struggle with formatting errors. LLMs generally recommend real scientists, but accuracy drops in field-, epoch-, and seniority-specific queries, consistently favoring senior scholars. Representation biases persist, replicating gender imbalances (reflecting male predominance), under-representing Asian scientists, and over-representing White scholars. Despite some diversity in institutional and collaboration networks, models favor highly cited and productive scholars, reinforcing the rich-getricher effect while offering limited geographical representation. These findings highlight the need to improve LLMs for more reliable and equitable scholarly recommendations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Non-uniqueness of Node Co-occurrence Matrices of Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs extend traditional networks by capturing multi-way or group interactions. Given the complexity of hypergraph data and the wide range of methodology available for pairwise network analysis, hypergraph data is often projected onto a weighted and undirected network. The simplest of these projections, often referred to as a node co-occurrence matrix, is known to be non-unique, as distinct non-isomorphic hypergraphs can produce the same weighted adjacency matrix. This non-uniqueness raises important questions about the structural information lost during the projection and how to efficiently quantify the complexity of the original hypergraph. Here we develop a search algorithm to identify all hypergraphs corresponding to a given projection, analyze its runtime, and explore its parallelisability. Applying this algorithm to projections derived from a random hypergraph model, we characterize conditions under which projections are non-unique. Our findings provide a new framework and set of computational tools to investigate projections of hypergraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Researchers use networks to model relational data from complex systems and apply tools from network science to reveal their organisation and function. Many real-world systems, from social networks to protein-protein interactions and species distributions, exhibit overlapping flow-based communities that reflect their functional organisation. However, identifying such overlapping flow-based communities typically requires higher-order relational data, which is often unavailable. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from the representation-learning algorithm \textsl{node2vec} and model higher-order flows through memory-biased random walks on first-order networks. Instead of simulating these walks, we model their constraints with sparse memory networks and control model complexity with an information-theoretic approach. Using the map equation framework, we identify overlapping modules in the resulting higher-order networks. Our method proves robust across synthetic benchmark networks and reveals interpretable overlapping communities in empirical networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Panic-induced herding in individuals often leads to social disasters, resulting in people being trapped and trampled in crowd stampedes triggered by panic. We introduce a novel approach that offers fresh insights into studying the phenomenon of asymmetrical panic-induced escape. Our approach is based on the concept of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB), a fundamental governing mechanism in the Physical Sciences. By applying the principles of SSB, we conjecture that the onset of disastrous effects of panic can be understood as a SSB phenomenon, and we formulate the process accordingly. We highlight that this way of understanding panic escape leads to simple general measures of preventing catastrophic situations, by considering two crucial parameters: \emph{population density} and \emph{external information}. The interplay of these two parameters is responsible for either breaking or restoring the symmetry of a system. We describe how these parameters are set by design conditions as well as crowd control. Based on these parameters, we discuss strategies for preventing potential social disasters caused by asymmetrical panic escape.</description>

      <title>When LLMs Play the Telephone Game: Cultural Attractors as Conceptual Tools to Evaluate LLMs in Multi-turn Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) start interacting with each other and generating an increasing amount of text online, it becomes crucial to better understand how information is transformed as it passes from one LLM to the next. While significant research has examined individual LLM behaviors, existing studies have largely overlooked the collective behaviors and information distortions arising from iterated LLM interactions. Small biases, negligible at the single output level, risk being amplified in iterated interactions, potentially leading the content to evolve towards attractor states. In a series of telephone game experiments, we apply a transmission chain design borrowed from the human cultural evolution literature: LLM agents iteratively receive, produce, and transmit texts from the previous to the next agent in the chain. By tracking the evolution of text toxicity, positivity, difficulty, and length across transmission chains, we uncover the existence of biases and attractors, and study their dependence on the initial text, the instructions, language model, and model size. For instance, we find that more open-ended instructions lead to stronger attraction effects compared to more constrained tasks. We also find that different text properties display different sensitivity to attraction effects, with toxicity leading to stronger attractors than length. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for multi-step transmission dynamics and represent a first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of LLM cultural dynamics.</description>

Abstract: People's cooperation in adopting protective measures is effective in epidemic control and creates herd immunity as a public good. Similarly, the presence of an epidemic is a driving factor for the formation and improvement of cooperation. Here, we study the coevolution of epidemic dynamics and the public good game as a paradigm of cooperation dynamics. Using simulations and a mean-field description, we show that the presence of an epidemic can promote cooperation even in regimes where cooperation would not naturally emerge in the standard public good game. The coupling of the two dynamics leads to a rich phenomenology, such as the more efficient control of epidemics, instead of higher cooperation, when the economic benefit of cooperation increases, or higher cooperation, but not higher disease spread, when disease transmission probability increases. Besides, our work shows that a higher altruistic effect of cooperation in controlling the disease can only be detrimental to the evolution of cooperation and disease control. Rather, individuals' choices in adopting costly preventive measures are predominantly driven by the self-interested effect of such measures in reducing the probability of getting infected.</description>

Abstract: Homophily-the tendency to connect with similar others-plays a central role in shaping network structure and function. It is often treated as a uniform, global parameter, independent from other structural features. Here, we propose a maximum-entropy framework that decomposes homophily into contributions within and across groups, with the stochastic block model emerging as a special case. Our exponential-family formulation, parameterized by group size, fits real-world social networks well and allows homophily to be captured with a single parameter per group size. This decomposition shows that aggregate metrics often obscure group-level variation. We also find that the scale-dependent distribution of homophily has a significant impact on network percolation, influencing epidemic thresholds, the spread of ideas or behaviors, and the effectiveness of intervention strategies. Ignoring this heterogeneity can lead to distorted conclusions about connectivity and dynamics in complex systems.</description>
