      <title>A presentation of the symmetric Grothendieck-Witt group of local rings over $\mathbb{F}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative local ring. We provide an explicit presentation of the symmetric Grothendieck-Witt ring $\mathrm{GW}^{\mathrm{s}}(R)$ of $R$ as an abelian group when $R$ has residue field $\mathbb{F}_2$. This completes a recent work by Rogers and Schlichting, where an explicit presentation of $\mathrm{GW}^{\mathrm{s}}(R)$ is given when the residue field is different from $\mathbb{F}_2$. We then use this result to compute the symmetric Grothendieck-Witt rings for the sequences of local rings $\mathbb{Z}/2^n\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{F}_2[x]/(x^n)$.</description>

      <title>$K_1$-Stability of symplectic modules over monoid algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a regular ring of dimension $d$ and $L$ be a $c$-divisible monoid. If ${K}_1{Sp}(R)$ is trivial and $k \geq d+2,$ then we prove that the symplectic group ${Sp}_{2k}(R[L])$ is generated by elementary symplectic matrices over $R[L]$. When $d \leq 1$ or $R$ is a geometrically regular ring containing a field, then improved bounds have been established. We also discuss the linear case, extending the work of Gubeladze.</description>

      <title>Invertible Morava motives in quadrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We associate to any element in the Milnor K-theory of a field $k$ modulo 2 an invertible Morava K-theory motive over $k$. Specifically, for $\alpha$ in $\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{M}}_{n+1}(k)/2$ we construct an invertible $\mathrm{K}(n)$-motive $L_\alpha$ in a way that is natural in the base field and additive in $\alpha$. This can be seen as categorification of $\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{M}}_{n+1}(k)/2$ in motives.
  The motives $L_\alpha$ are constructed as direct summands of the $\mathrm{K}(n)$-motives of quadrics, and we develop the necessary framework for the study of the latter. We show that passing to the field of functions of quadrics of dimension greater than or equal to $2^{n+1}-1$ does not lose any information about the structure of $\mathrm{K}(n)$-motives. This is based on the study of "decomposition of the diagonal" in Morava K-theory of quadrics.
  For quadrics of dimension less than $2^{n+1}-1$, we show that their Chow motives can be "reconstructed" from their $\mathrm{K}(n)$-motives, although the latter appear structurally simpler. Our proof of this result relies on the use of the unstable symmetric operations of Vishik on algebraic cobordism.
  The occurrence of the motive $L_\alpha$ as a direct summand of the $\mathrm{K}(n)$-motive of $X$ can be seen as evidence that $\alpha$ is a cohomological invariant of $X$. We study this occurrence for quadrics and relate it to Kahn's Descent conjecture.</description>

      <title>Additivity and Fiber Sequences for Combinatorial K-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.07701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The (A)CGW categories of Campbell and Zakharevich show how finite sets and varieties behave like the objects of an exact category for the purpose of algebraic $K$-theory. These structures admit a well-behaved Q-construction akin to Quillen's, and satisfy analogues of the D\'evissage and Localization theorems. In this work, we modify Campbell and Zakharevich's axioms to obtain a framework called ECGW categories that allows for an $S_\bullet$-construction akin to Waldhausen's, and show how it produces a K-theory spectrum which satisfies an analogue of the Additivity Theorem. We also define a notion of ``relative ECGW categories'' which have weak equivalences determined by a subcategory of acyclic objects satisfying minimal conditions; these satisfy analogues of the Fibration and Localization Theorems that generalize previous versions in the literature. We illustrate these results with examples including exact categories, extensive categories, algebraic varieties, and polytopes up to scissors congruence.</description>

      <title>Delocalized eta invariants of the signature operator on G-proper manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected, linear real reductive group and let $X$ be a cocompact $G$-proper manifold without boundary. We define delocalized eta invariants associated to a $L^2$-invertible perturbed Dirac operator $D_X+A$ with $A$ a suitable smoothing perturbation. We also investigate the case in which $D_X$ is not invertible but $0$ is isolated in the $L^2$-spectrum of $D_X$. We prove index formulas relating these delocalized eta invariants to Atiyah-Patodi-Singer delocalized indices on $G$-proper manifolds with boundary. In order to achieve this program we give a detailed account of both the large and small time behaviour of the heat-kernel of perturbed Dirac operators, as a map from the positive real line to the algebra of Lafforgue integral operators. We apply these results to the definition of rho-numbers associated to $G$-homotopy equivalences between closed $G$-proper manifolds and to the study of their bordism properties. We also define delocalized signatures of manifolds with boundary satisfying an invertibility assumption on the differential form Laplacian of the boundary in middle degree and prove an Atiyah-Patodi-Singer formula for these delocalized signatures.</description>
