      <title>On the proximal dynamics between integrable and non-integrable members of a generalized Korteweg-de Vries family of equations</title>

Abstract: The distance between the solutions to the integrable Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and a broad class of non-integrable generalized KdV (gKdV) equations is estimated in appropriate Sobolev spaces. Special cases of the latter family of equations include the standard gKdV equation with a power nonlinearity, as well as weakly nonlinear perturbations of the KdV equation. The distance estimates are established for initial data and nonlinearity parameters of arbitrary size. A crucial step for their derivation is the proof of a size estimate for local solutions to the gKdV family of equations, which is linear in the norm of the initial data. As a result, the distance estimates themselves predict that the dynamics between the gKdV and KdV equations remains close over long times for initial amplitudes even close to unity, while for larger amplitudes they predict an explicit rate of deviation of the dynamics between the compared equations. These theoretical results are illustrated via numerical simulations in the case of one-soliton and two-soliton initial data, which are in an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. Importantly, in the case of a power nonlinearity and large solitonic initial data, the deviation between the integrable and non-integrable dynamics can be drastically reduced upon incorporating suitable rotation effects by means of a rescaled KdV equation. As a result, the integrable dynamics stemming from the rescaled KdV equation may persist in the gKdV family of equations over remarkably long timescales.</description>

      <title>Quasi-amorphous crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brittle plastic yielding is a salient feature of well-annealed glassy materials. Here we show that the same behavior is characteristic of perfect crystals after they experience mechanically driven elastic instability leading to massive nucleation of dislocations. We argue that such 'preparation' effectively converts an atomic configuration from crystalline to quasi-amorphous. To understand the nature of the subsequent mechanical response, which is reminiscent of quasi-brittle yielding we study an athermal model 2D crystal subjected to quasistatic loading. We show that the intermittent pre- and post-yield dislocation avalanches exhibit power law statistics with matching exponents. The computed value of these exponents is indicative of marginal stability.</description>
