      <title>Robustness of chaotic-light correlation plenoptic imaging against turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an imaging scheme, inspired by microscopy, in which both correlation imaging and first-order intensity imaging can be performed simultaneously, to investigate the effects of strong turbulence on the two different kinds of images. The comparison between direct and correlation imaging in the presence of strong turbulence unambiguously revealed an advantage of the latter. Remarkably, this advantage, quantified by analyzing the visibility of periodic sample patterns, is more striking when the presence of turbulence becomes the dominant factor in determining the image resolution.</description>

      <title>Efficient and accurate analysis of oscillation dynamics for dissipative cavity solitons based on the artificial neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a conventional means to analyze the system mechanism based on partial differential equations (PDE) or nonlinear dynamics, iterative algorithms are computationally intensive. In this framework, the details of oscillating dynamics of cavity solitons are beyond the reach of traditional mathematical analysis. In this work, we demonstrate that this long-standing challenge could be tackled down with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. We propose the incorporating parameter-fed ports, which are capable of recognizing period-doubling bifurcations of respiratory solitons and quickly predicting nonlinear dynamics of solitons with arbitrary parameter combinations and arbitrary time series lengths. The model predictions capture oscillatory features with a small Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) = 0.01676 and an absolute error that barely grows with the length of the prediction time. Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) based parameter space boundaries for typical oscillatory patterns are plotted at about 120 times the speed relative to the split-step Fourier method (SSFM) and higher resolution.</description>

      <title>Boosting the Self-driven Properties of 2D Photodetectors through Synergistic Asymmetrical Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-driven photodetectors (SDPDs) transform photon energy into electrical energy without external voltage, which makes them highly advantageous for applications such as low-power communication and imaging systems. Two-dimensional materials (2DMs) provide ideal platforms for SDPDs thanks to their band structures covering ultraviolet to infrared spectrum, strong light absorption efficiencies, and high carrier mobilities. However, the lack of stable doping methods and the complicated 2DMs multilayer stacking techniques pose tremendous difficulties for 2DMs to adopt the same device structures (i.e. PN junctions) as bulk materials, and the resultant self-driven performance remains at a low level. This work reveals how different asymmetrical effects can be combined to synergistically boost self-driven properties based on typical 2D metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors. Using WSe2 as an exemplary 2D material to build MSM photodetectors, the synergistic effect of asymmetrical contact electrodes and asymmetrical contact geometries is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the SDPD reaches 0.58V, with a zero-bias responsivity of 5.77 A/W and an on/off ratio of 1.73*10^5. Additionally, our devices demonstrate potential for visible light communication (VLC) in underwater environments. Our results offer a promising and efficient strategy for building SDPDs based on various 2DMs and pave the way toward low-power optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Single-Shot Supercontinuum-Enhanced Terahertz Spectroscopy (SETS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-shot terahertz (THz) spectroscopy probes sub-picosecond, non-repetitive events by combining the advantages of laser absorption techniques with the phase-sensitive detection of interferometric methods. However, its usage as a quantitative tool is hindered by the chirp penalty of the spectral encoding scheme, where a narrow probe bandwidth distorts the THz signal, limiting the bandwidth and spectral resolution of THz measurements. In this work, we introduce Supercontinuum-Enhanced Terahertz Spectroscopy (SETS), a method that leverages a broadband supercontinuum probe to overcome these challenges. With SETS, we show an increase in usable THz bandwidth from 1.5 THz to 2.3 THz, reducing signal distortion by 50% and offering a scalable pathway to extend bandwidth further. Numerical models of spectral encoding highlight the flexibility of SETS, achieving high spectral resolution (&lt; 4 GHz with a 250 ps supercontinuum pulse) while maintaining a usable bandwidth &gt; 1 THz for amplitude and phase spectra. Experiments on argon plasma and water vapor, complemented by theoretical validation, generalization, and extrapolation, show the capability of SETS to measure electron density, collision frequency, and absorption spectra simultaneously with tailored measurement accuracy and resolution (as low as 5x10^15 m^-3 for electron density). By addressing a critical limitation in single-shot diagnostics, SETS enables high-resolution, non-intrusive, quantitative measurements for complex reactive flows and dynamic refractive media.</description>

      <title>Modeling reflection and refraction of freeform surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a detailed procedure of computer implementation of the laws of refraction and reflection on an arbitrary surface with rotational symmetry with respect to the propagation axis. The goal is to facilitate the understanding and application of these physical principles in a computational context. This enables students and instructors alike to develop simulations and interactive applications that faithfully replicate the behavior of light and sound propagating in a diversity of media separated by arbitrary surfaces. In particular it can help to explore freeform optics. Additionally, we include a practical example demonstrating these implementations using either Matlab or open-source Octave programming language.</description>

      <title>Pseudospin Transverse Localization of Light in an Optical Disordered Spin-Glass Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization phenomena during transport are typically driven by disordered scalar potentials. Here, we predict a universal pseudospin localization phenomenon induced by a disordered vectorial potential and demonstrate it experimentally in an optical analogue of a classical disordered spin-glass magnetic phase. In our system, a transverse disorder in the second-order nonlinear coupling of a nonlinear photonic crystal causes the idler-signal light beam, representing the pseudospin current, to become localized in the transverse plane. This effect depends strongly on the nonlinear coupling strength, controlled by the optical pump power, revealing its inherently nonlinear and non-perturbative nature. Furthermore, this phenomenon is marked by decaying Rabi oscillations between the idler and signal fields, linked to the disorder properties, suggesting an accompanied longitudinal decoherence effect. Our findings offer deep insights into spin transport in disordered magnetic textures and open avenues for exploring complex magnetic phases and phase transitions using nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Using hyperspectral imaging to identify optimal narrowband filter parameters for construction and demolition waste classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is widely applied in various industries, enabling detailed analysis of material properties or composition through their spectral signatures. However, for classification of construction and demolition waste (CDW) materials, HSI is impractical since real-time sorting requires rapid data acquisition and lightweight classification. Instead, fitting selected narrowband filters onto standard cameras can achieve comparable results with substantially reduced computational overhead. In this study, reflectance data of common CDW materials were recorded using a hyperspectral camera, and a multilayer perceptron classifier was employed to evaluate different feature sets. The findings indicate that adding only two wavelengths beyond the RGB channels is sufficient for high-accuracy classification, with optimal filter central wavelengths identified at approximately 650-750 nm and 850-1000 nm across the tested bandwidths (5-50 nm) highlighting the importance of near-infrared regions for material discrimination.</description>

      <title>Photonic Modes in Twisted Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the behavior of photonic modes in twisted graphene nanoribbons (TGNRs) using an analytical approach based on solving the fully covariant vector boson equation. We present a model that demonstrates how helical twisting in TGNRs significantly affects the evolution of photonic modes. Our analytical solutions yield detailed expressions for mode profiles, energy spectra, and decay characteristics. We find that increasing the twist parameter shortens the decay times (\(\tau_{ns}\)) for damped modes, indicating enhanced photonic coupling due to the twisted geometry. Conversely, longer nanoribbons (NRs) exhibit increased decay times, showing a length (\(L\))-dependent effect, where \(\tau_{ns} \propto L / c\), with \(c\) representing the speed of light. These findings may enhance the understanding of light control in nanostructures and suggest potential applications in tunable photonic devices, topological photonics, and quantum optical systems.</description>

      <title>Visualization Techniques for Assessing Inhomogeneities and Stress in Ti:Sapphire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive optical analysis of titanium-doped sapphire (Ti:Sa) crystals, introducing two innovative measurement techniques to enhance the characterization of this material. The first method enables highly precise transmission measurements, facilitating the visualization of optical doping patterns across samples and providing accurate Figure of Merit (FoM) evaluations. This technique covers an area of 25 x 100 mm, allowing for the creation of detailed optical property maps. The second method is specifically designed to identify stress and refractive index inhomogeneities using circular polarization, leveraging the birefringent properties of Ti:Sa material. Experimental validation was performed on three Ti:Sa samples with distinct defects, analyzing and comparing their optical and structural properties. A novel central optical pattern, previously unreported, was observed in all samples. This pattern is hypothesized to originate from core formation during crystal growth. These findings provide new insights into the material's internal structure and hold significant implications for its optimization in optical applications.</description>

      <title>Photo-luminescence properties of ion implanted Er3+-defects in 4H-SiCOI towards integrated quantum photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colour centres hosted in solid-state materials such as silicon carbide and diamond are promising candidates for integration into chip-scale quantum systems. Specifically, the incorporation of these colour centres within photonic integrated circuits may enable precise control over their inherent photo-physical properties through strong light-matter interaction. Here, we investigate ion-implanted erbium ($\text{Er}^{3+}$) defects embedded in thin-film 4H-silicon-carbide-on-insulator (4H-SiCOI). Optimized implantation conditions and thermal annealing processes designed to enhance the emission characteristics of the $\text{Er}^{3+}$-defect are reported. By examining key properties such as photoluminescence intensity, optical lifetime, and polarization, we present an analysis of ensemble $\text{Er}^{3+}$-defects within 4H-SiCOI, providing insights into their potential for future quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Knife-Edge Diffraction of Scalar and Vector Vortex Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various methods have been introduced to measure the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, from fork holograms to Dove prism interferometers, from tilted lenses to triangular apertures - each with their own benefits and limitations. Here we demonstrate how simple knife-edge diffraction can be used to identify the OAM of an optical phase vortex from the formation of fork dislocations within the Fresnel diffraction pattern. For vector vortex beams without net OAM, the conventional Fresnel fringes are recovered, whereas the polarization in the geometric shadow is changed in its ellipticity. The observed diffraction patterns agree with simulations and their features can be explained by considering diffraction as an interference phenomenon. Knife-edge diffraction provides not only an instructive illustration of various properties of phase and polarization vortices, but can also serve as an ideal method for the quick determination of optical OAM, with potential applications beyond optics, where alternative detection measurement methods may be harder to realize.</description>

      <title>Impact of cut-off frequency effect on resonance energy transfer and Casimir-Polder interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Green's function approach, we investigate the resonance energy transfer (RET) rate between two parallel, identical two-level atoms in the presence of three types of cylindrical system: a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR), a perfectly reflecting wall (PRW), and a two-layer silicon fiber. Our analysis, incorporating the cut-off frequency condition, reveals significant suppression of the RET rate for atoms positioned along the axis of the cylinder with the PRW. In contrast, for atoms located within the DBR, the RET rate is enhanced in the far zone. Additionally, we find that for atoms oriented radially are placed inside or near the surface of the silicon fiber, the RET rate is entirely inhibited. We also investigate the Casimir-Polder (CP) interaction between a cut-off-frequency DBR and an excited atom, discovering a fully attractive potential towards the surface for the atom within the waveguide.</description>

      <title>Cavity quantum electrodynamics of photonic temporal crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic temporal crystals host a variety of intriguing phenomena, from wave amplification and mixing to exotic band structures, all stemming from the time-periodic modulation of optical properties. While these features have been well described classically, their quantum manifestation has remained elusive. Here, we introduce a quantum electrodynamical model of PTCs that reveals a deeper connection between classical and quantum pictures: the classical momentum gap arises from a localization-delocalization quantum phase transition in a Floquet-photonic synthetic lattice. Leveraging an effective Hamiltonian perspective, we pinpoint the critical momenta and highlight how classical exponential field growth manifests itself as wave-packet acceleration in the quantum synthetic space. Remarkably, when a two-level atom is embedded in such a cavity, its Rabi oscillations undergo irreversible decay to a half-and-half mixed state-a previously unobserved phenomenon driven by photonic delocalization within the momentum gap, even with just a single frequency mode. Our findings establish photonic temporal crystals as versatile platforms for studying nonequilibrium quantum photonics and suggest new avenues for controlling light matter interactions through time domain engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Displacement Current is a peculiar aspect of Maxwell's equation created by theoretical necessity only to be later validated through experimentation. We analyze the properties of the Displacement Current in the static condition of resulting in polarization of dielectrics and in the dynamic condition in Transverse Electromagnetic (TEM) waves. We perform this investigation to determine the role the Displacement Current has in influencing longitudinal interactions attributed to particles of light as part of the long-standing problem of physical optics known as the wave-particle duality, in addition to exploration of the theories of faster than light propagation in theoretical longitudinal modes of electric transmission attributed to the Displacement Current.</description>

      <title>Cost-effective time-stretch terahertz recorders using 1550 nm probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-stretch electro-optic detection allows THz waveforms to be recorded in single-shot, up to Megahertz acquisition rates. This capability is required in accelerator physics, and also opens new applications in table-top THz time-domain spectroscopy. However, the technique has also been notoriously known for the need of high speed -- and high cost -- ADCs or oscilloscopes for the readout. Furthermore, the resulting cost considerably increases with the number of samples that is needed per THz waveform, an issue that has severely limited the widespread of the technique so far. In this article, we show that particularly cost-effective designs can be obtained by using 1550~nm probes. We present the performances of an experimental design, that uses only standard components (including dispersive devices), and a standard commercial probe laser without additional pulse broadening. In these conditions, our time-stretch system could already record coherent THz pulses at the SOLEIL synchrotron radiation facility, over an unprecedented number of samples, using oscilloscopes and ADC boards with only 1-3 GHz bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Tunable absorption spectrum splitting in a pulse-driven three-level system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a two-level system is driven on resonance by a strong incident field, its emission spectrum is characterized by the well-known Mollow triplet. If the absorption from the excited state, in this continuously driven two-level system, to a third, higher energy level, is probed by a weak field, the resulting absorption spectrum features the Autler-Townes doublet with two peaks separated by the Rabi frequency of the strong driving field. It has been shown that when the two-level system is instead driven by a periodic pulse sequence, the emission spectrum obtained has similarities with the Mollow triplet even though the system is only driven during the short application time of the pulses and is allowed to evolve freely between pulses. Here, we evaluate the absorption spectrum of the three-level system in the ladder/cascade configuration when the bottom two levels are driven by a periodic pulse sequence while the transition between the middle and the highest level is probed by a weak field. The absorption spectrum displays similarities with the Autler-Townes doublet with frequency separation between the main peaks defined by the inter-pulse delay. In addition, this spectrum shows little dependence on the pulse carrier frequency. These results demonstrate the capacity to modulate the absorption spectrum of a three-level system with experimentally achievable pulse protocols.</description>

      <title>Parabolic dielectric reflector for extreme on-chip spot-size conversion with broad bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spot-size converters are key for efficient coupling of light between waveguides of different sizes. While adiabatic tapers are well suited for small size differences, they become impractically long for expansion factors around x100 which are often required when coupling integrated waveguides and free-space beams. Evanescent couplers and bragg deflectors can be used in this scenario, but their operation is inherently limited in bandwidth. Here we propose a solution based on a parabolic dielectric interface that couples light from a 0.5 um-wide waveguide to a 285 um-wide waveguide, i.e. an expansion factor of x570. We experimentally demonstrate an unprecedented bandwidth of more than 380 nm with insertion losses below 0.35 dB. We furthermore provide analytical expressions for the design of such parabolic spot-size-converters for arbitrary expansion factors.</description>

      <title>Equalities and inequalities from entanglement, loss, and beam splitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum optics bridges esoteric notions of entanglement and superposition with practical applications like metrology and communication. Throughout, there is an interplay between information theoretic concepts such as entropy and physical considerations such as quantum system design, noise, and loss. Therefore, a fundamental result at the heart of these fields has numerous ramifications in development of applications and advancing our understanding of quantum physics. Our recent proof for the entanglement properties of states interfering with the vacuum on a beam splitter led to monotonicity and convexity properties for quantum states undergoing photon loss [Lupu-Gladstein et al., arXiv:2411.03423 (2024)] by breathing life into a decades-old conjecture. In this work, we extend these fundamental properties to measures of similarity between states, provide inequalities for creation and annihilation operators beyond the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, prove a conjecture [Hertz et al., PRA 110, 012408 (2024)] dictating that nonclassicality through the quadrature coherence scale is uncertifiable beyond a loss of 50%, and place constraints on quasiprobability distributions of all physical states. These ideas can now circulate afresh throughout quantum optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waveguides on a chip represent a new medium for implementing nonlinear optical transformations of light. The capabilities of waveguides for generating sub-Poissonian light in the form of a displaced Kerr state are analyzed. We offer analytical formulas for estimating the ultimate capabilities of suppressing photon fluctuations of a displaced Kerr state for any value of input light amplitude. The results of numerical calculations are presented. It is shown that the degree of photon noise suppression can reach values of 5 - 15 dB with 100 mW light power in waveguides a few meters long.</description>

      <title>Photon Blockade in Cavity Magnomechanical Systems using Phase-Controlled Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we optimize photon blockade in a cavity magnomechanical system using feedback by introducing optimized values for the phase and magnetic field coupling strength at each drive frequency. It is shown that the computed values significantly reduce the photon second-order correlation function in the dynamic Schrodinger equation. The Radau method, an implicit Runge-Kutta method, has been employed, which provides more accurate results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a frequency detuning between the magnon and photon can result in deep values of photon blockade. Utilizing these optimized parameters outperforms scenarios that rely on constant, non-optimized values. This approach provides strong potential for applications in quantum sensing and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Mapping Transient Structures of Cyclo[18]Carbon by Computational X-Ray Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of cyclo[18]carbon (C$_{18}$), whether in its polyynic form with bond length alternation (BLA) or its cumulenic form without BLA, has long fascinated researchers, even prior to its successful synthesis. Recent studies suggest a polyynic ground state and a cumulenic transient state; however, the dynamics remain unclear and lack experimental validation. This study presents a first-principles theoretical investigation of the bond lengths ($R_1$ and $R_2$) dependent two-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) of C$_{18}$, concentrating on the ground state and carbon 1s ionized and excited states. We examine the potential of X-ray spectra for determining bond lengths and monitoring transient structures, finding that both X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and absorption (XAS) spectra are sensitive to these variations. Utilizing a library of ground-state minimum structures optimized with 14 different functionals, we observe that core binding energies predicted with the $\omega$B97XD functional can vary by 0.9 eV (290.3--291.2 eV). Unlike the ground state PES, which predicts minima at alternating bond lengths, the C1s ionized state PES predicts minima with equivalent bond lengths. In the XAS spectra, peaks 1$\pi^*$ and 2$\pi^*$ show a redshift with increasing bond lengths along the line where $R_1 = R_2$. Additionally, increasing $R_2$ (with $R_1$ fixed) results in an initial redshift followed by a blueshift, minimizing at $R_1 = R_2$. Major peaks indicate that both 1$\pi^*$ and 2$\pi^*$ arise from two channels: C1s$\rightarrow\pi^*_{z}$ (out-of-plane) and C1s$\rightarrow\pi^*_{xy}$ (in-plane) transitions at coinciding energies.</description>

      <title>Foam stabilization in salt solutions : the role of capillary drainage and Marangoni stresses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-standing question of why foaming is easier in seawater than in freshwater remains unresolved. In this study, we address this issue through precise interferometry single bubble experiments, demonstrating that the theory proposed by G. Marrucci (1969) provides a compelling explanation. Electrolyte solutions with varying concentrations of phosphate salts were used to study film formation and drainage, with thickness tracked by interferometry. In deionized water, bubbles rupture within seconds due to repaid dimple collapse. However, in phosphate salt solutions, bubbles persisted for several minutes. While surface tension gradients from evaporation-driven salt concentration gradients have been thought to create Marangoni stresses, our results show that despite film thinning being capillary-dominated, Marangoni-driven influx can be observed. Marrucci's theory explains this by showing that an increased interfacial area as the film thins, leads to higher salt concentration in the film due to Gibbs surface excess. This concentration gradient induces Marangoni stresses, causing flow reversal, increased film thickness, and enhanced foam stability. We show that Marrucci's theory has been incorrectly dismissed, and the predicted critical heights where fluid influx occurs closely match our findings and other studies using sodium chloride. Additionally, we extend the theory's applicability to foam films in non-aqueous film mixtures, highlighting its broader relevance.</description>

      <title>Generalized Huang's Equation for Phonon Polariton in Polyatomic Polar Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The original theory of phonon polariton is Huang's equation which is suitable for diatomic polar crystals only. We proposed a generalized Huang's equation without fitting parameters for phonon polariton in polyatomic polar crystals. We obtained the dispersions of phonon polariton in GaP (bulk), hBN (bulk and 2D), {\alpha}-MoO3 (bulk and 2D) and ZnTeMoO6 (2D), which agree with the experimental results in the literature and of ourselves. We also obtained the eigenstates of the phonon polariton. We found that the circular polarization of the ion vibration component of these eigenstates is nonzero in hBN flakes. The result is different from that of the phonon in hBN.</description>

      <title>Ultra-fast, high-power MUTC Photodiodes with bandwidth-efficiency product over 130 GHz * 100%</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerating demand for wireless communication necessitates wideband, energy-efficient photonic sub-terahertz (sub-THz) sources to enable ultra-fast data transfer. However, as critical components for THz photonic mixing, photodiodes (PDs) face a fundamental trade-off between quantum efficiency and bandwidth, presenting a major obstacle to achieving high-speed performance with high optoelectronic conversion efficiency. Here, we overcome this challenge by demonstrating an InP-based, waveguide-integrated modified uni-traveling carrier photodiode (MUTC-PD) with a terahertz bandwidth exceeding 200 GHz and a bandwidth-efficiency product (BEP) surpassing 130 GHz * 100%. Through the integration of a spot-size converter (SSC) to enhance external responsivity, alongside optimized electric field distribution, balanced carrier transport, and minimized parasitic capacitance, the device achieves a 3-dB bandwidth of 206 GHz and an external responsivity of 0.8 A/W, setting a new benchmark for BEP. Packaged with WR-5.1 waveguide output, it delivers radio-frequency (RF) power exceeding -5 dBm across the 127-185 GHz frequency range. As a proof of concept, we achieved a wireless transmission of 54 meters with a single-line rate of up to 120 Gbps, leveraging photonics-aided technology without requiring a low-noise amplifier (LNA). This work establishes a pathway to significantly enhance optical power budgets and reduce energy consumption, presenting a transformative step toward high-bandwidth, high-efficiency sub-THz communication systems and next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Experimental Bound on the Maximum Predictive Power of Physical Theories in Multi-Dimensional Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The completeness of quantum mechanics in predictive power is a central question in its foundational study. While most investigations focus on two-dimensional systems, high-dimensional systems are more general and widely applicable. Building on the non-extensibility theorem by Colbeck and Renner [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 050403 (2008)], which established that no higher theory can enhance the predictive power of quantum mechanics for two-dimensional systems, we extend this result to arbitrarily dimensional systems. We connect maximum potential predictive power achievable by any alternative theory to experimentally observable correlations, and establish optimal experimental bounds across varying dimensions by exploiting two-photon orbital angular momentum entangled states with entanglement concentration. These bounds falsify a broader class of alternative theories, including Bell's and Leggett's models, and those that remain theoretically ambiguous or experimentally unverified. Our findings not only deepen the foundational understanding of quantum mechanics but also hold significant potential for high-dimensional quantum cryptography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to Bell's theorem, any model based on local variables cannot reproduce certain quantum correlations. A critical question is whether one could devise an alternative framework, based on nonlocal variables, to reproduce quantum correlations while adhering to fundamental principles. Leggett proposed a nonlocal model, termed crypto-nonlocality, rooted in considerations of the reality of photon polarization, but this property restricted it to being bi-dimensional. In this Letter, we extend the crypto-nonlocal model to higher dimensions and develop a framework for constructing experimentally testable Leggett-type inequalities for arbitrary dimensions. Our investigation into models that yield specific predictions exceeding those of quantum mechanics is intriguing from an information-theoretic perspective and is expected to deepen our understanding of quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Phase-contrast imaging of a dense atomic cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the experimental production and characterization of a dense cold atomic cloud of \(^{88}\text{Sr}\) atoms, optimized for the future studies of light transport in highly dense regimes. Using narrow-line molasses on the 689 nm transition, combined with a far off-resonant optical dipole trap, we achieve spatial densities as high as \(7.9 \times 10^{13} \, \text{atoms/cm}^3\) and optical depths up to 64. This approach stands out from previous methods by integrating narrow-line molasses with an optical dipole trap, enabling high-density samples without relying on evaporative cooling. Unlike traditional absorption imaging, which becomes inaccurate in such dense regimes, we demonstrate that phase-contrast imaging (PCI) can reliably reconstruct the in-situ density profile even for highly spatially and optically dense samples. The use of a spatial light modulator instead of a fixed phase plate in the PCI setup provides enhanced flexibility and control of imaging parameters, making this imaging technique robust against imaging artifacts and adaptable to varying experimental conditions. Moreover, we derive theoretical conditions for reliable PCI operation in dense regimes and validate these experimentally, showing excellent agreement with time-of-flight measurements even at the highest densities. Our results establish a robust method for producing and characterizing dense atomic clouds.</description>

Abstract: The growing use of photonic integrated circuits in light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors has made the speckle and phase distribution of the reflected light relevant for coupling into the guided modes of these systems. We adopt the use of a simplified diffuse surface model to show the average coupling efficiency of reflected speckle into guided modes can be predicted from the optical intensity at the target. For the first time, we provide experimental results to show that this relationship is valid for predicting free-space loss as a function of range. We intend to aid optics design for integrated photonic LiDAR systems, providing a simple and accurate model to predict the free-space loss from a representative target at all distances.</description>

      <title>Efficient algorithms for surface density of states in topological photonic and acoustic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological photonics and acoustics have recently garnered wide research interests for their topological ability to manipulate the light and sound at surfaces. Conventionally, the supercell technique is the standard approach to calculating these boundary effects, whereas it consumes increasingly large computational resources as the supercell size grows. Additionally, it falls short in differentiating the surface states at opposite boundaries and from bulk states due to the finite size of systems. To overcome the limitations, here we provide two complementary efficient methods for obtaining the ideal topological surface states of a semi-infinite system. The first one is the cyclic reduction method, which is based on iteratively inverting the Hamiltonian for a single unit cell, and the other is the transfer matrix method, which relies on the eigenanalysis of a transfer matrix for a pair of unit cells. Benchmarks show that, compared to the traditional supercell method, the cyclic reduction method can reduce both memory and time consumption by two orders of magnitude; the transfer matrix method can reduce memory by an order of magnitude, take less than half the time, and achieve high accuracy. Our methods are applicable to more complex scenarios, such as coated structures, heterostructures, and sandwiched structures. As examples, the surface-density-of-states spectra of photonic Chern insulators, valley photonic crystals, and acoustic topological insulators are demonstrated. Our computational schemes enable direct comparisons with near-field scanning measurements and expedite the exploration of topological artificial materials and the design of topological devices.</description>

Abstract: The centerpiece of topological photonics is the bulk-boundary correspondence principle (BBCP), which relates discrete invariants of the Bloch bands to the possible presence of topologically protected interface modes between two periodic heterostructures. In addition to the fundamental significance of BBCP, interface modes are of interest in a variety of applications. In Maxwell's electrodynamics, the BBCP has been rigorously proved for 1D problems, but the 2D case is qualitatively different, because the boundary conditions involve nontrivial Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps rather than scalar impedances as in 1D. The theoretical analysis and numerical examples presented in the paper are consistent with the BBCP. Moreover, the BBCP is closely connected with the positivity of electromagnetic energy density, as has also been shown to be the case in 1D and 1.5D.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Agnostic Topology Optimization Framework for Photonic-Crystal Structures</title>

Abstract: We present a symmetry-agnostic topology optimization framework for photonic-crystal structures based on computation of the photonic density of states in a manner analogous to $\Gamma$-point integration. We provide a generalization of the approach that allows for computations at different scales with the additional scales being analogous to integration over the full Brillouin zone and to regimes between the two limiting cases of full Brillouin-zone integration and $\Gamma$-point integration, though these other scales do not preserve the symmetry-agnostic nature of the $\Gamma$-point framework. We also demonstrate how our approach can be generalized to the problem of inverting photonic or phononic bandstructures and to the treatment of the frequency-dependent optical response of materials. Finally, we show that at the symmetry-agnostic scale analogous to $\Gamma$-point integration, we can recover a known two-dimensional photonic crystal for the TM polarization. A key insight of our work is the determination of the minimum supercell size and the minimum precision to which the frequencies within the photonic bandgap must be sampled in order to observe photonic-crystal structures.</description>

      <title>Photoacoustic Iterative Optimization Algorithm with Shape Prior Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00705v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) suffers from inherent limitations that can degrade the quality of reconstructed results, such as noise, artifacts and incomplete data acquisition caused by sparse sampling or partial array detection. In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of polarising components at cryogenic temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling polarisation directly at low temperature is crucial for development of optical spectroscopy techniques at sub-Kelvin temperatures, for example, in a hybrid scheme where light is fed into and collected in the cryostat by fibres that are as easy to install as electrical wiring, but where distortions in the fibre need to be compensated for by discrete polarising optical components. The latter are poorly characterised at low temperatures. So we cool-down polarising components from room temperature to 4K and monitor the evolution of the polarisation properties in this range. We test a zero-order half-wave plate, a polarising beamsplitting cube and a dichroic polariser in the optical telecommunication range at 1.5$\mu$m. We show that the polarisation is maintained at the $10^{-4}$ level within the whole temperature range. This is consistent with the typical thermal contraction of optical materials. This level of precision is sufficient for many optics experiments at low temperature. We argue that these experiments will allow the design of compact fibre based probes for cryogenic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Optimizing for a Near Single-Mode Type-0 Optical Parametric Amplifier in Nanophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has recently emerged as a promising platform for integrated nonlinear photonics, enabling the use of optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) for applications in quantum information processing, precision metrology, and ultrafast optical signal processing. However, OPA waveguide designs have not yet achieved the phase-matching conditions for type-0 operation in a single spectro-temporal mode, limiting their use. We optimize the waveguide dimensions, poling pattern, pump wavelength, and pump pulse duration for high spectral purity, a metric for single-mode fidelity. We numerically demonstrate a nanophotonic OPA with a spectral purity of 0.982 in a TFLN waveguide. Through semi-classical simulations, we further demonstrate that in the optical parametric regime, where vacuum fluctuations at the input of the OPA can saturate the gain and deplete the pump, the macroscopic output of such a single-mode OPA can be utilized for an ultra-fast quantum random number generator. These results demonstrate a promising direction for integrated OPAs in a wide range of ultrafast quantum nanophotonics applications.</description>

      <title>Detectorless 3D terahertz imaging: achieving subwavelength resolution with reflectance confocal interferometric microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz imaging holds great potential for non-destructive material inspection, but practical implementation has been limited by resolution constraints. In this study, we present a novel single-pixel THz imaging system based on a confocal microscope architecture, utilising a quantum cascade laser as both transmitter and phase-sensitive receiver. Our approach addresses these challenges by integrating laser feedback interferometry detection, achieving a two-fold improvement in lateral resolution compared to conventional reflectance confocal microscopy and a dramatic enhancement in axial resolution through precise interferometric phase measurements. This breakthrough provides lateral resolution near $\lambda/2$ and a depth of focus better than $\lambda/5$, significantly outperforming traditional confocal systems. The system can produce a 0.5 Mpixel image in under two minutes, surpassing both raster-scanning single-pixel and multipixel focal-plane array-based imagers. Coherent operation enables simultaneous amplitude and phase image acquisition, and a novel visualisation method links amplitude to image saturation and phase to hue, enhancing material characterisation. A 3D tomographic analysis of a silicon chip reveals subwavelength features, demonstrating the system's potential for high-resolution THz imaging and material analysis. This work sets a new benchmark for THz imaging, overcoming key challenges and opening up transformative possibilities for non-destructive material inspection and characterisation.</description>

      <title>On the Twistability of Partially Coherent, Schell-model Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of assessing the twistability of a given bona fide cross-spectral density is tackled for the class of Schell-model sources, whose shift-invariant degree of coherence is represented by a real and symmetric function, {denoted as} $\mu(-\bfr)=\mu(\bfr)$. By employing an abstract operatorial language, the problem of determining the highly degenerate spectrum of a twisted operator $\hat W_u$ is addressed through a modal analysis based on {the} complete knowledge of the spectrum of the {\em sole} twist operator $\hat T_u$, as found by R. Simon and N. Mukunda. [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A \textbf{15,} 1361 (1998)]. To this end, the evaluation of the complete tensor of the matrix elements $\bra n',\ell'|\hat W_u|n,\ell\ket$ is carried out within the framework of the so-called {\em extended Wigner distribution function}, a concept recently introduced by M. {VanValkenburgh} [J. Mod. Opt. \textbf{55,} 3537 - 3549 (2008)]. As a nontrivial application of the algorithm developed here, the analytical determination of the spectrum of saturated twisted astigmatic Gaussian Schell-model sources is also presented.</description>

      <title>Observing Quantum Coherent Oscillations in a Three-Level Atoms via Electromagnetically Induced Transparency by Two-Dimensional Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has high spectral resolution and is a useful tool for studying atom dynamics. In this paper, we show a smallest unit of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) for 2DES, that is, a three-level system. It is found that the original main peak is split into four small ones due to the introduction of the EIT. It suggests that the homogeneous broadening of 2DES can be effectively reduced by the EIT. Moreover, in sharp contrast to a constant height, the height of the peaks will manifest a damped oscillation with respect to the population time. It seems that the quantum-beat phenomenon appears. These findings may help us obtain more information about the dynamics of excited states.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise induced nonreciprocity for single photon transport in parity-time symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show nonreciprocal light propagation for single-photon inputs due to quantum noise in coupled optical systems with gain and loss. We consider two parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric linear optical systems consisting of either two directly coupled resonators or two finite-length waveguides evanescently coupled in parallel. One resonator or waveguide is filled with an active gain medium and the other with a passive loss medium. The light propagation is reciprocal in such $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric linear systems without quantum noise. We show here that light transmission becomes nonreciprocal when we include quantum noises in our modeling, which is essential for a proper physical description. The quantum nonreciprocity is especially pronounced in the $\mathcal{PT}$ broken phase. Transmitted light intensity in the waveguide of incidence is asymmetric for two waveguides even without noise. Quantum noise significantly enhances such asymmetry in the broken phase.</description>

      <title>Phonon-induced modification of polaritonic Rabi oscillations in the presence of the dark excitonic condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13882v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optically inactive (dark) intervalley momentum-forbidden excitons are characterized by relatively long life time, and therefore are desirable candidates for realizing collective excitonic phases. However, testing their coherence by light directly is impossible. Here we propose a method for detecting a dark excitonic condensate. It relies on the interaction between excitons and phonons responsible for the interconversion between bright and dark excitons. As long as the dark condensate forms, the Rabi oscillations between photons and bright excitons can become strongly modified, and can be viewed as the photon-exciton-phonon polaritonic effect. The multi-component nature of the dark condensate consistent with the point-group symmetry is taken into account in the limit of weak phonon-exciton interaction. A perspective for the case of the strong interaction leading to the polaronic effect is discussed.</description>
