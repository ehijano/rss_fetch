      <title>An End-to-End Distributed Quantum Circuit Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has made substantial progress in recent years; however, its scalability remains constrained on a monolithic quantum processing unit (QPU). Distributed quantum computing (DQC) offers a pathway by coordinating multiple QPUs to execute large-scale circuits. Yet, DQC still faces practical barriers, as its realization depends on advances in hardware-level components such as quantum transducers and high-fidelity entanglement-distribution modules. While these technologies continue to improve, mature DQC platforms remain unavailable. In the meantime, researchers need to assess the benefits of DQC and evaluate emerging DQC designs, but the software ecosystem lacks a circuit-level simulator that models heterogeneous backends, noisy connections, and distributed execution. To fill this gap, this paper proposes SimDisQ, the first end-to-end circuit-level DQC simulator, composed of a set of novel DQC-oriented automated simulation toolkits and communication noise models that can interoperate with existing toolkits in mainstream quantum software ecosystems. Leveraging circuit-level simulation capabilities, SimDisQ enables quantitative exploration of architectural design trade-offs, communication fidelity constraints, and new circuit optimization challenges introduced by DQC, providing a foundation for future research in this promising direction. Benchmarking experiments using SimDisQ respond to a couple of open questions in the community; for example, noisy simulation of superconducting and trapped-ion qubits, with a reasonable entanglement-distribution fidelity, reveal that heterogeneous QPUs can indeed yield higher execution fidelity.</description>

      <title>Are Large Brainwave Foundation Models Capable Yet? Insights from Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation Models have demonstrated significant success across various domains in Artificial Intelligence (AI), yet their capabilities for brainwave modeling remain unclear. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate current Large Brainwave Foundation Models (LBMs) through systematic fine-tuning experiments across multiple Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) benchmark tasks, including memory tasks and sleep stage classification. Our extensive analysis shows that state-of-the-art LBMs achieve only marginal improvements (0.9%-1.2%) over traditional deep architectures while requiring significantly more parameters (millions vs thousands), raising important questions about their efficiency and applicability in BCI contexts. Moreover, through detailed ablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce trainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that architectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities. Our experiments span both full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, providing insights into optimal training strategies for BCI applications. We pioneer the application of LoRA to LBMs, revealing that performance benefits generally emerge when adapting multiple neural network components simultaneously. These findings highlight the critical need for domain-specific development strategies to advance LBMs, suggesting that current architectures may require redesign to fully leverage the potential of foundation models in brainwave analysis.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Uplink 256QAM on Commercial 5G New Radio (NR) Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Uplink 256QAM (UL-256QAM) has been introduced since 2016 as a part of 3GPP Release 14, the adoption was quite poor as many Radio Access Network (RAN) and User Equipment (UE) vendors didn't support this feature. With the introduction of 5G, the support of UL-256QAM has been greatly improved due to a big re-haul of RAN by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). However, many RAN manufacturers charge MNOs for licenses to enable UL-256QAM per cell basis. This led to some MNOs hesitating to enable the feature on some of their gNodeB or cells to save cost.
  Since it's known that 256QAM modulation requires a very good channel condition to operate, but UE has a very limited transmission power budget. In this paper, 256QAM utilization, throughput and latency impact from enabling UL-256QAM will be evaluated on commercial 5G Standalone (SA) networks in two countries: Japan and Thailand on various frequency bands, mobility characteristics, and deployment schemes. By modifying the modem firmware, UL-256QAM can be turned off and compared to the conventional UL-64QAM. The results show that UL-256QAM utilization was less than 20% when deployed on a passive antenna network resulting in an average of 8.22% improvement in throughput. However, with Massive MIMO deployment, more than 50% utilization was possible on commercial networks. Furthermore, despite a small uplink throughput gain, enabling UL-256QAM can lower the latency when the link is fully loaded with an average improvement of 7.97 ms in TCP latency observed across various test cases with two TCP congestion control algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Accelerating Newton-Raphson Convergence with Ising Machines: A Case Study for Power Flow Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Newton-Raphson (NR) method is widely used for solving power flow (PF) equations due to its quadratic convergence. However, its performance deteriorates under poor initialization or extreme operating scenarios, e.g., high levels of renewable energy penetration. Traditional NR initialization strategies often fail to address these challenges, resulting in slow convergence or even divergence. We propose the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the initialization of NR, and introduce a novel quantum-enhanced RL environment update mechanism to mitigate the significant computational cost of evaluating power system states over a combinatorially large action space at each RL timestep by formulating the voltage adjustment task as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. Specifically, quantum/digital annealers are integrated into the RL environment update to evaluate state transitions using a problem Hamiltonian designed for PF. Results demonstrate significant improvements in convergence speed, a reduction in NR iteration counts, and enhanced robustness under different operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic yet practical optimization of quantum circuits implementing GF($2^m$) multiplication and division operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20618v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present optimized quantum circuits for GF$(2^m)$ multiplication and division operations, which are essential computing primitives in various quantum algorithms. Our ancilla-free GF multiplication circuit has the gate count complexity of $O(m^{\log_2{3}})$, an improvement over the previous best bound of $O(m^2)$. This was achieved by developing an efficient $O(m)$ circuit for multiplication by the constant polynomial $1+x^{\lceil{m/2}\rceil}$, a key component of Van Hoof's construction. This asymptotic reduction translates to a factor of 100+ improvement of the CNOT gate counts in the implementation of the multiplication by the constant for parameters $m$ of practical importance. For the GF division, we reduce gate count complexity from $O(m^2 \log(m))$ to $O(m^2 \log \log(m)/\log(m))$ by selecting irreducible polynomials that enable efficient implementation of both the constant polynomial multiplication and field squaring operations. We demonstrate practical advantages for cryptographically relevant values of $m$, including reductions in both CNOT and Toffoli gate counts. Additionally, we explore the complexity of implementing square roots of linear reversible unitaries and demonstrate that a root, although itself still a linear reversible transformation, can require asymptotically deeper circuit implementations than the original unitary.</description>

      <title>Boundaries of Acceptable Defectiveness: Redefining Surface Code Robustness under Heterogeneous Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of past research on superconducting qubits shows that these devices exhibit considerable variation and thus cannot be accurately depicted by a uniform noise model. To combat this often unrealistic picture of homogeneous noise in quantum processors during runtime, our work aims to define the boundaries of acceptable defectiveness (BADs), or the upper boundary of a qubit's physical error, past which this defective qubit entirely degrades the logical computation and should be considered faulty and removed from the surface code mapping. Here, we present a simulation framework based on the stabilizer simulation package STIM, that allows for rapid experimentation of quantum error correction (QEC) performance under any arbitrary and unique noise model. Using this tool, QEC circuits using rotated surface codes were generated, sampled, and analyzed from distances 3 to 17, with various defective error rates and outlier defect locations. The results suggest that there are, in fact, boundaries of acceptable defectiveness in which a defective qubit, with a physical error rate $\leq 0.75$, can be left in the lattice with negligible impact on logical error rate given sufficient code distances and proper placement in the lattice. Additionally, when modeling noise as a uniform distribution, the logical error rate shows minimal impact with increasing deviation, with $\sigma \leq \mu$. As a result, we propose that defectiveness of both individual qubits and the overall uniformity of lattice fidelity should not be viewed as all or nothing, but instead as a spectrum. Our research demonstrates how heterogeneity relates to the logical error rate and, through the framework provided, facilitates the development of preliminary goals and metrics for hardware designers to meet to achieve target logical performance with imperfect or nonuniform qubit qualities.</description>
