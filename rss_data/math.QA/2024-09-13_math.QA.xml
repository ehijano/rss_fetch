      <title>Bootstrapping the critical behavior of multi-matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a matrix model, by combining the Schwinger-Dyson equations with positivity constraints on its solutions, in the large $N$ limit one is able to obtain explicit and numerical bounds on its moments. This technique is known as bootstrapping with positivity. In this paper we use this technique to estimate the critical points and exponents of several matrix multi-models. As a proof of concept, we first show it can be used to find the well-studied quartic single matrix model's critical phenomena. We then apply the method to several similar ``unsolved" 2-matrix models with various quartic interactions. We conjecture and present strong evidence for the string susceptibility exponent for some of these models to be $\gamma = 1/2$, which heuristically indicates that the continuum limit will likely be the Continuum Random Tree. For the other 2-matrix models, we find estimates of new string susceptibility exponents that may indicate a new continuum limit. We then study an unsolved 3-matrix model that generalizes the 3-colour model with cubic interactions. Additionally, for all of these models, we are able to derive explicitly the first several terms of the free energy in the large $N$ limit as a power series expansion in the coupling constants at zero by exploiting the structure of the Schwinger-Dyson equations.</description>

      <title>Associated varieties of simple affine VOAs $L_k(sl_3)$ and $W$-algebras $W_k(sl_3,f)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we first prove that the maximal ideal of the universal affine vertex operator algebra $V^k(sl_n)$ for $k=-n+\frac{n-1}{q}$ is generated by two singular vectors of conformal weight $3q$ if $n=3$, and by one singular vector of conformal weight $2q$ if $n\geq 4$. We next determine the associated varieties of the simple vertex operator algebras $L_k(sl_3)$ for all the non-admissible levels $k=-3+\frac{2}{2m+1}$, $m\geq 0$. The varieties of the associated simple affine $W$-algebras $W_k(sl_3,f)$, for nilpotent elements $f$ of $sl_3$, are also determined.</description>

      <title>Quantum wreath products and Schur-Weyl duality I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14181v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper the authors introduce a new notion called the quantum wreath product, which is the algebra $B \wr_Q \mathcal{H}(d)$ produced from a given algebra $B$, a positive integer $d$, and a choice $Q=(R,S,\rho,\sigma)$ of parameters. Important examples {that arise from our construction} include many variants of the Hecke algebras, such as the Ariki-Koike algebras, the affine Hecke algebras and their degenerate version, Wan-Wang's wreath Hecke algebras, Rosso-Savage's (affine) Frobenius Hecke algebras, Kleshchev-Muth's affine zigzag algebras, and the Hu algebra that quantizes the wreath product $\Sigma_m \wr \Sigma_2$ between symmetric groups.
  In the first part of the paper, the authors develop a structure theory for the quantum wreath products. Necessary and sufficient conditions for these algebras to afford a basis of suitable size are obtained. Furthermore, a Schur-Weyl duality is established via a splitting lemma and mild assumptions on the base algebra $B$. Our uniform approach encompasses many known results which were proved in a case by case manner. The second part of the paper involves the problem of constructing natural subalgebras of Hecke algebras that arise from wreath products. Moreover, a bar-invariant basis of the Hu algebra via an explicit formula for its extra generator is also described.</description>
