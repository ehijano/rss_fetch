      <title>A Reduced Action Integral for Photon-Photon Interactions in Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves propagating through vacuum can polarize virtual electron-positron pairs; this polarization, in turn, nonlinearly modifies their propagation. A semi-classical nonlinear wave equation describing the propagation is derived from the Euler--Heisenberg Lagrangian density, which captures vacuum polarization effects up to the one-loop level. Here, we present a reduced-action-integral approach that enables rapid modeling of nonlinear phenomena arising from the Euler--Heisenberg Lagrangian. Application of the variational principle to the reduced action provides equations of motion for familiar light-pulse parameters, such as spot size, phase, polarization, and phase-front curvature, without requiring full-field simulations. Three examples demonstrate the utility of the approach: phase modulation, birefringence, and frequency mixing.</description>

      <title>Off resonant Fano enhanced single molecule resolution imaging with a CW source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Apertureless scanning near-field optical microscopy (a-SNOM) is typically limited to ~10 nm resolution by the tip apex size. We demonstrate that ~1-nm resolution can be achieved under continuous-wave (CW) illumination by exploiting Fano path interference. A defect center that naturally forms at the apex of a metal-coated AFM tip acts as a quantum object and induces Fano interference, forcing a stronger but normally off-resonant plasmonic mode (597 nm) to operate effectively on resonance at the driving wavelength (520 nm). Because this interference occurs only beneath the defect, a ~1-nm-wide, strongly enhanced near-field hotspot is created. Using this off-resonant Fano-enhanced field, we achieve single-molecule-resolution imaging based on exact three-dimensional Maxwell simulations.</description>

      <title>Full-field-of-view aberration correction for large arrays of focused beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and implement an aberration correction method for the creation of extended arrays of spots well beyond the isoplanatic region of any optical system. The method relies on an extensive calibration of aberrations in terms of Zernike polynomials over the full accessible field of an optical system. We introduce a modified Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for generating holographic phase masks creating fully corrected arbitrary arrays of spots. By applying the method to an aspherical lens, and using a liquid-crystal spatial light modulator (SLM), we increase the aberration-free field of view from 50 to 500 $\mu$m, only limited by the largest diffraction angles accessible to the SLM. This opens new perspectives for the generation of large arrays of optical tweezers, especially for neutral atom based quantum processors and simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog coprocessors for neural networks are an intensively developing field. They provide approximate results of computations for relatively low energy cost and at high speed. We show that a set of ring resonators with Brillouin interaction between photons and phonons, being coupled to a waveguide, can be used to implement matrix-vector multiplication. The input vector is formed by occupancies of the anti-Stokes optical modes pumped via spontaneous Brillouin scattering, i.e, scattering on thermal phonons. Brillouin scattering rates and coupling constants between ring resonators and the waveguide form the matrix. The system allows for parallel computations in frequency band.</description>

      <title>A dispersion-driven 3D color near-eye meta-display</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromatic dispersion, an inherent wavelength-dependent phenomenon in optical systems, has traditionally been regarded as a detrimental effect to be minimized in imaging and display. Here, we present a paradigm shift by deliberately engineering and harnessing metalens dispersion as a functional mechanism for three-dimensional (3D) near-eye displays. Specifically, we exploit lateral dispersion to transform transverse offset between green and red objects into image-space angular separations that make their images intersected virtually, thereby creating color-merged 3D virtual-image perception. This meta-display architecture preserves compactness of conventional planar display while exhibiting less data requirements and lower hardware complexity than other near-eye 3D displays. Experimentally, we demonstrate a multi-color near-eye 3D system achieving an 11{\deg} field of view, 22 pixels-per-degree angular resolution, 0.9 m depth of field, and 19 distinct image planes. This work establishes a new pathway for metasurfaces toward visual displays and highlights great potential for future virtual/augmented reality.</description>

      <title>Light matter interaction in van der Waals heterostructures with Mie voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently introduced concept of Mie voids allows to enhance the field localization inside air cavities embedded in high-index materials. Mie voids provide an alternative approach to conventional dielectric resonators that confine optical fields within bulk high-index materials. Building on this concept, here we present a hybrid photonic platform that integrates monolayer WS2 with Mie void resonators patterned in a high-index Bi2Te3 substrate. By carefully aligning the dipolar void resonance with the excitonic transition of WS2, we achieve substantially enhanced photoluminescence and second-harmonic generation. Far-field imaging of the harmonic fields reveals spatially resolved hotspots that directly map localized resonant modes, with their positions tunable by cavity geometry and pump wavelength. This approach enables real-space control of nonlinear emission at the single-resonator level, offering a robust and reconfigurable platform for next-generation nonlinear photonics and surface-enhanced optical sensing.</description>

      <title>Polygonal Spatiotemporal Optical Vortices Wavepackets with Prescribed Vortex Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical vortices carrying orbital angular momentum offer additional degrees of freedom. According to the orientation of orbital angular momentum, optical vortices can be classified into spatial optical vortex beam carrying longitudinalorbital angular momentum and spatiotemporal optical vortices carrying transverse orbital angular momentum. As an emerging subset of optical vortices, polygonal optical vortices provide a unique platform for a wide range of frontier applications by introducing a new degree of freedom in the form of a customizable intensity structure. In the spatial domain, polygonal spatial optical vortex beam carrying longitudinal orbital angular momentum have already demonstrated great potential in optical manipulation and two-photon lithography. However, polygonal spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepackets contain multiple sub spatiotemporal optical vortices carrying transverse orbital angular momentum remains unrealized to date. In this work, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate polygonal spatiotemporal optical vortices wavepackets embedded with prescribed vortex structures. Within the structure, a prescribed number of sub spatiotemporal optical vortices carrying transverse orbital angular momentum is set along a designed polygonal spatiotemporal trajectory. Using the spatiotemporal holographic shaping approach, we generate polygonal perfect spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepacket and use the combination of multiple polygonal perfect spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepacket to form polygonal spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepacket with the prescribed vortex structure. A full control over multiple key properties of the polygonal spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepackets such as the geometry, number of phase singularities, and spatiotemporal distribution of sub spatiotemporal optical vortices is also achieved.</description>

      <title>Three-Octave Supercontinuum Generation Spanning from Ultraviolet in Lithium Tantalate Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate, for the first time, supercontinuum generation spanning more than three octaves in dispersion-engineered thin-film lithium tantalite (TFLT) waveguides. Pumped by a femtosecond laser at 1560 nm, the waveguides yield a spectrum from 240 nm in the ultraviolet to beyond 2400 nm in the near-infrared. The spectral evolution is mapped from low-power harmonic generation (second- and third-harmonic) to a high-power continuum driven by soliton fission and dispersive wave emission. This first demonstration of ultrabroadband nonlinear optics in TFLT establishes it as a competitive, low-loss platform for integrated photonics, with significant potential for applications in frequency metrology and on-chip spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Photoacoustic model for laser-induced acoustic desorption of nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-induced acoustic desorption (LIAD) enables loading nanoparticles into optical traps under vacuum for levitated optomechanics experiments. Current LIAD systems rely on empirical optimization using available laboratory lasers rather than systematic theoretical design, resulting in large systems incompatible with portable or space-based applications. We develop a theoretical framework using the photoacoustic wave equation to model acoustic wave generation and propagation in metal substrates, enabling systematic optimization of laser parameters. The model identifies key scaling relationships: surface acceleration scales as $\tau^{-2}$ with pulse duration, while acoustic diffraction sets fundamental limits on optimal spot size $w \gtrsim \sqrt{v\tau d}$. Material figures of merit combine thermal expansion and optical absorption properties, suggesting alternatives to traditional aluminum substrates. The framework validates well against experimental data and demonstrates that compact laser systems with sub-nanosecond pulse durations can achieve performance competitive with existing laboratory-scale implementations despite orders-of-magnitude lower pulse energies. This enables rational design of minimal LIAD systems for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Topological reorganization of near-field energy flow governing scattering transitions in subwavelength rectangular grooves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering of electromagnetic waves by subwavelength rectangular grooves has been extensively studied, yet its physical interpretation has largely relied on field-intensity distri- butions. Here we demonstrate that the transition from concave to convex scattering profiles observed as the groove width approaches the wavelength is governed by a topological reorga- nization of the near-field energy flow. Using a rigorous modal formulation for TM-polarized fields, we analyze the complex electromagnetic field and the associated time-averaged Poynt- ing vector. We show that reducing the groove width induces the creation, migration, and annihilation of Poynting-vector singularities, including vortices and saddle points, leading to a qualitative restructuring of electromagnetic energy transport. This topological transition redirects the local energy flux and manifests as a convex scattering profile in the far field. The results establish a direct link between near-field energy topology and far-field scattering, providing a unified physical interpretation of subwavelength groove scattering.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Silicon Photonics Extreme Learning Machine with Random Non-linearities as Neural Processor and Physical Unclonable Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An alternative extreme learning machine -ELM- paradigm is presented exploiting random non-linearities -RN, named RN-ELM, instead of a conventional fixed node non-linearity. This method is implemented on a hybrid neural engine, with the physical layer realized by an integrated silicon photonic mesh and the digital layer by a simple regression algorithm. Non-linearities are intrinsically non-power depended and are generated through non-linear frequency to power mapping offered by optical filters. The numerical evaluation is based on an experimentally derived transfer function of an all-pass filter, implemented on a silicon reconfigurable photonic integrated chip -RPIC. RN-ELM is evaluated in a twofold manner; first as a machine learning scheme, where the expressivity offered by multiple, yet random, activation functions lead to a compact and highly simplified design with 5 optical filters, offering state-of-the-art performance in time-series prediction tasks with minimum hardware requirements. The second scenario entails its deployment as a physical unclonable function -PUF, for authentication applications directly in the physical layer. In this case, the random activation functions are associated with unavoidable, fabrication related waveguide imperfections that can act as hardware signatures. Numerical results reveal a probability of cloning as low as 10e-15, which corresponds to a highly secure authentication token.</description>

      <title>An epsilon-near-zero-based nonlinear platform for ultrafast re-writable holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-examine real-time holography for all-optical structuring of light and optical computation using a contemporary material: a subwavelength-thick, spatially unstructured film of indium tin oxide (ITO). When excited by spatially structured light at epsilon-near-zero frequencies, the film acts as an efficient and reconfigurable diffractive optical platform for all-optical modulation of light such as spatial structuring and optical computations. We demonstrate a few percent of absolute diffraction efficiency over greater than 300 nm bandwidth around telecom wavelengths using a film four orders of magnitude thinner than and up to six orders of magnitude faster than standard holographic materials. Our findings highlight the potential of using epsilon-near-zero-based nanostructures for efficient modulation of spatially structured light and rapid prototyping without complex nanofabrication processes.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal topological phase transitions in photonic spacetime crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phase transitions, characterized by the closing and reopening of band gaps and a concomitant change in topological invariants, have played a central role in topological physics. However, such transitions have so far been restricted to spatial crystals, relying solely on energy band gaps and spatial interfaces. Here, we transcend this conventional framework and report, for the first time, spatiotemporal topological phase transition in photonic spacetime crystals - structures that are periodically modulated in both space and time. Using a dynamically modulated transmission line metamaterial, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate complete spatiotemporal topological phase transitions characterized by the closing and reopening of both energy and momentum band gaps, alongside changes in spatiotemporal topological invariants and topological phases. Furthermore, in a genuine photonic spacetime crystal that possesses a complete energy-momentum band gap, we directly observe a space-time topological event that localizes in both space and time, exhibiting relativistic-causality-governed excitation and robustness against spatiotemporal disorders. Our findings reveal the interplay among space, time, and topology, establishing a unified framework that provides a comprehensive picture of the emerging topological space-time physics and opening new avenues for robust spatiotemporal topological wave manipulations.</description>

      <title>Octave-spanning, deterministic single soliton generation in 4H-silicon carbide-on-insulator microring resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The miniaturization of self-referencing frequency comb systems enables emerging applications in metrology and spectroscopy. One major challenge in realizing the chip-scale self-referencing function is to generate octave-spanning soliton microcombs with low operation power. Accessing soliton states is also not trivial due to the thermal effect. Though an auxiliary laser was utilized to compensate for the thermal effect, deterministic single soliton generation is still elusive, especially for broadband operation. In this work, dispersion management is performed for a 4H-silicon carbide-on-insulator (SiCOI) multi-mode microring resonator, benefiting from the submicron-confinement waveguide layout. The fundamental transverse electric (TE) mode is engineered to anomalous dispersion for two dispersive waves generation over an octave span. While a higher order TE mode is engineered to normal dispersion to accommodate the auxiliary light for thermal compensation. The normal dispersion prevents modulation-instability Kerr comb generation, allowing for a large soliton existence range. We achieve microring resonators with Q up to 5.8 million and sub-milli-watt-threshold Kerr comb generation. Combining the dispersion-managed design and high Q device, we demonstrate the deterministic generation of a single soliton comb spanning beyond an octave with a low on-chip power of 60 mW. Our demonstration paves the way to realize chip-scale, turn-key, self-referenced frequency combs.</description>

      <title>Subspace tracking: a novel measurement method to test the standard phase noise model of optical frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of digital signal processing (DSP) assisted coherent detection has been a cornerstone of modern fiber-optic communication systems. The ability to digitally, i.e. after analogue-to-digital converter, compensate for chromatic dispersion, polarization mode dispersion, and phase noise has rendered traditional analog feedback loops largely obsolete. While analog techniques remain prevalent for phase noise characterization of single-frequency lasers, the phase noise characterization of optical frequency combs presents a greater challenge. This complexity arises from different number of phase noise sources affecting an optical frequency comb. Here, we show how a phase noise measurement techniques method based on multi-heterodyne coherent detection and DSP-based subspace tracking can be used to identify, measure and quantify various phase noise sources associated with an optical frequency comb.</description>

Abstract: In an ultrafast optical-pump terahertz-probe measurement, the photoinduced material response can be modulated on a timescale shorter than the extent of the THz pulse. In this situation, the measured time-frequency response deviates from a simple time-dependent linear response. When full two-dimensional time-frequency maps are measured, this yields complex features that can be incorrectly assigned to a photoexcited coherent response. We investigate this experimentally via the measured response of photoexcited SnSe, whereby photoinduced phase change dynamics lead to ultrafast changes of the charge carrier and lattice optical conductivity response. Two-dimensional time-frequency THz transmission maps subsequently show unexpected time-frequency features at early pump-probe delay times. These features are reproduced in both finite-difference time-domain simulations of the THz experiment and in an extension of non-equilibrium response function theory, demonstrating their systematic origin. This work improves the understanding of systematic effects in high time resolution optical-pump THz-probe spectroscopy, and explores the conditions in which they are likely to appear.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Real-Time Synthesis of Acousto-Optically Generated Laser-Beam Patterns and Tweezer Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acousto-optic deflectors (AOD) enable spatiotemporal control of laser beams through diffraction at an ultrasonic grating that is controllable by radio-frequency (rf) waveforms. These devices are a widely used tool for high-bandwidth random-access scanning applications, such as optical tweezers in quantum technology. A single AOD can generate multiple optical tweezers by multitone rf input in one dimension. Two-dimensional (2D) patterns can be realized with two perpendicularly oriented AODs. As the acousto-optical response depends nonlinearly on the applied frequency components, phases, and amplitudes, and in addition experiences dimensional coupling in 2D setups, intensity regulation becomes a unique challenge. Guided by coupled-wave theory and experimental observations, we derive a compute-efficient model which we implement on a graphics processing unit. Only one-time sampling of single-tone laser-power calibration is needed for model parameter determination, allowing for straight-forward integration into optical instruments. We implement and experimentally validate an open-loop diffraction efficiency control system that enables programmable 2D multibeam trajectories with intensity control applied at every time step during digital signal generation, overcoming the limited flexibility, pattern-size constraints, and bandwidth limitations of methods using precalculation and precalibration of a predefined pattern set or closed-loop feedback. The system is capable of stable real-time waveform streaming of arrays with up to 50 x 50 tweezers with minimal time resolution of 1.4 ns (700 MS/s) and a peak latency below 257 microseconds for execution of newly requested patterns. Reactive, real-time 2D multibeam laser patterning and scanning with strict intensity matching will substantially benefit parallelization and increasing data rates in materials processing, microscopy, and optical tweezers.</description>

      <title>Topology of the near field in enhanced transmission through subwavelength apertures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze enhanced optical transmission through subwavelength aper- tures using a modal formulation for the two fundamental polarizations, transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM). Within this frame- work, the fields inside the aperture are described in terms of guided modes whose excitation and interference govern the transmission process. By ex- amining the near-field energy transport through the time-averaged Poynt- ing vector, we show that resonant transmission is accompanied by a pro- nounced reorganization of the energy flow in the vicinity of the aperture. As the wavelength is varied across resonance, the energy transport un- dergoes a topological transition characterized by vortical and saddle-type flow structures, localized backflow regions, and efficient energy funneling through the aperture. These features correlate with strong phase gradi- ents and phase singularities associated with the excited modal fields. The modal approach provides a unified and physically transparent interpre- tation of enhanced transmission in both slits and channels, applicable to perfect conductors and beyond plasmonic regimes.</description>

      <title>Experimental Measurement of Enhanced Group Delay Silicon Photonic Waveguides Indicative of the Frozen Mode Regime Around the Stationary Inflection Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersion engineering of periodic silicon photonic waveguides presents opportunities for significant group delay enhancement compared to uniform waveguides of comparable length. We describe the spectral response characteristics for measured devices and compare their properties to modeled data. These waveguides support the frozen mode regime (FMR) around near infrared wavelengths and are expected to show enhanced group delays around the FMR resonances. Measurements of fabricated devices provide evidence for enhanced delays and spectral properties associated with the FMR. We study how perturbations to the waveguide model impact agreement with measurements and its meaning for these devices operating in the FMR.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical Kerr effect in pump-probe setups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theoretical framework for computing the time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect in ultrafast pump-probe setups, formulated within the Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA) and its application to the generalized linear-response theory for pumped systems. Furthermore, we exploit this formalism to express the post-pump optical conductivity and consequently the Kerr rotation in terms of the time-evolved single-particle density matrix (SPDM), providing a transparent and computationally efficient description of photo-excited multi-band systems. This extension, in addition to its lower computational cost, has the advantage of allowing the inclusion of phenomenological damping. We illustrate the formalism using both (i) a two-band tight-binding model, which captures the essential physics of ultrafast spin-charge dynamics and the Kerr rotation, and (ii) weakly spin-polarized germanium, as a realistic playground with a complex band structure. The results demonstrate that, by exploiting DPOA and/or its SPDM extension, one can reliably reproduce both the short-time features under the pump-pulse envelope and the long-time dynamics after excitation, offering a versatile framework for analyzing time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect experiments in complex materials. Moreover, this analysis clearly shows that the Kerr rotation can be used to deduce experimentally the relevant n-photon resonances for a given specific material.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger tracking of coherence loss during bond breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled electronic and nuclear motions govern chemical reactions, yet disentangling their interplay during bond rupture remains challenging. Here we follow the light-induced fragmentation of Br$_2$ using a coincidence-based multi-messenger approach. A UV pulse prepares the dissociative state, and strong-field ionization probes the evolving system. Coincident measurement of three-dimensional photoion and photoelectron momenta provides real-time access to both the instantaneous internuclear separation and the accompanying reorganization of the electronic structure, allowing us to determine the timescale of bond breaking. We find that electronic rearrangement concludes well before the nuclei reach the bond-breaking distance, revealing a hierarchy imposed by electron-nuclear coupling. Supported by semiclassical modelling, the results show that the stretched Br$_2$ molecule behaves as a two-centre interferometer in which the loss of coherence between atomic centres encodes the coupled evolution of electrons and nuclei. Our work establishes a general framework for imaging ultrafast electron-nuclear dynamics in molecules.</description>

      <title>Near-Infrared Quantum Emission from Oxygen-Related Defects in hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color centers hosted in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as a promising platform for single-photon emission and coherent spin-photon interfaces that underpin quantum communication and quantum networking technologies. As a wide-bandgap van der Waals material, hBN can host individual optically active quantum defects emitting across the ultraviolet to visible spectrum, but existing color centers often show broad phonon sidebands (PSBs), unstable emission, or inconvenient wavelengths. Here, we show a simple, scalable oxygen-plasma process that reproducibly creates oxygen-related single quantum emitters in hBN with blinking-free zero-phonon lines spanning the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum from 700-960 nanometers. These emitters demonstrate room-temperature operation, high brightness, and ultra-sharp cryogenic linewidths in the few-gigahertz range under non-resonant excitation. Analysis of the PSBs shows weak electron-phonon coupling and predominant zero-phonon-line emission, while first-principles calculations identify plausible oxygen-related defect configurations. These emitters provide a promising platform for indistinguishable NIR single photons towards free-space quantum networking.</description>

      <title>Pixel Super-Resolved Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a powerful quantitative technique that provides metabolic and molecular contrast, offering strong translational potential for label-free, real-time diagnostics. However, its clinical adoption remains limited by long pixel dwell times and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which impose a stricter resolution-speed trade-off than conventional optical imaging approaches. Here, we introduce FLIM_PSR_k, a deep learning-based multi-channel pixel super-resolution (PSR) framework that reconstructs high-resolution FLIM images from data acquired with up to a 5-fold increased pixel size. The model is trained using the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework, which, compared to diffusion model-based alternatives, delivers a more robust PSR reconstruction with substantially shorter inference times, a crucial advantage for practical deployment. FLIM_PSR_k not only enables faster image acquisition but can also alleviate SNR limitations in autofluorescence-based FLIM. Blind testing on held-out patient-derived tumor tissue samples demonstrates that FLIM_PSR_k reliably achieves a super-resolution factor of k = 5, resulting in a 25-fold increase in the space-bandwidth product of the output images and revealing fine architectural features lost in lower-resolution inputs, with statistically significant improvements across various image quality metrics. By increasing FLIM's effective spatial resolution, FLIM_PSR_k advances lifetime imaging toward faster, higher-resolution, and hardware-flexible implementations compatible with low-numerical-aperture and miniaturized platforms, better positioning FLIM for translational applications.</description>

      <title>Feedback Cooling and Thermometry of a Single Trapped Ion Using a Knife Edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the first feedback cooling of a single trapped ion below the Doppler limit of $\hbar\Gamma/2 k_\mathrm{B}$. The motion of a single ion is monitored in real-time and cooled up to 9-times below the Doppler cooling temperature by applying electronic feedback. Real-time motion detection is implemented by imaging the fluorescence photons emitted by the ion onto a knife edge and detecting the transmitted light, a method used so far to cool trapped nanoparticles. The intensity modulation of the fluorescence resulting from the ion motion is used to generate and apply the feedback signal and also to determine the ion temperature. The method benefits from a high rate of detected scattered photons, which can be a challenge, and which we address by using a parabolic mirror for collecting the fluorescence.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous velocity during quantum tunnelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum tunnelling, a hallmark phenomenon of quantum mechanics, allows particles to pass through the classically forbidden region. It underpins fundamental processes ranging from nuclear fusion and photosynthesis to the operation of superconducting qubits. Yet the underlying dynamics of particle motion during tunnelling remain subtle and are still the subject of active debate. Here, by analyzing the temporal evolution of the tunnelling process, we show that the particle velocity inside the barrier continuously relaxes from a large initial value toward a smaller one, and may even approach zero in the evanescent regime. Meanwhile, the probability density within the barrier gradually builds up before reaching its stationary profile, in contrast to existing inherently. In addition, starting from the steady-state equations, we derive an explicit relation between the particle velocity and the barrier width, and show that the velocity in evanescent states approaches zero when the barrier is sufficiently wide. These findings resolve the apparent paradox of a vanishing steady-state velocity coexisting with a finite particle density. We point out that defining an effective speed from the probability density, rather than from the probability current, can lead to spuriously nonzero "stationary speed," as appears to be the case in Ref. [Nature 643, 67 (2025)]. Our work establishes a clear dynamical picture for the formation of tunnelling flow and provides a theoretical foundation for testing time-resolved tunnelling phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The guided modes supported by dielectric channel waveguides act as individual carriers of momentum. We show this by proving that the modes satisfy an orthogonality condition which relates to the momentum of the optical electromagnetic field, with a link to the more familiar power (energy) orthogonality. This result forms the basis for a rigorous, self-consistent procedure for the quantization of broadband guided electromagnetic fields in the typical channels used in integrated photonic circuits. Our work removes the existing theoretical gap between the classical solution of the Maxwell equations for guided fields and the intuitive understanding of photons in waveguides. The presented approach is valid for straight, lossless, and potentially anisotropic, dielectric waveguides of general shape, in the linear regime, and including material dispersion. Examples for the hybrid modes of a thin film lithium niobate strip waveguide are briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopy of muonic atoms is, to date, the most accurate technique to extract parameters of the nuclear charge density. The same reasons for their heightened sensitivity to nuclear parameters, a large overlap of the muonic wavefunction with the nucleus, makes them attractive systems to test Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) Physics. This raises concerns of self-consistency as the same data are used to, first, extract nuclear parameters, and second, check the consistency with BSM models. We combine the two steps and self-consistently extract the nuclear and BSM parameters. We show that the data are consistent with vanishing BSM coupling and extract robust exclusion bounds. We further note that the nuclear parameters change under the influence of those BSM couplings on the parameter fits and compare with the fit solely based on quantum electrodynamics (QED).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wigner crystals, lattices made purely of electrons, are a quintessential paradigm of studying correlation-driven quantum phase transitions. Despite decades of research, the internal dynamics of Wigner crystals has remained extremely challenging to access, with most experiments probing only static order or collective motion. Here, we establish monolayer WSe2 as a new materials platform to host zero-field Wigner crystals and then demonstrate that exciton spectroscopy provides a direct means to probe both static and dynamic properties of these electron lattices. We uncover striking optical resonances that we identify as Wigner polarons, quasiparticles formed when the electron lattice is locally distorted by exciton-Wigner crystal coupling. We further achieve all-optical control of spins in the Wigner crystal, directly probing valley-dependent Wigner polaron scattering well above the magnetic ordering temperature and in the absence of any external magnetic field. Finally, we demonstrate optical melting of the Wigner crystal and observe intriguingly different responses of the umklapp (static) and Wigner polaron (dynamic) resonances to optical excitation. Our results open up exciting new avenues for elucidating electron dynamics and achieving ultrafast optical control of interaction-driven quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how different reservoir memory profiles influence the dynamical evolution of a single waveguide coupled to an external environment. We compare three representative memory kernels: Lorentzian, Gaussian and Uniform, highlighting their distinct spatial correlations and their impact on system behavior. We compute the transmission amplitude, transparency properties, as well as long-time behavior of the system under each memory model. To quantify deviations from Markovian dynamics, we employ a non-Markovianity measure based on information backflow, allowing a direct comparison between the structured reservoirs and the Markovian limit. Our results reveal clear signatures of memoryless-induced modifications in the transmission spectrum and demonstrate how specific reservoir profiles enhance or suppress non-Markovian effects.</description>

Abstract: Topological textures in magnetically ordered materials are important case studies for fundamental research with promising applications in data science. They can also serve as photonic elements to mold electromagnetic fields endowing them with features inherent to the spin order, as demonstrated analytically and numerically in this work. A self-consistent theory is developed for the interaction of spatially structured electromagnetic fields with non-collinear, topologically non-trivial spin textures. A tractable numerical method is designed and implemented for the calculation of the formed magnetic/photonic textures in the entire simulation space. Numerical illustrations are presented for scattering from point-like singularities, i.e. Bloch points, in the magnetization vector fields, evidencing that the geometry and topology of the magnetic order results in photonic fields that embody orbital angular momentum, chirality as well as magnetoelectric densities. Features of the scattered fields can serve as a fingerprint for the underlying magnetic texture and its dynamics. The findings point to the potential of topological magnetic textures as a route to molding photonic fields.</description>

      <title>Rapid general Electromagnetic Analysis with computational conformal geometry via Conformal Energy Minimization</title>

Abstract: We recently found that the electromagnetic scattering problem can be very fast in an approach expressing the fields in terms of orthonormal basis functions. In this paper we apply computational conformal geometry with the conformal energy minimization (CEM) algorithm to make possible fast solution of finite-frequency electromagnetic problems involving arbitrarily shaped, simply-connected metallic surfaces. The CEM algorithm computes conformal maps with minimal angular distortion, enabling the transformation of arbitrary simply-connected surfaces into a disk, where orthogonal basis functions can be defined and electromagnetic analysis can be significantly simplified. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method by investigating the resonance characteristics of two metallic surfaces: a square plate and a four-petal plate. Compared to traditional finite element methods (e.g., COMSOL), our approach achieves a three-order-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency, requiring only seconds to extract resonant frequencies and fields. Moreover, it reveals low-energy, doubly degenerate resonance modes that are elusive to conventional methods. These findings not only provide a powerful tool for analyzing electromagnetic fields on complex geometries but also pave the way for the design of high-performance electromagnetic devices.</description>

      <title>Coherent phonon control beyond amplitude saturation in a sliding ferroelectric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The breakdown of Hooke's law marks the onset of nonlinear behaviour: when displacements become large, restoring forces weaken and conventional proportionality fails. In quantum materials, intense optical excitation can drive the crystal lattice into a similar regime, where established linear relations between light, electrons, and phonons no longer hold. Sliding ferroelectrics are particularly susceptible, as controlling their polarization requires large interlayer shifts. Displacive excitation of coherent phonons, the principal mechanism for launching structural motion, typically assumes that lattice-driving forces scale linearly with the photo-excited carrier density. Whether this linearity survives at high excitation, however, remains largely unexplored, and its breakdown can fundamentally limit accessible lattice displacements. Here we show that such nonlinear limitations can be surpassed in a sliding ferroelectric by timing, rather than strengthening the optical drive. Time-resolved second-harmonic generation reveals that the interlayer sliding phonon governing ferroelectricity saturates and even diminishes under single-pulse excitation. First-principles calculations attribute this nonlinearity to band-specific electron-phonon coupling that induces competing forces on the lattice. By splitting the optical energy into two well-timed pulses that avoid populating counteracting states, we achieve markedly larger phonon amplitudes at fixed total fluence. The resulting enhanced sliding motion exposes a regime of anharmonic phonon coupling that emerges only far from equilibrium. Our findings show that nonlinear limits in driven solids can be overcome, opening new pathways for steering lattice motion in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Scalable low-latency entanglement distribution for distributed quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Practical distributed quantum computing and error correction require quantum networks with high-qubit-rate, high-fidelity, and low-reconfiguration-latency. Unfortunately, current approaches are limited by fundamental constraints: single-channel entanglement rates remain at the MHz level with millisecond-level reconfiguration, which is insufficient for fault-tolerant distributed quantum computing. Here, we propose a quantum network architecture that leverages reconfigurable quantum interfaces and wavelength-selective switches to overcome bandwidth and latency constraints. By tuning the frequency and temporal modes of photonic qubits across dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) channels, our protocol achieves an entanglement generation rate of up to 183.4 MHz based on our comprehensive modeling of the networked cold atom computing systems. Our architecture enables nanosecond-scale network reconfiguration with low loss, low infidelity, and high dimensionality. Our modeling and simulation are designed for deployable distributed quantum computing and error correction, integrating the quantum interface, network switching, circuit compilation, and execution into a unified framework. The proposed architecture is fully compatible with industry-standard DWDM infrastructure, providing a scalable and cost-effective foundation for distributed quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Electrical generation of surface plasmon polaritons in plasmonic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) can be understood as two-dimensional light confined to a conductor-dielectric interface via plasmonic excitations. While low-energy SPPs behave similarly to photons, higher-frequency SPPs resemble surface plasmons. Electrically generating mid-range SPPs is particularly challenging because it requires compensating for momentum mismatch, a process conventionally achieved through inelastic electron transport in nanostructures. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that electrical SPP generation is possible by directly coupling electron-hole dipoles to the quantized SPP field across an insulating spacer without accompanying electron transport. This approach can be realized in plasmonic van der Waals heterostructures composed of strongly-biased monolayer graphene as the emitter, few-layer hexagonal boron nitride as the spacer, and silver (or gold) as the plasmonic material. In this configuration, graphene's remarkable ability to support a strongly non-equilibrium steady-state electron-hole population results in non-thermal, bias-tunable SPP emission that is uniform along the hBN/Ag interface, achieving a power conversion efficiency of up to 1% and a Purcell factor of up to 100. These findings pave the way for integrating photonic and electronic functionalities within a single two-dimensional heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Intensified optical camera with Timepix4 readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14649v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first characterization results of an optical time-stamping camera based on the Timepix4 chip coupled to a fully depleted optical silicon sensor and fast image intensifier, enabling sub-nanosecond scale, time-resolved imaging for single photons. The system achieves an RMS time resolution of 0.3 ns in direct detection mode without the intensifier and from 0.6 to 1.5 ns in the single-photon regime with an intensifier for different amplitude-based signal selections. This shows that Timepix4 provides a significant improvement over previous Timepix3-based cameras in terms of timing precision, and also in pixel count and data throughput. We analyze key factors that affect performance, including sensor bias and timewalk effect, and demonstrate effective correction methods to recover high temporal accuracy. The camera's temporal resolution, event-driven readout and high rate capability make it a scalable platform for a wide range of applications, including quantum optics, ultrafast imaging, and time-correlated photon counting experiments.</description>
