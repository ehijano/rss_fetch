      <title>The Fragility of Global Comparisons of Perceived Scientist Trustworthiness: Evidence from Measurement Alignment across 68 Countries/Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cologna et al. (2025) compared perceived scientist trustworthiness across 68 countries/regions and examined its associations with individual- and country-level factors. While the authors reported that the scale did not satisfy metric and scalar measurement invariance, their subsequent cross-national/regional comparisons and regressions were nonetheless conducted using weighted means of observed item scores, implicitly assuming cross-country/region comparability at the observed-score level. Using the publicly shared dataset, we re-evaluated these conclusions by systematically applying measurement alignment under four analytical paths: pooled-sample versus country/region-specific confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), each estimated with and without weights. Across all specifications, cross-national/regional CFA supported configural and metric invariance but failed to establish scalar or strict invariance. Importantly, under the analytical path most closely corresponding to the original study (pooled CFA with weights), only the competence and openness factors yielded admissible aligned solutions within the four-factor model. Using aligned latent scores for these two dimensions, country/region rankings changed for 62 of the 68 countries/regions. Substantive conclusions also differed: associations between perceived scientist trustworthiness and science-related populist attitudes or social dominance orientation were near zero or non-robust, whereas attitudes toward science remained strongly and positively related. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that cross-national/regional comparisons based on observed-score averages may be misleading when measurement equivalence is not established, and that latent-variable approaches such as alignment provide a more defensible basis for international inference.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous expressed-private $q$-voter model on networks: self-anticonformity and preference falsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People may express preferences that differ from their privately held views, often under social pressure, and may fail to act on their stated intentions. Such inconsistencies are referred to as preference falsification and the intention-behavior gap, respectively. Both hamper collective decision-making and adaptation, complicating policy formulation and implementation. To simulate these phenomena, dual-layer opinion agent-based models are used, in which each agent holds both a private and an expressed (public) opinion. Within the $q$-voter framework, two expressed-private opinion (EPO) models have been introduced in which private and expressed opinions are updated synchronously; two variants differ only by the presence of self-anticonformity, a mechanism in which an agent may set its private opinion opposite to its current expressed opinion, breaking internal harmony and creating a state akin to cognitive dissonance. Here, we extend these models by introducing an asynchronous update: in each elementary step, an agent updates its private opinion with probability $\alpha$ or its expressed opinion with complementary probability; hence the name $\alpha$-EPO models. Using Monte Carlo simulations on both artificial and real organizational social networks, along with mean-field and pair approximation analyses, we show that self-anticonformity makes collective outcomes robust to behavioral volatility tuned by $\alpha$, enhances collective agreement, and suppresses hysteresis. In contrast, without self-anticonformity, $\alpha$ affects the nature of the transition between agreement and disagreement: higher values of $\alpha$ suppress hysteresis and enhance overall agreement.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium phase transitions in a racism-spreading model with interaction-driven dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Racism remains a persistent societal issue, increasingly amplified by the structure and dynamics of online social networks. In this work, we propose a three-state compartmental model to study the spreading and suppression of racist content, drawing from epidemic-like dynamics and interaction-driven transitions. We analyze the model on fully-connected (homogeneous mixing) networks using a set of coupled differential equations, and on Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) scale-free and Watts-Strogatz (WS) small-world networks through agent-based simulations. The system exhibits three distinct stationary regimes: two racism-free absorbing states and one active phase with persistent racist content. We identify and characterize the phase transitions between these regimes, discuss the role of network topology, and highlight the emergence of absorbing states. Our findings illustrate how statistical physics tools can help uncover the macroscopic consequences of microscopic social interactions in digital environments.</description>

      <title>Abundance and Economic diversity as a descriptor of cities' economic complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intricate interactions among firms, institutions, and spatial structures shape urban economic systems. In this study, we propose a framework based on three structural dimensions -- abundance, diversity, and longevity (ADL) of economic units -- as proxies of urban economic complexity and resilience. Using a decade of georeferenced firm-level data from Mexico City, we analyze the relationships among ADL variables using regression, spatial correlation, and time-series clustering. Our results reveal nonlinear dynamics across urban space, with powerlaw behavior in central zones and logarithmic saturation in peripheral areas, suggesting differentiated growth regimes. Notably, firm longevity modulates the relationship between abundance and diversity, particularly in periurban transition zones. These spatial patterns point to an emerging polycentric restructuring within a traditionally monocentric metropolis. By integrating economic complexity theory with spatial analysis, our approach provides a scalable method to assess the adaptive capacity of urban economies. This has implications for understanding informality, designing inclusive urban policies, and navigating structural transitions in rapidly urbanizing regions.</description>

      <title>Modeling Two-Scale Rank Distributions via Redistribution Dynamics or an Analytic Derivation of the Beta Rank Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beta Rank Function (BRF) is a two-sided distribution characterized by a smooth peak and double powerlaw decay, widely used to model empirical data exhibiting deviations from pure power laws. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-step generative process that produces data exactly following the BRF distribution. The first step involves any mechanism generating a power-law distribution, while the second step applies a regressive redistribution process that reallocates resources from poorer to richer entities, thereby amplifying inequality. This approach represents the first analytic derivation of an exact BRF distribution from a generative mechanism. We validate the model through applications to income and urban population distributions. Beyond exact generation, this framework offers new insights into the systemic origins of deviations from power laws frequently observed in complex systems, linking rank distributions to underlying feedback and redistribution dynamics.</description>

      <title>Directional Liquidity and Geometric Shear in Pregeometric Order Books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a structural framework for the geometry of financial order books in which liquidity, supply, and demand are treated as emergent observables rather than primitive market variables. The market is modeled as a relational substrate without assumed metric, temporal, or price coordinates. Observable quantities arise only through observation, implemented here as a reduction of relational degrees of freedom followed by a low-dimensional spectral projection. A one-dimensional projection induces a price-like coordinate and a projected liquidity density around the mid price, from which bid and ask sides emerge as two complementary restrictions. We show that directional liquidity imbalances decompose naturally into a rigid drift of the projected density and a geometric shear mode that deforms the bid--ask structure without inducing price motion. Under a minimal single-scale hypothesis, the shear geometry constrains the projected liquidity to a gamma-like functional form, appearing as an integrated-gamma profile in discrete data. Empirical analysis of high-frequency Level~II data across multiple U.S. equities confirms this geometry and shows that it outperforms standard alternative cumulative models under explicit model comparison and residual diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Friendship Paradoxes in Network Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized friendship paradoxes occur when, on average, our friends have more of some attribute than us. These paradoxes are relevant to many aspects of human interaction, notably in social science and epidemiology. Here, we derive new theoretical results concerning the inevitability of a paradox arising, using a linear algebra perspective. Following the seminal 1991 work of Scott L. Feld, we consider two distinct ways to measure and compare averages, which may be regarded as global and local. For global averaging, we show that a generalized friendship paradox holds for a large family of walk-based centralities, including Katz centrality and total subgraph communicability, and also for nonbacktracking eigenvector centrality. However, we also find counterexamples for centralities based on walks of even length. For local averaging we establish a paradox for nonbacktracking eigenvector centrality and we characterize the cases where the paradox holds with equality for the walk-based case. Defining loneliness as the reciprocal of the number of friends, we show that for this attribute the generalized and local friendship paradoxes always hold in reverse. In this sense, we are always more lonely, on average, than our friends. We also derive global and local averaging paradoxes for the case where the arithmetic mean is replaced by the geometric mean. As well as unifying and adding to the literature in this area, we highlight some open questions.</description>
