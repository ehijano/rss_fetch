      <title>From Glosten-Milgrom to the whole limit order book and applications to financial regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10743</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.10743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build an agent-based model for the order book with three types of market participants: informed trader, noise trader and competitive market makers. Using a Glosten-Milgrom like approach, we are able to deduce the whole limit order book (bid-ask spread and volume available at each price) from the interactions between the different agents. More precisely, we obtain a link between efficient price dynamic, proportion of trades due to the noise trader, traded volume, bid-ask spread and equilibrium limit order book state. With this model, we provide a relevant tool for regulators and market platforms. We show for example that it allows us to forecast consequences of a tick size change on the microstructure of an asset. It also enables us to value quantitatively the queue position of a limit order in the book.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Curves for Optimally Efficient Market Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are essential in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) as they match liquidity supply with demand. They function through liquidity providers (LPs) who deposit assets into liquidity pools. However, the asset trading prices in these pools often trail behind those in more dynamic, centralized exchanges, leading to potential arbitrage losses for LPs. This issue is tackled by adapting market maker bonding curves to trader behavior, based on the classical market microstructure model of Glosten and Milgrom. Our approach ensures a zero-profit condition for the market maker's prices. We derive the differential equation that an optimal adaptive curve should follow to minimize arbitrage losses while remaining competitive. Solutions to this optimality equation are obtained for standard Gaussian and Lognormal price models using Kalman filtering. A key feature of our method is its ability to estimate the external market price without relying on price or loss oracles. We also provide an equivalent differential equation for the implied dynamics of canonical static bonding curves and establish conditions for their optimality. Our algorithms demonstrate robustness to changing market conditions and adversarial perturbations, and we offer an on-chain implementation using Uniswap v4 alongside off-chain AI co-processors.</description>

      <title>Liquidity Jump, Liquidity Diffusion, and Crypto Wash Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new framework to detect wash trading in crypto assets through real-time liquidity fluctuation. We propose that short-term price jumps in crypto assets results from wash trading-induced liquidity fluctuation, and construct two complementary liquidity measures, liquidity jump (size of fluctuation) and liquidity diffusion (volatility of fluctuation), to capture the behavioral signature of wash trading. Using US stocks as a benchmark, we demonstrate that joint elevation in both liquidity metrics indicates wash trading in crypto assets. A simulated regulatory treatment that removes likely wash trades confirms this dynamic: it reduces liquidity diffusion significantly while leaving liquidity jump largely unaffected. These findings align with a theoretical model in which manipulative traders amplify both the level and variance of price pressure, whereas passive investors affect only the level. Our model offers practical tools for investors to assess market quality and for regulators to monitor manipulation risk on crypto exchanges without oversight.</description>
