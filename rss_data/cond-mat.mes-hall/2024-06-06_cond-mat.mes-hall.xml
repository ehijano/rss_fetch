      <title>Sublattice polarization from destructive interference on common lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that sublattice-polarized states (SLPSs) appear ubiquitously on the common lattices. We first establish the destructive-interference scenario for the SLPSs, which is further systematized by a point-group-symmetry interpretation. The examples on common one-, two-, and three-dimensional lattices are then demonstrated. We also deduce the symmetry-protected robustness of SLPSs against further-neighbor hoppings. Moreover, the destructive-interference scenario can be generalized to the multi-SLP. The important effects on interaction-driven phases are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>The persistence of spin coherence in a crystalline environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze quantum interference in the triplet-exciton pair generated by singlet exciton fission in a molecular crystal, and introduce transport-induced dephasing (TID) as a key effect that can suppress the expected fluorescence quantum beats when the triplet-exciton wavefunction can localize on inequivalent sites. TID depends on the triplet-exciton hopping rate between inequivalent sites and on the energy-shifts among the stationary states of the entangled triplet pair in different spatial configurations. The theoretical model is confirmed by experiments in rubrene single crystals, where triplet pairs remain entangled for more than 50 ns but quantum beats are suppressed by TID within a few nanoseconds when the magnetic field is misaligned by just a few degrees from specific symmetric directions. Our experiments deliver the zero-field parameters for the rubrene molecule in its orthorhombic lattice and information on triplet-exciton transport, in particular the triplet-exciton hopping rate between inequivalent sites, which we evaluate to be of the order of 150 ps in rubrene.</description>

      <title>Nature of long-lived moir\'e interlayer excitons in electrically tunable MoS$_{2}$/MoSe$_{2}$ heterobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interlayer excitons in transition-metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers combine high binding energy and valley-contrasting physics with long optical lifetime and strong dipolar character. Their permanent electric dipole enables electric-field control of emission energy, lifetime, and location. Device material and geometry impacts the nature of the interlayer excitons via their real- and momentum-space configurations. Here, we show that interlayer excitons in MoS$_{2}$/MoSe$_{2}$ heterobilayers are formed by charge carriers residing at the Brillouin zone edges, with negligible interlayer hybridization. We find that the moir\'e superlattice leads to the reversal of the valley-dependent optical selection rules, yielding a positively valued g-factor and cross-polarized photoluminescence. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal that the interlayer exciton population retains the optically induced valley polarization throughout its microsecond-long lifetime. The combination of long optical lifetime and valley polarization retention makes MoS$_{2}$/MoSe$_{2}$ heterobilayers a promising platform for studying fundamental bosonic interactions and developing excitonic circuits for optical information processing.</description>

      <title>Electrical control of intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect in antiferromagnetic topological insulator sandwiches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear Hall effect (NHE) can originate from the quantum metric mechanism in antiferromagnetic topological materials with PT symmetry, which has been experimentally observed in MnBi2Te4. In this work, we propose that breaking PT symmetry via external electric fields can lead to a dramatic enhancement of NHE, thus allowing for an electric control of NHE. Microscopically, this is because breaking PT symmetry can lift spin degeneracy of a Kramers' pair, giving rise to additional contributions within one Kramers' pair of bands. We demonstrate this enhancement through a model Hamiltonian that describes an antiferromagnetic topological insulator sandwich structure.</description>

      <title>Versatile polymer method to dry-flip two-dimensional moir\'e hetero structures for nanoscale surface characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), in which two sheets of monolayer graphene are precisely stacked to a specific angle, has opened up a plethora of new opportunities in the field of topology, superconductivity, and other strongly correlated effects. Most conventional ways of preparing twisted bilayer devices require the use of high process temperatures and solvents and are not well-suited for preparing samples which need to be flipped to be compatible with characterization techniques like STM, ARPES, PFM, SThM etc. Here, we demonstrate a very simple polymer-based method using Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), which can be used for making flipped twisted bilayer graphene devices. This allowed us to produce flipped twisted samples without the need of any solvents and with high quality as confirmed by Piezoresponse Force Microscopy. We believe that this dry flip technique can be readily extended to twist 2D materials beyond graphene, especially air-sensitive materials which require operation under inert atmosphere, where often solvents cannot be used.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature tunable tunneling magnetoresistance in Fe3GaTe2/WSe2/Fe3GaTe2 van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exceptional properties of two-dimensional (2D) magnet materials present a novel approach to fabricate functional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) by constructing full van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with atomically sharp and clean interfaces. The exploration of vdW MTJ devices with high working temperature and adjustable functionalities holds great potential for advancing the application of 2D materials in magnetic sensing and data storage. Here, we report the observation of highly tunable room-temperature tunneling magnetoresistance through electronic means in a full vdW Fe3GaTe2/WSe2/Fe3GaTe2 MTJ. The spin valve effect of the MTJ can be detected even with the current below 1 nA, both at low and room temperatures, yielding a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) of 340% at 2 K and 50% at 300 K, respectively. Importantly, the magnitude and sign of TMR can be modulated by a DC bias current, even at room temperature, a capability that was previously unrealized in full vdW MTJs. This tunable TMR arises from the contribution of energy-dependent localized spin states in the metallic ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 during tunnel transport when a finite electrical bias is applied. Our work offers a new perspective for designing and exploring room-temperature tunable spintronic devices based on vdW magnet heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of spin Nernst effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the microscopic theory of the spin Nernst effect, which is a transverse spin current directly induced by a temperature gradient, employing the linear response theory with Luttinger's gravitational potential method. We consider a generic, non-interacting electron system with randomly distributed impurities and evaluate the spin current response to the gravitational potential. Our theory takes into account a contribution of the local equilibrium current modified by Luttinger's gravitational potential and is thus consistent with the thermodynamic principle that thermal responses should vanish. The Ward-Takahashi identities ensure that the spin Nernst current is well-behaved at low temperatures in any order of the random impurity potentials. Furthermore, we microscopically derive the spin-current version of Mott's formula, which associates the spin Nernst coefficient with the spin Hall conductivity. The spin-current version of the St\v{r}eda formula is also discussed. To demonstrate these findings, the spin Nernst current of three-dimensional Dirac electrons is computed. Our theory is general and can therefore be extended to interacting electron systems, where Mott's formula no longer holds.</description>

      <title>Light-induced large and tunable valley-selective Hall effect in a centrosymmetric system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that a large and tunable valley-selective Hall effect can be realized in a centrosymmetric system via light-induced breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries. This is demonstrated in graphene driven by bicircularly polarized light, which consists of a linear combination of left- and right-handed circularly polarized light with different frequencies. We also show that our Hall conductivity is two orders of magnitude larger than the maximum value obtained in noncentrosymmetric systems, and that the main valley can be switched by tuning a phase difference between the left- and right-handed circularly polarized light. Our results will enable us to generate and control the valley-selective Hall effect in centrosymmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Shaping the topology of twisted bilayer graphene via time-reversal symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking is an effective tool for tuning the transport and topological properties of 2D layered materials. Among these materials, twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has emerged as a promising platform for new physics, characterized by a rich interplay between topological features and strongly correlated electronic behavior. In this study, we utilize time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) to manipulate the topological properties of TBG. By varying the strength of TRSB, we discover a topological phase transition between a topological insulating phase, which exhibits a pair of flat bands with opposite Chern numbers, and a novel insulating state where the Chern number, but not the Berry curvature, of the flat bands vanishes. We demonstrate that this topological transition is mediated by a gap closing at the $\Gamma$ point, and we construct a three-dimensional phase diagram as a function of the twisting angle, the symmetry-breaking parameter, and the mismatch coupling between AA and AB stacking regions. Finally, we show that this novel electronic phase can be identified in the lab by measuring, as a function of the Fermi energy, its non-quantized anomalous Hall conductivity that is induced by the Berry dipole density of the lowest flat bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In transmission electron energy-loss spectroscopy, the cross section in 2D is quenched by kinematic effects once the momentum transfer becomes smaller than a critical value set by $q_z$, the momentum loss parallel to the beam. Our highly momentum ($\Delta q = 0.02$~\r{A}$^{-1}$) and energy ($\Delta E = 45$~meV) resolved setup is instrumental on delivering the unprecedented experimental verification of quenched 2D EEL spectra on freestanding graphene at momentum transfers $q$ below $0.06$\r{A}$^{-1}$. We retrieve the intrinsic uniform dielectric response of graphene from measured spectra by quantifying the kinematic suppression.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity in spin dynamics of frustrated Kagom\'e lattice system under harmonic perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the spin dynamics of a frustrated Kagom\'e lattice system, focusing on the nonlinearity of spin oscillations induced by a harmonic magnetic field under varying strengths of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), exchange field, and anisotropy energy. We have utilized Poincar\'e Surface Sections (PSS) and Power Spectra (PS) for different DMI and anisotropy energy to study the spin dynamics. Our findings reveal that when the DMI strength, external field, anisotropy, and applied magnetic field are weak, the oscillations are quasi-periodic, mostly dominated by the exchange field. With the increase in the DMI strength, the oscillation of the system becomes highly aperiodic. Strong anisotropy tends to induce periodic oscillations, but increasing DMI eventually leads to chaotic behaviour. Additionally, the external magnetic field destabilizes the periodicity of oscillations in systems with weak easy-axis anisotropy, but the systems with strong anisotropy, the oscillations remain unaffected by the external field's strength. Our analysis of magnon dispersion and magnetic resonance (MR) spectra reveals multiple resonance peaks at higher DMI strengths, indicating a complex interplay between spin wave excitation and system parameters. These results underscore the importance of understanding the inherent DMI and anisotropy in the Kagom\'e lattice during fabrication for various applications. Moreover, our comprehensive analysis of spin dynamics in a Kagom\'e lattice system demonstrates a clear transition from quasi-periodic to chaotic oscillations with the increase in DMI strength.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency microwave photodetection by cavity coupled double dots with single cavity-photon sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a superconducting cavity-coupled double quantum dot (DQD) photodiode that achieves a maximum photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of 25% in the microwave domain. With a higher-quality-factor cavity and improved device design to prevent photon leakages through unwanted pathways, our device measures microwave signals down to 100 aW power level and achieves sensitivity to probe microwave signals with one photon at a time in the cavity. We analyze the photodiode operation using Jaynes-Cummings input-output theory, identifying the key improvements of stronger cavity-DQD coupling needed to achieve near-unity photodetection efficiency. The results presented in this work represent a crucial advancement toward near unity microwave photodetection efficiency with single cavity-photon sensitivity for studies of photon statistics in the microwave range and applications related to quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we bring up our investigation on the properties of asymmetric scattering in graphene made with the microcavity exciton-polaritons. It is shown by numerical simulations of Gross-Pitaevskii equation that ratchet phenomena occurs in the polariton graphene due to its structural inhomogeneity. Thus, we suggest a way to induce preferential motion of polaritons by the confinement potential engineering.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in twisted bilayer and twisted trilayer graphene has generated tremendous interest. The key feature of these systems is an interplay between interlayer coupling and a moir\'e superlattice that gives rise to low-energy flat bands with strong correlations. Flat bands can also be induced by moir\'e patterns in lattice-mismatched and or twisted heterostructures of other two-dimensional materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Although a wide range of correlated phenomenon have indeed been observed in the moir\'e TMDs, robust demonstration of superconductivity has remained absent. Here we report superconductivity in 5 degree twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ (tWSe$_2$) with a maximum critical temperature of 426 mK. The superconducting state appears in a limited region of displacement field and density that is adjacent to a metallic state with Fermi surface reconstruction believed to arise from antiferromagnetic order. A sharp boundary is observed between the superconducting and magnetic phases at low temperature, reminiscent of spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity. Our results establish that moir\'e flat-band superconductivity extends beyond graphene structures. Material properties that are absent in graphene but intrinsic among the TMDs such as a native band gap, large spin-orbit coupling, spin-valley locking, and magnetism offer the possibility to access a broader superconducting parameter space than graphene-only structures.</description>

      <title>Even Integer Quantum Hall Effect in Materials with Hidden Spin Texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is invisible in the band structure when inversion symmetry exists, whether spins are trivially degenerate or strongly coupled to momentum due to SOC is presumed to make little difference in transport measurements, such as magnetoresistance and quantum oscillations. In this work, however, we show that hidden Rashba SOC in a centrosymmetric two-dimensional material can lead to the quantum Hall effect with only even-integer plateaus, unlike a spinless electron gas. Here, two Rashba layers that are degenerate but with opposite SOC due to inversion symmetry, hybridize with each other and create two doubly-degenerate bands with hidden spin texture. Correspondingly, two branches of Landau levels interact, resulting in significant suppression of spin splitting due to the balancing of intralayer SOC and interlayer hybridization. Furthermore, we show that breaking inversion symmetry restores the ordinary quantum Hall fluid by introducing spin-split Fermi surfaces. Our theory can apply to centrosymmetric materials with strong SOC, as demonstrated in a recent experiment on the two-dimensional semiconductor Bi$_2$O$_2$Se.</description>

Abstract: We show that a non-Hermitian lattice with a disclination can host topological disclination states that are induced by on-site gain and loss. The disclination states are inherently non-Hermitian as they do not exist in the limit of zero gain/loss. They arise from charge fractionalization in the non-Hermitian lattice, which we establish using non-Hermitian Wilson loops calculated with biorthogonal products. The model can be realized using an array of optical resonators, with the emergence of the topological disclination states manifesting as an abrupt shift in emission intensity and frequency upon tuning the gain/loss level.</description>

      <title>Splitting of Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman density wave and the nature of chiral gravitons in fractional quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental manifestation of the nontrivial correlations of an incompressible fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state is that an electron added to it disintegrates into more elementary particles, namely fractionally-charged composite fermions (CFs). We show here that the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) density-wave excitation of the $\nu{=}n/(2pn{\pm }1)$ FQH states also splits into more elementary single CF excitons. In particular, the GMP graviton, which refers to the recently observed spin-2 neutral excitation in the vanishing wave vector limit [Liang et al., Nature 628, 78 (2024)], remains undivided for $\nu{=}n/(2n{\pm} 1)$ but splits into two gravitons at $\nu{=}n/(4n{\pm} 1)$ with $n{&gt;}1$. A detailed experimental confirmation of the many observable consequences of the splitting of the GMP mode should provide a unique window into the correlations underlying the FQH effect.</description>

      <title>Raman Spectroscopic Fingerprint of Exfoliated S=1 Triangular Lattice Antiferromagnet NiGa$_2$S$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials have been an exciting area of research ever since scientists first isolated a single layer of graphene. Now, since the emergence of 2D magnets, there has been even more potential for interesting properties and applications ranging from spintronics to topological magnonics. Here we report the first successful exfoliation of bilayer and few-layer flakes of S = 1 triangular lattice antiferromagnet NiGa$_2$S$_4$. We establish the reported number of layers of the material by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and detail a careful characterization using Raman spectroscopy to see how the optical, electronic, and structural properties of the crystal change as a function of sample thickness. Our results provide a reliable method of determining the number of layers of the material by means of Raman spectroscopy. The study is accompanied by electronic structure calculations of bulk versus monolayer NiGa$_2$S$_4$. We conclude with an analysis of the possibility of doping monolayer NiGa$_2$S$_4$ by proximity to a metal.</description>

      <title>Effective short distance interaction in Calogero-Sutherland quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the effective conformal field theory with symmetry W-infinity x W-infinity that describes the thermodynamic limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model. In the repulsive regime of the free fermion formulation, we identify an attractive interaction between opposite moving particle-hole pairs that dominates the short distance behavior and that is proposed as responsible for the destabilization of the ground state, leading to a new one of bosonic nature. The process is described by a Bogoliubov transformation of the free fermion bilinear operators into bosonic ones, preserving the form of the W-infinity algebra but decoupling the opposite chirality terms in the hamiltonian, as expected in the low energy limit. In coordinate space this interaction has a short range component that arises due to the quantum regularization of the theory. The described dynamical process may be considered as a mechanism of the emergence of the known charge and quantum statistics fractionalization of the low lying excitations of the theory, as predicted in both first and second quantization studies.</description>

      <title>Correlated states controlled by tunable van Hove singularity in moir\'e WSe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors have emerged as a highly tunable system for the studies of correlated and topological states of matter, such as superconductivity, ferromagnetism, correlated insulators, and topological and Chern insulators. However, the connection between these symmetry-breaking ground states and the underlying band structure singularity in these materials remains largely unexplored. Here, by combining exciton sensing and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) measurements, we demonstrate how the magnetic properties and the correlated insulating states are controlled by the gate tunable van Hove singularity (VHS) in the band structure of twisted bilayer WSe2 (tWSe2). In particular, we demonstrate how the location of the VHS in the tWSe2 band structure can influence 1) the stability of Stoner ferromagnetism, 2) the valley polarizability and the stability of Chern insulators, as well as 3) the layer polarizability and the associated metal-insulator transition. The results are supported by continuum model band structure calculations. Our work highlights an important ingredient for understanding the electronic phase diagram in twisted bilayer TMDs.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Molecules Interacting with Metal Surfaces: Extending the Hierarchical Equations of Motion and Langevin Dynamics Approach to Position-Dependent Metal-Molecule Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic friction and Langevin dynamics is a popular mixed quantum-classical method for simulating the nonadiabatic dynamics of molecules interacting with metal surfaces, as it can be computationally more efficient than fully quantum approaches. Previous approaches to calculating the electronic friction and other forces, however, have been limited to either noninteracting molecular models or position-independent metal-molecule couplings. In this work, we extend the theory of electronic friction within the hierarchical equations of motion formalism to models with a position-dependent metal-molecule coupling. We show that the addition of a position-dependent metal-molecule coupling adds new contributions to the electronic friction and other forces, which are highly relevant for many physical processes. Our expressions for the electronic forces within the Langevin equation are valid both in and out of equilibrium and for molecular models containing strong interactions. We demonstrate the approach by applying it to different models of interest.</description>

Abstract: The recently discovered van der Waals antiferromagnets have suffered from the lack of a comprehensive method to study their magnetic properties. Here, we propose a dissipationless magnon spin Hall current driven by surface acoustic waves as a novel probe for such antiferromagnets. Our results pave the way towards mechanical detection and manipulation of the magnetic order in two-dimensional antiferromagnets. Furthermore, they will overcome the difficulties with weak magnetic responses inherent in the use of antiferromagnets and hence provide a building block for future antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00447v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a practical implementation of a universal quantum computer that uses local fermionic modes (LFM) rather than qubits. The device layout consists of quantum dots tunnel coupled by a hybrid superconducting island and a tunable capacitive coupling between the dots. We show that coherent control of Cooper pair splitting, elastic cotunneling, and Coulomb interactions allows us to implement the universal set of quantum gates defined by Bravyi and Kitaev. Due to the similarity with charge qubits, we expect charge noise to be the main source of decoherence. For this reason, we also consider an alternative design where the quantum dots have tunable coupling to the superconductor. In this second device design, we show that there is a sweetspot for which the local fermionic modes are charge neutral, making the device insensitive to charge noise effects. Finally, we compare both designs and their experimental limitations and suggest future efforts to overcome them.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that macroscopically-normalizable zero-energy wavefunctions of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in a two-dimensional inhomogeneous magnetic field are spin-polarized and exactly calculable with degeneracy equaling the number of flux quanta linking the whole system. Extending this argument to massless Dirac fermions subjected to magnetic fields that have \textit{zero} net flux but are doubly periodic in real space, we show that there exist \textit{only two} Bloch-normalizable zero-energy eigenstates, one for each spin flavor. This result is immediately relevant to graphene multilayer systems subjected to doubly-periodic strain fields, which at low energies, enter the Hamiltonian as periodic pseudo-gauge vector potentials. Furthermore, we explore various related settings including nonlinearly-dispersing band structure models and systems with singly-periodic magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: The nature of the anomalous metal state has been a major puzzle in condensed matter physics for more than three decades. Here, we report systematic investigation and modulation of the anomalous metal states in high-temperature interface superconductor FeSe films on SrTiO3 substrate. Remarkably, under zero magnetic field, the anomalous metal state persists up to 20 K in pristine FeSe films, an exceptionally high temperature standing out from previous observations. In stark contrast, for the FeSe films with nano-hole arrays, the characteristic temperature of the anomalous metal state is considerably reduced. We demonstrate that the observed anomalous metal states originate from the quantum tunneling of vortices adjusted by the Ohmic dissipation. Our work offers a perspective for understanding the origin and modulation of the anomalous metal states in two-dimensional bosonic systems.</description>

Abstract: Artificial one- and two-dimensional lattices have emerged as a powerful platform for the emulation of lattice Hamiltonians, the fundamental study of collective many-body effects, and phenomena arising from non-trivial topology. Exciton-polaritons, bosonic part-light and part-matter quasiparticles, combine pronounced nonlinearities with the possibility of on-chip implementation. In this context, organic semiconductors embedded in microcavities have proven to be versatile candidates to study nonlinear many-body physics and bosonic condensation, and in contrast to most inorganic systems, they allow the use at ambient conditions since they host ultra-stable Frenkel excitons. We implement a well-controlled, high-quality optical lattice that accommodates light-matter quasiparticles. The realized polariton graphene presents with excellent cavity quality factors, showing distinct signatures of Dirac cone and flatband dispersions as well as polariton lasing at room temperature. This is realized by filling coupled dielectric microcavities with the fluorescent protein mCherry. We demonstrate the emergence of a coherent polariton condensate at ambient conditions, taking advantage of coupling conditions as precise and controllable as in state-of-the-art inorganic semiconductor-based systems, without the limitations of e.g. lattice matching in epitaxial growth. This progress allows straightforward extension to more complex systems, such as the study of topological phenomena in two-dimensional lattices including topological lasers and non-Hermitian optics.</description>

Abstract: Hedgehog and antihedgehog spin textures in magnets behave as emergent monopoles and antimonopoles, which give rise to astonishing transport and electromagnetic phenomena. Using the Kondo-lattice model in three dimensions, we theoretically study collective spin-wave excitation modes of magnetic hedgehog lattices which have recently been discovered in itinerant magnets such as MnSi1-xGex and SrFeO3. It is revealed that the spin-wave modes, which appear in the sub-terahertz regime, have dominant amplitudes localized at Dirac strings connecting hedgehog-antihedgehog pairs and are characterized by their translational oscillations. It is found that their spectral features sensitively depend on the number and configuration of the Dirac strings and, thus, can be exploited for identifying the topological phase transitions associated with the monopole-antimonopole pair annihilations.</description>

Abstract: In two-dimensional topological nodal superconductors, Majorana edge states have been conventionally believed to exhibit only spin-triplet pairing correlations. However, we reveal a substantial spin-singlet pairing component in Majorana edge states of antiferromagnetic topological nodal-point superconductors. This unexpected phenomenon emerges from the interplay between antiferromagnetic order and symmetry, resulting in Majorana edge states with a nearly flat band dispersion, deviating from the strictly flat band. Crucially, this phenomenon is detectable through spin-selective Andreev reflection, where the zero-bias conductance peaks are maximized when the spin of incident electrons is nearly antiparallel to that of Majorana edge excitations. This discovery unveils a unique spin signature for Andreev reflection resonances, advancing our fundamental understanding of spin-dependent mechanisms in topological superconductivity and representing a significant step towards the experimental detection of Majorana fermions.</description>

Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) with symmetry-protected surface states, offer exciting opportunities for next-generation photonic and optoelectronic device applications. The heterojunctions of TIs and semiconductors (e.g. Si, Ge) have been observed to excellent photo-responsive characteristics. However, the realization of high-frequency operations in these heterojunctions can be hindered by unwanted 1/f (or Flicker) noise and phase noise. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of 1/f noise figures becomes paramount for the effective utilization of such materials.Here we report optoelectronic response and 1/f noise characteristics of a p-n diode fabricated using topological insulator, Bi2Se3 and silicon for potential photo-detector. Through meticulous temperature-dependent current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements, we ascertain crucial parameters like barrier height, ideality factor, and reverse saturation current of the photodetector. The low-frequency 1/f conductance noise spectra suggest a significant presence of trap states influencing the optoelectronic transport properties. The forward noise characteristics exhibit typical 1/f features, having a uni-slope across four decades of frequency, suggesting a homogeneous distribution of barrier height. The spectral and photocurrent-dependent responses show the power law behavior of noise level on photon flux. The hybrid heterojunction demonstrates excellent photo-response and reasonably low noise level, promising signatures for the room-temperature visible photodetector applications.</description>
