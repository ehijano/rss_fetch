      <title>Towards absolutely stable ergodicity breaking in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new physically reasonable systems capable of avoiding ergodicity at infinite time in the thermodynamic limit, even with generic perturbations and when coupled to a heat bath. In two dimensions, the rainbow loop soup has (stretched) exponentially numerous absolutely stable nonergodic states with diverging energy but vanishing energy density. In three dimensions the rainbow membrane soup has (stretched) exponentially numerous nonergodic states with diverging energy barriers, leading to infinite-time robust ergodicity breaking that even survives coupling to a nonzero temperature heat bath. We describe our results in the language of exact emergent symmetries and demonstrate how the systems avoid common instabilities. Our construction naturally connects to quantum dimer models, topologically ordered systems, the group word construction, and Hamiltonians whose low-energy eigenstates exhibit anomalous entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Exact spectral form factors of non-interacting fermions with Dyson statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral form factor (SFF) is a powerful diagnostic of random matrix behavior in quantum many-body systems. We introduce a family of random circuit ensembles whose SFFs can be computed $\textit{exactly}$. These ensembles describe the evolution of non-interacting fermions in the presence of correlated on-site potentials drawn from the eigenvalue distribution of a circular ensemble. For disorder parameters drawn from the circular unitary ensemble (CUE), we derive an exact closed form for the SFF, valid for any choice of system size $L$ or time $t$. When the disorder is drawn from the circular orthogonal or symplectic ensembles (COE and CSE, respectively), we carry out the disorder averages analytically and reduce the computation of the SFF to a combinatorial problem amenable to transfer matrix methods. In each of these cases the SFF grows exponentially in time, which we argue is a signature of random matrix universality at the single-particle level. Finally, we develop matchgate circuit representations of our circuit ensembles, enabling their experimental realization in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Higher-order gap ratios of singular values in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding open quantum systems using information encoded in its complex eigenvalues has been a subject of growing interest. In this paper, we study higher-order gap ratios of the singular values of generic open quantum systems. We show that $k$-th order gap ratio of the singular values of an open quantum system can be connected to the nearest-neighbor spacing ratio of positions of classical particles of a harmonically confined log-gas with inverse temperature $\beta'(k)$ where $\beta'(k)$ is an analytical function that depends on $k$ and the Dyson's index $\beta=1,2,$ and $4$ that characterizes the properties of the associated Hermitized matrix. Our findings are crucial not only for understanding long-range correlations between the eigenvalues but also provide an excellent way of distinguishing different symmetry classes in an open quantum system. To highlight the universality of our findings, we demonstrate the higher-order gap ratios using different platforms such as non-Hermitian random matrices, random dissipative Liouvillians, Hamiltonians coupled to a Markovian bath, and Hamiltonians with in-built non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Koopman correlations underlie linear response and causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inference of causal relationships among observed variables is a pivotal, longstanding problem in the scientific community. An intuitive method for quantifying these causal links involves examining the response of one variable to perturbations in another. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem elegantly connects this response to the correlation functions of the unperturbed system, thereby bridging the concepts of causality and correlation. However, this relationship becomes intricate in nonlinear systems, where knowledge of the invariant measure is required but elusive, especially in high-dimensional spaces. In this study, we establish a novel link between the Koopman operator of nonlinear stochastic systems and the response function. This connection provides an alternative method for computing the response function using generalized correlation functions, even when the invariant measure is unknown. We validate our theoretical framework by applying it to a nonlinear high-dimensional system amenable to exact solutions, demonstrating convergence and consistency with established results. Finally, we discuss a significant interplay between the resulting causal network and the relevant time scales of the system.</description>

      <title>Theory for sequence selection via phase separation and oligomerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium selection pressures were proposed for the formation of oligonucleotides with rich functionalities encoded in their sequences, such as catalysis. Since phase separation was shown to direct various chemical processes, we ask whether condensed phases can provide mechanisms for sequence selection. To answer this question, we use non-equilibrium thermodynamics and describe the reversible oligomerization of different monomers to sequences at non-dilute conditions prone to phase separation. We find that when sequences oligomerize, their interactions give rise to phase separation, boosting specific sequences' enrichment and depletion. Our key result is that phase separation gives rise to a selection pressure for the oligomerization of specific sequence patterns when fragmentation maintains the system away from equilibrium. Specifically, slow fragmentation favors alternating sequences that interact well with their environment (more cooperative), while fast fragmentation selects sequences with extended motifs capable of specific sequence interactions (less cooperative). Our results highlight that out-of-equilibrium condensed phases could provide versatile hubs for Darwinian-like evolution toward functional sequences, both relevant for the molecular origin of life and de novo life.</description>

      <title>Gyromorphs: a new class of functional disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of functional correlated disordered materials, termed Gyromorphs, which uniquely combine liquid-like translational disorder with quasi-long-range rotational order, induced by a ring of $G$ delta peaks in their structure factor. We generate gyromorphs in $2d$ and $3d$ by spectral optimization methods, verifying that they display strong discrete rotational order but no long-range translational order, while maintaining rotational isotropy at short range for sufficiently large $G$. We show that they are distinct from quasicrystals, which we argue are akin to Fourier ''duals'' of gyromorphs. Using a coupled dipole approximation, we show that these structures outperform quasicrystals, stealthy hyperuniformity, and Vogel spirals in the formation of isotropic bandgaps in $2d$, for both scalar and vector waves, and open complete isotropic bandgaps in $3d$. Finally, we introduce ''polygyromorphs'' with several rotational symmetries at different length scales (i.e., multiple rings of delta peaks), enabling the formation of multiple bandgaps in a single structure, thereby paving the way for fine control over optical properties.</description>

      <title>Foundation and challenges in modelling Dilute Active Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active suspensions, which consist of suspended self-propelling particles such as swimming microorganisms, often exhibit non-trivial transport properties. Continuum models are frequently employed to elucidate phenomena in active suspensions, such as shear trapping of bacteria, bacterial turbulence, and bioconvection patterns in suspensions of algae. Yet, these models are often empirically derived and may not always agree with the individual-based description of active particles. Here we establish a more rigorous foundation to fully develop a continuum model based on the respective microscopic dynamics through coarse-graining. All the assumptions needed to reach popular continuum models from a multi-particle Fokker-Planck equation, which governs the probability of the full configuration space, are explicitly presented. In the dilute limit, this approach leads to the mean-field model (a.k.a. Doi-Saintillan-Shelley model), which can be further reduced to a continuum equation for particle density. Moreover, we review the limitations and highlight the challenges related to continuum descriptions, including significant issues in implementing physical boundary conditions and the possible emergence of singular solutions.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Free Localization for Benchmarking Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disorder-free localization (DFL) is a phenomenon as striking as it appears to be simple: a translationally invariant state evolving under a disorder-free Hamiltonian failing to thermalize. It is predicted to occur in a number of quantum systems exhibiting emergent or native \emph{local} symmetries. These include models of lattice gauge theories and, perhaps most simply, some two-component spin chains. Though well-established analytically for special soluble examples, numerical studies of generic systems have proven difficult. Moreover, the required local symmetries are a challenge for any experimental realization. Here, we show how a canonical model of DFL can be efficiently implemented on gate-based quantum computers, which relies on our efficient encoding of three-qubit gates. We show that the simultaneous observation of the absence of correlation spreading and tunable entanglement growth to a volume law provides an ideal testbed for benchmarking the capabilities of quantum computers. In particular, the availability of a soluble limit allows for a rigorous prediction of emergent localization length scales and tunable time scales for the volume law entanglement growth, which are ideal for testing capabilities of scalable quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A phase transition in sampling from Restricted Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann Machines are a class of undirected graphical models that play a key role in deep learning and unsupervised learning. In this study, we prove a phase transition phenomenon in the mixing time of the Gibbs sampler for a one-parameter Restricted Boltzmann Machine. Specifically, the mixing time varies logarithmically, polynomially, and exponentially with the number of vertices depending on whether the parameter $c$ is above, equal to, or below a critical value $c_\star\approx-5.87$. A key insight from our analysis is the link between the Gibbs sampler and a dynamical system, which we utilize to quantify the former based on the behavior of the latter. To study the critical case $c= c_\star$, we develop a new isoperimetric inequality for the sampler's stationary distribution by showing that the distribution is nearly log-concave.</description>

      <title>Snap and Jump: How Elastic Shells Pop Out</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grip, walk, crawl, and jump. Soft robots are integrated functional structures composed of compliant mechanisms, whose activity spans various industrial applications such as surgery, healthcare, surveillance, and even planetary exploration. One of their promising mobility mechanism is snap-buckling; the instability mode of flexible structures passing from one equilibrium state to another can instantaneously generate large power for its motion. Predicting their performance with even simple geometry requires disentangling material, geometric nonlinearity, and contact, thereby still being a challenging problem to date. Here, we study the jumping dynamics of hemispherical elastic shells driven by snap-buckling, as a model system of soft jumping mechanisms, combining experiments, simulations, and analytical theory. We find that the contact transition dynamics trigger the jumping phenomenon upon snap-buckling by constructing the analytical predictions with shell elasticity in excellent agreement with both experiments and simulations. Despite the simple geometry of the shell, its dynamical performance primarily relies on a complex interplay between elasticity, geometry, and contact friction. By elucidating the dynamics of the building blocks of soft robots that undergo large deformations, we can build their predictive experimental and numerical framework. Our research paves the way for designing soft robots suitable for the required loading conditions or structural requirements without empirical methods.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a mixed-state generalization of the multi-entropy through the canonical purification, which we called reflected multi-entropy. We propose the holographic dual of this measure. For the tripartite case, a field-theoretical calculation is performed using a six-point function of twist operators at large $c$ limit. At both zero and finite temperature, the field-theoretical results match the holographic results exactly, supporting our holographic conjecture of this new measure.</description>

      <title>Regulating protocols of globally coupled continuum systems: Effects on dynamics and thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling and understanding phenomena in coupled systems remains a significant challenge across diverse fields. This study investigates a simple globally coupled chemical system that exhibits a range of rich collective dynamics, from coherence to chimera states, controllable by a system parameter. We explore the effects of altering this control parameter using two different protocols. In protocol-I, a continuous variation of the control parameter leads to memory effects, resulting in two distinct sets of phenomena in the forward and reverse directions. In contrast, protocol-II, which includes a resetting feature, yields an entirely distinct collection of behaviors. Additionally, we capture the evolution of key elements of nonequilibrium thermodynamics associated with these dynamical states under both protocols, revealing distinct signatures for each. This work highlights the complexity and uniqueness of regulating coupled systems via control parameters compared to corresponding single systems, and it carries potential implications for the manipulation and application of collective behaviors.</description>

      <title>Supercritical density fluctuations and structural heterogeneity in supercooled water-glycerol microdroplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments and theoretical studies strongly indicate that water exhibits a liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT) in the supercooled domain. An open question is how the LLPT of water can affect the properties of aqueous solutions. Here, we study the structural and thermodynamic properties of supercooled glycerol-water microdroplets at dilute conditions ($\chi_g=3.2~\%$ glycerol mole fraction). The combination of rapid evaporative cooling with ultrafast X-ray scattering allows us to outrun crystallization and gain access to the deeply supercooled regime down to $T=229.3$ K. We find that the density fluctuations of the glycerol-water solution or, equivalently, its isothermal compressibility, $\kappa_T$, increases upon cooling. This is confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that the presence of glycerol shifts the temperature of maximum $\kappa_T$ from $T=230$ K in pure water down to $T=223$ K in the solution. Our findings elucidate the interplay between the complex behavior of water, including its LLPT, and the properties of aqueous solutions at low temperatures, which can have practical consequences in cryogenic biological applications and cryopreservation techniques.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocity is necessary for robust dimensional reduction and strong responses in stochastic topological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16720v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological theory predicts the necessary conditions for robust dimensional reduction in a host of quantum and classical systems. Models have recently been proposed for stochastic systems which describe many biological and chemical phenomena. However, general theoretical principles are lacking for this class of systems, exemplified by the breakdown of the celebrated bulk-edge correspondence. We prove that contrary to topological phases in quantum and many classical systems, stochastic systems require non-reciprocal (or non-Hermitian) transitions for robust edge responses, which holds across all dimensions and geometries. We propose a novel explanation of hybridization that destroys edge responses in reciprocal (Hermitian) stochastic systems. Further, we show that stochastic steady states grow dramatically with non-reciprocity, in contrast to their quantum counterparts which plateaus. We analyze the resulting theoretical and physical consequences and how non-reciprocity mitigates the effects of hybridization towards robust edge states in equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states. These results establish the crucial role of non-reciprocal interactions for responses that are robust to random perturbations in active and living matter.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis</title>

Abstract: Understanding how out-of-equilibrium states thermalize under quantum unitary dynamics is an important problem in many-body physics. In this work, we propose a statistical ansatz for the matrix elements of non-equilibrium initial states in the energy eigenbasis, in order to describe such evolution. The approach is inspired by the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis (ETH) but the proposed ansatz exhibits different scaling. Importantly, we point out the exponentially small cross-correlations between the observable and the initial state matrix elements that determine relaxation dynamics toward equilibrium. We numerically verify scaling and cross-correlation, point out the emergent universality of the high-frequency behavior, and outline possible generalizations.</description>

      <title>Emerging cost-time Pareto front for diffusion with stochastic return</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resetting, in which a system is regularly returned to a given state after a fixed or random duration, has become a useful strategy to optimize the search performance of a system. While earlier theoretical frameworks focused on instantaneous resetting, wherein the system is directly teleported to a given state, there is a growing interest in physical resetting mechanisms that involve a finite return time. However employing such a mechanism involves cost and the effect of this cost on the search time remains largely unexplored. Yet answering this is important in order to design cost-efficient resetting strategies. Motivated from this, we present a thermodynamic analysis of a diffusing particle whose position is intermittently reset to a specific site by employing a stochastic return protocol with external confining trap. We show for a family of potentials $U_R(x) \sim |x|^{m}$ with $m&gt;0$, it is possible to find optimal potential shape that minimises the expected first-passage time for a given value of the thermodynamic cost, i.e. mean work. By varying this value, we then obtain the Pareto optimal front, and demonstrate a trade-off relation between the first-passage time and the work done.</description>

      <title>Spatial Form Factor for Point Patterns: Homogeneous Poisson Point Process and Coulomb Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a spatial form factor (SFF) for the characterization of spatial patterns associated with point processes. Specifically, the SFF is defined in terms of the averaged even Fourier transform of the distance between any pair of points. We focus on homogeneous Poisson point processes and derive the explicit expression for the SFF in $d$-spatial dimensions. The SFF can then be found in terms of the even Fourier transform of the probability distribution for the distance between two independent and uniformly distributed random points on a $d$-dimensional ball, arising in the ball line picking problem. The relation between the SFF and the set of $n$-order spacing distributions is further established. The SFF is analyzed in detail for $d=1,2,3$ and in the infinite-dimensional case, as well as for the $d$-dimensional Coulomb gas, as an interacting point process. We also introduce a generalization of the SFF applicable to arbitrary sets in a metric space.</description>

      <title>Geometric Characterization of Many Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many body localization (MBL) represents a unique physical phenomenon, providing a testing ground for exploring thermalization, or more precisely its failure. Here we characterize the MBL phase geometrically by the many-body quantum metric (MBQM), defined in the parameter space of twist boundary. We find that we can characterise the transition by comparing the thermodynamic limits of the MBQM and localization length as defined in the modern theory of polarization and insulators. As such we find that we can extract a natural localization length in the MBL phase that relies only on the real space spread of the wave function and can be measured through lattice shaking or AC response measurements.</description>

      <title>Microscopic and stochastic simulations of chemically active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates play a central role in the spatial organization of living matter. Their formation is now well understood as a form of liquid-liquid phase separation that occurs very far from equilibrium. For instance, they can be modeled as active droplets, where the combination of molecular interactions and chemical reactions result in microphase separation. However, so far, models of chemically active droplets are spatially continuous and deterministic. Therefore, the relationship between the microscopic parameters of the models and some crucial properties of active droplets (such as their polydispersity, their shape anisotropy, or their typical lifetime) is yet to be established. In this work, we address this question computationally, using Brownian dynamics simulations of chemically active droplets: the building blocks are represented explicitly as particles that interact with attractive or repulsive interactions, depending on whether they are in a droplet-forming state or not. Thanks to this microscopic and stochastic view of the problem, we reveal how driving the system away from equilibrium in a controlled way determines the fluctuations and dynamics of active emulsions.</description>
