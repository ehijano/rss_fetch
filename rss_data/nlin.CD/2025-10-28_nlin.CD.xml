      <title>Eigenvector Geometry as a Universal Amplifier of Heavy-Tailed Fluctuations in Random Multiplicative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy-tailed fluctuations and power-law distributions pervade physics, biology, and the social sciences, with numerous mechanisms proposed for their emergence. Kesten processes, which are multiplicative stochastic recursions with additive noise or reinjection, provide a canonical explanation, where power-law tails arise from transient supercritical excursions as eigenvalues intermittently cross the stability boundary. Here we uncover a distinct and more general mechanism in multidimensional systems: non-normal eigenvector amplification. In random non-normal matrices, the non-orthogonality of eigenvectors, quantified by the condition number $\kappa$, induces transient growth that increases the effective Lyapunov exponent $\gamma \simeq \gamma_0 + \langle \ln \kappa \rangle$ and lowers the tail exponent $\alpha \simeq -2\gamma / \sigma_{\kappa}^2$, where $\sigma_{\kappa}^2$ is the variance of $\ln \kappa$. As the system dimension $N$ grows, $\kappa$ typically increases proportionally, making non-normal amplification the dominant source of scale-free behavior. We illustrate this mechanism in two representative systems: (i) polymer stretching in turbulent flows, where intermittent extensions arise from eigenvector amplification of velocity gradients and (ii) financial return distributions, where extending one-dimensional GARCH/Kesten processes to a multidimensional setting yields a collective origin for heavy-tailed market fluctuations and explains their near-universal exponents across assets.</description>

      <title>The dynamics around the collinear points of the elliptic three-body problem: A normal form approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the collinear points in the planar, restricted three-body problem, assuming that the primaries move on an elliptic orbit around a common barycenter. The equations of motion can be conveniently written in a rotating pulsating barycentric frame, taking the true anomaly as independent variable. We consider the Hamiltonian modeling this problem in the extended phase space and we imple ment a normal form to make a center manifold reduction. The normal form provides an approximate solution for the Cartesian coordinates, which allows us to construct several kinds of orbits, most notably planar and vertical Lyapunov orbits, and halo orbits. We compare the analytical results with a numerical simulation, which requires special care in the selection of the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of the spin-spin problem in Celestial Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates different models of rotational dynamics of two rigid bodies with the shape of an ellipsoid, moving under their gravitational influence. The focus of this study is on their behavior, their linear stability, and numerical investigation of the main resonances. We assume that the spin axes of the two bodies are perpendicular to the orbital plane and coinciding with the direction of their shortest physical axis. In the basic approximation, we assume that the orbits of the centers of mass are Keplerian and we retain the lowest order of the potential, according to which the rotational motions of the two bodies are decoupled, the so-called spin-orbit problem. When considering highest order approximation of the potential, the rotational motions become coupled giving rise to the so-called spin-spin problem. Finally, we release the assumption that the orbit is Keplerian, which implies that the rotational dynamics is coupled to the variation of the orbital elements. The resulting system is called the full spin-spin problem. We also consider the above models under the assumption that one or both bodies are non rigid; the dissipative effect is modeled by a linear function of the rotational velocity, depending on some dissipative and drift coefficients. We consider three main resonances, namely the (1:1,1:1), (3:2,3:2), (1:1,3:2) resonances and we start by analyzing the linear stability of the equilibria in the conservative and dissipative settings (after averaging and keeping only the resonant angle), showing that the stability depends on the value of the orbital eccentricity. By a numerical integration of the equations of motion, we compare the spin-orbit and spin-spin problems to highlight the influence of the coupling term of the potential in the conservative and dissipative case...</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for Identifying Weakly Chaotic, Strongly Chaotic, Resonant and Non-resonant Orbits in the Generalized Kicked Rotator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the types of orbits is an important topic in the study of chaotic dynamical systems. Beyond the well-known distinctly chaotic and regular motions, we focus on dynamics occurring in regions where regular and chaotic motions coexist and intertwine, which potentially indicating weakly chaotic orbits. This intermediate regime lies between strongly chaotic dynamics, characterized by exponential sensitivity and completely non-chaotic, purely regular behavior. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning framework to identify the types of orbits in the generalized kicked rotator system, which is challenging to study due to its complex and mixed chaotic behaviors. Our deep learning framework can be divided into two steps. First, we propose a novel algorithm that integrates the weighted Birkhoff average, the Lyapunov exponent, and the correlation dimension to identify weakly chaotic orbits. The algorithm categorizes orbits into four types: weakly chaotic, strongly chaotic, and regular orbits (which are further subdivided into resonant and non-resonant orbits), thereby creating a valuable dataset required for deep learning models. Second, we demonstrate that a well-trained 2D-CNN achieves high performance in accurately classifying orbits, largely because it effectively leverages the 2D structural information of the phase space relation. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to identify weakly chaotic orbits using deep learning methods. The method can be easily extend to other models.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependent Mechanical and Structural Properties of Uniaxially Strained Planar Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14709v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, is discussed. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature, in accordance with previous investigations. An almost linear variation of the third-order elastic modulus with temperature is demonstrated, revealing opposite trends for uniaxial loadings along the armchair or the zigzag direction. The detailed dependence of the distributions of bond lengths and bond angles both on strain and temperature is presented for the first time, along with approximate analytical expressions. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>

      <title>Trapping, chaos and averaging in bubbling AdS spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss chaos and ensemble averaging in 1/2 BPS bubbling $AdS$ spaces of Lin, Lunin and Maldacena (LLM) by studying trapped and escaping null geodesics and estimating their decay rates. We find typical chaotic scattering behavior and confirm the Pesin relation between escape rates, Lyapunov exponents and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. On the other hand, for geodesics in coarse-grained (grayscale) LLM geometries (which exhibit a naked singularity) chaos is strongly suppressed, which is consistent with orbits and escape rates averaged over microscopic backgrounds. Also the singularities in these grayscale geometries produce an attractive potential and have some similarities to black hole throats trapping geodesics for a long time. Overall, averaging over the ensembles of LLM geometries brings us closer toward the typical behavior of geodesics in black hole backgrounds, but some important differences remain, in particular the existence of a threshold timescale when the averaging fails.</description>
