      <title>On the universality of star formation efficiency in galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze high-resolution hydrodynamics simulations of an isolated disk dwarf galaxy with an explicit model for unresolved turbulence and turbulence-based star formation prescription. We examine the characteristic values of the star formation efficiency per free-fall time, $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$, and its variations with local environment properties, such as metallicity, UV flux, and surface density. We show that the star formation efficiency per free-fall time in $\approx 10$ pc star-forming regions of the simulated disks has values in the range $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}\approx 0.01-0.1$, similar to observational estimates, with no trend with metallicity and only a weak trend with the UV flux. Likewise, $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ estimated using projected patches of 500 pc size does not vary with metallicity and shows only a weak trend with average UV flux and gas surface density. The characteristic values of $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}\approx 0.01-0.1$ arise naturally in the simulations via the combined effect of dynamical gas compression and ensuing stellar feedback that injects thermal and turbulent energy. The compression and feedback regulate the virial parameter, $\alpha_\mathrm{vir}$, in star-forming regions, limiting it to $\alpha_\mathrm{vir}\approx 3-10$. Turbulence plays an important role in the universality of $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$ because turbulent energy and its dissipation are not sensitive to metallicity and UV flux that affect thermal energy. Our results indicate that the universality of observational estimates of $\epsilon_\mathrm{ff}$ can be plausibly explained by the turbulence-driven and feedback-regulated properties of star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>What halts the growth of galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gas reservoir of galaxies can be altered by outflows driven by star-formation and luminous active galactic nuclei. Jets heating the surroundings of host galaxies can also prevent gas cooling and inflows. While spectacular examples for these three mass displacement channels have been observed, their importance in transforming the galaxy population depends on the occurance rates of outflow triggers. In an observation-driven approach, we combine distribution functions and scaling relations to empirically compare average outflow rates across the galaxy total stellar mass spectrum and across cosmic time. This hinges on local outflow studies which should be extended to systematic, large and diverse samples, and we do not yet consider a halo heating effect by radiation-driven outflows. Our results show, independent of simulations, the dominance of star formation-driven outflows in low-mass galaxies. Massive galaxies today are predominately prevented from growing further by jet heating, and while at z=1-3 all three processes are approximately similarly important. Other the full mass spectrum and cosmic history, outflows driven by the radiation from active galactic nuclei is never the dominant process.</description>

      <title>Globular cluster orbital decay in dwarf galaxies with MOND and CDM: Impact of supernova feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical friction works very differently for Newtonian gravity with dark matter and in modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). While the absence of dark matter considerably reduces the friction in major galaxy mergers, analytic calculations indicate the opposite for very small perturbations, such as globular clusters (GCs) sinking in dwarf galaxies. Here, we study the decay of GCs in isolated gas-rich dwarf galaxies using simulations with the Phantom of Ramses code, which enables both the Newtonian and the QUMOND MOND gravity. We modeled the GCs as point masses, and we simulated the full hydrodynamics, with star formation and supernovae feedback. We explored whether the fluctuations in gravitational potential caused by the supernovae can prevent GCs from sinking toward the nucleus. For GCs of typical mass or lighter, we find that this indeed works in both Newtonian and MOND simulations. The GC can even make a random walk. However, we find that supernovae cannot prevent massive GCs ($M\geq 4\times10^5\,M_\odot$) from sinking in MOND. The resulting object looks similar to a galaxy with an offset core, which embeds the sunk GC. The problem is much milder in the Newtonian simulations. This result thus favors Newtonian over QUMOND gravity, but we note that it relies on the correctness of the difficult modeling of baryonic feedback. We propose that the fluctuations in the gravitational potential could be responsible for the thickness of the stellar disks of dwarf galaxies and that strong supernova winds in modified gravity can transform dwarf galaxies into ultra-diffuse galaxies.</description>

      <title>Pattern speed evolution of barred galaxies in TNG50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic bars are found in the majority of disc galaxies. They rotate nearly rigidly with an angular frequency called pattern speed. Previous idealised simulations have shown that bar pattern speed decreases with time due to dynamical friction exerted by the dark matter halo, while cold gas can reduce or even reverse this trend. We want to understand how different galaxy properties affect the evolution of the bar pattern speed in more realistic situations, including ongoing star formation, mass infall, AGN feedback and galaxy interactions. We used the high-resolution run TNG50-1 of the magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulations suite IllustrisTNG to trace the pattern speed of simulated bars and see how it depends on various galaxy properties. Simulated bars with initially high pattern speed and a subsequent rapid slowdown are more likely found in more massive galaxies. Lower mass galaxies, on the other hand, preferentially host bars that start at relatively low pattern speeds and retain the same value until the end of the simulation. More massive barred galaxies are also more affected by the AGN feedback, which removes (or heats up) the cold gas that could have prevented the slowdown. We find that bars grow and strengthen with slowdown, in agreement with higher resolution simulations. We find that strong correlations between the bar slowdown rate and galaxy mass weaken considerably when we use dimensionless measures to quantify the slowdown. In TNG50, the AGN feedback prescription amplifies the mass dependence. Turned around, this provides an interesting statistic to constrain subgrid physics by bar growth/slowing.</description>

      <title>VVV catalog of ab-type RR Lyrae in the inner Galactic bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Observational evidence has accumulated in the past years, showing that the Galactic bulge includes two populations, a metal poor and a metal rich one that, in addition to a different metallicity, show different alpha over iron abundances, spatial distribution, and kinematics. While the metal rich, barred component has been fairly well characterized, the metal poor, spheroidal component has been more elusive and harder to describe. RR Lyrae variables are clean tracers of the old bulge component, and they are, on average, more metal poor than red clump stars.
  Aims. In the present paper, we provide a new catalog of 16488 ab type RR Lyrae variables in the bulge region within -10&lt;l&lt;10 and -2.8&lt;b&lt;2.8, extracted from multi epoch PSF photometry performed on VISTA Variable in the Via Lactea survey data. We used the catalog to constrain the shape of the old, metal poor, bulge stellar population.
  Methods. The identification of ab type RR Lyrae among a large sample of candidate variables of different types has been performed via a combination of a Random Forest classifier and visual inspection... [abridged]
  Results. We use the present catalog to derive the shape of their distribution around the Galactic Center, resulting in an elongated spheroid with projected axis ratio b/a~0.7 and inclination angle ~20 degrees. We discuss how observational biases such as errors on the distances and a non-uniform sampling in longitude, affect both the present measurements and previous ones, especially those based on red clump stars... [abridged]
  Conclusions. We publish a high purity RRab sample for future studies of the oldest Galactic bulge population, close to the midplane. We explore different choices for the period-luminosity-metallicity relation, highlighting how some of them introduce spurious trends of distances with either period or metallicity, or both...

      <title>Different influence of gas accretion on the evolution of star-forming and non-star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using integral field spectroscopic data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey, we investigate the spatially resolved properties and empirical relations of a star-forming galaxy and a non-star-forming galaxy hosting counter-rotating stellar disks (CRDs). The DESI $g, r, z$ color images reveal no evidence of merger remnants in either galaxy, suggesting that gas accretion fuels the formation of CRDs. Based on the visible counter-rotation in the stellar velocity field, we can fit a spatial boundary to distinguish the inner and outer regions dominated by two stellar disks in each galaxy. In the inner region of the star-forming CRDs, stars are co-rotating with ionized gas, and the stellar population is younger. Comparison of the star-forming main sequence relations between the inner and outer regions reveals enhanced star formation in the inner region. Given the abundant pre-existing gas in the star-forming galaxy, collisions between pre-existing and external gas efficiently consume angular momentum, triggering star formation in the inner region. Conversely, in the outer region of the non-star-forming CRDs, stars are co-rotating with ionized gas, and the stellar population is younger. Comparison of the stellar mass-metallicity relations between the inner and outer regions indicates enriched gas-phase metallicity in the outer region. Considering the less abundant pre-existing gas in the non-star-forming galaxy, external gas could preserve angular momentum, fueling star formation in the outer region. Overall, gas accretion exhibits different influence on the evolution of star-forming and non-star-forming galaxies.</description>

      <title>Milky Way-mass disc galaxies with low-mass stellar haloes have diverse merger histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Eagle simulation to study the relationship between the stellar haloes of Milky-Way-mass galaxies and their recent merger histories. The stellar mass ratio of the most massive merger that occurred since $z=1$ is strongly correlated with the $z=0$ fraction of ex situ stars in the galaxy, $f_{\rm ex\ situ}$, but is weakly correlated with stellar halo mass fraction, $f_{\rm SH}$, particularly for disc galaxies. Contrary to common belief, our results suggest that disc galaxies with low mass stellar haloes do not necessarily have quiescent merger histories; in fact, roughly one quarter have experienced a merger with stellar mass ratio $&gt; 0.1$ since $z=1$. We demonstrate that the population of disc galaxies with low $f_{\rm SH}$ and active merger histories undergo mergers with satellites whose orbits are more circular than average and are approximately co-planar with the disc; instead of contributing significantly to the stellar halo, these mergers lead to discs that contain a substantial fraction of ex situ stellar mass and are thicker and more extended than those of quiescent galaxies. Such mergers also supply fuel that often incites a significant episode of in situ star formation in the disc. Our results suggest that seemingly quiescent disc galaxies with low-mass stellar haloes actually have diverse merger histories, which limits the extent to which stellar haloes alone can act as observable tracers of the hierarchical assembly of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine structure of the methanol molecule as traced by Class I methanol masers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results on simultaneous observations of Class~I methanol masers at 25, 36, and 44 GHz towards 22 Galactic targets carried out with the Effelsberg 100-m telescope. The study investigates relations between the hyperfine (HF) structure of the torsion-rotation transitions in CH3OH and maser activity. By analyzing the radial velocity shifts between different maser lines together with the patterns of the HF structure based on laboratory measurements and quantum-chemical calculations, we find that in any source only one specific HF transition forms the maser emission and that this transition changes from source to source. The physical conditions leading to this selective behavior are still unclear. Using accurate laboratory rest frequencies for the 25 GHz transitions, we have refined the centre frequencies for the HF multiplets at 36, 44, and 95 GHz: f_36 = (36169.2488 +/- 0.0002_stat +/- 0.0004_sys) MHz. f_44 = (44069.4176 +/- 0.0002_stat +/- 0.0004_sys) MHz, and f_95 = (95169.4414 +/- 0.0003_stat +/- 0.0004_sys) MHz. Comparison with previous observations of 44 GHz masers performed 6-10 years ago with a Korean 21-m KVN telescope towards the same targets confirms the kinematic stability of Class~I maser line profiles during this time interval and reveals a systematic radial velocity shift of 0.013 +/- 0.005 km/s between the two telescopes.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Kinematics in Young Clusters: The {\lambda} Ori Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Most stars form in clusters or associations but only a small number of these groups are expected to remain bound for longer than a few Myr. Once star formation has ended and the molecular gas around young stellar objects has been expelled via feedback processes, most initially bound young clusters lose the majority of their binding mass and begin to disperse into the Galactic field. Aims. This process can be investigated by analysing the structure and kinematic trends in nearby young clusters, particularly expansion, the tell-tale sign that a cluster is no longer gravitationally bound but is dispersing into the field. Methods. We combine Gaia DR3 5-parameter astrometry with calibrated radial velocities for members of the nearby young cluster {\lambda} Ori (Collinder 69). Results. We characterise the plane-of-sky substructure of the cluster using the Q-parameter and Angular Dispersion parameter. We find evidence that the cluster contains significant substructure, but that this is preferentially located away from the central cluster core, which is smooth and likely remains bound. We find strong evidence for expansion in {\lambda} Ori in the plane-of-sky using a number of metrics, but also that the trends are asymmetric at the 5{\sigma} significance level. with the maximum rate of expansion being directed nearly parallel to the Galactic plane. We then invert the maximum rate of expansion of 0.144^{+0.003}_{-0.003} kms^{-1}pc^{-1} to give an expansion timescale of 6.944^{+0.148}_{-0.142} Myr, which is slightly larger than typical literature age estimates for the cluster. We also find asymmetry in the velocity dispersion, potential signatures of cluster rotation, and calculate kinematic ages for individual cluster members by tracing their motion back in time to their closest approach to the cluster center.</description>

      <title>The Strength of Bisymmetric Modes in SDSS-IV/MaNGA Barred Galaxy Kinematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SDSS-IV/MaNGA Survey data provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the internal motions of galaxies and, in particular, represent the largest sample of barred galaxy kinematic maps obtained to date. We present results from Nirvana, our non-axisymmetric kinematic modeling code built with a physically-motivated Bayesian forward modeling approach, which decomposes MaNGA velocity fields into first- and second-order radial and tangential rotational modes in a generalized and minimally-supervised fashion. We use Nirvana to produce models and rotation curves for 1263 unique barred MaNGA galaxies and a matched unbarred control sample We present our modeling approach, tests of its efficacy, and validation against existing visual bar classifications. Nirvana finds elevated non-circular motions in galaxies identified as bars in imaging, and bar position angles that agree well with visual measurements. The Nirvana-MaNGA barred and control samples provide a new opportunity for studying the influence of non-axisymmetric internal disk kinematics in a large statistical sample.</description>

      <title>X-ray and multiwavelength polarization of Mrk 501 from 2022 to 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present multiwavelength polarization measurements of the luminous blazar Mrk~501 over a 14-month period. The 2--8 keV X-ray polarization was measured with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) with six 100-ks observations spanning from 2022 March to 2023 April. Each IXPE observation was accompanied by simultaneous X-ray data from NuSTAR, Swift/XRT, and/or XMM-Newton. Complementary optical-infrared polarization measurements were also available in the B, V, R, I, and J bands, as were radio polarization measurements from 4.85 GHz to 225.5 GHz. Among the first five IXPE observations, we did not find significant variability in the X-ray polarization degree and angle with IXPE. However, the most recent sixth observation found an elevated polarization degree at $&gt;3\sigma$ above the average of the other five observations. The optical and radio measurements show no apparent correlations with the X-ray polarization properties. Throughout the six IXPE observations, the X-ray polarization degree remained higher than, or similar to, the R-band optical polarization degree, which remained higher than the radio value. This is consistent with the energy-stratified shock scenario proposed to explain the first two IXPE observations, in which the polarized X-ray, optical, and radio emission arises from different regions.</description>

Abstract: Axion dark matter thermalizes by gravitational self-interactions and forms a Bose-Einstein condensate. We show that the rethermalization of the axion fluid during the initial collapse of large scale overdensities near cosmic dawn transports angular momentum outward sufficientlly fast that black holes form with masses ranging from approximately $10^5$ to a few times $10^{10}~M_\odot$.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of proprietary and open-weights large language models using the first astronomy-specific benchmarking dataset. This dataset comprises 4,425 multiple-choice questions curated from the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, covering a broad range of astrophysical topics. Our analysis examines model performance across various astronomical subfields and assesses response calibration, crucial for potential deployment in research environments. Claude-3.5-Sonnet outperforms competitors by up to 4.6 percentage points, achieving 85.0% accuracy. For proprietary models, we observed a universal reduction in cost every 3-to-12 months to achieve similar score in this particular astronomy benchmark. Open-source models have rapidly improved, with LLaMA-3-70b (80.6%) and Qwen-2-72b (77.7%) now competing with some of the best proprietary models. We identify performance variations across topics, with non-English-focused models generally struggling more in exoplanet-related fields, stellar astrophysics, and instrumentation related questions. These challenges likely stem from less abundant training data, limited historical context, and rapid recent developments in these areas. This pattern is observed across both open-weights and proprietary models, with regional dependencies evident, highlighting the impact of training data diversity on model performance in specialized scientific domains. Top-performing models demonstrate well-calibrated confidence, with correlations above 0.9 between confidence and correctness, though they tend to be slightly underconfident. The development for fast, low-cost inference of open-weights models presents new opportunities for affordable deployment in astronomy. The rapid progress observed suggests that LLM-driven research in astronomy may become feasible in the near future.</description>

      <title>Tidal Disruption of Stars by Supermassive Black Holes and Naked Singularities with Scalar Hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study tidal forces near strongly gravitating objects at the centers of galaxies. In our approach, dark matter surrounding the centers of galaxies is modeled by a nonlinear scalar field. We focus on static, asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric black holes and naked singularities supported by a real self-gravitating scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. We consider the influence of dark matter on the tidal forces caused by the central objects and some features of the motion of matter near these configurations. It turns out, first, that the event horizon radius of a scalar field black hole can be arbitrarily small as well as the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit, and tidal forces near this orbit can be very large. Second, we show that if strongly gravitating objects in the centers of galaxies are naked singularities, then bright flares (tidal disruption events) in the nuclei of galaxies can be explained in different way. In the vicinity of a scalar field naked singularity, baryonic matter is concentrated in the gravitational potential well forming a "gray shell" consisting of cold compressed matter. In this case, the flares are caused by the collisions of stars with this shell.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an Extremely r-process-enhanced Thin-disk Star with [Eu/H] = +0.78</title>

Abstract: Highly r-process-enhanced stars are rare and usually metal-poor ([Fe/H] &lt; - 1.0), and mainly populate the Milky Way halo and dwarf galaxies. This study presents the discovery of a relatively bright (V = 12.72), highly r-process-enhanced (r-II) star ([Eu/Fe] = +1.32, [Ba/Eu] = - 0.95), LAMOST J020623.21 + 494127.9. This star was selected from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) medium-resolution (R ~ 7500) spectroscopic survey; follow-up high-resolution (R ~ 25,000) observations were conducted with the High Optical Resolution Spectrograph (HORuS) installed on the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). The stellar parameters (${T_{\rm eff}}$ = 4130 K, $\rm log\,g $ = 1.52, $ \rm[Fe/H] $ = $ - $0.54, $\xi$ = 1.80 $ \rm{km\,{s^{-1}}} $) have been inferred taking into account non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects. The abundances of [Ce/Fe], [Pr/Fe], and [Nd/Fe] are +0.19, +0.65 and +0.64, respectively, relatively low compared to the Solar r-process pattern normalized to Eu. This star has a high metallicity ([Fe/H] = - 0.54) compared to most other highly r-process-enhanced stars, and has the highest measured abundance ratio of Eu to H ([Eu/H] = +0.78). It is classified as a thin-disk star based on its kinematics, and does not appear to belong to any known stream or dwarf galaxy.</description>

      <title>Discovering the Cosmic Evolution of Supermassive Black Holes using Nano-Hertz Gravitational Waves and Galaxy Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the Universe remains an open question in cosmology. We show for the first time that the evolution of SMBHs with redshift leads to a unique signature on the angular cross-correlation power spectrum between the multi-frequency nano-hertz (nHz) stochastic gravitational wave (SGWB) and the galaxy density in the Universe. By using galaxy catalogs from the upcoming Rubin LSST Observatory in synergy with the nHz SGWB signal accessible from the Square Kilometer Array, we can measure this signal with a signal-to-noise ratio above five, thereby opening a new observational window to the cosmic evolution of SMBHs across redshift. This discovery space that can be opened by the cross-correlation of the nHz SGWB will not be possible by any other currently known techniques.</description>

      <title>Population synthesis of Thorne-\.Zytkow objects: Rejuvenated donors and unexplored progenitors in the common envelope formation channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Common envelope evolution of a massive star and a neutron star companion has two possible outcomes: formation of a short-period binary (a potential gravitational wave source progenitor) or a merger of the massive star with the neutron star. If the binary merges, a structure with a neutron star core surrounded by a large diffuse envelope, a so-called Thorne-\.Zytkow object (T\.ZO), may form. The predicted appearance of this hypothetical class of star is very similar to red supergiants, making observational identification difficult.
  Aims. Our objective is to understand the properties of systems that are potential T\.ZO progenitors, e.g., binary systems that enter a common envelope phase with a neutron star companion. We also aim to distinguish those that have been through a previous stable mass transfer phase, which can rejuvenate the accretor. We estimate the number of T\.ZOs in the Milky Way and assess the impact of uncertainties in their formation.
  Methods. We use the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS at Solar metallicity and with common envelope efficiency parameter set to unity to determine the population demographics of T\.ZOs. We use one-dimensional evolutionary T\.ZO models from the literature to determine a fit for T\.ZO lifetime in order to estimate the current number of T\.ZOs in the Galaxy as well as to assess core disruption during the merger.
  Results. We explore the progenitors in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, calculate formation rates, and investigate kinematics of the progenitor stars. We find that the vast majority ($\approx 92\%$) of T\.ZO progenitors in our population have experienced mass transfer and become rejuvenated before their formation event. Using a constant star formation rate we estimate $\approx 2\times 10 ^{-4}$ T\.ZOs per $M_\odot$ in our Galaxy, corresponding to $\approx 5\pm 1$ T\.ZOs in the Milky Way at present.</description>

      <title>Inferring the mass content of galaxy clusters with satellite kinematics and Jeans Anisotropic modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite galaxies can be used to indicate the dynamical mass of galaxy groups and clusters. In this study, we apply the axis-symmetric Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion JAM modeling to satellite galaxies in 28 galaxy clusters selected from the TNG300-1 simulation with halo mass of $\log_{10}M_{200}/M_\odot&gt;14.3$. If using true bound satellites as tracers, the best constrained total mass within the half-mass radius of satellites, $M(&lt;r_\mathrm{half})$, and the virial mass, $M_{200}$, have average biases of -0.01 and $0.03$~dex, with average scatters of 0.11~dex and 0.15~dex. If selecting companions in redshift space with line-of-sight depth of 2,000~km/s, the biases are -0.06 and $0.01$~dex, while the scatters are 0.12 and 0.18~dex for $M(&lt;r_\mathrm{half})$ and $M_{200}$. By comparing the best-fitting and actual density profiles, we find $\sim$29% of best-fitting density profiles show very good agreement with the truth, $\sim$32% display over or under estimates at most of the radial range with biased $M(&lt;r_\mathrm{half})$, and 39% show under/over estimates in central regions and over/under estimates in the outskirts, with good constraints on $M(&lt;r_\mathrm{half})$, yet most of the best constraints are still consistent with the true profiles within 1-$\sigma$ statistical uncertainties for the three circumstances. Using a mock DESI Bright Galaxy Survey catalog with the effect of fiber incompleteness, we find DESI fiber assignments and the choice of flux limits barely modify the velocity dispersion profiles and are thus unlikely to affect the dynamical modeling outcomes. Our results show that with current and future deep spectroscopic surveys, JAM can be a powerful tool to constrain the underlying density profiles of individual massive galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>A multi-wavelength study to decipher the 2017 flare of the blazar OJ 287</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11848v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In February 2017, the blazar OJ~287 underwent a period of intense multiwavelength activity. It reached a new historic peak in the soft X-ray (0.3-10 keV) band, as measured by Swift-XRT. This event coincides with a very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray outburst that led VERITAS to detect emission above 100 GeV, with a detection significance of $10\sigma$ (from 2016 December 9 to 2017 March 31). The time-averaged VHE $\gamma$-ray spectrum was consistent with a soft power law ($\Gamma = -3.81 \pm 0.26$) and an integral flux corresponding to $\sim2.4\%$ that of the Crab Nebula above the same energy. Contemporaneous data from multiple instruments across the electromagnetic spectrum reveal complex flaring behavior, primarily in the soft X-ray and VHE bands. To investigate the possible origin of such an event, our study focuses on three distinct activity states: before, during, and after the February 2017 peak. The spectral energy distributions during these periods suggest the presence of at least two non-thermal emission zones, with the more compact one responsible for the observed flare. Broadband modeling results and observations of a new radio knot in the jet of OJ~287 in 2017 are consistent with a flare originating from a strong recollimation shock outside the radio core.</description>

      <title>PECCARY: A novel approach for characterizing orbital complexity, stochasticity, and regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permutation Entropy and statistiCal Complexity Analysis for astRophysics (PECCARY) is a computationally inexpensive, statistical method by which any time-series can be characterized as predominately regular, complex, or stochastic. Elements of the PECCARY method have been used in a variety of physical, biological, economic, and mathematical scenarios, but have not yet gained traction in the astrophysical community. This study introduces the PECCARY technique with the specific aims to motivate its use in and optimize it for the analysis of astrophysical orbital systems. PECCARY works by decomposing a time-dependent measure, such as the x-coordinate or orbital angular momentum time-series, into ordinal patterns. Due to its unique approach and statistical nature, PECCARY is well-suited for detecting preferred and forbidden patterns (a signature of chaos), even when the chaotic behavior is short-lived or when working with a relatively short duration time-series or small sets of time-series data. A variety of examples are used to demonstrate the capabilities of PECCARY. These include mathematical examples (sine waves, varieties of noise, sums of sine waves, well-known chaotic functions), a double pendulum system, and astrophysical tracer particle simulations with potentials of varying intricacies. Since the adopted timescale used to diagnose a given time-series can affect the outcome, a method is presented to identify an ideal sampling scheme, constrained by the overall duration and the natural timescale of the system. The accompanying PECCARY Python package and its usage are discussed.</description>

      <title>MUSE adaptive-optics spectroscopy confirms dual active galactic nuclei and strongly lensed systems at sub-arcsec separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The novel Gaia Multi Peak (GMP) technique has proven to be able to successfully select dual and lensed AGN candidates at sub-arcsec separations. Both populations are important because dual AGN represent one of the central, still largely untested, predictions of lamdaCDM cosmology, and compact lensed quasars allow to probe the central regions of the lensing galaxies. In this work, we present high spatial resolution spectroscopy of twelve GMP-selected systems. We use the the adaptive-optics assisted integral-field spectrograph MUSE at VLT to resolve each system and study the nature of each component. All the targets reveal the presence of two components confirming the GMP selection. We classify five targets as dual AGN, two as lensed systems, and five as a chance alignment of a star and and AGN. Having separations between 0.30" and 0.86", these dual and lensed systems are, to date, among the most compact ever discovered at z &gt;0.3. This is the largest sample of distant dual AGN with sub-arcsec separations ever presented in a single paper.</description>

      <title>The Disruption of Dark Matter Minihalos by Successive Stellar Encounters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scenarios such as the QCD axion with the Peccei-Quinn symmetry broken after inflation predict an enhanced matter power spectrum on sub-parsec scales. These theories lead to the formation of dense dark matter structures known as minihalos, which provide insights into early Universe dynamics and have implications for direct detection experiments. We examine the mass loss of minihalos during stellar encounters, building on previous studies that derived formulas for mass loss and performed N-body simulations. We propose a new formula for the mass loss that accounts for changes in the minihalo profile after disruption by a passing star. We also investigate the mass loss for multiple stellar encounters. We demonstrate that accurately assessing the mass loss in minihalos due to multiple stellar encounters necessitates considering the alterations in the minihalo's binding energy after each encounter, as overlooking this aspect results in a substantial underestimation of the mass loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The internal structure and abundance of dark matter halos and subhalos are powerful probes of the nature of dark matter. In order to compare observations with dark matter models, accurate theoretical predictions of these quantities are needed. We present a fast and accurate method to describe the tidal evolution of subhalos within their parent halo, based on a semi-analytic approach. We first consider idealized N-body simulations of subhalos within their host halo, using a generalized mass density profile that describes their properties in a variety of dark matter models at infall, including popular warm, cold, and self-interacting ones. Using these simulations we construct tidal "tracks" for the evolution of subhalos based on their conditions at infall. Second, we use the results of these simulations to build semi-analytic models for tidal effects, including stripping and heating and implement them within the code GALACTICUS. Our semi-analytic models can accurately predict the tidal evolution of both cored and cuspy subhalos, including the bound mass and density profiles, providing a powerful and efficient tool for studying the post-infall properties of subhalos in different dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Glimmers in the Cosmic Dawn: A Census of the Youngest Supermassive Black Holes by Photometric Variability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report first results from a deep near infrared campaign with the Hubble Space Telescope to obtain late-epoch images of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF), 10-15 years after the first epoch data were obtained. The main objectives are to search for faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshifts by virtue of their photometric variability, and measure (or constrain) the comoving number density of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), n_{SMBH}, at early times. In this Letter we present an overview of the program and preliminary results concerning eight objects. Three variables are supernovae, two of which are apparently hostless with indeterminable redshifts, although one has previously been recorded at a z\approx 6 object precisely because of its transient nature. Two further objects are clear AGN at z= 2.0 and 3.2, based on morphology and/or infrared spectroscopy from JWST. Three variable targets are identified at z = 6-7, which are also likely AGN candidates. These sources provide a first measure of n_{SMBH} in the reionization epoch by photometric variability, which places a firm lower limit of 3 \times 10^{-4} cMpc^{-3}. After accounting for variability and luminosity incompleteness, we estimate n_{SMBH} \gtrsim 8 \times 10{-3} cMpc{-3}, which is the largest value so far reported at these redshifts. This SMBH abundance is also strikingly similar to estimates of n_{SMBH} in the local Universe. We discuss how these results test various theories for SMBH formation.</description>

Abstract: The supermassive black holes ($M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{6}$$-$$10^{10}~M_\odot$) that power luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs), i.e., quasars, generally show a correlation between thermal disk emission in the ultraviolet (UV) and coronal emission in hard X-rays. In contrast, some "massive" black holes (mBHs; $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{5}$$-$$10^{6}~M_\odot$) in low-mass galaxies present curious X-ray properties with coronal radiative output up to 100$\times$ weaker than expected. To examine this issue, we present a pilot study incorporating Very Large Array radio observations of a sample of 18 high-accretion-rate (Eddington ratios $L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd} &gt; 0.1$), mBH-powered AGNs ($M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{6}~M_\odot$) with Chandra X-ray coverage. Empirical correlations previously revealed in samples of radio-quiet, high-Eddington AGNs indicate that the radio$-$X-ray luminosity ratio, $L_{\rm R}/L_{\rm X}$, is approximately constant. Through multiwavelength analysis, we instead find that the X-ray-weaker mBHs in our sample tend toward larger values of $L_{\rm R}/L_{\rm X}$ even though they remain radio-quiet per their optical$-$UV properties. This trend results in a tentative but highly intriguing correlation between $L_{\rm R}/L_{\rm X}$ and X-ray weakness, which we argue is consistent with a scenario in which X-rays may be preferentially obscured from our line of sight by a "slim" accretion disk. We compare this observation to weak emission-line quasars (AGNs with exceptionally weak broad-line emission and a significant X-ray-weak fraction) and conclude by suggesting that our results may offer a new observational signature for finding high-accretion-rate AGNs.</description>

      <title>Galactic Superbubbles in 3D: Wind Formation and Cloud Shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic superbubbles are triggered by stellar feedback in the discs of star-forming galaxies. They are important in launching galactic winds, which play a key role in regulating the mass and energy exchange in galaxies. Observations can only reveal projected information and the 3D structure of such winds is quite complex. Therefore, numerical simulations are required to further our understanding of such structures. Here, we describe hydrodynamical simulations targeting two spatial scales. Large-scale superbubble models reveal supernova-driven outflows, and their subsequent merging, which leads to galactic wind formation. Additionally, the turbulence parameter $\sigma_t$ not only affects disc formation, but also influences mass and energy characteristics, controlling gas distribution and the injection rate in the simulated star formation zone. Small-scale wind-multicloud models indicate that isolated clouds are susceptible to instabilities, leading to fragmentation and dense gas destruction. In contrast, in closer cloud configurations, the condensation mechanism becomes important owing to hydrodynamic shielding, which helps to maintain the cold material throughout the evolution of the system. These simulations provide a comprehensive picture of galactic winds, showing how large-scale superbubble dynamics create the environment where small-scale wind-multicloud interactions shape the interstellar and circumgalactic media, ultimately regulating galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Probing the strength of radial migration via churning by using metal-rich red giant stars from APOGEE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Making use of the APOGEE DR17 catalogue with high quality data for 143,509 red giant branch stars we explore the strength of different mechanisms that causes a star to radially migrate in the Milky Way stellar disk. At any position in the disk we find stars that are more metal-rich than the local interstellar medium. This is surprising and normally attributed to the migration of these stars after their formation inside their current Galactocentric-radius. Such stars are prime candidates for studying the strength of different migratory processes. We specifically select two types of metal-rich stars: i) super metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] &gt; 0.2) and ii) stars that are more metal-rich than their local environment. For both, we explore the distribution of orbital parameters and ages as evidence of their migration history. We find that most super metal-rich stars have experienced some amount of churning as they have orbits with Rg &gt;= 5 kpc. Furthermore, about half of the super metal-rich stars are on non-circular orbits (ecc &gt; 0.15) and therefore also have experienced blurring. The metallicity of young stars in our sample is generally the same as the metallicity of the interstellar medium, suggesting they have not radially migrated yet. Stars with lower metallicity than the local environment have intermediate to old ages. We further find that super metal-rich stars have approximately the same age distribution at all Galactocentric-radii, which suggests that radial migration is a key mechanism responsible for the chemical compositions of stellar populations in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>ColdSIM predictions of [C II] emission in primordial galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01277v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A powerful tool to probe the gas content at high redshift is the [C II] 158 $\mu$m sub-millimeter emission line, which, due to its low excitation potential and luminous emission, is considered a possible direct tracer of star forming gas. In this work we investigate the origin, evolution and environmental dependencies of [C II] 158 $\mu$m emission line, as well as its expected correlation with stellar mass and star formation activity of the high-redshift galaxies observed by JWST. We use a set of state-of-the-art cold-gas hydrodynamic simulations (ColdSIM) with fully coupled time-dependent atomic and molecular non-equilibrium chemistry and self-consistent [C II] emission from metal enriched gas. We accurately track the evolution of H I, H II and $H_2$ in a cosmological context and predict both global and galaxy-based [C II] properties. For the first time, we predict the cosmic mass density evolution of [C II] and find that it is in good agreement with new measurements at redshift z = 6 from high-resolution optical quasar spectroscopy. We find a correlation between [C II] luminosity, $L_{[C II]}$, and stellar mass, consistent with results from ALMA high-redshift large programs. We predict a redshift evolution in the relation between $L_{[C II]}$ and the star formation rate, SFR, and provide a fit to relate $L_{[C II]}$ to SFR which can be adopted as a more accurate alternative to the currently used linear relation. Our findings provide physical grounds to interpret high-redshift detections in contemporary and future observations, such as the ones performed by ALMA and JWST, and to advance our knowledge on structure formation at early times.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Diffuse Molecular Media with Non-ideal Magnetohydrodynamics and Consistent Thermochemistry: Numerical Simulations and Dynamic Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent diffuse molecular clouds can exhibit complicated morphologies caused by the interactions among radiation, chemistry, fluids, and fields. We performed full 3D simulations for turbulent diffuse molecular interstellar media, featuring time-dependent non-equilibrium thermochemistry co-evolved with magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Simulation results exhibit the relative abundances of key chemical species (e.g., C, CO, OH) vary by more than one order of magnitude for the "premature" epoch of chemical evolution ($t\lesssim 2\times 10^5~{\rm yr}$). Various simulations are also conducted to study the impacts of physical parameters. Non-ideal MHD effects are essential in shaping the behavior of gases, and strong magnetic fields ($\sim 10~\mu{\rm G}$) tend to inhibit vigorous compressions and thus reduce the fraction of warm gases ($T\gtrsim 10^2~{\rm K}$). Thermodynamical and chemical conditions of the gas are sensitive to modulation by dynamic conditions, especially the energy injection by turbulence. Chemical features, including ionization (cosmic ray and diffuse interstellar radiation), would not directly affect the turbulence power spectra. Nonetheless, their effects are prominent in the distribution profiles of temperatures and gas densities. Comprehensive observations are necessary and useful to eliminate the degeneracies of physical parameters and constrain the properties of diffuse molecular clouds with confidence.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-CRISTAL survey: Dust temperature and physical conditions of the interstellar medium in a typical galaxy at z=5.66</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new $\lambda_{\rm rest}=77$ $\mu$m dust continuum observations from the ALMA of HZ10 (CRISTAL-22), a dusty main-sequence galaxy at $z$=5.66 as part of the [CII] Resolved Ism in STar-forming Alma Large program, CRISTAL. The high angular resolution of the ALMA Band 7 and new Band 9 data($\sim{0}''.4$) reveals the complex structure of HZ10, which comprises two main components (HZ10-C and HZ10-W) and a bridge-like dusty emission between them (the Bridge). We model the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) to constrain the physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) and its variations among the different components identified in HZ10. We find that HZ10-W (the more UV-obscured component) has an SED dust temperature of $T_{\rm SED}$$\sim$51.2$\pm13.1$ K; this is $\sim$5 K higher (although still consistent) than that of the central component and previous global estimations for HZ10. Our new ALMA data allow us to reduce by a factor of $\sim$2.3 the uncertainties of global $T_{\rm SED}$ measurements compared to previous studies. Interestingly, HZ10-W shows a lower [CII]/FIR ratio compared to the other two components (although still within the uncertainties), suggesting a harder radiation field destroying polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon associated with [CII] emission (e.g., active galactic nuclei or young stellar populations). While HZ10-C appears to follow the tight IRX-$\beta_{\rm UV}$ relation seen in local UV-selected starburst galaxies and high-$z$ star-forming galaxies, we find that both HZ10-W and the Bridge depart from this relation and are well described by dust-screen models with holes in front of a hard UV radiation field. This suggests that the UV emission (likely from young stellar populations) is strongly attenuated in the more dusty components of the HZ10 system.</description>

      <title>On the statistical theory of self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow: high order kinematic and dynamic relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To better understand the collisionless dark matter flow on different scales, statistical theory involving kinematic and dynamic relations must be developed for different types of flow, e.g. incompressible, constant divergence, and irrotational flow. This paper extends our previous work on the second-order statistics (Phys. Fluids 35, 077105) to high order statistics. Kinematic and dynamic relations were developed for dark matter flow on different scales. The results were validated by N-body simulations. On large scales, we found i) third-order velocity correlations can be related to density correlation or pairwise velocity; ii) the $p$th-order velocity correlations follow $\propto a^{(p+2)/2}$ for odd $p$ and $\propto a^{p/2}$ for even $p$, where $a$ is the scale factor; iii) the overdensity $\delta$ is proportional to density correlation on the same scale; iv) velocity dispersion on a given scale $r$ is proportional to the overdensity on the same scale. On small scales, i) a self-closed velocity evolution is developed by decomposing the velocity into motion in haloes and motion of haloes; ii) the evolution of vorticity and enstrophy are derived from the evolution of velocity; iii) dynamic relations are derived to relate second- and third-order correlations; iv) while the first moment of pairwise velocity follows $\langle\Delta u_L\rangle=-Har$ ($H$ is the Hubble parameter), the third moment follows $\langle(\Delta u_L)^3\rangle\propto\varepsilon_uar$ that can be directly compared with simulations and observations, where $\varepsilon_u\approx10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$ is the constant rate for energy cascade; v) the $p$th order velocity correlations follow $\propto a^{(3p-5)/4}$ for odd $p$ and $\propto a^{3p/4}$ for even $p$. Finally, the combined kinematic and dynamic relations lead to exponential and one-fourth power-law velocity correlations on large and small scales, respectively.</description>

      <title>21cmEMU: an emulator of 21cmFAST summary observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed rapid progress in observations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). These have enabled high-dimensional inference of galaxy and intergalactic medium (IGM) properties during the first billion years of our Universe. However, even using efficient, semi-numerical simulations, traditional inference approaches that compute 3D lightcones on-the-fly can take $10^5$ core hours. Here we present 21cmEMU: an emulator of several summary observables from the popular 21cmFAST simulation code. 21cmEMU takes as input nine parameters characterizing EoR galaxies, and outputs the following summary statistics: (i) the IGM mean neutral fraction; (ii) the 21-cm power spectrum; (iii) the mean 21-cm spin temperature; (iv) the sky-averaged (global) 21-cm signal; (v) the ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions (LFs); and (vi) the Thomson scattering optical depth to the cosmic microwave background (CMB). All observables are predicted with sub-percent median accuracy, with a reduction of the computational cost by a factor of over 10$^4$. After validating inference results, we showcase a few applications, including: (i) quantifying the relative constraining power of different observational datasets; (ii) seeing how recent claims of a late EoR impact previous inferences; and (iii) forecasting upcoming constraints from the sixth observing season of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) telescope. 21cmEMU is publicly-available, and is included as an alternative simulator in the public 21CMMC sampler.</description>

      <title>MUSE spectroscopy of the high abundance discrepancy planetary nebula NGC 6153</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Abridged) The Abundance Discrepancy problem in planetary nebulae (PNe) has long puzzled astronomers. NGC6153, with its high Abundance Discrepancy Factor (ADF~10), provides an opportunity to understand the chemical structure and ionisation processes by constructing detailed emission line maps and examining variations in electron temperature and density. We used the MUSE spectrograph to acquire IFU data covering the wavelength range 4600-9300 \AA\ with a spatial sampling of 0.2 arcsec and spectral resolutions ranging from R = 1600-3500. We created emission line maps for 60 lines and two continuum regions. We developed a tailored methodology for the analysis of the data, including correction for recombination contributions to auroral lines and the contributions of different plasma phases. Our analysis confirmed the presence of a low-temperature plasma component in NGC6153. We find that electron temperatures derived from recombination line/continuum diagnostics are significantly lower than those derived from collisionally excited lines diagnostics. Ionic chemical abundance maps were constructed, considering the weight of the cold plasma phase in the HI emission. Adopting this approach, we found ionic abundances that could be up to 0.2 dex lower for those derived from CELs and up to 1.1 dex higher for those derived from RLs than in the case of an homogeneous HI emission. The Abundance Contrast Factor (ACF) between both plasma components was defined, with values, on average, 0.9 dex higher than the ADF. Different methods for calculating ionisation correction factors (ICFs) yielded consistent results. Our findings emphasize that accurate chemical abundance determinations in high-ADF PNe must account for multiple plasma phases.</description>
