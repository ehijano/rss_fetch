      <title>Jackknife Inference for Fixed Effects Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a general method of inference for fixed effects models which is (i) automatic, (ii) computationally inexpensive, and (iii) highly model agnostic. Specifically, we show how to combine a collection of subsample estimators into a self-normalised jackknife $t$-statistic, from which hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, and $p$-values are readily obtained.</description>

      <title>Incentive-Aware Synthetic Control: Accurate Counterfactual Estimation via Incentivized Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic control methods (SCMs) are a canonical approach used to estimate treatment effects from panel data in the internet economy. We shed light on a frequently overlooked but ubiquitous assumption made in SCMs of "overlap": a treated unit can be written as some combination -- typically, convex or linear -- of the units that remain under control. We show that if units select their own interventions, and there is sufficiently large heterogeneity between units that prefer different interventions, overlap will not hold. We address this issue by proposing a recommender system which incentivizes units with different preferences to take interventions they would not normally consider. Specifically, leveraging tools from information design and online learning, we propose an SCM that incentivizes exploration in panel data settings by providing incentive-compatible intervention recommendations to units. We establish this estimator obtains valid counterfactual estimates without the need for an a priori overlap assumption. We extend our results to the setting of synthetic interventions, where the goal is to produce counterfactual outcomes under all interventions, not just control. Finally, we provide two hypothesis tests for determining whether unit overlap holds for a given panel dataset.</description>

      <title>Continuous time asymptotic representations for adaptive experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article develops a continuous-time asymptotic framework for analyzing adaptive experiments -- settings in which data collection and treatment assignment evolve dynamically in response to incoming information. A key challenge in analyzing fully adaptive experiments, where the assignment policy is updated after each observation, is that the sequence of policy rules often lack a well-defined asymptotic limit. To address this, we focus instead on the empirical allocation process, which captures the fraction of observations assigned to each treatment over time. We show that, under general conditions, any adaptive experiment and its associated empirical allocation process can be approximated by a limit experiment defined by Gaussian diffusions with unknown drifts and a corresponding continuous-time allocation process. This limit representation facilitates the analysis of optimal decision rules by reducing the dimensionality of the state-space and leveraging the tractability of Gaussian diffusions. We apply the framework to derive optimal estimators, analyze in-sample regret for adaptive experiments, and construct e-processes for anytime-valid inference. Notably, we introduce the first definition of any-time and any-experiment valid inference for multi-treatment settings.</description>

      <title>Initial-Condition-Robust Inference in Autoregressive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers confidence intervals (CIs) for the autoregressive (AR) parameter in an AR model with an AR parameter that may be close or equal to one. Existing CIs rely on the assumption of a stationary or fixed initial condition to obtain correct asymptotic coverage and good finite sample coverage. When this assumption fails, their coverage can be quite poor. In this paper, we introduce a new CI for the AR parameter whose coverage probability is completely robust to the initial condition, both asymptotically and in finite samples. This CI pays only a small price in terms of its length when the initial condition is stationary or fixed. The new CI also is robust to conditional heteroskedasticity of the errors.</description>

      <title>Breaking the HISCO Barrier: Automatic Occupational Standardization with OccCANINE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces OccCANINE, an open-source tool that maps occupational descriptions to HISCO codes. Manual coding is slow and error-prone; OccCANINE replaces weeks of work with results in minutes. We fine-tune CANINE on 15.8 million description-code pairs from 29 sources in 13 languages. The model achieves 96 percent accuracy, precision, and recall. We also show that the approach generalizes to three systems - OCC1950, OCCICEM, and ISCO-68 - and release them open source. By breaking the "HISCO barrier," OccCANINE democratizes access to high-quality occupational coding, enabling broader research in economics, economic history, and related disciplines.</description>
