      <title>Latent Spaces for Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of machine learning coarse-grained potentials in molecular dynamics, propagators require that the Hamiltonian is quadratic in momentum, thus limiting the family of coarse-graining functions. In this paper, we derive a general family of coarse-graining embedding functions for which Langevin dynamics can be applied. This has significant implications in molecular simulations, and it paves the way for Langevin dynamics to be run on non-geometric coarse-graining representations such as those given by principal components of time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA) or latent embeddings of molecules obtained from neural networks.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Relaxation Dynamics of Inner-Shell Vacancies in Hydrated Pyrrole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ real-space, real-time time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) combined with Ehrenfest dynamics to investigate ultrafast intermolecular relaxation following inner-valence ionization in hydrated pyrrole. This time-dependent approach treats electronic and nuclear motions simultaneously, allowing the description of electronic excitation, charge transfer, ionization, and nuclear motion.When the initial vacancy in the O 2s 1 state is created on the water molecule, the system predominantly undergoes intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) and electron- transfer mediated decay (ETMD), accompanied by pronounced charge transfer between pyrrole and water. In contrast, ionization of the pyrrole site for N 2s electron leads to both ICD and Auger decay channels. These results demonstrate that the decay dynamics are strongly governed by the initial vacancy location, offering microscopic insight into intermolecular energy-transfer mechanisms in hydrated molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Tripeptide-Dynamics from Empirical and Machine-Learned Energy Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations for tripeptides in the gas phase and in solution using empirical and machine-learned energy functions are presented. For cationic AAA a machine-learned potential energy surface (ML-PES) trained on MP2 reference data yields quantitative agreement with measured splittings of the amide-I vibrations. Experimental spectroscopy in solution reports a splitting of 25 cm-1 which compares with 20 cm-1 from ML/MM-MD simulations of AAA in explicit solvent. For the AMA tripeptide a ML-PES describing both, the zwitterionic and neutral form is trained and used to map out the accessible conformational space. Due to cyclization and H-bonding between the termini in neutral AMA the NH- and OH-stretch spectra are strongly red-shifted below 3000 cm-1. The present work demonstrates that meaningful MD simulations on the nanosecond time scale are feasible and provides insight into experiments.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Simulations of Oxide-Water Interfaces using Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxide-water interfaces govern a wide range of physical and chemical processes fundamental to many fields like catalysis, geochemistry, corrosion, electrochemistry, and sensor technology. Near solid oxide surfaces, water behaves differently than in the bulk, exhibiting pronounced structuring and increased reactivity, typically requiring ab initio-level accuracy for reliable modeling. However, explicit ab initio calculations are often computationally prohibitive, especially if large system sizes and long simulation time scales are required. By learning the potential energy surface (PES) from data obtained from electronic structure calculations, machine learning potentials (MLPs) have emerged as transformative tools, enabling simulations with ab initio accuracy at dramatically reduced computational expense. Here, we provide an overview of recent progress in the application of MLPs to atomistic simulations of oxide-water interfaces. Specifically, we review insights that have been gained into the reactivity of interfacial systems involving the dissociation and recombination of water molecules, proton transfer processes between the solvent and the surface and the dynamic nature of aqueous oxide surfaces. Moreover, we discuss open challenges and future possible research directions in this rapidly evolving but challenging field.</description>

      <title>Ring-polymer instanton theory for tunneling between asymmetric wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instanton theory has arisen as a practical tool for calculating tunneling splittings in molecular systems. Un- fortunately, the original formulation of instanton theory fundamentally breaks down when trying to calculate the level splitting in asymmetric double wells, as there is no imaginary-time periodic orbit connecting the two non-degenerate minima. We have therefore developed a new formulation of instanton theory based on a projected flux correlation function that is applicable to these asymmetric systems. Comparison with exact quantum-mechanical results in one- and two-dimensional models demonstrates that it has a reasonably high accuracy, similar to that reported for instanton theory in the symmetric case. The theory is then applied to study tunneling between non-degenerate minima in the biomolecule $\alpha$-fenchol, for which we find good agree- ment with experiment. Finally, we use the connection to instanton rate theory, which is also derived from flux correlation functions, to discuss the often misunderstood relationship between tunneling splittings and reaction rate constants.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation of Noisy Force Labels for Improved Coarse-Grained Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an integral tool for studying the atomistic behavior of materials under diverse conditions. However, they can be computationally demanding in wall-clock time, especially for large systems, which limits the time and length scales accessible. Coarse-grained (CG) models reduce computational expense by grouping atoms into simplified representations commonly termed beads, but sacrifice atomic detail and introduce mapping noise, complicating the training of machine-learned surrogates. Moreover, because CG models inherently include entropic contributions, they cannot be fit directly to all-atom energies, leaving instantaneous, noisy forces as the only state-specific quantities available for training. Here, we apply a knowledge distillation framework by first training an initial CG neural network potential (the teacher) solely on CG-mapped forces to denoise those labels, then distill its force and energy predictions to train refined CG models (the student) in both single- and ensemble-training setups while exploring different force and energy target combinations. We validate this framework on a complex molecular fluid - a deep eutectic solvent - by evaluating two-, three-, and many-body properties and compare the CG and all-atom results. Our findings demonstrate that training a student model on ensemble teacher-predicted forces and per-bead energies improves the quality and stability of CG force fields.</description>

      <title>Orbital Optimization and Neural-Network-Assisted Configuration Interaction Calculations of Rydberg States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg excited states of molecules pose a challenge for electronic structure calculations because of their highly diffuse electron distribution. Even large and elaborate atomic basis sets tend to underrepresent the long-range tail, overly confining the Rydberg state. An approach is presented where the molecular orbitals are variationally optimized for the excited state using a plane wave basis set in Hartree-Fock calculations, followed by configuration interaction calculations on the resulting reference. Using excited state optimized plane wave orbitals greatly enhances the convergence of the many-body calculation, as illustrated by a full configuration interaction calculation of the 2s Rydberg state of H$_2$. A neural-network-based selective configuration interaction approach is then applied to calculations of the 3s, 3p$_x$ and 3p$_y$ states of H$_2$O and the 3s and 3p$_z$ states of NH$_3$. The obtained values of excitation energy are in close agreement with experimental measurements as well as previous many-body calculations based on sufficiently diffuse atomic basis sets. Previously reported high-level calculations limited to atomic basis sets lacking extra diffuse functions, such as aug-cc-pVTZ, give significantly higher estimates due to confinement of the Rydberg states.</description>

      <title>Study of arbitrarily low shear rate rheology using dissipative particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation to study the rheology of fluids under shear has always been of great interest to the research community. Despite being a powerful tool, a limitation of DPD is the need to use high shear rates to obtain viscosity results with a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This often leads to simulations with unrealistically large deformations that do not reflect typical stress conditions on the fluid. In this work, the transient time correlation function (TTCF) technique is used for a simple Newtonian DPD fluid to achieve high SNR results even at arbitrarily low shear rates. The applicability of the TTCF on DPD systems is assessed, and the modifications required by the nature of the DPD force field are discussed. The results showed that the standard error (SE) of viscosity values obtained with TTCF is consistently lower than that of the classic averaging procedure across all tested shear rates. Moreover, the SE resulted proportional to the shear rate, leading to a constant SNR that does not decrease at lower shear rates. Additionally, the effect of trajectory mapping on DPD is studied, and a TTCF approach that does not require mappings is consolidated. Remarkably, the absence of mappings has not reduced the precision of the method compared with the more common mapped approach.</description>

      <title>Tailored heat treatments to characterise the fracture resistance of critical weld regions in hydrogen transmission pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new protocol is presented to directly characterise the toughness of microstructural regions present within the weld heat-affected zone (HAZ), the most vulnerable location governing the structural integrity of hydrogen transport pipelines. Heat treatments are tailored to obtain bulk specimens that replicate predominantly ferritic-bainitic, bainitic, and martensitic microstructures present in the HAZ. These are applied to a range of pipeline steels to investigate the role of manufacturing era (vintage versus modern), chemical composition, and grade. The heat treatments successfully reproduce the hardness levels and microstructures observed in the HAZ of existing natural gas pipelines. Subsequently, fracture experiments are conducted in air and pure H2 at 100 bar, revealing a reduced fracture resistance and higher hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of the HAZ microstructures, with initiation toughness values as low as 32 MPa$\sqrt{\text{m}}$. The findings emphasise the need to adequately consider the influence of microstructure and hard, brittle zones within the HAZ.</description>

      <title>Reducing Weighted Ensemble Variance With Optimal Trajectory Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weighted ensemble (WE) is an enhanced path-sampling method that is conceptually simple, widely applicable, and statistically exact. In a WE simulation, an ensemble of trajectories is periodically pruned or replicated to enhance sampling of rare transitions and improve estimation of mean first passage times (MFPTs). However, poor choices of the parameters governing pruning and replication can lead to high-variance MFPT estimates. Our previous work [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 014108 (2023)] presented an optimal WE parameterization strategy and applied it in low-dimensional example systems. The strategy harnesses estimated local MFPTs from different initial configurations to a single target state. In the present work, we apply the optimal parameterization strategy to more challenging, high-dimensional molecular models, namely, synthetic molecular dynamics (MD) models of Trp-cage folding and unfolding, as well as atomistic MD models of NTL9 folding in high-friction and low-friction continuum solvents. In each system we use WE to estimate the MFPT for folding or unfolding events. We show that the optimal parameterization reduces the variance of MFPT estimates in three of four systems, with dramatic improvement in the most challenging atomistic system. Overall, the parameterization strategy improves the accuracy and reliability of WE estimates for the kinetics of biophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learned Potentials for Solvation Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solvent environments play a central role in determining molecular structure, energetics, reactivity, and interfacial phenomena. However, modeling solvation from first principles remains difficult due to the complex interplay of interactions and unfavorable computational scaling of first-principles treatment with system size. Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have recently emerged as efficient surrogates for quantum chemistry methods, offering first-principles accuracy at greatly reduced computational cost. MLPs approximate the underlying potential energy surface, enabling efficient computation of energies and forces in solvated systems, and are capable of accounting for effects such as hydrogen bonding, long-range polarization, and conformational changes. This review surveys the development and application of MLPs in solvation modeling. We summarize the theoretical basis of MLP-based energy and force predictions and present a classification of MLPs based on training targets, model types, and design choices related to architectures, descriptors, and training protocols. Integration into established solvation workflows is discussed, with case studies spanning small molecules, interfaces, and reactive systems. We conclude by outlining open challenges and future directions toward transferable, robust, and physically grounded MLPs for solvation-aware atomistic modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the combination of molecular chirality and phase-controlled driving can lead to rectification of vibrational energy transfer. We demonstrate this effect using classical models of (1) a single helical chain and (2) a more realistic model of polyethylene double helix. We examine the effect of the driving frequency, polarization, and temperature on this phenomenon. Notably, we find that the direction and magnitude of the observed directionality preference depend on the driving frequency and phase, and that the effect persists at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Generalized spheroidal wave equation for real and complex valued parameters. An algorithm based on the analytic derivatives for the eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for the computation of eigenvalues of the generalized spheroidal wave equations. The novelty of the present method is in the use of the analytical derivatives of the eigenvalues to minimize losses in accuracy. The derivatives are constructed in the form of three-term recurrent relations within the method of continued fractions associated with the corresponding spheroidal wave equation. Very accurate results for the eigenvalues are obtained for a wide range of the parameters of the problem. As an illustrative example, the electronic energies and the separation constants are computed for various electronic states and geometries of selected ($\rm{H}_2^{+}$, $\rm{HeH}^{2+}$, and $\rm{BH}^{5+}$) quasimolecular systems. The computations for high lying ${}^{2}\Sigma$ electronic states of $\rm{H}_2^{+}$ up to very large internuclear separations ($ \leq 1.7 \times 10^5$ au) are presented. Also presented the computations for the eigenvalues of the generalized spheroidal wave equations with complex valued parameters. The agreement between the obtained results and the results of other authors is discussed.</description>

      <title>Scaling up the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explicitly correlated methods, such as the transcorrelated method which shifts a Jastrow or Gutzwiller correlator from the wave function to the Hamiltonian, are designed for high-accuracy calculations of electronic structures, but their application to larger systems has been hampered by the computational cost. We develop improved techniques for the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), in which the ground state of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is represented as a matrix product state (MPS), and demonstrate large-scale calculations of the ground-state energy of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. Our developments stem from three technical inventions: (i) constructing matrix product operators (MPO) of transcorrelated Hamiltonians with low bond dimension and high sparsity, (ii) exploiting the entanglement structure of the ground states to increase the accuracy of the MPS representation, and (iii) optimizing the non-linear parameter of the Gutzwiller correlator to mitigate the non-variational nature of the transcorrelated method. We examine systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ lattice sites, four times larger than previous transcorrelated DMRG studies, and demonstrate that transcorrelated DMRG yields significant improvements over standard non-transcorrelated DMRG for equivalent computational effort. Transcorrelated DMRG reduces the error of the ground state energy by $3\times$-$17 \times$, with the smallest improvement seen for a small system at half-filling and the largest improvement in a dilute closed-shell system.</description>

      <title>The dawn of alchemical free-energy methods in biomolecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04917</link>

Abstract: From the onset of fundamental statistical mechanical constructs formulated in the late 19th century, alchemical free-energy methods slowly emerged and transitioned to become operational tools of biomolecular simulation applicable to a wide range of problems including protein-ligand binding for drug discovery research. This article reconstructs how statistical mechanical approaches such as thermodynamic integration and free-energy perturbation were reconfigured in the early 1980's to address the complexities of increasingly heterogeneous biomolecular systems. Drawing on oral history interviews and primary literature, the study examines the technical, institutional, theoretical, and infrastructural conditions under which these methods were implemented, and became progressively operational. These conditions encompassed the consolidation of lab-specific software infrastructures, the formulation of practical simulation protocols, as well as essential statistical mechanical clarifications. From this perspective, the progress of free-energy methods proceeded less from a unified convergence than from an iterative troubleshooting process of alignment involving practical and theoretical considerations. The aim of the present article is to offer a historically grounded account of how free-energy techniques acquired practical and functional reliability.</description>
