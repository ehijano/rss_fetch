      <title>Multiplicative Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman operators are infinite-dimensional operators that linearize nonlinear dynamical systems, facilitating the study of their spectral properties and enabling the prediction of the time evolution of observable quantities. Recent methods have aimed to approximate Koopman operators while preserving key structures. However, approximating Koopman operators typically requires a dictionary of observables to capture the system's behavior in a finite-dimensional subspace. The selection of these functions is often heuristic, may result in the loss of spectral information, and can severely complicate structure preservation. This paper introduces Multiplicative Dynamic Mode Decomposition (MultDMD), which enforces the multiplicative structure inherent in the Koopman operator within its finite-dimensional approximation. Leveraging this multiplicative property, we guide the selection of observables and define a constrained optimization problem for the matrix approximation, which can be efficiently solved. MultDMD presents a structured approach to finite-dimensional approximations and can more accurately reflect the spectral properties of the Koopman operator. We elaborate on the theoretical framework of MultDMD, detailing its formulation, optimization strategy, and convergence properties. The efficacy of MultDMD is demonstrated through several examples, including the nonlinear pendulum, the Lorenz system, and fluid dynamics data, where we demonstrate its remarkable robustness to noise.</description>

Abstract: A holomorphic pre-foliation $\mathscr{F}=\mathcal{C}\boxtimes\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ is the data of a reduced complex projective curve $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ and a holomorphic foliation $\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$. When the foliation $\mathcal{F}$ is convex and the curve $\mathcal{C}$ is invariant by $\mathcal{F}$, we speak of convex pre-foliation. In a previous paper, we showed that if a foliation $\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ is reduced convex or homogeneous convex and if $\mathcal{C}$ is an invariant line of $\mathcal{F}$, then the dual web of the convex pre-foliation $\mathcal{C}\boxtimes\mathcal{F}$ is flat. In this paper, we propose to extend this result to the case of a curve $\mathcal{C}$ consisting of several invariant lines.</description>

      <title>Topological bifurcations in a mean-field game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean-field games (MFG) provide a statistical physics inspired modeling framework for decision making in large-populations of strategic, non-cooperative agents. Mathematically, these systems consist of a forward-backward in time system of two coupled nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), namely the Fokker-Plank and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, governing the agent state and control distribution, respectively. In this work, we study a finite-time MFG with a rich global bifurcation structure using a reduced-order model (ROM). The ROM is a 4D two-point boundary value problem obtained by restricting the controlled dynamics to first two moments of the agent state distribution, i.e., the mean and the variance. Phase space analysis of the ROM reveals that the invariant manifolds of periodic orbits around the so-called `ergodic MFG equilibrium' play a crucial role in determining the bifurcation diagram, and impart a topological signature to various solution branches. We show a qualitative agreement of these results with numerical solutions of the full-order MFG PDE system.</description>

      <title>Periodic Solutions in a Simple Delay Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simple form scalar differential equation with delay and nonlinear negative periodic feedback is considered. The existence of several types of slowly oscillating periodic solutions is shown with the same and double periods of the feedback coefficient. The periodic solutions are built explicitly in the case of piecewise constant nonlinearities involved. The periodic dynamics are shown to persist under small perturbations of the equation which make it smooth. The theoretical results are verified by extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a multilink wheeled vehicle: partial solutions and unbounded speedup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical model featuring the motion of a multilink wheeled vehicle is developed using a nonholonomic model. A detailed analysis of the inertial motion is made. Fixed points of the reduced system are identified, their stability is analyzed, and invariant manifolds are found. For the case of three platforms (links), a phase portrait for motion on an invariant manifold is shown and trajectories of the attachment points of the wheel pairs of the three-link vehicle are presented. In addition, an analysis is made of motion in the case where the leading platform has a rotor whose angular velocity is a periodic function of time. The existence of trajectories for which one of the velocity components increases without bound is established, and the asymptotics for it is found.</description>

      <title>The Riemann hypothesis and dynamics of Backtracking New Q-Newton's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new variant of Newton's method - named Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (BNQN) - was recently introduced by the second author. This method has good convergence guarantees, specially concerning finding roots of meromorphic functions. This paper explores using BNQN for the Riemann xi function. We show in particular that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to that all attractors of BNQN lie on the critical line. We also explain how an apparent relation between the basins of attraction of BNQN and Voronoi's diagram can be helpful for verifying the Riemann hypothesis or finding a counterexample to it. Some illustrating experimental results are included, which convey some interesting phenomena. The experiments show that BNQN works very stably with highly transcendental functions like the Riemann xi function and its derivatives. Based on insights from the experiments, we discuss some concrete steps on using BNQN towards the Riemann hypothesis. Ideas and results from this paper can be extended to other zeta functions.</description>

      <title>Uniformly global observables for 1D maps with an indifferent fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the property of global-local mixing for full-branched expanding maps of either the half-line or the interval, with one indifferent fixed point. Global-local mixing expresses the decorrelation of global vs local observables w.r.t. to an infinite measure $\mu$. Global observables are essentially bounded functions admitting an infinite-volume average, i.e., a limit for the average of the function over bigger and bigger intervals; local observables are integrable functions (both notions are relative to $\mu$). Of course, the definition of global observable depends on the exact definition of infinite-volume average. The first choice for it would be to consider averages over the entire space minus a neighborhood of the indifferent fixed point (a.k.a. the "point at infinity"), in the limit where such neighborhood vanishes. This is the choice that was made in previous papers on the subject. The classes of systems for which global-local mixing was proved, with this natural choice of global observables, are ample but not really general. In this paper we consider uniformly global observables, i.e., $L^\infty$ functions whose averages over any interval $V$ converges to a limit, uniformly as $\mu(V) \to \infty$. Uniformly global observables form quite an extensive subclass of all global observables. We prove global-local mixing in the sense of uniformly global observables, for two truly general classes of expanding maps with one indifferent fixed point, respectively on $\mathbb{R}_0^+$ and on $(0,1]$. The technical core of the proofs is rather different from previous work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compare quasi graphs and generalized $\sin(1/x)$-type continua - two classes that generalize topological graphs and contain the Warsaw circle as a non-trivial element. We show that neither class is the subset of the other, provide the characterization and present illustrative examples. We unify both approaches by considering the class of tranched graphs, connect it with objects found in literature and describe how the topological structure of its elements restricts possible dynamics.</description>

      <title>Parameter identification for an uncertain reaction-diffusion equation via setpoint regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of estimating the reaction coefficient of a system governed by a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation is tackled. An estimator relying on boundary measurements only is proposed. The estimator is based upon a setpoint regulation strategy and leads to an asymptotically converging estimate of the unknown reaction coefficient. The proposed estimator is combined with a state observer and shown to provide an asymptotic estimate of the actual system state. A numerical example supports and illustrates the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Efficient numerical computation of spiral spectra with exponentially-weighted preconditioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of nonlinear waves on spatially extended domains is commonly probed by computing the spectrum of the linearization of the underlying PDE about the wave profile. It is known that convective transport, whether driven by the nonlinear pattern itself or an underlying fluid flow, can cause exponential growth of the resolvent of the linearization as a function of the domain length. In particular, sparse eigenvalue algorithms may result in inaccurate and spurious spectra in the convective regime. In this work, we focus on spiral waves, which arise in many natural processes and which exhibit convective transport. We prove that exponential weights can serve as effective, inexpensive preconditioners that result in resolvents that are uniformly bounded in the domain size and that stabilize numerical spectral computations. We also show that the optimal exponential rates can be computed reliably from a simpler asymptotic problem posed in one space dimension.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal model reduction of linear systems with multiple quadratic outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal model reduction of dynamical systems that are linear in the state equation and up to quadratic nonlinearity in the output equation. As our primary theoretical contributions, we derive gradients of the squared $\mathcal{H}_2$ system error with respect to the reduced model quantities and, from the stationary points of these gradients, introduce Gramian-based first-order necessary conditions for the $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal approximation of a linear quadratic output (LQO) system. The resulting $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimality framework neatly generalizes the analogous Gramian-based optimality framework for purely linear systems. Computationally, we show how to enforce the necessary optimality conditions using Petrov-Galerkin projection; the corresponding projection matrices are obtained from a pair of Sylvester equations. Based on this result, we propose an iteratively corrected algorithm for the $\mathcal{H}_2$ model reduction of LQO systems, which we refer to as LQO-TSIA (linear quadratic output two-sided iteration algorithm). Numerical examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed computational method against other existing approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the set of Julia limiting directions of a transcendental-type $K$-quasiregular mapping $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^n$ must contain a component of a certain size, depending on the dimension $n$, the maximal dilatation $K$, and the order of growth of $f$. In particular, we show that if the order of growth is small enough, then every direction is a Julia limiting direction. We also show that if every component of the set of Julia limiting directions is a point, then $f$ has infinite order. The main tool in proving these results is a new version of a Phragm\'en-Lindel\"of principle for sub-$F$-extremals in sectors, where we allow for boundary growth of the form $O( \log |x| )$ instead of the previously considered $O(1)$ bound.</description>

      <title>On description of blow-up behavior for ODEs with normally hyperbolic nature in dynamics at infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe blow-up behavior for ODEs by means of dynamics at infinity with complex asymptotic behavior in autonomous systems, as well as in nonautonomous systems. Based on preceding studies, a variant of closed embeddings of phase spaces and the time-scale transformation determined by the structure of vector fields at infinity reduce our description of blow-ups to unravel the shadowing property of (pre)compact trajectories on the horizon, the geometric object expressing the infinity, with the specific convergence rates. Geometrically, this description is organized by asymptotic phase of invariant sets on the horizon. Blow-up solutions in nonautonomous systems can be described in a similar way. As a corollary, normally, or partially hyperbolic invariant manifolds on the horizon possessing asymptotic phase are shown to induce blow-ups.</description>

      <title>Compactness of Marked Length Isospectral Sets of Birkhoff Billiard Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that equivalence classes of marked length isospectral Birkhoff billiard tables are compact in the $C^\infty$ topology, analogous to the Laplace spectral results of Melrose, Osgood, Phillips and Sarnak. To do so, we derive a hierarchical structure for the integral invariants of Marvizi and Melrose, or equivalently the coefficients of a caustic length-Lazutkin parameter expansion, which are in turn algebraically equivalent to the Taylor coefficients of Mather's $\beta$ function (also called the mean minimal action). Under a generically satisfied noncoincidence condition, these are also Laplace spectral invariants and can be used to hear the shape of certain drumheads. As a byproduct, we obtain an independent proof of the compactness of Laplace isospectral sets for strictly convex planar billiard tables. The proof of the structure theorem uses an interpolating Hamiltonian for nearly glancing billiard orbits and some analytic number theory to compute its Taylor coefficients.</description>

      <title>Drift estimation in stochastic flows using kernel integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stochastic differential equation (SDE) describes a motion in which a particle is governed simultaneously by the direction provided by a vector field / drift, and the scattering effects of white noise. The resulting motion can only be described as a random process instead of a solution curve. Due to the non-deterministic nature of this motion, the task of determining the drift from data is quite challenging, since the data does not directly represent the directional information of the flow. This paper describes an interpretation of vector field as a conditional expectation, which makes its estimation feasible via kernel-integral methods. It presents a numerical procedure based on kernel integral operators, that computes this expectation. In addition, some techniques are presented which can overcome the challenge of dimensionality if the SDE's carry some structure enabling sparsity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by Furstenberg's Theorem on sets in the circle invariant under multiplication by a non-lacunary semigroup, we define a general class of dynamical systems possessing similar topological dynamical properties. We call such systems chaotic almost minimal, reflecting that these systems are chaotic, but in some sense are close to minimal. We study properties of the acting group needed to admit such an action, and show the existence of a chaotic almost minimal $\mathbb{Z}$-action. We show there exists chaotic almost minimal $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$-actions which support multiple distinct nonatomic ergodic probability measures.</description>
