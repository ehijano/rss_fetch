      <title>The metaplectic semigroup and its applications to time-frequency analysis and evolution operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systematic analysis of the metaplectic semigroup $\mathrm{Mp}_+(d,\mathbb{C})$ associated with positive complex symplectic matrices, a notion introduced almost simultaneously and independently by H\"ormander, Brunet, Kramer, and Howe, thereby extending the classical metaplectic theory beyond the unitary setting.
  While the existing literature has largely focused on propagators of quadratic evolution equations, for which results are typically obtained via Mehler formulas, our approach is operator-theoretic and symplectic in spirit and adapts techniques from the standard metaplectic group $\mathrm{Mp}(d,\mathbb{R})$ to a substantially broader framework that is not driven by differential problems or particular propagators.
  This point of view provides deeper insight into the structure of the metaplectic semigroup, and allows us to investigate its generators, polar decomposition, and intertwining relations with complex conjugation and with the Wigner distribution. We then exploit these structural results to characterize, from a metaplectic perspective, classes of time-frequency representations satisfying prescribed structural properties. Finally, we discuss further implications for parabolic equations with complex quadratic Hamiltonians, we study the boundedness of their propagators on modulation spaces, we obtain estimates in time of their operator norms. Finally, we apply our theory to the study of propagation of Wigner singularities.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Analytical Heat Transfer Model for Enhanced Geothermal Systems: Capturing Fracture Interactions and Correcting Classical Optimistic Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical analytical heat transfer models play a critical role in geothermal design and feasibility studies. Classical solutions, such as those proposed by Gringarten et al. 1975, rely on simplified assumptions and systematically overestimate thermal performance, which can lead to unrealistic engineering decisions.
  This study presents a generalized analytical model for enhanced geothermal systems that explicitly captures thermal interactions between fractures while preserving analytical tractability.
  The formulation is based on Green\'s functions and reproduces realistic thermal behavior under conditions representative of fractured geothermal reservoirs. The resulting solution is computationally efficient and sufficiently simple to be implemented directly in standard spreadsheets, without requiring Laplace space transformations or numerical inversion algorithms.
  The model is validated against numerical simulations performed using CMG STARS and Volsung software, showing close agreement in temperature evolution, including the effects of interacting fractures. Compared with classical analytical approaches, the proposed model corrects optimistic bias and provides more reliable predictions of production temperature and energy recovery.
  These results have direct implications for geothermal feasibility studies, well design, and power forecasting, effectively bridging the gap between legacy analytical models and numerical or commercial engineering tools. Building on the analytical framework originally introduced by Gringarten et al. 1975, the proposed formulation generalizes classical heat transfer solutions to account for fracture interaction while retaining analytical simplicity and practical applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem for the Hardy parabolic equation with general nonlinearity and establish the local existence and nonexistence results. Our results provide the optimal integrability conditions on initial function for the existence of a local-in-time nonnegative solution. The proof of the existence result is based on the supersolution method.</description>

      <title>Transmission and Reflection coefficients for Schr\"odinger Operators with Truncated Periodic Potentials that support defect states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider scattering waves through truncated periodic potentials with perturbations that support localized gap eigenstates. In a small complex neighborhood around an assumed positive bound state of the model operator, we prove the existence of a distinct zero reflection state, or transmission resonance. We compare its location to a previously found scattering resonance and use the properties of solutions near these interesting points to analyze the behavior of transmission and reflection coefficients of scattering solutions near the assumed bound state. By example, we also discuss the truncated simple harmonic oscillator and compare the analysis to the crystalline case.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties and bound states of the Dirac equation on periodic quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nonlinear Dirac equations on a periodic quantum graph $G$ and develop a variational approach to the existence and multiplicity of bound states. After introducing the Dirac operator on $G$ with a $\mathbb Z^{d}$-periodic potential, we describe its spectral decomposition and work in the natural energy space. Under asymptotically linear or superquadratic assumptions on the nonlinearity, we establish the required linking geometry and a Cerami-type compactness property modulo $\mathbb Z^{d}$-translations. As a consequence, we prove the existence of at least one bound state and, when the nonlinearity is even, infinitely many geometrically distinct bound states.</description>

      <title>Weighted estimates for Hodge-Maxwell systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish up to the boundary regularity estimates in weighted $L^{p}$ spaces with Muckenhoupt weights $A_{p}$ for weak solutions to the Hodge systems
  \begin{align*}
  d^{\ast}\left(Ad\omega\right) + B^{\intercal}dd^{\ast}\left(B\omega\right) = \lambda B\omega + f \quad \text{ in } \Omega
  \end{align*}
  with either $\nu \wedge \omega $ and $\nu \wedge d^{\ast}\left(B\omega\right)$ or $\nu \lrcorner B\omega$ and $\nu \lrcorner Ad\omega$ prescribed on $\partial\Omega.$ As a consequence, we prove the solvability of Hodge-Maxwell systems and derive Hodge decomposition theorems in weighted Lebesgue spaces. Our proof avoids potential theory, does not rely on representation formulas and instead uses decay estimates in the spirit of `Campanato method' to establish weighted $L^{p}$ estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the spectral properties of two classes of elliptic problems characterized by mixed Steklov-Robin boundary conditions. Our main objective is to prove that, for a generic domain, all the eigenvalues are simple. This result is established by employing domain perturbation techniques and analyzing the transversality of the associated operators.</description>

      <title>Unconditional well-posedness of the master equation for monotone mean field games of controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the first unconditional well-posedness result for the master equation associated with a general class of mean field games of controls. Our analysis covers games with displacement monotone or Lasry--Lions monotone data, as well as those with a small time horizon. By unconditional, we mean that all assumptions are imposed solely at the level of the Lagrangian and the terminal cost. In particular, we do not require any a priori regularity or structural assumptions on the additional fixed-point mappings arising from the control interactions; instead we show that these fixed-point mappings are well-behaved as a consequence of the regularity and the monotonicity of the data. Our approach is bottom-up in nature, unlike most previous results which rely on a generalized method of characteristics. In particular, we build a classical solution of the master equation by showing that the solutions of the corresponding $N$-player Nash systems are compact, in an appropriate sense, and that their subsequential limit points must be solutions to the master equation. Compactness is obtained via uniform-in-$N$ decay estimates for derivatives of the $N$-player value functions. The underlying games are driven by non-degenerate idiosyncratic Brownian noise, and our results allow for the presence of common noise with constant intensity.</description>

      <title>Existence of a solution of the TV Wasserstein gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the flat torus in any dimension we prove existence of a solution to the TV Wasserstein gradient flow equation, only assuming that the initial density $\rho_0$ is bounded from below and above by strictly positive constants. This solution preserves upper and lower bounds of the densities, and shows a certain decay of the BV norm (of the order of $t^{-1/3}$ for $t\to 0$ -- if $\rho_0\notin BV$, otherwise the BV norm is of course bounded -- and of the order of $t^{-1}$ as $t\to\infty$). This generalizes a previous result by Carlier and Poon, who only gave a full proof in one dimension of space and did not consider the case $\rho_0\notin BV$.
  The main tool consists in considering an approximated TV-JKO scheme which artificially imposes a lower bound on the density and allows to find a continuous-in-time solution regular enough to prove that the lower bounds of the initial datum propagates in time, and study on this approximated equation the decay of the BV norm.</description>

      <title>Global Well-posedness of Strong Solutions to the Cauchy Problem of 2D Nonhomogeneous Navier-Stokes Equations with Density-Dependent Viscosity and Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the Cauchy problem for the modified two-dimensional (2D) nonhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with density-dependent viscosity. By fully using the structure of the system, we can obtain the key estimates of $\|\nabla \rho\|_{L_t^\infty L_x^q},q&gt;2$ without any smallness asuumption on the initial data, and thus establish the global existence of the strong solutions with the far-field density being either vacuum or nonvacuum. Notably, the initial data can be arbitrarily large and the initial density is allowed to vanish. Furthermore, the large-time asymptotic behavior of the gradients of the velocity and the pressure is also established.</description>

      <title>Local Well-posedness and Blow-up for the Restricted Fourth-Order Prandtl Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove local well-posedness and finite-time blow-up for a restricted fourth-order Prandtl equation posed on the half-line with clamped boundary conditions. The equation arises from a two-dimensional fourth-order Prandtl system via an ansatz reduction, and its nonlinearity involves a nonlocal integral term. To close a Duhamel fixed-point argument, we need uniform $L^1$ bounds for the associated half-line biharmonic heat kernel. We establish uniform $L^1$ estimates for the kernel and its derivatives, and we show that the semigroup preserves spatial regularity under appropriate compatibility conditions, using an alternative representation derived by integration by parts. These kernel estimates yield local existence and uniqueness for the restricted model and allow us to construct solutions that blow-up in finite time.</description>

      <title>Instability of two-dimensional Taylor-Green Vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a wide class of linear Hamiltonian operators we develop a general criterion that characterizes the unstable eigenvalues as the zeros of a holomorphic function given by the determinant of a finite-dimensional matrix. We apply the latter result to prove the spectral instability of the Taylor-Green vortex in two-dimensional ideal fluids. The linearized Euler operator at this steady state possesses different invariant subspaces, within which we apply our criterion to rule out or detect instabilities. We show linear stability of odd perturbations, for which the unstable spectrum can appear only on the real axis. We exclude this possibility by applying our stability criterion. Real instabilities, instead, exist and can be detected with the same criterion if we consider suitable rescalings of the Taylor-Green vortex. In the subspace of functions even in both variables, the problem is reduced to finding a single complex root of our stability function. We successfully locate this value by combining our general criterion with a rigorous computer-assisted argument. As a consequence, we fully characterize the unstable spectrum of the Taylor-Green vortex.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation with magnetic potential on metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we shall investigate the Nonlinear Magnetic Schr\"odinger Equation on noncompact metric graphs, focusing on the existence of ground states. We prove that the magnetic Hamiltonian is variationally equivalent to a non-magnetic operator with additional repulsive potentials supported on the graph's cycles. This effective potential is strictly determined by the Aharonov-Bohm flux through the topological loops. Leveraging this reduction, we extend classical existence criteria to the magnetic setting. As a key application, we characterize the ground state structure on the tadpole graph, revealing a mass-dependent phase transition. The ground states exist for sufficiently small repulsion in an intermediate regime of masses while sufficiently strong flux prevents the formation of ground states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to establish well-posedness properties for hyperbolic PDEs on Fourier Lebesgue spaces. We consider hyperbolic operators with complex characteristics. Since our approach comes from harmonic analysis, we establish boundedness properties of Fourier integral operators with complex-valued phase functions on Fourier Lebesgue spaces, Besov spaces and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. Indeed, these classes of operators serve as propagators of the considered PDE problems. In terms of the boundedness properties, we prove new results in the case where the canonical relation of the operator is assumed to satisfy the {\it spatial smooth factorization condition}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish $\mathrm{W}^{1,1}$-regularity and higher gradient integrability for relaxed minimizers of convex integral functionals on $\mathrm{BV}$. Unlike classical examples such as the minimal surface integrand, we only require linear growth from below but not necessarily from above. This typically comes with a non-uniformly degenerate elliptic behaviour, for which our results extend the presently available bounds from the superlinear growth case in a sharp way.</description>

      <title>Sharp thresholds for Escobar and Gagliardo-Nirenberg functionals: the Escobar-Willmore mass, geometric selection, and compactness trichotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified quantitative framework for sharp threshold phenomena in boundary-critical variational problems on compact Riemannian manifolds, covering the Escobar quotient and Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities. Via transfer-stability-reduction, we obtain attainment-versus-bubbling alternatives, $H^1$-compactness, and finite-dimensional reductions. Geometric selection is governed by mean curvature $H_g$ and a Willmore-type anisotropy from $|\mathring{\mathrm{II}}|^2$.
  At hemisphere threshold $S_\ast=C^*_{\mathrm{Esc}}(\mathbb S^n_+)$ for $n\ge5$ on $H_g\equiv0$, we identify a renormalized boundary mass $\mathfrak R_g=\kappa_1(n)\,\mathrm{Ric}_g(\nu,\nu)+\kappa_2(n)\,\mathrm{Scal}_{g|\partial M}+\kappa_3(n)\,|\mathring{\mathrm{II}}|^2$, $\kappa_3(n)&lt;0$, yielding one-bubble expansions and energy-only estimators. Threshold dichotomy: if the first nonvanishing coefficient among $\{\rho_n^{\mathrm{conf}}H_g,\mathfrak R_g,\Theta_g\}$ is negative somewhere, then $C^*_{\mathrm{Esc}}(M,g)&lt;S_\ast$ and sequences are precompact. At threshold, blow-up concentrates where $H_g$ is critical; on $H_g\equiv0$, stationarity forces $\mathfrak R_g(p)=\nabla_\partial\mathfrak R_g(p)=0$. If $H_g$ is Morse and $\mathfrak R_g&gt;0$ at all critical points, no bubbling occurs. In multi-bubble regime ($n\ge5$), dynamics governed by $\mathcal W_k=\sum_{i=1}^k\mathfrak R_g(x_i)$ produce $k$-bubble critical points at levels $k^{1/(n-1)}S_\ast$. In the degenerate case we obtain conformal hemispherical rigidity.
  The GN track yields analogous dichotomies and resolves a question of Christianson et al.: the sharp constant with small Dirichlet windows diverges at optimal capacitary rate, relating threshold to spectral/isoperimetric invariants. Applications include entropy inequalities for fast diffusion, curvature-driven NLS ground states, and (in $n=2$) Euler characteristic recovery from GN measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the prescribed $T$-curvature problem on the unit ball $\mathbb{B}^4$ of $\mathbb{R} ^4$ via the $T$-curvature flow approach. By combining Ache-Chang's inequality with the Morse-theoretic approach of Malchiodi-Struwe, we establish existence results under strong Morse-type inequalities at infinity. As a byproduct of our argument, we also prove the exponential convergence of the $T$-curvature flow on $\mathbb{B}^4$, starting from a $Q$-flat and minimal metric conformal to the standard Euclidean metric, to an extremal metric of Ache-Chang's inequality whose explicit expression was derived by Ndiaye-Sun.</description>

      <title>On two-dimensional Dirac operators with critical delta-shell interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional Dirac operators with singular interactions of electrostatic and Lorentzscalar type, supported either on a straight line or a circle. For certain critical values of the interaction strengths, the essential spectrum of such operators comprises an isolated point lying within the mass gap. We clarify the nature of this point in both geometries. For the straight line model, this point is known to be an eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity, and we provide a detailed analysis of the corresponding eigenfunctions. By contrast, in the case of a circle, we show that the said point is not itself an eigenvalue, but rather an accumulation point of a double sequence of simple eigenvalues. In view of the high degree of symmetry of the configurations under analysis, this behavior is unexpected and our findings lead us to formulate some conjectures concerning critical singular interactions supported on generic smooth curves.</description>

      <title>On the finite time blow-ups for solutions of nonlinear differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations where the dominant term, with respect to large spatial variables, causes blow-ups and is positively homogeneous of a degree $1+\alpha$ for some $\alpha&gt;0$. We prove that the asymptotic behavior of a solution $y(t)$ near a finite blow-up time $T_*$ is $(T_*-t)^{-1/\alpha}\xi_*$ for some nonzero vector $\xi_*$. Specific error estimates for $|(T_*-t)^{1/\alpha}y(t)-\xi_*|$ are provided. In some typical cases, they can be a positive power of $(T_*-t)$ or $1/|\ln(T_*-t)|$. This depends on whether the decaying rate of the lower order term, relative to the size of the dominant term, is of a power or logarithmic form. Similar results are obtained for a class of nonlinear differential inequalities with finite time blow-up solutions. Our results cover larger classes of nonlinear equations, differential inequalities and error estimates than those in the previous work.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for multiple species in a porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We rigorously derive a homogenized model for the Poisson--Nernst--Planck (PNP) equations for the case of multiple species defined on a periodic porous medium in spatial dimensions two and three. This extends the previous homogenization results for the PNP equations concerning two species. Here, the main difficulty is that the microscopic concentrations remain uniformly bounded in a space with relatively weak regularity. Therefore, the standard Aubin-Lions-Simon type compactness results for porous media, which give strong convergence of the microscopic solutions, become inapplicable in our weak setting. We overcome this problem by constructing suitable cut-off functions. The cut-off function, together with the application of a previously known energy functional, yields strong convergence of the microscopic concentrations in $L^1_t L^r_x$, for some $r&gt;2$, enabling us to pass to the limit in the nonlinear drift term. Finally, we derive the homogenized equations by means of two-scale convergence in $L^p_t L^q_x$ setting.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness of the Linear Regularized 13-Moment Equations Using Tensor-Valued Korn Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we finally prove the well-posedness of the linearized R13 moment model, which describes, e.g., rarefied gas flows. As an extension of the classical fluid equations, moment models are robust and have been frequently used, yet they are challenging to analyze due to their additional equations. By effectively grouping variables, we identify a 2-by-2 block structure, allowing us to analyze well-posedness within the abstract LBB framework for saddle point problems. Due to the unique tensorial structure of the equations, in addition to an interesting combination of tools from Stokes' and linear elasticity theory, we also need new coercivity estimates for tensor fields. These Korn-type inequalities are established by analyzing the symbol map of the symmetric and trace-free part of tensor derivative fields. Together with the corresponding right inverse of the tensorial divergence, we obtain the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions. This result also serves as the basis for future numerical analysis of corresponding discretization schemes.</description>

      <title>Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund estimates for double phase problems with matrix weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an optimal Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund theory for nonuniformly elliptic double phase problems with matrix weights. For $1&lt;p&lt;q&lt;\infty$, $a(\cdot)\in C^{0,\alpha}(\Omega)$ ($0&lt;\alpha\le1$), and a symmetric, almost everywhere positive definite matrix weight $\M$ with $|\M(x)|\,|\M(x)^{-1}|\le\Lambda$ for some constant $\Lambda\ge 1$ and small $|\log \M|_{\mathrm{BMO}}$, we prove, for every $\gamma&gt;1$, $$ (|\M F|^p+a(x)|\M F|^q)\in L^\gamma_{\mathrm{loc}} \;\Longrightarrow\; (|\M Du|^p+a(x)|\M Du|^q)\in L^\gamma_{\mathrm{loc}}. $$ Our argument combines a freezing of the logarithm of the matrix field, $\log \M$, with a fractional maximal-operator method governed by the Muckenhoupt-Wheeden $\mathcal{A}_{p,s}$ classes (where $1/s=1/p-\alpha/(nq)$). This yields scale-invariant comparison and level-set estimates and precludes Lavrentiev gaps at the sharp threshold $q/p\le 1+\alpha/n$. Our result recovers the identity case $\,\M\equiv {\rm I}_n\,$, i.e., the classical (unweighted) Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund theory for double-phase problems.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps for radial conductivities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of characterizing sequences of real numbers that arise as spectra of Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) maps for elliptic operators has attracted considerable attention over the past fifty years. In this article, we address this question in the simple setting of DtN maps associated with a rotation-invariant elliptic operator $\nabla \cdot (\gamma\nabla \centerdot )$ in the ball in Euclidean space. We show that the spectrum of such a DtN operator can be expressed as a universal term, determined solely by the boundary values of the conductivity $\gamma$, plus a sequence of Hausdorff moments of an integrable function, which we call the Born approximation of $\gamma$. We also show that this object is locally determined from the boundary by the corresponding values of the conductivity, a property that implies a local uniqueness result for the Calder\'on Problem in this setting. We also give a stability result: the functional mapping the Born approximation to its conductivity is H\"older stable in suitable Sobolev spaces. Finally, in order to refine the characterization of the Born approximation, we analyze its regularity properties and their dependence on the conductivity.</description>

      <title>On $W^{2,\varepsilon}$-estimates for a class of singular-degenerate parabolic equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of parabolic equations in non-divergence form with measurable coefficients that exhibit singular and/or degenerate behavior governed by weights in the $A_{1+\frac{1}{n}}$-Muckenhoupt class. Under a smallness assumption on a weighted mean oscillation of the weights, we establish weighted $W^{2,\varepsilon}$-estimates in the spirit of F.-H. Lin. Our results particularly holds for equations whose leading coefficients are of logistic-type singularities, as well as to those with polynomial blow-up or vanishing with sufficiently small exponents. A central component of our approach is the development of local quantitative lower estimates for solutions, which are interpreted as the mean sojourn time of sample paths, a stochastic-geometric perspective that generalizes the seminal work of L. C. Evans. We address the singular-degenerate nature of the operators by employing a class of intrinsic weighted parabolic cylinders, combined with a perturbation argument and parabolic Aleksandrov-Bakelman-Pucci (ABP) estimates. Furthermore, we conduct a rigorous analysis of weight regularization and truncation to ensure that the estimates are independent of the regularization and truncation parameters. The results extend classical regularity theory to a broad class of second-order parabolic equations and provide a functional analytic foundation for further study of fully nonlinear parabolic equations with singular-degenerate structure</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral stability of small-amplitude shock profiles for the one-dimensional isothermal Navier-Stokes-Poisson system, which describes ion dynamics in a collision-dominated plasma. Specifically, we establish (i) bounds on the essential spectrum, (ii) bounds on the point spectrum, and (iii) simplicity of the zero eigenvalue for the linearized operator about the profile in $L^2$. The result in (i) shows that the zero eigenvalue arising from translation invariance is embedded in the essential spectrum. Consequently, the standard Evans function approach cannot be applied directly to prove (iii). To resolve this, we employ an Evans-function framework that extends into regions of the essential spectrum, thereby enabling us to compute the derivative of the Evans function at the origin. Our result establishes that this derivative admits a factorization into two factors: one associated with transversality of the connecting profile and the other with hyperbolic stability of the corresponding shock of the quasi-neutral Euler system. We further show that both factors are nonzero, which implies simplicity of the zero eigenvalue.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study quasi-isospectral operators as a generalization of isospectral operators. The paper contains both expository material and original results. We begin by reviewing known results on isospectral potentials on compact manifolds and finite intervals, and then introduce the notion of quasi-isospectrality. We next investigate the BMT method as a systematic approach to constructing quasi-isospectral Sturm-Liouville operators on a finite interval, and apply it to several boundary value problems. Our main result shows that any two quasi-isospectral closed manifolds of odd dimension are, in fact, isospectral. In addition, we extend classical compactness results for isospectral potentials on low-dimensional manifolds to the quasi-isospectral setting via heat trace asymptotics.</description>

      <title>On uniqueness in structured model learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of uniqueness in learning physical laws for systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). Contrary to most existing approaches, it considers a framework of structured model learning, where existing, approximately correct physical models are augmented with components that are learned from data. The main results of the paper are a uniqueness and a convergence result that cover a large class of PDEs and a suitable class of neural networks used for approximating the unknown model components. The uniqueness result shows that, in the limit of full, noiseless measurements, a unique identification of the unknown model components as functions is possible as classical regularization-minimizing solutions of the PDE system. This result is complemented by a convergence result showing that model components learned as parameterized neural networks from incomplete, noisy measurements approximate the regularization-minimizing solutions of the PDE system in the limit. These results are possible under specific properties of the approximating neural networks and due to a dedicated choice of regularization. With this, a practical contribution of this analytic paper is to provide a class of model learning frameworks different to standard settings where uniqueness can be expected in the limit of full measurements.</description>

Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description>

      <title>Instability of the halocline at the North Pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address the issue of stability for the near-inertial Pollard waves, as a model for the halocline in the region of the Arctic Ocean centered around the North Pole, derived in Puntini (2025a). Adopting the short-wavelength instability approach, the stability of such flows reduces to study the stability of a system of ODEs along fluid trajectories, leading to the result that, when the steepness of the near-inertial Pollard waves exceeds a specific threshold, those waves are linearly unstable. The explicit dispersion relation of the model allows to easily compute such threshold, knowing the physical properties of the water column.</description>

      <title>Study of a TPFA scheme for the stochastic Allen-Cahn problem with constraint through numerical experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This contribution provides numerical experiments for a finite volume scheme for an approximation of the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The approximation is done by a Yosida approximation of the subdifferential operator. The problem is set on a polygonal bounded domain in two or three dimensions. The non-linear character of the projection term induces challenges to implement the scheme. To this end, we provide a splitting method for the finite volume scheme. We show that the splitting method is accurate. The computational error estimates induce that the squared $L^2$-error w.r.t. time is of order $1$ as long as the noise term is small enough. For larger noise terms the order of convergence w.r.t. time might become worse.</description>
