      <title>A comprehensive representation of selection at loci with multiple alleles that allows complex forms of genotypic fitness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genetic diversity is central to the process of evolution. Both natural selection and random genetic drift are influenced by the level of genetic diversity of a population; selection acts on diversity while drift samples from it. At a given locus in a diploid population, each individual carries only two alleles, but the population as a whole can possess a much larger number of alleles, with the upper limit constrained by twice the population size. This allows for many possible types of homozygotes and heterozygotes. Moreover, there are biologically important loci, for example those related to the MHC complex, the ABO blood types, and cystic fibrosis, that exhibit a large number of alleles. Despite this, much of population genetic theory, and data analysis, are limited to considering biallelic loci. However, to the present, what is lacking is a flexible expression for the force of selection that allows an arbitrary number of alleles (and hence an arbitrary number of heterozygotes), along with a variety of forms of fitness. In this work, we remedy this absence by giving an analytical representation of the force of selection that emphasises the very different roles played by the diversity of the population, and the fitnesses of different genotypes. The result presented facilitates our understanding and applies in a variety of different situations involving multiple alleles. This includes situations where fitnesses are: additive, multiplicative, randomly fluctuating, frequency-dependent, and it allows fitnesses which involve explicit gene interactions, such as heterozygote advantage.</description>

      <title>A vector Allee effect in mosquito dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a recently introduced model of mosquito dynamics that includes mating and progression through breeding, questing and egg-laying stages of mosquitoes using human and other vertebrate sources for blood meals. By exploiting a multiscale character of the model and recent results on their uniform-in-time asymptotics, we derive a simplified monotone model with the same long-term dynamics. Using the theory of monotone dynamical systems, we show that for a range of parameters, the latter displays Allee-type dynamics; that is, it has one extinction and two positive equilibria ordered with respect to the positive cone $\mathbb R_+^7$, with the extinction and the larger equilibrium being attractive and the middle one unstable. Using asymptotic analysis, we show that the original system also displays this pattern.</description>

      <title>On the Non-Oxygenic Origins of Thylakoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shed light on the emergence and evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. It is likely that the ancestor of Terrabacteria already possessed two distinct reaction centers, and that the ability to split water via photosystem II arose early in their evolution. Consequently, it is equally probable that the emergence of thylakoid membranes played a crucial role in the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, the study of thylakoid emergence remains less explored than the origin of photosystems. With a highly synchronized process involving numerous assembly factors, the biogenesis of thylakoid membranes suggests the existence of intermediate evolutionary states in the emergence of these compartments. Constrained by the sulfide-rich environment of the Archean, I propose a non-oxygenic origin of thylakoid membranes, which would have been initially devoted to alternative electron flows.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical genotype networks and incipient ecological speciation in Q$\beta$ phage quasispecies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how viral mutant spectra organize and explore genotype space is essential for unraveling the mechanisms driving evolution at the finest scale. Here we use deep-sequencing data of an amplicon in the A2 protein of the RNA bacteriophage Q$\beta$ to reconstruct genotype networks with tens of thousands of different haplotypes. The study of populations evolved under different temperature regimes uncovers generic topological features conditioned by fundamental structural motifs of genotype networks -- tetrahedrons, triangles, and squares -- that govern their local architecture. Mutant swarms display a hierarchical structure where sequences cluster around a highly connected and abundant sequence core that sustains population diversity. The immediate neighborhood of this core is comprehensively sampled, with no signs of selection, while a few mutations away sampling becomes dynamical and sparse, showing signs of purifying selection. By aggregating genotype networks from populations adapted to different temperatures, we capture the early stages of evolutionary divergence, with overlapping populations that remain connected through short mutational paths. Even at the time scale of these experiments, evolutionary pathways might be multiple, preventing the backward reconstruction of unique trajectories once mutations have been fixed. This analysis provides a detailed view of the local, fine-scale processes shaping viral quasispecies evolution and underscores the usefulness of genotype networks as an enlightening visualization of the organization of mutant swarms.</description>

      <title>Polymerization and replication of primordial RNA explained by clay-water interface dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RNA is the only known biopolymer that combines genotype and phenotype in a single molecular entity. This has suggested that the flow of genetic information DNA-RNA-proteins already operating in LUCA could have been preceded by a primordial era when RNA was the genetic and catalytic macromolecule. However, understanding how RNA could have polymerized and subsequently replicated in early Earth remains challenging. We present a theoretical and computational framework to model the non-enzymatic polymerization of ribonucleotides and the template-dependent replication of primordial RNA molecules, at the interfaces between the aqueous solution and a clay mineral supplied by its interlayers and channels. Our results demonstrate that efficient polymerization and accurate replication of single-stranded RNA polymers, sufficiently long to fold and acquire basic functions ($&gt;15$ nt), were possible at clay-water interfaces in early Earth, provided the physico-chemical environment exhibited an oscillatory pattern of large amplitude and a period compatible with spring tide dynamics. Interestingly, the theoretical analysis presents rigorous evidence that RNA replication efficiency increases in oscillating environments compared to constant ones. Moreover, the versatility of our framework enables comparisons between different genetic alphabets, showing that a four-letter alphabet -- particularly when allowing non-canonical base pairs, as in current RNA -- represents an optimal balance of replication speed and sequence diversity in the pathway to life.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Microcephaly Under Vertical Transmission of Zika</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Zika virus, known for its potential to induce neurological conditions such as microcephaly when transmitted vertically from infected mothers to infants, has sparked widespread concerns globally. Motivated by this, we propose an optimal control problem for the prevention of vertical Zika transmission. The novelty of this study lies in its consideration of time-dependent control functions, namely, insecticide spraying and personal protective measures taken to safeguard pregnant women from infected mosquitoes. New results provide a way to minimize the number of infected pregnant women through the implementation of control strategies while simultaneously reducing both the associated costs of control measures and the mosquito population, resulting in a decline in microcephaly cases.</description>

      <title>Towards Graph Neural Network Surrogates Leveraging Mechanistic Expert Knowledge for Pandemic Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 crisis, mechanistic models have been proven fundamental to guide evidence-based decision making. However, time-critical decisions in a dynamically changing environment restrict the time available for modelers to gather supporting evidence. As infectious disease dynamics are often heterogeneous on a spatial or demographic scale, models should be resolved accordingly. In addition, with a large number of potential interventions, all scenarios can barely be computed on time, even when using supercomputing facilities. We suggest to combine complex mechanistic models with data-driven surrogate models to allow for on-the-fly model adaptations by public health experts. We build upon a spatially and demographically resolved infectious disease model and train a graph neural network for data sets representing early phases of the pandemic. The resulting networks reached an execution time of less than a second, a significant speedup compared to the metapopulation approach. The suggested approach yields potential for on-the-fly execution and, thus, integration of disease dynamics models in low-barrier website applications. For the approach to be used with decision-making, datasets with larger variance will have to be considered.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:1503.07215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of Multiland is to generate neutral landscapes made of several types of regions, with an exact control of the proportions occupied by each type of region. An important feature of the software is that it allows a control of the landscape fragmentation. It is intended to theoretical studies on the effect of landscape structure in applied sciences. It has been developed in the framework of the PEERLESS ANR project "Predictive Ecological Engineering for Landscape Ecosystem Services and Sustainability". It includes both Matlab and Python versions.</description>

      <title>Foundations of ecological and evolutionary change</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological evolution is realised through the same mechanisms of birth and death that underlie change in population density. The deep interdependence between ecology and evolution is well-established, but much theory in each discipline has been developed in isolation. While recent work has accomplished eco-evolutionary synthesis, a gap remains between the logical foundations of ecology and evolution. We bridge this gap with a new equation that defines a summed value for a characteristic across individuals in a population, from which the fundamental equations of population ecology and evolutionary biology (the Price equation) are derived. We thereby unify the fundamental equations of population ecology and biological evolution under a general framework. Our unification further demonstrates the equivalence between mean population growth rate and evolutionary fitness, shows how ecological and evolutionary change are reflected in the first and second statistical moments of fitness, respectively, and links this change to ecosystem function. Finally, we outline how our proposed framework can be used to unify social evolution and density-dependent population growth.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Rock-Paper-Scissors games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is mounting evidence that species interactions often involve long-term memory, with highly-varying waiting times between successive events and long-range temporal correlations. Accounting for memory undermines the common Markovian assumption, and dramatically impacts key ingredients of population dynamics including birth, foraging, predation, and competition processes. Here, we investigate a critical aspect of population dynamics, namely non-Markovian multi-species competition. This is done in the realm of the zero-sum rock-paper-scissors (zRPS) model that is broadly used in the life sciences to metaphorically describe cyclic competition between three interacting species. We develop a general non-Markovian formalism for multi-species dynamics, allowing us to determine the regions of the parameter space where each species dominates. In particular, when the dynamics are Markovian, the waiting times are exponentially distributed and the fate of the zRPS model in large well-mixed populations follows the so-called ``law of the weakest'' (LOW), predicting that the species with the lowest growth rate is the most likely to prevail. We demonstrate that the survival behavior and LOW of the zRPS model are critically affected by non-exponential waiting time distributions, and especially, by their coefficient of variation. Our findings provide key insight into the influence of long waiting times on non-Markovian evolutionary processes.</description>
