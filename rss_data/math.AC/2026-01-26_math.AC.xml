      <title>Normality of Ideals and Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate when the Rees algebra of an integrally closed $\mathfrak{m}$-primary ideal in a regular local ring is a Cohen-Macaulay normal domain. While this property always holds in dimension two, it fails in general in higher dimensions, prompting a search for sufficient conditions on the ideal. We show that if an integrally closed ideal contains a part of regular system of parameters of length $d-2$, where $d$ is the dimension of the regular local ring, then its Rees algebra is Cohen-Macaulay and normal. We also extend results of Goto and Ciuperc\u{a} by proving the same conclusion when the minimal number of generators of an ideal is at most $d+2$. Furthermore, we treat the case of integrally closed zero-dimensional ideals generated by $d+3$ homogeneous polynomials. Finally, using generic Bourbaki ideals, we generalize these results to integrally closed torsionfree modules of finite colength.</description>

      <title>Derived equivalences for complexes with support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a Serre subcategory $\mathscr L$ and a resolving subcategory $\mathscr A$ of an abelian category, we show that the derived equivalence $D^b(\overline{\mathscr A} \cap \mathscr L) \simeq D^b_{\mathscr L}(\mathscr A)$ holds under certain conditions. We apply this to obtain derived equivalences in the contexts of chain complexes of graded modules or coherent sheaves, with finite $\mathscr A$-dimension, supported on closed sets having eventually finite $\mathscr A$-dimension.</description>

      <title>Homomorphisms between Bott-Samelson bimodules corresponding to sequences of reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the space of all bimodule homomorphisms $R_x\otimes_R R(\underline{t})\otimes_R R_y\to R_z\otimes_R R(\underline{t}')\otimes_R R_w$ as a one-sided module, where $R_x,R_y,R_z,R_w$ are standard twisted bimodules and $R(\underline{t})$ and $R(\underline{t}')$ are the Bott-Samelson bimodules corresponding to sequences of reflections $\underline{t}$ and $\underline{t}'$ respectively. We prove that this module is always reflexive under some reasonable restrictions on the representation of the underlying Coxeter group.
  However, unlike the case where $\underline{t}$ and $\underline{t}'$ contain only simple reflections, this module does not need any longer to be free. We provide a series of counterexamples already for the symmetric groups $S_n$, where $n\ge4$. The projective dimension of the modules dual to them is $n-3$ and thus serves to measure the deviation from the free modules.
  When placed within a geometric framework, these examples show how to find fibers of points fixed by the compact torus in the Bott-Samelson resolutions (as in the original definition by Raoul Bott and Hans Samelson) with non-vanishing odd cohomology.</description>

      <title>Components of the nested Hilbert scheme of few points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence and the schematic structure of elementary components of the nested Hilbert scheme on a smooth quasi-projective variety. Precisely, we find a new lower bound for the existence of non-smoothable nestings of fat points on a smooth $n$-fold, for $n\geqslant 4$. Moreover, we implement a systematic method to build generically non-reduced elementary components. We also investigate the problem of irreducibility of the Hilbert scheme of points on a singular hypersurface of $\mathbb A^3$. Explicitly, we show that the Hilbert scheme of points on a hypersurface of $\mathbb{A}^3$ having a singularity of multiplicity at least 5 admits elementary components.</description>

      <title>On generalized Gorenstein local rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce generalized Gorenstein local (GGL) rings. The notion of GGL rings is a natural generalization of the notion of almost Gorenstein rings, which can thus be treated as part of the theory of GGL rings. For a Cohen-Macaulay local ring $R$, we explore the endomorphism algebra of the maximal ideal, the trace ideal of the canonical module, Ulrich ideals, and Rees algebras of parameter ideals in connection with the GGL property. We also give numerous examples of numerical semigroup rings, idealizations, and determinantal rings of certain matrices.</description>

      <title>Coarsest Fourier-reflexive Partitions for the Lee, Homogeneous and Subfield Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MacWilliams identities relate the weight enumerators of a code with those of its dual and are classically formulated with respect to the Hamming weight. For other metrics, however, these identities often fail when considering the weight partition of the ambient space. It is known that MacWilliams identities hold for enumerators associated with Fourier-reflexive partitions, and that orbits of subgroups of the linear isometry group always yield such partitions. This raises the question whether, for metrics beyond the Hamming metric, there exist meaningful partitions that lie strictly between the weight partition and the orbit partition: finer than the latter, yet still coarse enough to retain useful MacWilliams-type identities. In this work, we study this question for finite chain rings endowed with additive metrics. For the Lee metric, we show that the partition induced by the action of the full group of linear isometries is already the coarsest Fourier-reflexive partition refining the weight partition. In particular, no intermediate partition exists that is both finer than the Lee weight partition and Fourier-reflexive. We refer to this partition as the Lee partition and show that it allows the recovery of all additive weight enumerators over the ring. In contrast, for the homogeneous metric and for the subfield metric, we identify new, significantly coarser symmetrized partitions that remain Fourier-reflexive and still allow the recovery of the corresponding weight enumerators. We prove that these partitions are the coarsest such symmetrized partitions for which MacWilliams-type identities hold. As an application, we derive linear programming bounds based on the resulting MacWilliams identities.</description>

      <title>Survey on second submodules of modules over commutative rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let R be a commutative ring with identity. The concept of second submodule of an R-module (as a dual notion of prime submodules) was introduced and studied by S.Yassemi in 2001. This notion has obtained a great attention by many authors and now there is a considerable amount of research concerning this class of modules. The main purpose of this paper is to collect these results and provide a useful source for those who are interested in research in this field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove some results on the structure of ind-pro completions of Noetherian rings along flags of prime ideals. In particular, we compute the Krull dimension and deduce the criterion on semilocality in the case of essentially of finite type algebras over a field. We also show that ind-pro completion inherits properties of the base ring such as normality, regularity, local equidimensionality, etc.</description>

      <title>Pure subrings of Du Bois singularities are Du Bois singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14429v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R \to S$ be a cyclically pure map of Noetherian $\mathbb{Q}$-algebras. In this paper, we show that if $S$ has Du Bois singularities, then $R$ has Du Bois singularities. Our result is new even when $R \to S$ is faithfully flat. Our proof also yields interesting results in prime characteristic and in mixed characteristic. As a consequence, we show that if $R \to S$ is a cyclically pure map of rings essentially of finite type over the complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$, $S$ has log canonical type singularities, and $K_R$ is Cartier, then $R$ has log canonical singularities. Along the way, we prove a version of the key injectivity theorem of Kov\'acs and Schwede for Noetherian schemes of equal characteristic zero that have isolated non-Du Bois points. Throughout the paper, we use the characterization of the complex $\underline{\Omega}^0_X$ and of Du Bois singularities in terms of sheafification with respect to Grothendieck topologies.</description>

      <title>Existence of K\"ahler algebras with Chow polynomials as Hilbert series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study Chow polynomials of weakly ranked posets and prove the existence of Gorenstein algebras with the K\"ahler package such that their Hilbert--Poincar\'e series agrees with the Chow polynomial. Our statement provides evidence in support of a conjecture by Ferroni, Matherne and the second author about the existence of an algebra for every weakly ranked poset that generalizes the Feichtner--Yuzvinsky Chow ring for matroids. This allows us to prove strong inequalities for the coefficients of Chow polynomials; we prove log-concavity for all posets of weak rank at most six and provide counterexamples to log-concavity for any higher rank. For ranked posets we recover an even stronger condition, showing that the differences between consecutive coefficients constitute a pure O-sequence.</description>

      <title>Graded Betti numbers of the Jacobian algebra and total Tjurina numbers of plane curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compute an explicit closed formula for the total Tjurina number $\tau(C)$ of a reduced projective plane curve $C$ in terms of the graded Betti numbers of the corresponding Jacobian algebra. This formula allows a completely new view point on the classical upper bounds for the total Tjurina number $\tau(C)$ of a plane curve $C$ given by A. du Plessis and C. T. C. Wall. This approach yields in particular a new necessary condition for a set of positive integers to be the graded Betti numbers of the Jacobian algebra of a reduced plane curve.</description>
