      <title>Safe Sliding Mode Controllers for Nonlinear Uncertain Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel sliding mode safety-critical controller designed to address both stability and safety concerns in a class of nonlinear uncertain systems. The controller features two feedback loops: an inner loop designed by conventional sliding mode techniques and an outer safeguarding loop aimed at enhancing system safety. The inner loop, while ensuring asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system, may not guarantee compliance with safety constraints. To overcome this limitation and ensure both stability and safety, the outer loop introduces a correction term known as the safeguarding control signal. This signal is added to the unsafe control signal generated by the inner loop, effectively modifying it to meet the required safety constraints. To design the safeguarding control law, we integrate the system dynamics with an additional state variable. The dynamics of this augmented state are derived based on a stability constraint obtained from Lyapunov theory. By utilizing a control barrier function for the augmented system, we determine the safeguarding control signal, which ensures the system operates within the defined safety constraint. The proposed safety-critical controller exhibits finite-time convergence to the sliding manifold. To mitigate interference between the inner and outer loops, strategies such as defining risky sets are employed, limiting the impact of the safeguarding loop on the functionality of the inner loop. A closed-form solution for designing safeguarding control laws is derived to eliminate the necessity for solving any quadratic problems in real-time. Simulation case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller in maintaining stability and safety.</description>

      <title>Statistical QoS Provisioning Architecture for 6G Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of massive ultra-reliable and low latency communications (mURLLC) as a category of time/reliability-sensitive service over 6G networks has received considerable research attention, which has presented unprecedented challenges. As one of the key enablers for 6G, satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STIN) have been developed to offer more expansive connectivity and comprehensive 3D coverage in space-aerial-terrestrial domains for supporting 6G mission-critical mURLLC applications while fulfilling diverse and rigorous quality of service (QoS) requirements. In the context of these mURLLC-driven satellite services, data freshness assumes paramount importance, as outdated data may engender unpredictable or catastrophic outcomes. To effectively measure data freshness in satellite-terrestrial integrated communications, age of information (AoI) has recently surfaced as a new dimension of QoS metric to support time-sensitive applications. It is crucial to design new analytical models that ensure stringent and diverse QoS metrics bounded by different key parameters, including AoI, delay, and reliability, over 6G satellite-terrestrial integrated networks. However, due to the complicated and dynamic nature of satellite-terrestrial integrated network environments, the research on efficiently defining new statistical QoS schemes while taking into account varying degrees of freedom has still been in their infancy. To remedy these deficiencies, in this paper we develop statistical QoS provisioning schemes over 6G satellite-terrestrial integrated networks in the finite blocklength regime. Particularly, we firstly introduce and review key technologies for supporting mURLLC. Secondly, we formulate a number of novel fundamental statistical-QoS metrics in the finite blocklength regime. Finally, we conduct a set of simulations to evaluate our developed statistical QoS schemes.</description>

      <title>Colored Petri Nets for Modeling and Simulation of a Green Supply Chain System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Green supply chain is an emerging approach in supply chain management to reduce environmental impact of the process concerning the flow of goods and materials. As a discrete-event system, supply chain can be modeled using Petri Nets. Colored Petri Nets (CPNs) extend the classical Petri net formalism with data, time and hierarchy. These extensions makes it possible to deal with the green aspects of the supply chain.This paper deals with the Colored Petri Net approach to model and simulate a green supply chain system. The forward supply chain network starts from the raw material suppliers, to the manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and to the final customers. The reverse supply chain network is made of collecting points, recycling plants, disassembly plants,and secondary material market. A government environment agency plays the role of regulation of the recycling process. A colored Petri net model of the green supply chain is developed and simulated with CPN Tools, a dedicated software for CPN models. The simulation results as well as the state-space analysis results validate the correctness of the model.</description>

      <title>Multiple-input, multiple-output modal testing of a Hawk T1A aircraft: A new full-scale dataset for structural health monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of measured vibration data from structures has a long history of enabling the development of methods for inference and monitoring. In particular, applications based on system identification and structural health monitoring have risen to prominence over recent decades and promise significant benefits when implemented in practice. However, significant challenges remain in the development of these methods. The introduction of realistic, full-scale datasets will be an important contribution to overcoming these challenges. This paper presents a new benchmark dataset capturing the dynamic response of a decommissioned BAE Systems Hawk T1A. The dataset reflects the behaviour of a complex structure with a history of service that can still be tested in controlled laboratory conditions, using a variety of known loading and damage simulation conditions. As such, it provides a key stepping stone between simple laboratory test structures and in-service structures. In this paper, the Hawk structure is described in detail, alongside a comprehensive summary of the experimental work undertaken. Following this, key descriptive highlights of the dataset are presented, before a discussion of the research challenges that the data present. Using the dataset, non-linearity in the structure is demonstrated, as well as the sensitivity of the structure to damage of different types. The dataset is highly applicable to many academic enquiries and additional analysis techniques which will enable further advancement of vibration-based engineering techniques.</description>

      <title>Structured physics-guided neural networks for electromagnetic commutation applied to industrial linear motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechatronic systems are described by an interconnection of the electromagnetic part, i.e., a static position-dependent nonlinear relation between currents and forces, and the mechanical part, i.e., a dynamic relation from forces to position. Commutation inverts a model of the electromagnetic part of the system, and thereby removes the electromagnetic part from the position control problem. Typical commutation algorithms rely on simplified models derived from physics-based knowledge, which do not take into account position dependent parasitic effects. In turn, these commutation related model errors translate into position tracking errors, which limit the system performance. Therefore, in this work, we develop a data-driven approach to commutation using physics-guided neural networks (PGNNs). A novel PGNN model is proposed which structures neural networks (NNs) to learn specific motor dependent parasitic effects. The PGNN is used to identify a model of the electromagnetic part using force measurements, after which it is analytically inverted to obtain a PGNN-based commutation algorithm. Motivated by industrial applications, we develop an input transformation to deal with systems with fixed commutation, i.e., when the currents cannot be controlled. Real-life experiments on an industrial coreless linear motor (CLM) demonstrate a factor 10 improvement in the commutation error in driving direction and a factor 4 improvement in the position error with respect to classical commutation in terms of the mean--squared error (MSE).</description>

      <title>Provable Bounds on the Hessian of Neural Networks: Derivative-Preserving Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel reachability analysis method tailored for neural networks with differentiable activations. Our idea hinges on a sound abstraction of the neural network map based on first-order Taylor expansion and bounding the remainder. To this end, we propose a method to compute analytical bounds on the network's first derivative (gradient) and second derivative (Hessian). A key aspect of our method is loop transformation on the activation functions to exploit their monotonicity effectively. The resulting end-to-end abstraction locally preserves the derivative information, yielding accurate bounds on small input sets. Finally, we employ a branch and bound framework for larger input sets to refine the abstraction recursively. We evaluate our method numerically via different examples and compare the results with relevant state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Precision in Tactile Internet-Enabled Remote Robotic Surgery: Kalman Filter Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the position of a patient's side robotic arm in real time in a remote surgery task is a significant challenge, particularly in Tactile Internet (TI) environments. This paper presents a Kalman Filter (KF) based computationally efficient position estimation method. The study also assume no prior knowledge of the dynamic system model of the robotic arm system. Instead, The JIGSAW dataset, which is a comprehensive collection of robotic surgical data, and the Master Tool Manipulator's (MTM) input are utilized to learn the system model using System Identification (SI) toolkit available in Matlab. We further investigate the effectiveness of KF to determine the position of the Patient Side Manipulator (PSM) under simulated network conditions that include delays, jitter, and packet loss. These conditions reflect the typical challenges encountered in real-world Tactile Internet applications. The results of the study highlight KF's resilience and effectiveness in achieving accurate state estimation despite network-induced uncertainties with over 90\% estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid-Layered System for Image-Guided Navigation and Robot Assisted Spine Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to the growing demand for precise and affordable solutions for Image-Guided Spine Surgery (IGSS), this paper presents a comprehensive development of a Robot-Assisted and Navigation-Guided IGSS System. The endeavor involves integrating cutting-edge technologies to attain the required surgical precision and limit user radiation exposure, thereby addressing the limitations of manual surgical methods. We propose an IGSS workflow and system architecture employing a hybrid-layered approach, combining modular and integrated system architectures in distinctive layers to develop an affordable system for seamless integration, scalability, and reconfigurability. We developed and integrated the system and extensively tested it on phantoms and cadavers. The proposed system's accuracy using navigation guidance is 1.020 mm, and robot assistance is 1.11 mm on phantoms. Observing a similar performance in cadaveric validation where 84% of screw placements were grade A, 10% were grade B using navigation guidance, 90% were grade A, and 10% were grade B using robot assistance as per the Gertzbein-Robbins scale, proving its efficacy for an IGSS. The evaluated performance is adequate for an IGSS and at par with the existing systems in literature and those commercially available. The user radiation is lower than in the literature, given that the system requires only an average of 3 C-Arm images per pedicle screw placement and verification</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today's distributed and pervasive computing addresses large-scale cyber-physical ecosystems, characterised by dense and large networks of devices capable of computation, communication and interaction with the environment and people. While most research focusses on treating these systems as "composites" (i.e., heterogeneous functional complexes), recent developments in fields such as self-organising systems and swarm robotics have opened up a complementary perspective: treating systems as "collectives" (i.e., uniform, collaborative, and self-organising groups of entities). This article explores the motivations, state of the art, and implications of this "collective computing paradigm" in software engineering, discusses its peculiar challenges, and outlines a path for future research, touching on aspects such as macroprogramming, collective intelligence, self-adaptive middleware, learning, synthesis, and experimentation of collective behaviour.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the receiver to transmitter antenna coupling in near-field communications with massive arrays. Although most works in the literature consider that it is negligible and approximate it by zero, there is no rigorous analysis on its relevance for practical systems. In this work, we leverage multiport communication theory to obtain conditions for the aforementioned approximation to be valid in MISO and SIMO systems. These conditions are then particularized for arrays with fixed inter-element spacing and arrays with fixed size.</description>

      <title>Optimal path planning and weighted control of a four-arm robot in on-orbit servicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a trajectory optimization and control approach for the guidance of an orbital four-arm robot in extravehicular activities. The robot operates near the target spacecraft, enabling its arm's end-effectors to reach the spacecraft's surface. Connections to the target spacecraft can be established by the arms through specific footholds (docking devices). The trajectory optimization allows the robot path planning by computing the docking positions on the target spacecraft surface, along with their timing, the arm trajectories, the six degrees of freedom body motion, and the necessary contact forces during docking. In addition, the paper introduces a controller designed to track the planned trajectories derived from the solution of the nonlinear programming problem. A weighted controller formulated as a convex optimization problem is proposed. The controller is defined as the optimization of an objective function that allows the system to perform a set of tasks simultaneously. Simulation results show the application of the trajectory optimization and control approaches to an on-orbit servicing scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient numerical optimization methods can improve performance and reduce the environmental impact of computing in many applications. This work presents a proof-of-concept study combining primitive state representations and agent-environment interactions as first-order optimizers in the setting of budget-limited optimization. Through reinforcement learning (RL) over a set of training instances of an optimization problem class, optimal policies for sequential update selection of algorithmic iteration steps are approximated in generally formulated low-dimensional partial state representations that consider aspects of progress and resource use. For the investigated case studies, deployment of the trained agents to unseen instances of the quadratic optimization problem classes outperformed conventional optimal algorithms with optimized hyperparameters. The results show that elementary RL methods combined with succinct partial state representations can be used as heuristics to manage complexity in RL-based optimization, paving the way for agentic optimization approaches.</description>

      <title>Auto-Multilift: Distributed Learning and Control for Cooperative Load Transportation With Quadrotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing motion control and planning algorithms for multilift systems remains challenging due to the complexities of dynamics, collision avoidance, actuator limits, and scalability. Existing methods that use optimization and distributed techniques effectively address these constraints and scalability issues. However, they often require substantial manual tuning, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes Auto-Multilift, a novel framework that automates the tuning of model predictive controllers (MPCs) for multilift systems. We model the MPC cost functions with deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling fast online adaptation to various scenarios. We develop a distributed policy gradient algorithm to train these DNNs efficiently in a closed-loop manner. Central to our algorithm is distributed sensitivity propagation, which parallelizes gradient computation across quadrotors, focusing on actual system state sensitivities relative to key MPC parameters. We also provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of this algorithm. Extensive simulations show rapid convergence and favorable scalability to a large number of quadrotors. Our method outperforms a state-of-the-art open-loop MPC tuning approach by effectively learning adaptive MPCs from trajectory tracking errors and handling the unique dynamics couplings within the multilift system. Additionally, our framework can learn an adaptive reference for reconfigurating the system when traversing through multiple narrow slots.</description>

      <title>Sim-to-real Transfer of Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents for Online Coverage Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer presents a difficult challenge, where models trained in simulation are to be deployed in the real world. The distribution shift between the two settings leads to biased representations of the perceived real-world environment, and thus to suboptimal predictions. In this work, we tackle the challenge of sim-to-real transfer of reinforcement learning (RL) agents for coverage path planning (CPP). In CPP, the task is for a robot to find a path that visits every point of a confined area. Specifically, we consider the case where the environment is unknown, and the agent needs to plan the path online while mapping the environment. We bridge the sim-to-real gap through a semi-virtual environment with a simulated sensor and obstacles, while including real robot kinematics and real-time aspects. We investigate what level of fine-tuning is needed for adapting to a realistic setting, comparing to an agent trained solely in simulation. We find that a high model inference frequency is sufficient for reducing the sim-to-real gap, while fine-tuning degrades performance initially. By training the model in simulation and deploying it at a high inference frequency, we transfer state-of-the-art results from simulation to the real domain, where direct learning would take in the order of weeks with manual interaction, i.e., would be completely infeasible.</description>

Abstract: The learning inefficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) from scratch hinders its practical application towards continuous robotic tracking control, especially for high-dimensional robots. This work proposes a data-informed residual reinforcement learning (DR-RL) based robotic tracking control scheme applicable to robots with high dimensionality. The proposed DR-RL methodology outperforms common RL methods regarding sample efficiency and scalability. Specifically, we first decouple the original robot into low-dimensional robotic subsystems; and further utilize one-step backward (OSBK) data to construct incremental subsystems that are equivalent model-free representations of the above decoupled robotic subsystems. The formulated incremental subsystems allow for parallel learning to relieve computation load and offer us mathematical descriptions of robotic movements for conducting theoretical analysis. Then, we apply DR-RL to learn the tracking control policy, a combination of incremental base policy and incremental residual policy, under a parallel learning architecture. The incremental residual policy uses the guidance from the incremental base policy as the learning initialization and further learns from interactions with environments to endow the tracking control policy with adaptability towards dynamically changing environments. Our proposed DR-RL based tracking control scheme is developed with rigorous theoretical analysis of system stability and weight convergence. The effectiveness of our proposed method is validated numerically on a 7-DoF KUKA iiwa robot manipulator and experimentally on a 3-DoF robot manipulator that would fail for other counterpart RL methods.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Observability Analysis for Nonlinear Stochastic Systems</title>

Abstract: Distinguishability and, by extension, observability are key properties of dynamical systems. Establishing these properties is challenging, especially when no analytical model is available and they are to be inferred directly from measurement data. The presence of noise further complicates this analysis, as standard notions of distinguishability are tailored to deterministic systems. We build on distributional distinguishability, which extends the deterministic notion by comparing distributions of outputs of stochastic systems. We first show that both concepts are equivalent for a class of systems that includes linear systems. We then present a method to assess and quantify distributional distinguishability from output data. Specifically, our quantification measures how much data is required to tell apart two initial states, inducing a continuous spectrum of distinguishability. We propose a statistical test to determine a threshold above which two states can be considered distinguishable with high confidence. We illustrate these tools by computing distinguishability maps over the state space in simulation, then leverage the test to compare sensor configurations on hardware.</description>

      <title>Battery model impact on time-optimal co-design for electric racing cars: review and application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sustainable mobility trend touches the racing world as well, from the hybridization of Formula 1 (F1) and Le Mans Hypercars to the fully electric Formula E racing class. In this scenario, the research community is studying how to push electric racing vehicles to their limit, combining vehicle dynamics and energy management, to successfully solve the minimum lap time problem. Recently, this class of problems has been enlarged towards optimal sizing, with a particular interest in batteries, which represent the main bottleneck for electric vehicle performance. In this work, starting from a thorough review of literature approaches, we define a general optimization framework of minimum lap and race time problems for electric vehicles, suitable to figure out the impact of different modeling choices on both problem structure and optimal variables profiles. Exploiting a case study on Generation 3 (Gen 3) of Formula E cars, we delve into the impact of battery models' complexity on both optimal sizing and optimal battery usage. We show how highly detailed models are necessary to study the evolution of both battery and vehicle control variables during the race, while, simple models are more than sufficient to address the battery sizing problem.</description>

      <title>An adaptive optimal control approach to monocular depth observability maximization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an integral concurrent learning (ICL)-based observer for a monocular camera to accurately estimate the Euclidean distance to features on a stationary object, under the restriction that state information is unavailable. Using distance estimates, an infinite horizon optimal regulation problem is solved, which aims to regulate the camera to a goal location while maximizing feature observability. Lyapunov-based stability analysis is used to guarantee exponential convergence of depth estimates and input-to-state stability of the goal location relative to the camera. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified in simulation, and a table illustrating improved observability is provided.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Emergency Braking With Driver-In-The-Loop: Torque Vectoring for Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) potentially brings significant improvements in automotive safety due to its ability to autonomously prevent collisions in situations where the driver may not be able to do so. Driven by the poor performance of the state of the art in recent testing, this work provides an online solution to identify critical parameters such as the current and maximum friction coefficients. The method introduced here, namely Torque Vectoring for Active Learning (TVAL), can perform state and parameter estimation whilst following the driver's input. Importantly with less power requirements than normal driving. Our method is designed with a crucial focus on ensuring minimal disruption to the driver, allowing them to maintain full control of the vehicle. Additionally, we exploit a rain/light sensor to drive the observer resampling to maintain estimation certainty across prolonged operation. Then a scheme to modulate TVAL is introduced that considers powertrain efficiency, safety, and availability in an online fashion. Using a high-fidelity vehicle model and drive cycle we demonstrate the functionality of TVAL controller across changing road surfaces where we successfully identify the road surface whenever possible.</description>

      <title>A Unified Formulation of Geometry-aware Dynamic Movement Primitives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.03374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from demonstration (LfD) is considered as an efficient way to transfer skills from humans to robots. Traditionally, LfD has been used to transfer Cartesian and joint positions and forces from human demonstrations. The traditional approach works well for some robotic tasks, but for many tasks of interest, it is necessary to learn skills such as orientation, impedance, and/or manipulability that have specific geometric characteristics. An effective encoding of such skills can be only achieved if the underlying geometric structure of the skill manifold is considered and the constrains arising from this structure are fulfilled during both learning and execution. However, typical learned skill models such as dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) are limited to Euclidean data and fail in correctly embedding quantities with geometric constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel and mathematically principled framework that uses concepts from Riemannian geometry to allow DMPs to properly embed geometric constrains. The resulting DMP formulation can deal with data sampled from any Riemannian manifold including, but not limited to, unit quaternions and symmetric and positive definite matrices. The proposed approach has been extensively evaluated both on simulated data and real robot experiments. The performed evaluation demonstrates that beneficial properties of DMPs, such as convergence to a given goal and the possibility to change the goal during operation, apply also to the proposed formulation.</description>

      <title>Learning Coverage Paths in Unknown Environments with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16978v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coverage path planning (CPP) is the problem of finding a path that covers the entire free space of a confined area, with applications ranging from robotic lawn mowing to search-and-rescue. When the environment is unknown, the path needs to be planned online while mapping the environment, which cannot be addressed by offline planning methods that do not allow for a flexible path space. We investigate how suitable reinforcement learning is for this challenging problem, and analyze the involved components required to efficiently learn coverage paths, such as action space, input feature representation, neural network architecture, and reward function. We propose a computationally feasible egocentric map representation based on frontiers, and a novel reward term based on total variation to promote complete coverage. Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach surpasses the performance of both previous RL-based approaches and highly specialized methods across multiple CPP variations.</description>

      <title>Saturability of the Quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao Bound in Multiparameter Quantum Estimation at the Single-Copy Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11567v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (QCRB) as the ultimate lower bound for precision in quantum parameter estimation is only known to be saturable in the multiparameter setting in special cases and under conditions such as full or average commutavity of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives (SLDs) associated with the parameters. Moreover, for general mixed states, collective measurements over infinitely many identical copies of the quantum state are generally required to attain the QCRB. In the important and experimentally relevant single-copy scenario, a necessary condition for saturating the QCRB in the multiparameter setting for general mixed states is the so-called partial commutativity condition on the SLDs. However, it is not known if this condition is also sufficient. This paper establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for saturability of the multiparameter QCRB in the single-copy setting in terms of the commutativity of a set of projected SLDs and the existence of a unitary solution to a system of nonlinear partial differential equations. New necessary conditions that imply partial commutativity are also obtained, which together with another condition become sufficient. Moreover, when the sufficient conditions are satisfied an optimal measurement saturating the QCRB can be chosen to be projective and explicitly characterized. An example is developed to illustrate the case of a multiparameter quantum state where the conditions derived herein are satisfied and can be explicitly verified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise glucose level monitoring is critical for people with diabetes to avoid serious complications. While there are several methods for continuous glucose level monitoring, research on maintenance devices is limited. To mitigate the gap, we provide a novel neural control system for continuous glucose monitoring and management that uses differential predictive control. Our approach, led by a sophisticated neural policy and differentiable modeling, constantly adjusts insulin supply in real-time, thereby improving glucose level optimization in the body. This end-to-end method maximizes efficiency, providing personalized care and improved health outcomes, as confirmed by empirical evidence.

      <title>Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in Fault Detection and Diagnosis: A Comprehensive Benchmark on the Tennessee Eastman Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13502v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating machine learning into Automated Control Systems (ACS) enhances decision-making in industrial process management. One of the limitations to the widespread adoption of these technologies in industry is the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial attacks. This study explores the threats in deploying deep learning models for fault diagnosis in ACS using the Tennessee Eastman Process dataset. By evaluating three neural networks with different architectures, we subject them to six types of adversarial attacks and explore five different defense methods. Our results highlight the strong vulnerability of models to adversarial samples and the varying effectiveness of defense strategies. We also propose a novel protection approach by combining multiple defense methods and demonstrate it's efficacy. This research contributes several insights into securing machine learning within ACS, ensuring robust fault diagnosis in industrial processes.</description>

      <title>CoViS-Net: A Cooperative Visual Spatial Foundation Model for Multi-Robot Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robot operation in unstructured environments is often underpinned by spatial understanding through vision. Systems composed of multiple concurrently operating robots additionally require access to frequent, accurate and reliable pose estimates. Classical vision-based methods to regress relative pose are commonly computationally expensive (precluding real-time applications), and often lack data-derived priors for resolving ambiguities. In this work, we propose CoViS-Net, a cooperative, multi-robot visual spatial foundation model that learns spatial priors from data, enabling pose estimation as well as general spatial comprehension. Our model is fully decentralized, platform-agnostic, executable in real-time using onboard compute, and does not require existing networking infrastructure. CoViS-Net provides relative pose estimates and a local bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation, even without camera overlap between robots, and can predict BEV representations of unseen regions. We demonstrate its use in a multi-robot formation control task across various real-world settings. We provide supplementary material online and will open source our trained model in due course. https://sites.google.com/view/covis-net</description>

      <title>Meta-Control: Automatic Model-based Control Synthesis for Heterogeneous Robot Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The requirements for real-world manipulation tasks are diverse and often conflicting; some tasks require precise motion while others require force compliance; some tasks require avoidance of certain regions, while others require convergence to certain states. Satisfying these varied requirements with a fixed state-action representation and control strategy is challenging, impeding the development of a universal robotic foundation model. In this work, we propose Meta-Control, the first LLM-enabled automatic control synthesis approach that creates customized state representations and control strategies tailored to specific tasks. Our core insight is that a meta-control system can be built to automate the thought process that human experts use to design control systems. Specifically, human experts heavily use a model-based, hierarchical (from abstract to concrete) thought model, then compose various dynamic models and controllers together to form a control system. Meta-Control mimics the thought model and harnesses LLM's extensive control knowledge with Socrates' "art of midwifery" to automate the thought process. Meta-Control stands out for its fully model-based nature, allowing rigorous analysis, generalizability, robustness, efficient parameter tuning, and reliable real-time execution.</description>

      <title>Schr\"{o}dinger Bridge with Quadratic State Cost is Exactly Solvable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger bridge is a diffusion process that steers a given distribution to another in a prescribed time while minimizing the effort to do so. It can be seen as the stochastic dynamical version of the optimal mass transport, and has growing applications in generative diffusion models and stochastic optimal control. In this work, we propose a regularized variant of the Schr\"odinger bridge with a quadratic state cost-to-go that incentivizes the optimal sample paths to stay close to a nominal level. Unlike the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge, the regularization induces a state-dependent rate of killing and creation of probability mass, and its solution requires determining the Markov kernel of a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation. We derive this Markov kernel in closed form. Our solution recovers the heat kernel in the vanishing regularization (i.e., diffusion without reaction) limit, thereby recovering the solution of the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge. Our results enable the use of dynamic Sinkhorn recursion for computing the Schr\"odinger bridge with a quadratic state cost-to-go, which would otherwise be challenging to use in this setting. We deduce properties of the new kernel and explain its connections with certain exactly solvable models in quantum mechanics.</description>
