      <title>Observation and manipulation of charge carrier distribution at the SiO$_2$/Si interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using low-energy muons, we map the charge carrier concentration as a function of depth and electric field across the \SiOSi interface up to a depth of \SI{100}{\nano\meter} in Si-based MOS capacitors. The results show that the formation of the anisotropic bond-centered muonium \MuBCz state in Si serves as a direct measure of the local changes in electronic structures. Different band-bending conditions could be distinguished, and the extension of the depletion width was directly extracted using the localized stopping and probing depth of the muons. Furthermore, electron build-up on the Si side of the \SiOO/Si interface, caused by the mirror charge induced by the fixed positive charge in the oxide and the image force effect, was observed. Our work represents a significant extension of the application of the muon spin rotation technique ($\mu$SR) and lays the foundation for further research on direct observation of charge carrier density manipulation at technologically important semiconductor device interfaces.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal singularities dominated by the dissipative photon-magnon coupling in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the magnon-photon coupling in an open cavity magnonic system, which leads to two different nonreciprocal singularities dominated by the dissipative coupling. One type of singularity is the exceptional point, which is just on the exceptional surface in parameter space. The other type of singularity is the bound state in the continuum discovered in the level-attraction-like coupling, which is above the exceptional surface. In experiment, we realized the two different singularities with nonreciprocity and selectivity in an open cavity magnonic system with suitable dissipation rating. Our results can be understood well with the pseudo-Hermitian theory of magnon-polariton system.</description>

      <title>Enhanced fractional quantum Hall gaps in a two-dimensional electron gas coupled to a hovering split-ring resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetotransport of a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas coupled to a hovering split-ring resonator with controllable distance is studied in the quantum Hall regime. The measurements reveal an enhancement by more than a factor 2 of the quantum Hall energy gaps at the fractional filling factors 4/3, 5/3, and 7/5, alongside a concurrent reduction in exchange splitting at odd integer filling factors. Theoretically, we show the strength of both effects to be quantitatively compatible with the emergence of an effective electron-electron long-range attractive interaction mediated by the exchange of virtual cavity photons in the presence of significant spatial gradients of the cavity electric vacuum fields. These results unveil a compelling interplay between cavity quantum electrodynamics and electronic correlations in two-dimensional systems, with profound implications for the manipulation and control of quantum phases in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17675v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators have been studied intensively over the last decades. Earlier research focused on Hermitian Hamiltonians, but recently, peculiar and interesting properties were found by introducing non-Hermiticity. In this work, we apply a quantum geometric approach to various Hermitian and non-Hermitian versions of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. We find that this method allows one to correctly identify different topological phases and topological phase transitions for all SSH models, but only when using the metric tensor containing both left and right eigenvectors. Whereas the quantum geometry of Hermitian systems is Riemannian, introducing non-Hermiticity leads to pseudo-Riemannian and complex geometries, thus significantly generalizing from the quantum geometries studied thus far. One remarkable example of this is the mathematical agreement between topological phase transition curves and lightlike paths in general relativity, suggesting a possibility of simulating space-times in non-Hermitian systems. We find that the metric in non-Hermitian phases degenerates in such a way that it effectively reduces the dimensionality of the quantum geometry by one. This implies that within linear response theory, one can perturb the system by a particular change of parameters while maintaining a zero excitation rate.</description>

      <title>Non-coherent evolution of closed weakly interacting system leads to equidistribution of probabilities of microstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a concept of non-coherent evolution of macroscopic quantum systems. We show that for weakly interacting systems such evolution is a Markovian stochastic process. The rates of transitions between states of the system, that characterize the process, are found by Fermi's golden rule. Such evolution is time-irreversible and leads to the equidistribution of probabilities across every state of the system. Further, we search for time dependence of mean numbers of particles in single-particle states and find that under made assumptions it is governed by Boltzmann collision integral. In this theory, the non-coherence is the mechanism that transforms time-reversible unitary evolution into time-irreversible stochastic evolution. Thus we present the possible solution for the famous time-arrow problem.</description>

      <title>Out-of-plane magnetic phase diagram of Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate Na2Co2TeO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the magnetic properties and mapped out the phase diagram of the honeycomb magnet Na2Co2TeO6 with Co 3d7 in out-of-plane magnetic fields. This material has previously been proposed to show nearest-neighbor Kitaev interactions between Co spins and maybe even Kitaev quantum spin liquid behavior in high fields. At low magnetic fields, we observe a thermal phase transition at TN = 27 K, transitioning from a paramagnetic state to a canonical ferrimagnetic state. Under the application of magnetic fields, a spin flop-like phase transition occurred before saturation of J = 1/2 between 10 K and TN. Below 10 K, a peak-dip-peak structure emerges between 10 and 17 T in the magnetic susceptibility (dM/dH) before the magnetic saturation, reminiscent of magnetic plateau behavior. The measurement of the magnetocaloric effect also shows dip-peak-dip behavior in this field range. Our data can be explained by an XXZ model with a single ion anisotropy and possibly small Kitaev and {\Gamma} exchange interactions. We also unambiguously determined the magnetization saturation field that helps constrain the energy scale of the exchange interactions</description>
