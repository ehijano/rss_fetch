      <title>Large scale paired antibody language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that can identify and neutralise a wide variety of antigens with high specificity and affinity, and constitute the most successful class of biotherapeutics. With the advent of next-generation sequencing, billions of antibody sequences have been collected in recent years, though their application in the design of better therapeutics has been constrained by the sheer volume and complexity of the data. To address this challenge, we present IgBert and IgT5, the best performing antibody-specific language models developed to date which can consistently handle both paired and unpaired variable region sequences as input. These models are trained comprehensively using the more than two billion unpaired sequences and two million paired sequences of light and heavy chains present in the Observed Antibody Space dataset. We show that our models outperform existing antibody and protein language models on a diverse range of design and regression tasks relevant to antibody engineering. This advancement marks a significant leap forward in leveraging machine learning, large scale data sets and high-performance computing for enhancing antibody design for therapeutic development.</description>

      <title>CADGL: Context-Aware Deep Graph Learning for Predicting Drug-Drug Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Examining Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) is a pivotal element in the process of drug development. DDIs occur when one drug's properties are affected by the inclusion of other drugs. Detecting favorable DDIs has the potential to pave the way for creating and advancing innovative medications applicable in practical settings. However, existing DDI prediction models continue to face challenges related to generalization in extreme cases, robust feature extraction, and real-life application possibilities. We aim to address these challenges by leveraging the effectiveness of context-aware deep graph learning by introducing a novel framework named CADGL. Based on a customized variational graph autoencoder (VGAE), we capture critical structural and physio-chemical information using two context preprocessors for feature extraction from two different perspectives: local neighborhood and molecular context, in a heterogeneous graphical structure. Our customized VGAE consists of a graph encoder, a latent information encoder, and an MLP decoder. CADGL surpasses other state-of-the-art DDI prediction models, excelling in predicting clinically valuable novel DDIs, supported by rigorous case studies.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for coarse grained molecular dynamics of proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is crucial for elucidating their biological functions. While all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide detailed information, coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations capture the essential collective motions of proteins at significantly lower computational cost. In this article, we present a unified framework for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation of proteins. Our approach utilizes a tree-structured representation of collective variables, enabling reconstruction of protein Cartesian coordinates with high fidelity. The force field is constructed using a deep neural network trained on trajectories generated from conventional all-atom MD simulations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness using the 168-amino protein target T1027 from CASP14. Statistical distributions of the collective variables and time series of root mean square deviation (RMSD) obtained from our coarse-grained simulations closely resemble those from all-atom MD simulations. This method is not only useful for studying the movements of complex proteins, but also has the potential to be adapted for simulating other biomolecules like DNA, RNA, and even electrolytes in batteries.</description>

      <title>RetroBridge: Modeling Retrosynthesis with Markov Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning is a fundamental challenge in chemistry which aims at designing reaction pathways from commercially available starting materials to a target molecule. Each step in multi-step retrosynthesis planning requires accurate prediction of possible precursor molecules given the target molecule and confidence estimates to guide heuristic search algorithms. We model single-step retrosynthesis planning as a distribution learning problem in a discrete state space. First, we introduce the Markov Bridge Model, a generative framework aimed to approximate the dependency between two intractable discrete distributions accessible via a finite sample of coupled data points. Our framework is based on the concept of a Markov bridge, a Markov process pinned at its endpoints. Unlike diffusion-based methods, our Markov Bridge Model does not need a tractable noise distribution as a sampling proxy and directly operates on the input product molecules as samples from the intractable prior distribution. We then address the retrosynthesis planning problem with our novel framework and introduce RetroBridge, a template-free retrosynthesis modeling approach that achieves state-of-the-art results on standard evaluation benchmarks.</description>
