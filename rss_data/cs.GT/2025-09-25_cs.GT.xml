      <title>Choose Your Battles: Distributed Learning Over Multiple Tug of War Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider N players and K games taking place simultaneously. Each of these games is modeled as a Tug-of-War (ToW) game where increasing the action of one player decreases the reward for all other players. Each player participates in only one game at any given time. At each time step, a player decides the game in which they wish to participate in and the action they take in that game. Their reward depends on the actions of all players that are in the same game. This system of K games is termed `Meta Tug-of-War' (Meta-ToW) game. These games can model scenarios such as power control, distributed task allocation, and activation in sensor networks. We propose the Meta Tug-of-Peace algorithm, a distributed algorithm where the action updates are done using a simple stochastic approximation algorithm, and the decision to switch games is made using an infrequent 1-bit communication between the players. We prove that in Meta-ToW games, our algorithm converges to an equilibrium that satisfies a target Quality of Service reward vector for the players. We then demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm through simulations for the scenarios mentioned above.</description>

      <title>A Novel Framework for Honey-X Deception in Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel, game-theoretic model of deception in two-player, zero-sum games. Our framework leverages an information asymmetry: one player (the deceiver) has access to accurate payoff information, while the other (the victim) observes a modified version of these payoffs due to the deception strategy employed. The deceiver's objective is to choose a deception-action pair that optimally exploits the victim's best response to the altered payoffs, subject to a constraint on the deception's magnitude. We characterize the optimal deceptive strategy as the solution to a bi-level optimization problem, and we provide both an exact solution and an efficient method for computing a high-quality feasible point. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on numerical examples inspired by honeypot deception.</description>

      <title>A User-to-User Resource Reselling Game in Open RAN with Buffer Rollover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of the Open RAN (O-RAN) framework helps enable network slicing through its virtualization, interoperability, and flexibility. To improve spectral efficiency and better meet users' dynamic and heterogeneous service demands, O-RAN's flexibility further presents an opportunity for resource reselling of unused physical resource blocks (PRBs) across users. In this work, we propose a novel game-based user-to-user PRB reselling model in the O-RAN setting, which models the carryover of unmet demand across time slots, along with how users' internal buffer states relate to any PRBs purchased. We formulate the interplay between the users as a strategic game, with each participant aiming to maximize their own payoffs, and we prove the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE) in the game. We furthermore propose an iterative bidding mechanism that converges to this NE. Extensive simulations show that our best approach reduces data loss by 30.5% and spectrum resource wastage by 50.7% while significantly improving social welfare, compared to its absence.</description>

      <title>Pure Exploration via Frank-Wolfe Self-Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study pure exploration in structured stochastic multi-armed bandits, aiming to efficiently identify the correct hypothesis from a finite set of alternatives. For a broad class of tasks, asymptotic analyses reduce to a maximin optimization that admits a two-player zero-sum game interpretation between an experimenter and a skeptic: the experimenter allocates measurements to rule out alternatives while the skeptic proposes alternatives. We reformulate the game by allowing the skeptic to adopt a mixed strategy, yielding a concave-convex saddle-point problem. This viewpoint leads to Frank-Wolfe Self-Play (FWSP): a projection-free, regularization-free, tuning-free method whose one-hot updates on both sides match the bandit sampling paradigm. However, structural constraints introduce sharp pathologies that complicate algorithm design and analysis: our linear-bandit case study exhibits nonunique optima, optimal designs with zero mass on the best arm, bilinear objectives, and nonsmoothness at the boundary. We address these challenges via a differential-inclusion argument, proving convergence of the game value for best-arm identification in linear bandits. Our analysis proceeds through a continuous-time limit: a differential inclusion with a Lyapunov function that decays exponentially, implying a vanishing duality gap and convergence to the optimal value. Although Lyapunov analysis requires differentiability of the objective, which is not guaranteed on the boundary, we show that along continuous trajectories the algorithm steers away from pathological nonsmooth points and achieves uniform global convergence to the optimal game value. We then embed the discrete-time updates into a perturbed flow and show that the discrete game value also converges. Building on FWSP, we further propose a learning algorithm based on posterior sampling. Numerical experiments demonstrate a vanishing duality gap.</description>

      <title>On the Fragility of Contribution Score Computation in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the fragility of contribution evaluation in federated learning, a critical mechanism for ensuring fairness and incentivizing participation. We argue that contribution scores are susceptible to significant distortions from two fundamental perspectives: architectural sensitivity and intentional manipulation. First, we explore how different model aggregation methods impact these scores. While most research assumes a basic averaging approach, we demonstrate that advanced techniques, including those designed to handle unreliable or diverse clients, can unintentionally yet significantly alter the final scores. Second, we explore vulnerabilities posed by poisoning attacks, where malicious participants strategically manipulate their model updates to inflate their own contribution scores or reduce the importance of other participants. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model architectures, implemented within the Flower framework, we rigorously show that both the choice of aggregation method and the presence of attackers are potent vectors for distorting contribution scores, highlighting a critical need for more robust evaluation schemes.</description>

      <title>Proportionality for Constrained Public Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study situations where a group of voters need to take a collective decision over a number of public issues, with the goal of getting a result that reflects the voters' opinions in a proportional manner. Our focus is on interconnected public decisions, where the outcome on one or more issues has repercussions on the acceptance or rejection of other issues in the agenda. We show that the adaptation of classical justified-representation axioms to this enriched setting are always satisfiable only for restricted classes of public agendas. We adapt well-known proportional decision rules to take the structure of the public agenda into account, and we show that they match justified-representation properties in approximation on a class of expressive constraints. We also identify another path to achieving proportionality on interconnected issues via an adaptation of the notion of priceability.</description>
