      <title>Computation of the masses of the elementary particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An approach to gauge theory in the context of locally conformally flat space-time is described. It is discussed how there are a number of natural principal bundles associated with any given locally conformally flat space-time $X$. The simplest of these principal bundles is the bundle $P_X(G)$ with structure group $G=U(2,2)$. An 11 dimensional bundle $Q$ with structure group a certain 7 dimensional group $K$ is constructed by a method involving a reduction of structure group for the bundle $P_X(G)$. It is shown how the gauge groups $U(1)$, $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ can be derived from the geometry of locally conformally flat space-time. Fock spaces of multiparticle states for the fields of the standard model are constructed in the context of bundles with these groups as structure groups. Scattering and other particle interaction processes are defined in terms of linear maps between multiparticle state spaces. A technique for computing analytically and/or computationally the masses of the elementary particles is described. This method involves the computation of a certain quantity called the integral mass spectrum for a given family of particles and then the masses of the particles in the family are determined to be the locations of the peaks of the integral mass spectrum. The method is applied successfully in the electroweak sector to the cases of the charged leptons, $\mu$ and $\tau$, and the Z$^0$ particle.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points and defective resonances in an acoustic scattering system with sound-hard obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with non-Hermitian degeneracy and exceptional points associated with resonances in an acoustic scattering problem with sound-hard obstacles. The aim is to find non-Hermitian degenerate (defective) resonances using numerical methods. To this end, we characterize resonances of the scattering problem as eigenvalues of a holomorphic integral operator-valued function. This allows us to define defective resonances and associated exceptional points based on the geometric and algebraic multiplicities. Based on the theory on holomorphic Fredholm operator-valued functions, we show fractional-order sensitivity of defective resonances with respect to operator perturbation. This property is particularly important in physics and associated with intriguing phenomena, e.g., enhanced sensing and dissipation. A defective resonance is sought based on the perturbation analysis and Nystr\"om discretization of the boundary integral equation. Numerical evidence of the existence of a defective resonance is provided. The numerical results combined with theoretical analysis provide a new insight into novel concepts in non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Universal inverse Radon transforms: Complexity of Radon transforms and the hybrid functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18911v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the reconstruction problem, the universal representation of inverse Radon transforms may imply the needed complexity of the direct Radon transforms which leads to the additional contributions. Meanwhile, in the standard theory of generalized functions, if the origin function which generates the Radon image is a pure-real function, as a rule the complexity of Radon transform becomes in question. In the letter, we demonstrate that the Fourier method together with the hybrid (Wigner-like) function ensure naturally the corresponding complexity. In its turn, this complexity provides not only the additional contribution to the inverse Radon transforms, but also it makes an essential impact on the reconstruction and optimization procedures within the frame of the incorrect problems. The presented method can be effectively used for the practical tasks of reconstruction problems.</description>

      <title>p-adic Ghobber-Jaming Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\{\tau_j\}_{j=1}^n$ and $\{\omega_k\}_{k=1}^n$ be two orthonormal bases for a finite dimensional p-adic Hilbert space $\mathcal{X}$. Let $M,N\subseteq \{1, \dots, n\}$ be such that \begin{align*} \displaystyle \max_{j \in M, k \in N}|\langle \tau_j, \omega_k \rangle|&lt;1, \end{align*} where $o(M)$ is the cardinality of $M$. Then for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$, we show that \begin{align} (1) \quad \quad \quad \quad \|x\|\leq \left(\frac{1}{1-\displaystyle \max_{j \in M, k \in N}|\langle \tau_j, \omega_k \rangle|}\right)\max\left\{\displaystyle \max_{j \in M^c}|\langle x, \tau_j\rangle |, \displaystyle \max_{k \in N^c}|\langle x, \omega_k\rangle |\right\}. \end{align}
  We call Inequality (1) as \textbf{p-adic Ghobber-Jaming Uncertainty Principle}. Inequality (1) is the p-adic version of uncertainty principle obtained by Ghobber and Jaming \textit{[Linear Algebra Appl., 2011]}. We also derive analogues of Inequality (1) for non-Archimedean Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Sprinkled Decoupling for Hammersley's Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we prove a sprinkled decoupling inequality for the stationary Hammersley's interacting particle process. Inspired by the work of Baldasso and Texeira (2018), and Hil\'ario, Kious and Texeira (2020), we apply this inequality to study two distinct problems on the top of this particle process. First, we analyze a detection problem, demonstrating that a fugitive can evade particles, provided that their jump range is sufficiently large. Second, we show that a random walk in a dynamic random environment exhibits ballistic behavior with respect to the characteristic speed of the particle system, under a weak assumption on the probability of being away of this critical speed.</description>

      <title>Entropy from scattering in weakly interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbation theory is used to investigate the evolution of the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem of a bipartite quantum system in the course of a gedanken scattering experiment. We find surprisingly simple criteria for the initial state and the scattering matrix that guarantee that the subsystem entropy increases. The class of states that meet these criteria are more correlated than simple product states of the subsystems. They form a subclass of the set of all separable states, and they can therefore be assembled by classical processes alone.</description>

      <title>Embedding $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})/\mathbb{Z}_2$ in Complex Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified framework demonstrating how the spinor complex Lorentz group SL(2,C)/Z\_2 is realized as a canonical subgroup within a four-dimensional complex Riemannian manifold. Building on the complex, holomorphic metric extension and contour-integration regularization of classical singularities, we show that promoting the metric to a complex-valued tensor on a complex 4-fold enlarges the frame bundle to SO(4,C). Its spin double cover factorizes as a product of two independent SL(2,C) factors modulo a shared Z\_2, and selecting one Weyl factor recovers the familiar SL(2,C)/Z\_2 spin cover of the Lorentz group. By explicitly extending metric components and connection forms into the complex domain, using contour deformations to avoid coordinate-singular loci, we exhibit how left- and right-handed Weyl spinors transform under separate SL(2,C) factors, and how modding out a common Z\_2 reproduces the standard spin-Lorentz structure. In particular, the same contour-integration techniques that yield singularity-free Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions via a holomorphic radial coordinate also furnish a holomorphic spin bundle in which chiral spin representations live without imposing exotic matter or modifying the Einstein equations. This embedding clarifies the geometric origin of chirality, enables holomorphic factorization of curvature and connection forms, and provides a foundation for constructing holomorphic field theories and complexified gravity backgrounds. Our results indicate that extending the Lorentz group into a complex Riemannian setting not only recovers SL(2,C)/Z\_2 in a canonical fashion, but also establishes a geometric arena for studying chiral fermions, Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) instantons, and potential quantum-gravity corrections within a rigorously defined complex manifold.</description>

      <title>Towards a two-scale model for morphogenesis -- How cellular processes influence tissue deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-scale model to resolve essential features of developmental tissue deformations. The model couples individual cellular behavior to the mechanics at tissue scale. This is realized by a multiphase-field model addressing the motility, deformability and interaction of cells on an evolving surface. The surface evolution is due to bending elasticity, with bending properties influenced by the topology of the cellular network, which forms the surface. We discuss and motivate model assumptions, propose a numerical scheme, which essentially scales with the number of cells, and explore computationally the effect of the two-scale coupling on the global shape evolution. The approach provides a step towards more quantitative modeling of morphogenetic processes.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Symmetry Breaking and Interactions in a Symmetry Protected Topological Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the one dimensional massive Thirring model or equivalently the sine-Gordon model in the repulsive regime with general Dirichlet boundary conditions, which are characterized by two boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}$ associated with the left and right boundaries respectively. In the presence of these boundary fields, which explicitly break the charge conjugation symmetry, the system exhibits a duality symmetry which changes the sign of the mass parameter $m_0$ and shifts the values of the boundary fields by $\phi_{L,R}\rightarrow \phi_{L,R}+\pi$. When the mass parameter $m_0&lt;0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=0$, or equivalently due to duality symmetry, when the mass parameter $m_0&gt;0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=\pi$, the system is at a trivial point. Here, the ground state is unique just as in the case of periodic boundary conditions. In contrast, when the mass parameter $m_0&lt;0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=\pi$, and equivalently due to the duality symmetry, when the mass parameter $m_0&gt;0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=0$, the system is at a topological point where it exhibits a symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, which is characterized by the existence of zero energy bound states at both the boundaries. For a given value of the mass parameter $m_0$, we find that these phases remain stable in the presence of symmetry breaking fields at the boundary, provided they are smaller than certain critical values which depend on the strength of the interactions in the bulk. Hence, we show that the stability of the SPT and trivial phases depends on the interplay of the symmetry breaking boundary field values and the bulk interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Noncontextual Pauli Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextuality is a key feature of quantum mechanics, and identification of noncontextual subtheories of quantum mechanics is of both fundamental and practical importance. Recently, noncontextual Pauli Hamiltonians have been defined in the setting of variational quantum algorithms. In this work we rigorously establish a number of properties of noncontextual Pauli Hamiltonians. We prove that these Hamiltonians can be composed of more Pauli operators than diagonal Hamiltonians. This establishes that noncontextual Hamiltonians are able to describe a greater number of physical interactions. We then show that the eigenspaces admit an efficient classical description. We analyse the eigenspace of these Hamiltonians and prove that for every eigenvalue there exists an associated eigenvector whose stabilizer rank scales linearly with the number of qubits. We prove that further structure in these Hamiltonians allow us to derive where degeneracies in the eigenspectrum can arise. We thus open the field to a new class of efficiently simulatable states.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, which is a follow-up of our first paper "Normal forms for ordinary differential operators, I", we extend the explicit parametrisation of torsion free rank one sheaves on projective irreducible curves with vanishing cohomology groups obtained earlier to analogous parametrisation of torsion free sheaves of arbitrary rank with vanishing cohomology groups on projective irreducible curves.
  As an illustration of our theorem we calculate one explicit example of such parametrisation, namely for rank two sheaves on a Weierstrass cubic curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of all possible regular precessions of a heavy asymmetric body with a fixed point not coinciding with the center of mass. The calculations are done in terms of the rotation matrix, by writing the Euler-Poisson equations with all involved vectors parameterized in the Laboratory frame. It is shown that a regular precession is possible if the suspension point is chosen on the straight lines (lying in the principal plane) which are frontiers of the regions where, as the distance from the center of mass increases, the permutation of intermediate and largest moments of inertia occurs. Like the spin of an electron in quantum mechanics, the frequency of regular precession in classical mechanics turns out to be rigidly fixed by two values, i.e., quantized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An infinite 3-parametric family of superintegrable and exactly-solvable quantum models on a plane, admitting separation of variables in polar coordinates, marked by integer index $k$ was introduced in Journ Phys A 42 (2009) 242001 and was called in literature the TTW system. In this paper it is conjectured that the Hamiltonian and both integrals of TTW system have hidden algebra $g^{(k)}$ - it was checked for $k=1,2,3,4$ - having its finite-dimensional representation spaces as the invariant subspaces. It is checked that for $k=1,2,3,4$ that the Hamiltonian $H$, two integrals ${\cal I}_{1,2}$ and their commutator ${\cal I}_{12} = [{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_2]$ are four generating elements of the polynomial algebra of integrals of the order $(k+1)$: $[{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_{12}] = P_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, $[{\cal I}_2,{\cal I}_{12}] = Q_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, where $P_{k+1},Q_{k+1}$ are polynomials of degree $(k+1)$ written in terms of ordered monomials of $H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12}$. This implies that polynomial algebra of integrals is subalgebra of $g^{(k)}$. It is conjectured that all is true for any integer $k$.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of the Poincar{\'e} operator in an ellipsoid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the Poincar\'e operator in triaxial ellipsoids subject to a constant rotation. As explained in the paper, this mathematical problem is interesting for many physical applications. It is known that the spectrum of this bounded self-adjoint operator is pure point with polynomial eigenvectors [Backus &amp; Rieutord, Phys. Rev. E 95 (2017), 053116]. We give two new proofs of this result. Moreover, we describe the large-degree asymptotics of the restriction of that operator to polynomial vector fields of fixed degrees. The main tool is the microlocal analysis of the partial differential equation satisfied by the orthogonal polynomials in ellipsoids. This work also contains numerical calculations of these spectra, showing a very good agreement with the mathematical results.</description>

      <title>Layer potential operators for transmission problems on extension domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the well-posedness of transmission problems on classes of two-sided Sobolev extension domains to give variational definitions for (boundary) layer potential operators and Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators. These classes of domains contain Lipschitz domains, and also domains with fractal boundaries. Although our variational formulation does not involve any measures on the boundary, we recover the classical results in smooth domains by considering the surface measure on the boundary. We discuss properties of these operators and generalize basic results in imaging beyond the Lipschitz case.</description>

      <title>Self-dualities and Galois symmetries in Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that all Feynman integrals within a given family can be expressed as a finite linear combination of master integrals. The master integrals naturally group into sectors. Starting from two loops, there can exist sectors made up of more than one master integral. In this paper we show that such sectors may have additional symmetries. First of all, self-duality, which was first observed in Feynman integrals related to Calabi--Yau geometries, often carries over to non-Calabi--Yau Feynman integrals. Secondly, we show that in addition there can exist Galois symmetries relating integrals. In the simplest case of two master integrals within a sector, whose definition involves a square root $r$, we may choose a basis $(I_1,I_2)$ such that $I_2$ is obtained from $I_1$ by the substitution $r \rightarrow -r$. This pattern also persists in sectors, which a priori are not related to any square root with dependence on the kinematic variables. We show in several examples that in such cases a suitable redefinition of the integrals introduces constant square roots like $\sqrt{3}$. The new master integrals are then again related by a Galois symmetry, for example the substitution $\sqrt{3} \rightarrow -\sqrt{3}$. To handle the case where the argument of a square root would be a perfect square we introduce a limit Galois symmetry. Both self-duality and Galois symmetries constrain the differential equation.</description>

      <title>The integration problem for principal connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the Integration Problem for principal connections. Just as a principal connection on a principal bundle $\phi:Q\rightarrow M$ may be used to split $TQ$ into horizontal and vertical subbundles, a discrete connection may be used to split $Q\times Q$ into horizontal and vertical submanifolds. All discrete connections induce a connection on the same principal bundle via a process known as the Lie or derivative functor. The Integration Problem consists of describing, for a principal connection $\mathcal{A}$, the set of all discrete connections whose associated connection is $\mathcal{A}$. Our first result is that for \emph{flat} principal connections, the Integration Problem has a unique solution among the \emph{flat} discrete connections. More broadly, under a fairly mild condition on the structure group $G$ of the principal bundle $\phi$, we prove that the existence part of the Integration Problem has a solution that needs not be unique. Last, we see that, when $G$ is abelian, given compatible continuous and discrete curvatures the Integration Problem has a unique solution constrained by those curvatures.</description>

      <title>Stable standing waves for Nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01842v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the existence of stable standing waves by considering the associated $L^2$-minimization problem. The presence of a doping profile causes a difficulty in the proof of the strict sub-additivity. A key ingredient is to establish the strict sub-additivity by adapting a scaling argument, which is inspired by \cite{ZZou}. When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, smallness of some geometric quantity related to the domain ensures the existence of stable standing waves.</description>

      <title>Surface Defects in $A$-type Little String Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $A$-type Little String Theories (LSTs) are engineered from parallel M5-branes on a circle $\mathbb{S}_\perp^1$, probing a transverse $\mathbb{R}^4/\mathbb{Z}_M$ background. Below the scale of the radius of $\mathbb{S}_\perp^1$, these theories resemble a circular quiver gauge theory with $M$ nodes of gauge group $U(N)$ and matter in the bifundamental representation (or adjoint in the case of $M=1$). In this paper, we study these LSTs in the presence of a surface defect, which is introduced through the action of a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifold that breaks the gauge groups into $[U(1)]^N$. We provide a combinatoric expression for the non-perturbative BPS partition function for this system. This form allows us to argue that a number of non-perturbative symmetries, that have previously been established for the LSTs, are preserved in the presence of the defect. Furthermore, we discuss the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) limit of the defect partition function: focusing in detail on the case $(M,N)=(1,2)$, we analyse two distinct proposals made in the literature. We unravel an algebraic structure that is responsible for the cancellation of singular terms in the NS limit, which we generalise to generic $(M,N)$. In view of the dualities of higher dimensional gauge theories to quantum many-body systems, we provide indications that our combinatoric expression for the defect partition are useful in constructing and analysing quantum integrable systems in the future.</description>

      <title>Dark states in an integrable XY central spin model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04651v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenstates of central spin models in which the central spin is unentangled with the environment are known as dark states. They have recently been observed in a class of integrable XX models. Here we find that dark states are present in XY models, but only for particular configurations of the central spin magnetic field. We show this via an explicit construction of the Bethe states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate heat semigroups on a quantum automorphism group ${\rm Aut}^+(B)$ of a finite dimensional C*-algebra $B$ and its Plancherel trace. We show ultracontractivity, hypercontractivity, and the spectral gap inequality of the heat semigroups on ${\rm Aut}^+(B)$. Furthermore, we obtain the sharpness of the Sobolev embedding property and the Hausdorff-Young inequality of ${\rm Aut}^+(B)$.</description>

      <title>No-go theorem for environment-assisted invariance in non-unitary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the requirements for quantum operations that achieve environment-assisted invariance (envariance), a symmetry of entanglement. While envariance has traditionally been studied within the framework of local unitary operations, we extend the analysis to consider non-unitary local operations. First, we investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. Furthermore, we prove that this also holds for the multipartite scenario. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations. In addition, we show that the static condition of the eternal black hole in AdS/CFT is violated when the CFTs are coupled to the external baths.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of random band matrices at the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $N\times N$ Hermitian random band matrices $H=(H_{xy})$, whose entries are centered complex Gaussian random variables. The indices $x,y$ range over the $d$-dimensional discrete torus $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$ with $d\in \{1,2\}$ and $N=L^d$. The variance profile $S_{xy}=\mathbb E|h_{xy}|^2$ exhibits a banded structure: specifically, $S_{xy}=0$ whenever the distance $|x-y|$ exceeds a band width parameter $W\le L$. Let $W=L^\alpha$ for some exponent $0&lt;\alpha\le 1$. We show that as $\alpha$ increases from $\mathbf 1_{d=1}/2$ to $1-d/6$, the range of energies corresponding to delocalized eigenvectors gradually expands from the bulk toward the entire spectrum. More precisely, we prove that eigenvectors associated with energies $E$ satisfying $2 - |E| \gg N^{-c_{d,\alpha}}$ are delocalized, where the exponent $c_{d,\alpha}$ is given by $c_{d,\alpha} = 2\alpha - 1$ in dimension 1 and $c_{d,\alpha} = \alpha$ in dimension 2. Furthermore, when $\alpha &gt; 1-d/6$, all eigenvectors of $H$ become delocalized. We further establish quantum unique ergodicity for delocalized eigenvectors, as well as a rigidity estimate for the eigenvalues. Our findings extend previous results -- established in the bulk regime for one-dimensional (1D) (arXiv:2501.01718) and two-dimensional (2D) (arXiv:2503.07606) random band matrices -- to the entire spectrum, including the spectral edges. They also complement the results of arXiv:0906.4047 and arXiv:2401.00492, which concern the edge eigenvalue statistics for 1D and 2D random band matrices.</description>

      <title>A 2D-CFT Factory: Critical Lattice Models from Competing Anyon Condensation Processes in SymTO/SymTFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a ``CFT factory'' : a novel algorithm of methodically generating 2D lattice models that would flow to 2D conformal fixed points in the infrared. These 2D models are realised by giving critical boundary conditions to 3D topological orders (symTOs/symTFTs) described by string-net models, often called the strange correlators. We engineer these critical boundary conditions by introducing a commensurate amount of non-commuting anyon condensates. The non-invertible symmetries preserved at the critical point can be controlled by studying a novel ``refined condensation tree''. Our structured method generates an infinite family of critical lattice models, including the A-series minimal models, and uncovers previously unknown critical points. Notably, we find at least three novel critical points (c$\approx 1.3$, $1.8$, and $2.5$ respectively) preserving the Haagerup symmetries, in addition to recovering previously reported ones. The condensation tree, together with a generalised Kramers-Wannier duality, predicts precisely large swathes of phase boundaries, fixes almost completely the global phase diagram, and sieves out second order phase transitions. This is not only illustrated in well-known examples (such as the 8-vertex model related to the $A_5$ category) but also further verified with precision numerics, using our improved (non-invertible) symmetry-preserving tensor-network RG, in novel examples involving the Haagerup symmetries. We show that critical couplings can be precisely encoded in the categorical data (Frobenius algebras and quantum dimensions in unitary fusion categories), thus establishing a powerful, systematic route to discovering and potentially classifying new conformal field theories.</description>
