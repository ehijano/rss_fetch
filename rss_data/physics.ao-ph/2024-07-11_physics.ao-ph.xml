      <title>HF radar estimation of ocean wave parameters: second-order Doppler spectrum versus Bragg wave modulation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an original technique for the HF radar estimation of the main sea state parameters by exploiting the amplitude modulation of the radar signal time series. While the classical method for ocean wave measurement is based on the second-order ocean Doppler spectrum, this alternative approach makes use of the dominant first-order Bragg echo in the radar signal, which has a larger signal-to-noise ratio and allows for a farther spatial coverage. We apply this method to a yearly set of HF radar data in the vicinity of Toulon (Mediterranean coast of France) and compare it with the classical second-order method, where we use a nearby buoy record as ground truth. The Doppler spectrum-based method is slightly more accurate in estimating the significant wave height and the mean period at a short distance but the temporal approach allows for a significant increase in range and better captures the variability of wave parameters over time.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Seawater Quality Parameter and Treatment with Hydrodynamic Cavitation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of the research was to compare the quality parameters of Seawater before and after hydrodynamic cavitation treatment. The Hydrodynamic Cavitation Method for water treatment gives the highest reduction in Turbidity (100%), the second highest reduction in TSS (83.86%), and the lowest reduction in Na+ (8.47%), according to the study and analysis of various quality parameters. When compared to CPCB Water Quality Criteria, treated water is suitable for outdoor bathing; it again satisfies the standards for classes SW-I, SW-II, SW-III, SW-IV and SW-V, i.e., treated sea water can be used for a variety of purposes, including bathing, contact water sports, commercial fishing, mariculture, ecologically sensitive zones, aesthetics, harbour, waters Navigation and Controlled water disposal. The SAR value of treated water, which is 1.72, indicates it is appropriate for all types of soil and crops. The treated water's WQI, which is 65, showed that it is of Fair quality and may be used for industrial and irrigation uses. Water quality can be improved by recycling the treated water for an additional 24 hours using the hydrodynamic cavitation method. Recycling of one time treated sea water will result in higher-quality water that can be used for a variety of purposes.
  The Hydrodynamic Cavitation method by using venturi - orifice is proven to be the most effective over the other methods. Because it does not require any chemical reagent, hence does not produce any hazardous chemical waste, and maintains an eco-friendly and economically sustainable, environment benign technique for the treatment of Seawater.</description>

      <title>End-to-end data-driven weather forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weather forecasting is critical for a range of human activities including transportation, agriculture, industry, as well as the safety of the general public. Machine learning models have the potential to transform the complex weather prediction pipeline, but current approaches still rely on numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems, limiting forecast speed and accuracy. Here we demonstrate that a machine learning model can replace the entire operational NWP pipeline. Aardvark Weather, an end-to-end data-driven weather prediction system, ingests raw observations and outputs global gridded forecasts and local station forecasts. Further, it can be optimised end-to-end to maximise performance over quantities of interest. Global forecasts outperform an operational NWP baseline for multiple variables and lead times. Local station forecasts are skillful up to ten days lead time and achieve comparable and often lower errors than a post-processed global NWP baseline and a state-of-the-art end-to-end forecasting system with input from human forecasters. These forecasts are produced with a remarkably simple neural process model using just 8\% of the input data and three orders of magnitude less compute than existing NWP and hybrid AI-NWP methods. We anticipate that Aardvark Weather will be the starting point for a new generation of end-to-end machine learning models for medium-range forecasting that will reduce computational costs by orders of magnitude and enable the rapid and cheap creation of bespoke models for users in a variety of fields, including for the developing world where state-of-the-art local models are not currently available.</description>

      <title>The Jive Verification System and its Transformative Impact on Weather Forecasting Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecast verification is critical for continuous improvement in meteorological organizations. The Jive verification system was originally developed to assess the accuracy of public weather forecasts issued by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. It started as a research project in 2015 and gradually evolved to be a Bureau operational verification system in 2022. The system includes daily verification dashboards for forecasters to visualize recent forecast performance and "Evidence Targeted Automation" dashboards for exploring the performance of competing forecast systems. Additionally, there is a Jupyter Notebook server with the Jive Python library which supports research experiments, case studies, and the development of new verification metrics and tools.
  This paper describes the Jive verification system and how it helped bring verification to the forefront at the Bureau of Meteorology, leading to more accurate, streamlined forecasts. Jive has been used to provide evidence to support forecast automation decisions and has helped to understand the evolving role of meteorologists in the forecast process. It has given operational meteorologists tools for evaluating forecast processes, including identifying when and how manual interventions lead to superior predictions. Work on Jive led to new verification science, including novel metrics that are decision-focused, including for extreme conditions. Jive also provided the Bureau with an enterprise-wide data analysis environment and has prompted a clarification of forecast definitions.
  These collective impacts have resulted in more accurate forecasts, ultimately benefiting society, and building trust with forecast users. These positive outcomes highlight the importance of meteorological organizations investing in verification science and technology.</description>
