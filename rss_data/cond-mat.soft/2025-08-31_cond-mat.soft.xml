      <title>DNA Dynamics in Dual Nanopore Tug-of-War</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid state nanopores have emerged as powerful tools for single-molecule sensing, yet the rapid uncontrolled translocation of the molecule through the pore remains a key limitation. We have previously demonstrated that an active dual-nanopore system, consisting of two closely spaced pores operated via feedback controlled biasing, shows promise in achieving controlled, slowed-down translocation. Translocation control is achieved via capturing the DNA in a special tug-of-war configuration, whereby opposing electrophoretic forces at each pore are applied to a DNA molecule co-captured at the two pores. Here, we systematically explore translocation physics during DNA tug-of-war focusing on genomically relevant longer dsDNA using a T$_4$-DNA model (166\,kbp). We find that longer molecules can be trapped in tug-of-war states with an asymmetric partitioning of contour between the pores. Secondly, we explore the physics of DNA disengagement from a tug-of-war configuration, focusing on the dynamics of DNA free-end escape, in particular how the free-end velocity depends on pore voltage, DNA size and the presence of additional DNA strands between the pores (i.e. arising in the presence of folded translocation). These findings validate theoretical predictions derived from a first passage model and provide new insight into the physical mechanisms governing molecule disengagement in tug-of-war.</description>

      <title>Jetting with gels: Soft microgel networks stabilize and extend nozzle-free water jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of high-speed liquid jets is crucial for applications ranging from precision printing to needle-free drug delivery, yet it is fundamentally limited by capillary-driven breakup. A common strategy to stabilize jets is to use surfactants to lower surface tension. However, in nozzle-free jetting driven by surface acoustic waves (SAWs), extreme deformation rates cause conventional surfactants to desorb, calling for alternative strategies to stabilize jets. In particular, we find that tuning the nanoscale softness of PNIPAM microgels provides a robust, biocompatible strategy to overcome this limitation. Soft, low-cross-linker-density microgels form elastic interfacial networks at the air-water interface that suppress surface tension recovery, delay Rayleigh-Plateau instabilities, and extend SAW-driven jet lengths by up to 44%. In contrast, stiffer microgels lose network cohesion under strain, leading to rapid jet breakup. To gain molecular-level insights, we perform dissipative particle dynamics simulations, which reveal that polymer bridges in soft microgels remain entangled during elongation, maintaining a reduced effective surface tension. Finally, a simple scaling analysis, balancing the SAW-driven kinetic energy imparted to the droplet against the surface energy required to form a jet, quantitatively predicts the observed length enhancement. This surfactant-free, biocompatible approach lays the foundation for long-lived jets, enabling precision needle-free drug delivery, high-speed printing, and other high-strain interfacial flow applications.</description>

      <title>Computational study of Adhesion and Friction Behavior of Crosslinked Polymer Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we have utilized a molecular dynamics simulation approach to understand adhesion and friction behaviour of crosslinked polymer networks. We have used breakable quartic bond to model crosslinked polymers. We explored the structural characteristics and evaluated the coefficient of friction (CoF) as a function of crosslinked monomer fraction (cross-linking bond density) in four-fold cross-linked polymer networks. To estimate CoF, a rigid indenter was inserted to different depths of indentation. Subsequently a constant sliding speed was applied while keeping the depths of indentation fixed. Normal and friction forces were calculated at each depth to estimate CoF through a linear curve-fitting. For adhesion studies, using the force vs. displacement curve we quantified adhesion through the forces during the separation of rigid indenter from surface of crosslinked polymeric materials while unloading after indentation into the sample. The results indicate that as the fraction of crosslinked monomers increases, the stiffness of the crosslinked network increases, while the force of adhesion and CoF decrease. Additionally, increasing the depth of indentation during friction leads to higher frictional forces.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation theorem and optimal control of an active tracking particle with information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living systems often function with regulatory interactions, but the question of how activity, stochasticity and regulations work together for achieving different goals still remains puzzling.We propose the model of an active tracking particle with information processing, based on which the entropy production, information flow, and generalised fluctuation theorem are derived.Moreover, the system performance, in terms of the first passage steps and the total energy consumption, are analysed in the variable space of (measurement error, control field), leading to discussions on the optimal control of the system.Not only elucidating the basic concepts involved in a stochastic active system with information processing, this prototypical model could also inspire more elaborated modelings of natural smart organisms and industrial designs of controllable active systems with desired physical performances in the future.</description>

      <title>Probing microscopic dynamics in a uni-axially strained polymer network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new apparatus that probes simultaneously the macroscopic mechanical response and the microscopic motion in polymer networks under uni-axial strain. The setup leverages photon correlation imaging, a space- and time-resolved dynamic light scattering method, to measure the dynamics along three orthogonal directions and on two distinct length scales, from tens of nanometers to a couple of microns. We show how to avoid artifacts due to scattering from the surface of the polymer films and derive a theoretical expression for the intensity correlation function due to a purely affine deformation, showing that the setup sensitivity may be simply tuned by varying the acceptance angle of the collection optics. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of the setup by investigating the microscopic dynamics of a poly(dimethylsiloxne) polymer network under tensile strain in the linear regime. We find that non-affine dynamics dominate on length scales smaller than a few microns, above which the affine response is recovered. Surprisingly, the cross-over length separating the non-affine and affine regimes \textit{increases} upon decreasing the applied tensile strain.</description>

      <title>Replicated liquid theory in $1+\infty$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a replicated liquid theory for structural glasses which exhibit spatial variation of physical quantities along one axis, say $z$-axis. The theory becomes exact with infinite transverse dimension $d-1 \to \infty$. It provides an exact free-energy functional with space-dependent glass order parameter $\Delta_{ab}(z)$. As a first application of the scheme, we study diverging lengths associated with dynamic/static glass transitions of hardspheres with/without confining cavity. The exponents agree with those obtained in previous studies on related mean-field models. Moreover, it predicts a non-trivial spatial profile of the glass order parameter $\Delta_{ab}(z)$ within the cavity which exhibits a scaling feature approaching the dynamical glass transition.</description>

      <title>Confinement Reveals Hidden Splay-Bend Order in Twist-Bend Nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using extensive Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we investigate how spatial confinement affects molecular organization within thin films of the nematic twist-bend ($\mathrm{N_{TB}}$) phase. Our simulations show that confinement markedly amplifies the otherwise elusive splay-bend order, primarily by suppressing the intrinsic three-dimensional heliconical structure characteristic of bulk $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$.
  Remarkably, when the $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$ phase is confined between parallel walls imposing planar anchoring, and the bulk wave vector is oriented parallel to the walls, a smectic splay-bend ($\mathrm{S_{SB}}$) phase spontaneously emerges near the confining surfaces. This intermediate structure subsequently transforms into the bulk $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$ phase either directly via a smectic splay-bend-twist ($\mathrm{S_{SBT}}$) phase or through a sequence involving both the $\mathrm{S_{SBT}}$ and the nematic splay-bend-twist ($\mathrm{N_{SBT}}$) phases. Notably, the $\mathrm{N_{SBT}}$ phase becomes particularly pronounced as the molecular bend angle approaches its maximum attainable value in bulk $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$; this regime occurs in close proximity to the $\mathrm{N}\text{--}\mathrm{S_{A}}\text{--}\mathrm{S_{SB}}$ triple point on the bulk phase diagram.
  Our findings reveal a compelling and intricate interplay among chirality, confinement, and molecular ordering, further evidenced by the calculated elementary director distortions. Crucially, this study opens promising avenues for experimental exploration: confined thin-film geometries serve as powerful model systems for revealing and characterizing novel nematic and smectic liquid-crystal phases that remain elusive in, or currently inaccessible to, bulk experiments.</description>

      <title>Geometrically Frustrated Assembly at Finite Temperature: Phase Transitions from Self-Limiting to Bulk States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric frustration is recognized to generate complex morphologies in self-assembling particulate and molecular systems. In bulk states, frustrated drives structured arrays of topological defects. In the dilute limit, these systems have been shown to form a novel state of self-limiting assembly, in which the equilibrium size of multi-particle domains are finite and well-defined. In this article, we employ Monte Carlo simulations of a recently developed 2D lattice model of geometrically frustrated assembly~\cite{HackneyPhysRevX.13.041010} to study the phase transitions between the self-limiting and defect bulk phase driven by two distinct mechanisms: (i) increasing concentration and (ii) decreasing temperature or frustration. The first transition is mediated by a concentration-driven percolation transition of self-limiting, worm-like domains into an intermediate heterogeneous network mesophase, which gradually fills in at high concentration to form a quasi-uniform defect bulk state. We find that the percolation threshold is weakly dependent on frustration and shifts to higher concentration as frustration is increased, but depends strongly on the ratio of cohesion to elastic stiffness in the model. The second transition takes place between self-limiting assembly at high-temperature/frustration and phase separation into a condensed bulk state at low temperature/frustration. We consider the competing influences that translational and conformational entropy have on the critical temperature/frustration and show that the self-limiting phase is stabilized at higher frustrations and temperatures than previously expected. Taken together, this understanding of the transition pathways from self-limiting to bulk defect phases of frustrated assembly allows us to map the phase behavior of this 2D minimal model over the full range of concentration.</description>

      <title>Thermal Transport Anomalies of Electrolyte Solutions in the Water Supercooled Regime: Signatures of the Liquid-Liquid Water Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water exhibits remarkable anomalies when supercooled, attributed to a hypothesized liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT) between low-density (LDL) and high-density (HDL) liquid phases. Using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we explore thermal transport and coupled effects in supercooled NaCl and LiCl solutions (1-4 m, 200-300 K). At 1 m, thermal conductivity exhibits a pronounced minimum near 220 K, coinciding with maxima in isothermal compressibility and minima in the speed of sound, both of which are signatures of critical fluctuations. The anomalies progressively diminish with increasing salt concentration and vanish at 4 m, suggesting suppression of the LLPT. The Soret coefficient exhibits a striking behavior. Initially thermophobic at high temperatures (&gt; 280 K), becoming thermophilic upon cooling, then reverting to thermophobic below 220 K. This behavior correlates with structural changes in the hydrogen-bond network of water. Specifically, we find that electrolyte solutions dominated by HDL structures, which are characterized by lower tetrahedral order, exhibit thermophobic behavior, whereas thermodynamic states dominated by LDL structures, with higher tetrahedral order, display thermophilic behavior. Furthermore, Seebeck coefficients exhibit sign reversals near 220-230 K, highlighting the thermoelectric sensitivity to structural transformations and temperature. These findings establish thermal transport as a sensitive probe of supercooled water, revealing that electrolyte solutions preserve the water's anomalies deep into the supercooled regime.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear mechanical metamaterial cloaks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of cloaking -- hiding objects from external detection -- has seen wide success in linear systems. Yet, translating these advancements to nonlinear mechanical systems remains an open challenge. Here, we present a new approach to nonlinear mechanical cloaking that frames cloaking as an optimization problem aimed at replicating a target mechanical response. We solve this problem using a differentiable simulation framework coupled with gradient-based optimization. We implement this approach in a class of mechanical metamaterials constructed from rigid units with elastic couplings that support large deformation and contact interactions. Using both numerical simulations and physical experiments, we design optimal cloak structures that effectively mask internal inhomogeneities and shield against external mechanical disturbances both in static and dynamic regimes. This approach provides a versatile design paradigm for creating mechanical systems with integrated cloaking functionality across a broad range of loading scenarios.</description>

      <title>Closely piling up of multiple adhesive fronts in adhesive friction due to re-attachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05283v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a fundamental force, friction exerts a profound influence on various aspects of our daily lives across multiple disciplines. To understand why adhesive friction is associated with the contact area, here we investigate the generic sliding of elastic solids adhered to a rigid surface by considering re-attachment/healing. We then reveal multiple adhesive fronts closely aligning along the interface with the number of these regions generally increasing with the contact area. These adhesive fronts exhibit rich dynamics and their accumulation along an interface can aid each other through re-attachment/healing in friction, apparently resulting in the increase in the calculated shear-off force with the contact area. Based on these findings, we propose a refined law of adhesive friction. Our analysis further suggests that accumulating adhesive fronts along the interface can trigger crack-like propagation of individual fronts at high velocities, which potentially bridges the gap between tribology and fracture mechanics. We also discuss the relevance of this work to earthquake mechanics, which might provide a unified framework that captures key aspects of fault behavior. We expect that this work can supply a fundamental understanding of healing-mediated interfacial phenomena in diverse systems spanning biology, geology, and engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Passive rotational microrheology (RMR) for evaluating the dynamic modulus \(G^*\) of a suspending fluid through the rotational Brownian motion of a spherical probe particle is validated using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of Brownian motion in a viscoelastic fluid. Two methods of RMR are compared: an inertialess RMR based on the Generalized Stokes--Einstein relation for rotational diffusion (RGSER) and the full RMR based on the generalized Langevin equation for rotation, which accounts for fluid and particle inertia. Our analysis, performed using DNS of the fluctuating Oldroyd-B fluid, reveals that inertialess RMR accurately estimates \(G^*\) for \(\omega\lambda \alt 1\), but deviates significantly at high frequencies. In contrast, the full RMR improves \(G^*\) estimation accuracy up to the frequency \(\omega \approx \tau_{s}^{-1}=\eta_{s}/\rho_{f}a^{2}\), where fluid inertia becomes relevant. However, in the ballistic regime (\(t \ll \tau_{s}\)), particle inertia dominates, making accurate \(G^*\) evaluation challenging even with the full RMR. This study clarifies the applicability range of RMR. Additionally, rotational Brownian motion is turned out to be insensitive to periodic boundary conditions, which allows direct application to various mesoscale molecular simulations, including coarse-grained molecular dynamics, dissipative particle dynamics, and fluid dynamics simulations. In conclusion, rotational microrheology offers a promising approach for detailed rheological analysis in complex systems and conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.12955v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The response of cell populations to external stimuli plays a central role in biological mechanical processes such as epithelial wound healing and developmental morphogenesis. Wave-like propagation of a signal of ERK MAP kinase has been shown to direct collective migration in one direction; however, the mechanism based on continuum mechanics under a traveling wave is not fully understood. To elucidate how the traveling wave of the ERK kinase signal directs collective migration, we constructed the mechanical model of the epithelial cell monolayer by considering the signal-dependent coordination of contractile stress and cellular orientation. The proposed model was studied by using an optogenetically-controlled cell system where we found that local signal activation induces changes in cell density and orientation with the direction of propagation. The net motion of the cell population occurred relative to the wave, and the migration velocity showed a maximum in resonance with the velocity of the ERK signal wave. The presented mechanical model was further validated in \textit{in vitro} wound healing process.</description>

      <title>Langevin equations and a geometric integration scheme for the overdamped limit of rotational Brownian motion of axisymmetric particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The translational motion of anisotropic or self-propelled colloidal particles is closely linked with the particle's orientation and its rotational Brownian motion. In the overdamped limit, the stochastic evolution of the orientation vector follows a diffusion process on the unit sphere and is characterized by an orientation-dependent (``multiplicative'') noise. As a consequence, the corresponding Langevin equation attains different forms depending on whether It\=o's or Stratonovich's stochastic calculus is used. We clarify that both forms are equivalent and derive them in a top-down appraoch from a geometric construction of Brownian motion on the unit sphere, based on infinitesimal random rotations. Our approach suggests further a geometric integration scheme for rotational Brownian motion, which preserves the normalization constraint of the orientation vector exactly. We show that a simple implementation of the scheme, based on Gaussian random rotations, converges weakly at order 1 of the integration time step, and we outline an advanced variant of the scheme that is weakly exact for an arbitrarily large time step. Due to a favorable prefactor of the discretization error, already the Gaussian scheme allows for integration time steps that are one order of magnitude larger compared to a commonly used algorithm for rotational Brownian dynamics simulations based on projection on the constraining manifold. For torques originating from constant external fields, we prove by virtue of the Fokker-Planck equation that the constructed diffusion process satisfies detailed balance and converges to the correct equilibrium distribution. The analysis is restricted to time-homogeneous rotational Brownian motion (i.e., a single rotational diffusion constant), which is relevant for axisymmetric particles and also chemically anisotropic spheres, such as self-propelled Janus particles.</description>
