      <title>From Cancer Drivers to Cancer Keepers: Paradigm Shift and Clinical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer research has traditionally focused on identifying driver genes, those with mutations that initiate tumorigenesis. The Cancer Driver Gene (CDG) paradigm, further supported by the observation of oncogene addiction in tumors, has successfully guided the development of targeted therapies. However, the limitations of this driver-centric view, highlighted by the broad emergence of frequent therapeutic resistance, the presence of driver mutations in healthy tissues or individuals, and the lack of identifiable drivers in many tumors, call for a shift in perspective and clinical practice. The latest network controllability perspective on cancer cells introduced the concept of Cancer Keeper Genes (CKGs) and a CKG-based paradigm for cancer therapeutics. The new concept encompasses the concept of non-oncogene addiction, emphasizing reliance on non-mutated pathways crucial for maintaining oncogenic cellular states. Here, we explore the transition towards a system-level understanding of cancer based on the CKG paradigm, emphasizing the essential role of genes required for tumor maintenance, irrespective of their initiating function or mutational capacity. We discuss clinical implications of this paradigm shift, highlighting the progress made so far and potential of targeting non-driver CKGs, genes involved in processes like DNA damage response, proteostasis, and metabolism, as a promising strategy to overcome therapeutic challenges and achieve more durable cancer control. Targeting these maintenance vulnerabilities represents a critical evolution in precision oncology, moving towards therapies designed to dismantle the networks sustaining malignancies.</description>

      <title>Simulating stochastic population dynamics: The Linear Noise Approximation can capture non-linear phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is an abundance of highly stochastic, non-linear phenomena present in population dynamics across various fields, including molecular biology, epidemiology, and ecology. Oscillations and multi-stability are particularly prevalent in gene regulation systems. None of the currently available stochastic models for population dynamics are accurate and computationally efficient for long-term predictions. A prominent model in this field, known as the Linear Noise Approximation (LNA), is computationally efficient for tasks such as simulation, sensitivity analysis, and parameter estimation, still, it is only accurate for linear systems and short-time predictions. Other models may achieve greater accuracy across a broader range of systems, but they sacrifice computational efficiency and analytical tractability. This paper demonstrates that, with specific modifications, the LNA can indeed accurately capture non-linear dynamics in population dynamics. We introduce a new framework that employs centre manifold theory, a classical concept in non-linear dynamical systems. This approach allows us to identify simple, specialised modifications to the LNA tailored to classes of qualitatively similar non-linear dynamical systems. With these modifications, the LNA can achieve accurate long-term predictions without compromising its computational efficiency. We apply our methodology to a class of oscillatory systems and a class of bi-stable systems, and we provide multiple examples in molecular population dynamics that showcase accurate long-term predictions, and significant improvements in computational efficiency.</description>
