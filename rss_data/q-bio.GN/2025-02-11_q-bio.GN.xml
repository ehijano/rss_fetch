      <title>Find Central Dogma Again</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in various biological sequence analysis tasks, such as sequence classification, structure prediction, and function prediction. Similar to advancements in AI for other scientific fields, deeper research into biological LLMs has begun to focus on using these models to rediscover important existing biological laws or uncover entirely new patterns in biological sequences.This study leverages GPT-like LLMs to utilize language transfer capabilities to rediscover the genetic code rules of the central dogma. In our experimental design, we transformed the central dogma into a binary classification problem of aligning DNA sequences with protein sequences, where positive examples are matching DNA and protein sequences, and negative examples are non-matching pairs.We first trained a GPT-2 model from scratch using a dataset comprising protein sequences, DNA sequences, and sequences from languages such as English and Chinese. Subsequently, we fine-tuned the model using the English similarity judgment dataset from PAWS-X. When tested on a dataset for DNA and protein sequence alignment judgment, the fine-tuned model achieved a classification accuracy of 76%. The study also analyzed factors contributing to this zero-shot capability, including model training stability and types of training data.This research demonstrates that LLMs can, through the transfer of natural language capabilities and solely relying on the analysis of sequences themselves, rediscover the central dogma without prior knowledge of it. This study opens a new door for AI-driven biological research.</description>

      <title>Static Three-Dimensional Structures Determine Fast Dynamics Between Distal Loci Pairs in Interphase Chromosomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Live cell imaging experiments have shown that, although eukaryotic chromosomes are compact, the distal dynamics between enhancers and promoters are unexpectedly rapid and cannot be explained by standard polymer models. The discordance between the compact static chromatin organization (structure) and the relaxation times (dynamics) is a conundrum that violates the expected structure-function relationship. To resolve the puzzle, we developed a theory to predict chromatin dynamics by first calculating the accurate three-dimensional (3D) structure using static Hi-C contact maps or fixed-cell imaging data. The calculated 3D coordinates are used to accurately forecast the two-point dynamics reported in recent experiments that simultaneously monitor chromatin dynamics and transcription. Strikingly, the theory not only predicts the observed fast enhancer-promoter dynamics but also reveals a novel scaling relationship between two-point relaxation time and genomic separation that is in near quantitative agreement with recent experiments. The theory also predicts that cohesin depletion speeds up the dynamics between distal loci. Both the rapid dynamics between distal loci pairs in interphase chromosomes and the acceleration of chromatin loci diffusion upon cohesin depletion are explained in terms of structure-based centrality measure used in graph theory. Our framework shows that chromatin dynamics can be predicted based solely on static experimental data, reinforcing the concept that the three-dimensional structure determines their dynamic behavior. The generality of the theory opens new avenues for exploring chromatin dynamics, especially transcriptional dynamics, across different biological contexts.</description>
