      <title>Classification of solutions to the isotropic horospherical $p$-Minkowski problem in hyperbolic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \cite{LX}, the first author and Xu introduced and studied the horospherical $p$-Minkowski problem in hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$. In particular, they established the uniqueness result for solutions to this problem when the prescribed function is constant and $p\ge -n$. This paper focuses on the isotropic horospherical $p$-Minkowski problem in hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^{2}$, which corresponds to the equation \begin{equation}\label{0}
  \varphi^{-p}\left(\varphi_{\theta\theta}-\frac{\varphi_{\theta}^2}{2\varphi}+\frac{\varphi-\varphi^{-1}}{2}\right)=\gamma\quad\text{on}\ \mathbb{S}^1, \end{equation} where $\gamma$ is a positive constant. We provide a classification of solutions to the above equation for $p\ge -7$, as well as a nonuniqueness result of solutions for $p&lt;-7$. Furthermore, we extend this problem to the isotropic horospherical $q$-weighted $p$-Minkowski problem in hyperbolic plane and derive some uniqueness and nonuniqueness results.</description>

      <title>Packings of Smoothed Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This book uses optimal control theory to prove that the most unpackable centrally symmetric convex disk in the plane is a smoothed polygon. A smoothed polygon is a polygon whose corners have been rounded in a special way by arcs of hyperbolas. To be highly unpackable means that even densest packing of that disk has low density.
  Motivated by Minkowski's geometry of numbers, researchers began to search for the most unpackable centrally symmetric convex disk (in brief, the most unpackable disk) starting in the early 1920s. In 1934, Reinhardt conjectured that the most unpackable disk is a smoothed octagon. Working independently of Reinhardt, Mahler attempted without success in 1947 to prove that the most unpackable disk must be a smoothed polygon. This book proves what Mahler set out to prove: Mahler's First conjecture on smoothed polygons. His second conjecture is identical to the Reinhardt conjecture, which remains open.
  This book explores the many remarkable structures of this packing problem, formulated as a problem in optimal control theory on a Lie group, with connections to hyperbolic geometry and Hamiltonian mechanics. Bang-bang Pontryagin extremals to the optimal control problem are smoothed polygons. Extreme difficulties arise in the proof because of chattering behavior in the optimal control problem, corresponding to possible smoothed polygons with infinitely many sides that need to be ruled out. To analyze and eliminate the possibility of chattering solutions, the book introduces a discrete dynamical system (the Poincare first recurrence map) and gives a full description of its fixed points, stable and unstable manifolds, and basin of attraction on a blowup centered at a singular set. Some proofs in this book are computer-assisted using a computer algebra system.</description>

      <title>Total orders realizable as the distances between two sets of points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we give a negative answer to a question proposed by Almendra-Hern\'andez and Mart\'inez-Sandoval. Let $n\le m$ be positive integers and let $X$ and $Y$ be sets of sizes $n$ and $m$ in $\mathbb R^{n-1}$ such that $X\cup Y$ is in generic position. There is a natural order on $X\times Y$ induced by the distances between the corresponding points. The question is if all possible orders on $X\times Y$ can be obtained in this way. We show that the answer is negative when $n&lt;m$. The case $n=m$ remains open.</description>
