      <title>Hill's Lunar Equations, Series, Convergence, Motion of the Perigee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Hill's lunar equations, series and the motion of the perigee, and we use computers to go farther than has previously been known, calculating the coefficients of Hill's series up to order 24 in m, and the coefficients that do not depend on a_0 up to order 30. Numerical calculations indicate that the radius of convergence of Hill's series is somewhere near the value of m of the cusped orbit (0.560958), which we formulate as a conjecture. We calculate the motion of the perigee using a linearization of the equation for the anomalistic period, as in Hill's documentation, but with some discrepancies.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous noise-induced extreme events and synchronization in a globally coupled network of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of a globally coupled network of heterogeneous FitzHugh Nagumo (FHN) oscillators under stochastic influences, with particular emphasis on the emergence of extreme events (EE). While previous studies explored FHN networks subjected to homogeneous noise, revealing behaviors such as noise-induced synchronization, stochastic resonance, and coherence resonance, the impact of noise heterogeneity remains poorly understood. Moreover, the emergence of EE under heterogeneous stochastic excitation has largely been overlooked. To address these gaps, we capture the natural variability in neuronal responses to external stimuli by introducing nonidentical noise sources, thereby reflecting diversity across the network. Our results reveal that EE can arise both globally, where large excursions occur collectively across the entire network, and partially, where only a subset of oscillators exhibits extreme activity depending on the interplay between noise intensity and coupling strength. We further identify three distinct classes of EE that enrich the system's dynamical repertoire and propose a quantitative metric capable of distinguishing between global and local occurrences. Remarkably, we demonstrate that even under heterogeneous noise inputs, noise can synchronize EE across the network, underscoring the robustness of collective dynamics in stochastic regimes. Furthermore, causal interaction analysis between oscillator pairs provides mechanistic insights into the initiation and propagation of EE. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first demonstration of both partially and globally synchronized EE triggered solely by noise in a network of coupled oscillators. These findings enhance our understanding of noise-driven collective behavior in complex systems and provide new insights into neuronal dynamics under random influences.</description>

      <title>Multivariate time series prediction using clustered echo state network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many natural and physical processes can be understood by analyzing multiple system variables evolving, forming a multivariate time series. Predicting such time series is challenging due to the inherent noise and interdependencies among variables. Echo state networks (ESNs), a class of Reservoir Computing (RC) models, offer an efficient alternative to conventional recurrent neural networks by training only the output weights while keeping the reservoir dynamics fixed, reducing computational complexity. We propose a clustered ESNs (CESNs) that enhances the ability to model and predict multivariate time series by organizing the reservoir nodes into clusters, each corresponding to a distinct input variable. Input signals are directly mapped to their associated clusters, and intra-cluster connections remain dense while inter-cluster connections are sparse, mimicking the modular architecture of biological neural networks. This architecture improves information processing by limiting cross-variable interference and enhances computational efficiency through independent cluster-wise training via ridge regression. We further explore different reservoir topologies, including ring, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER), and scale-free (SF) networks, to evaluate their impact predictive performance. Our algorithm works well across diverse real-world datasets such as the stock market, solar wind, and chaotic R\"ossler system, demonstrating that CESNs consistently outperform conventional ESNs in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness to noise, particularly when using ER and SF topologies. These findings highlight the adaptability of CESNs for complex, multivariate time series forecasting.</description>

      <title>Lazy Diffusion: Mitigating spectral collapse in generative diffusion-based stable autoregressive emulation of turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent flows posses broadband, power-law spectra in which multiscale interactions couple high-wavenumber fluctuations to large-scale dynamics. Although diffusion-based generative models offer a principled probabilistic forecasting framework, we show that standard DDPMs induce a fundamental \emph{spectral collapse}: a Fourier-space analysis of the forward SDE reveals a closed-form, mode-wise signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that decays monotonically in wavenumber, $|k|$ for spectra $S(k)\!\propto\!|k|^{-\lambda}$, rendering high-wavenumber modes indistinguishable from noise and producing an intrinsic spectral bias. We reinterpret the noise schedule as a spectral regularizer and introduce power-law schedules $\beta(\tau)\!\propto\!\tau^\gamma$ that preserve fine-scale structure deeper into diffusion time, along with \emph{Lazy Diffusion}, a one-step distillation method that leverages the learned score geometry to bypass long reverse-time trajectories and prevent high-$k$ degradation. Applied to high-Reynolds-number 2D Kolmogorov turbulence and $1/12^\circ$ Gulf of Mexico ocean reanalysis, these methods resolve spectral collapse, stabilize long-horizon autoregression, and restore physically realistic inertial-range scaling. Together, they show that na\"ive Gaussian scheduling is structurally incompatible with power-law physics and that physics-aware diffusion processes can yield accurate, efficient, and fully probabilistic surrogates for multiscale dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>A new use of nonlocal symmetries for computing Liouvillian first integrals of rational second order ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we present an efficient method for finding and using a nonlocal symmetry admitted by a rational second order ordinary differential equation (rational 2ODE) in order to find a Liouvillian first integral (belonging to a vast class of Liouvillian functions). In a first stage, we construct an algorithm (improving the methodde veloped in [1]) that computes a nonlocal symmetry of a rational 2ODE. In ase cond stage, based on the knowledge of this symmetry, it is possible to construct three polynomial vector fields (in R2), which "share" the Liouvillian first integral with the rational 2ODE. These "plane" polynomial vector fields can be used to construct a procedure (based on an idea developed in [2]) to determine an integrating factor for the rational 2ODE with a fast probabilistic algorithm. The main advantages of the proposed method are: the obtaining of the nonlocal symmetry is algorithmic and very efficient and, furthermore, its use to find an integrating factor is a sequence of linear or quasilinear processes.</description>

      <title>Control Strategy for Generalized Synchrony in Coupled Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical systems can be coupled in a manner that is designed to drive the resulting dynamics onto a specified lower dimensional submanifold in the phase space of the combined system. On the submanifold, the variables of the two systems have a well-specified functional relationship. This process can be viewed as a control technique that ensures generalized synchronization. Depending on the nature of the dynamical systems and the specified submanifold, different coupling functions can be derived in order to achieve a desired control objective. We discuss a circuit implementation of this strategy for coupled chaotic Lorenz oscillators, as well as a demonstration of the methodology for designing coordinated motion (swarming) in a set of autonomous drones.</description>

      <title>Phase locking and multistability in the topological Kuramoto model on cell complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological Kuramoto model generalizes classical synchronization models by including higher-order interactions, with oscillator dynamics defined on cells of arbitrary dimension within simplicial or cell complexes. In this article, we demonstrate multistability in the topological Kuramoto model and develop the topological nonlinear Kirchhoff conditions algorithm to identify all phase-locked states on arbitrary cell complexes. The algorithm is based on a generalization of Kirchhoff's laws to cell complexes of arbitrary dimension and nonlinear interactions between cells. By applying this framework to rings, Platonic solids, and simplexes, as minimal representative motifs of larger networks, we derive explicit bounds (based on winding number constraints) that determine the number of coexisting stable states. We uncover structural cascades of multistability, inherited from both lower and higher dimensions and demonstrate that cell complexes can generate richer multistability patterns than simplicial complexes of the same dimension. Moreover, we find that multistability patterns in cell complexes appear to be determined by the number of boundary cells, hinting a possible universal pattern.</description>
