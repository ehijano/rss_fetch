      <title>The fate of $p$-wave spin polarization in helimagnets with Rashba spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been realized that magnetic systems with coplanar magnetic order that are invariant under the combined operation of time-reversal and translation with half a unit cell feature energy bands with a symmetry-protected $p$-wave spin polarization. Such $p$-wave magnets are a sought-after spin analogy of unconventional triplet superconducting pairing and show promise for use in spintronics. Metallic helimagnets provide a realization of $p$-wave magnetism, but such order often occurs in systems lacking inversion symmetry so that Rashba spin-orbit interactions can be prominent. An important question is therefore how the magnitude and the existence of $p$-wave spin polarization is affected by Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Here, we prove that while the $p$-wave symmetry of the spin-polarized bands is strictly speaking removed by spin-orbit interactions in helimagnets unless the period of the helix is fine-tuned, the actual quantitative deviation from $p$-wave symmetry is extremely weak unless the period of the helix is only a few lattice sites. Thereafter, we show that the $p$-wave magnetism becomes completely robust in pairs of antiferromagnetically coupled helices. More precisely, the $p$-wave spin-polarization of the bands then appears regardless of the periodicity and regardless of the strength of the spin-orbit interactions. This shows that antiferromagnetically coupled helimagnetic chains produce robust $p$-wave spin polarization free of fine-tuning requirements, making them attractive for potential spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Dielectrophoresis-Enhanced Graphene Field-Effect Transistors for Nano-Analyte Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectrophoretic (DEP) sensing is an extremely important sensing modality that enables the rapid capture and detection of polarizable particles of nano-scale size. This makes it a versatile tool for applications in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and materials science. Because DEP relies upon the creation of sharp electrode edges, its sensitivity is fundamentally limited by the electrode thickness. Graphene, with its monolayer thickness, enables scaling of the DEP force, allowing trapping of particles at graphene edges at ultra-low voltages. However, to date, this enhanced trapping efficiency of graphene has not been translated into an effective sensing geometry. Here, we demonstrate the expansion of graphene DEP trapping capability into a graphene field effect transistor (GFET) geometry that allows the trapped particles to be electrically detected. This four-terminal multi-functional hybrid device structure operates in three distinct modes: DEP, GFET, and DEP-GFET. By segmenting the channel of the GFET into multiple parallel channels, greatly increased density of particle trapping is demonstrated using fluorescence microscopy analysis. We show further enhancement of the trapping efficiency using engineered "nano-sites," which are holes in the graphene with size on the order of 200-300 nm. Scanning electron microscope analysis of immobilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) shows trapping efficiency &gt;90% for properly engineered nano-sites. Using nano-site trapping, we also demonstrate real-time, rapid electrical sensing of AuNPs, with &gt;2% current change occurring in 4.1 seconds, as well as rapid sensing of a variety of biomolecule-coated nanoparticles. This work shows that graphene DEP is an effective platform for nanoparticle and bio-molecule sensing that overcomes diffusion-limited and Brownian motion-based interactions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of spin spirals in a voltage biased 1D conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the fate of spiral order in a one-dimensional system of localized magnetic moments coupled to itinerant electrons under a voltage bias. Within an adiabatic approximation for the dynamics of the localized spins, and in the presence of a phenomenological damping term, we demonstrate the occurrence of various dynamical regimes: At small bias a rigidly rotating non-coplanar magnetic structure is realized which, by increasing the applied voltage, transitions to a quasi-periodic and, finally, fully chaotic evolution. These phases can be identified by transport measurements. In particular, the rigidly rotating state results in an average transfer of spin polarization. We analyze in detail the dependence of the rotation axis and frequency on system's parameters and show that the spin dynamics slows down in the thermodynamic limit, when a static conical state persists to arbitrarily long times. Our results suggest the possibility of discovering non-trivial dynamics in other symmetry-broken quantum states under bias.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of hydrodynamics in a Galilean quantum Hall crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamic effective field theory for Galilean-invariant quantum Hall systems with spontaneously broken translational symmetry. Neglecting the role of energy conservation in a low-temperature regime, the hydrodynamic mode is a magnetophonon with quartic attenuation: $\omega\sim \pm k^2-\mathrm{i} k^z$ with $z=4$. However, this linear response theory is unstable, and flows to a non-trivial dynamical universality class with $z\approx 3$. We observe this scaling in numerical simulations of many-body classical Hamiltonian dynamics, in a model of an electronic crystal in the lowest Landau level. Observing this magnetophonon decay rate in a quantum Hall crystal represents a promising setting to detect an analogue of a "fractonic dynamical universality class" in a solid-state system, e.g. using microwave impedance microscopy.</description>

      <title>Quantum charge sensing using semiconductor device based on $\delta$-layer tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a novel nanoscale device concept based on a highly doped $\delta$-layer tunnel junction embedded in a semiconductor for charge sensing. Recent advances in Atomic Precision Advanced Manufacturing (APAM) processes have enabled the fabrication of devices based on quasi-2D, highly conductive, highly doped regions in semiconductor materials. In this work, we demonstrate that FET-based sensors utilizing APAM $\delta$-layer tunnel junctions are ultrasensitive to the presence of charges near the tunnel junction, allowing the use of these devices for detecting charges by observing changes in the electrical current. We demonstrate that these devices can enhance the sensitivity in the limit, i.e. for small concentrations of charges, exhibiting significantly superior sensitivity compared to traditional FET-based sensors. We also propose that the extreme sensitivity arises from the strong quantization of the conduction band in these highly-confined systems.</description>

      <title>Local optical conductivity of strain solitons in bilayer graphene with arbitrary soliton angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the electronic band structure and local optical conductivity of domain wall solitons in bilayer graphene (as well as twisted bilayer graphene) with arbitrary soliton angle, which characterizes the local strain direction. We demonstrate that the soliton angle provides an important yet underexplored degree of freedom that can strongly modify the local optical conductivity. The conductivity spectrum features resonance peaks associated with interband transitions involving the topological as well as high-energy soliton states. Two most prominent peaks exhibit continuous suppression and enhancement, respectively, with the soliton angle. The dependence of the peaks on Fermi energy provides important information about the soliton band structure. The local optical conductivity exhibits substantial spatial dependence, which can be used to study the spatial distribution of the soliton states. Furthermore, we show that the conductivity spectra for all soliton angles are broadly tunable by external pressure, which can double the energies of the resonance peaks in experimentally achievable pressure ranges.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Resonance Spectroscopy: Characterizing Fast Dynamics with Slow Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system's internal dynamics and its interaction with the environment can be determined by tracking how external perturbations affect its transition rates between states. However, accurately measuring these rates poses a significant challenge, especially when they span a wide range of time scales. Here we introduce a broadband measurement method, called stochastic resonance spectroscopy (SRS), that operates in the frequency domain and quantifies the stochastic dynamics of atomic-scale quantum systems. We apply this method to determine spin switching rates in a scanning tunneling microscope over an extremely wide frequency range, from 199 ms^-1 for few-atom structures to 1.73 ns^-1 for individual atoms. SRS relies on the universal phenomenon of stochastic resonance which synchronizes stochastic dynamics to an oscillating perturbation. We develop an analytical theory that extracts quantitative transition rates from scanning tunneling microscopy measurements of the frequency-dependent tunnel current and show that the signal is dominated by homodyne detection. Our theory indicates that SRS is not limited to spin dynamics and we corroborate this by measuring transport dynamics through a bound state in a superconductor. We anticipate that the ability to characterize broadband stochastic dynamics at the atomic scale will enable insights into excited-state dynamics of quantum systems and even non-Markovian processes emerging from correlations with the environment.</description>

      <title>Light-induced thermal noise \textit{anomaly} governed by quantum metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, thermal noise in electric currents, arising from thermal agitation, is expected to increase with temperature $T$ and disappear as $T$ approaches zero. Contrary to this expectation, we discover that the resonant DC thermal noise (DTN) in photocurrents not only persists at $T=0$ but also exhibits a divergence proportional to $1/T$. This thermal noise \textit{anomaly} arises from the unique electron-photon interactions near the Fermi surface, manifesting as the interplay between the inherent Fermi-surface property and the resonant optical selection rules of DTN, and thereby represents an unexplored noise regime. Notably, we reveal that this \textit{anomalous} DTN, especially in time-reversal-invariant systems, is intrinsically linked to the quantum metric. We illustrate this \textit{anomalous} DTN in massless Dirac materials, including two-dimensional graphene, the surfaces of three-dimensional topological insulators, and three-dimensional Weyl semimetals, where the quantum metric plays a pivotal role. Finally, we find that the total noise spectrum at low temperatures, which includes both the DC shot noise and the \textit{anomalous} DTN, will universally peak at $\omega_p=2|\mu|$ with $\omega_p$ the frequency of light and $\mu$ the chemical potential of the bulk crystals.</description>

      <title>Scaterring of Massless Quasiparticles in the 3He-A Superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the scattering of fermionic quasiparticles in the presence of radial disgyrations and symmetric vortices in the superfluid 3He-A. We consider a Volovik analog model for the description of these defects and investigate the scattering of fermionic quasiparticles in this background. Furthermore, we solve the massless Dirac equation employing this methodology to gain comprehensive insights into the scattering phenomena and its dependence on the geometric properties. These results validate the optical theorem and highlight the role of defect topology in the scattering process.</description>

      <title>Electron-Electron Interactions in Device Simulation via Non-equilibrium Green's Functions and the GW Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous scaling of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) has led to device geometries where charged carriers are increasingly confined to ever smaller channel cross sections. This development is associated with reduced screening of long-range Coulomb interactions. To accurately predict the behavior of such ultra-scaled devices, electron-electron (e-e) interactions must be explicitly incorporated in their quantum transport simulation. In this paper, we present an \textit{ab initio} atomistic simulation framework based on density functional theory, the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, and the self-consistent GW approximation to perform this task. The implemented method is first validated with a carbon nanotube test structure before being applied to calculate the transfer characteristics of a silicon nanowire MOSFET in a gate-all-around configuration. As a consequence of e-e scattering, the energy and spatial distribution of the carrier and current densities both significantly change, while the on-current of the transistor decreases owing to the Coulomb repulsion between the electrons. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the resulting bandgap modulation of the nanowire channel as a function of the gate-to-source voltage could potentially improve the device performance. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first one reporting large-scale atomistic quantum transport simulations of nano-devices under non-equilibrium conditions and in the presence of e-e interactions within the GW approximation.</description>

      <title>Metallic collinear antiferromagnets with mirror-symmetric and asymmetric spin-splittings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we theoretically describe a distinct class of two-dimensional N\'{e}el ordered metallic antiferromagnets on a honeycomb-like lattice in which the two sublattices are connected only by a combination of time-reversal and mirror symmetry operations. As a result of this symmetry, conducting fermions have antiferromagnetic spin-splitting consistent with the symmetry, the mirror-symmetric spin-splitting. It is shown that the anomalous spin Hall effect is expected in such systems. We also consider a system in which there are no symmetries between the sublattices and obtain asymmetric spin-splitting. Such systems are expected to have the anomalous Hall effect. Our theoretical models suggest that conducting fermions in the MnTe antiferromagnet may be described by either of the obtained spin-splittings, which appear almost as the $d-$wave symmetric and which has been recently observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimal operation of hole spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hole spins in silicon or germanium quantum dots have emerged as a compelling solid-state platform for scalable quantum processors. Besides relying on well-established manufacturing technologies, hole-spin qubits feature fast, electric-field-mediated control stemming from their intrinsically large spin-orbit coupling [1, 2]. This key feature is accompanied by an undesirable susceptibility to charge noise, which usually limits qubit coherence. Here, by varying the magnetic-field orientation, we experimentally establish the existence of ``sweetlines'' in the polar-azimuthal manifold where the qubit is insensitive to charge noise. In agreement with recent predictions [3], we find that the observed sweetlines host the points of maximal driving efficiency, where we achieve fast Rabi oscillations with quality factors as high as 1200. Furthermore, we demonstrate that moderate adjustments in gate voltages can significantly shift the sweetlines. This tunability allows multiple qubits to be simultaneously made insensitive to electrical noise, paving the way for scalable qubit architectures that fully leverage all-electrical spin control. The conclusions of this experimental study, performed on a silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor device, are expected to apply to other implementations of hole spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Competing Orbital Magnetism and Superconductivity in electrostatically defined Josephson Junctions of Alternating Twisted Trilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism within a single material system represents a long-standing goal in condensed matter physics. Van der Waals-based moir\'e superlattices provide an exceptional platform for exploring competing and coexisting broken symmetry states. Alternating twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) exhibits robust superconductivity at the magic angle of 1.57{\deg} and 1.3{\deg}, with suppression at intermediate twist angles. In this study, we investigate the intermediate regime and uncover evidence of orbital magnetism. As previously reported, superconductivity is suppressed near the charge neutrality point (CNP) and emerges at larger moir\'e fillings. Conversely, we find orbital magnetism most substantial near the CNP, diminishing as superconductivity develops. This complementary behavior is similarly observed in the displacement field phase space, highlighting a competitive interplay between the two phases. Utilizing gate-defined Josephson junctions, we probe orbital magnetism by electrostatically tuning the weak links into the magnetic phase, revealing an asymmetric Fraunhofer interference pattern. The estimated orbital ferromagnetic ordering temperature is approximately half the superconducting critical temperature, coinciding with the onset of Fraunhofer asymmetry. Our findings suggest that the observed orbital magnetism is driven by valley polarization and is distinct from the anomalous Hall effect reported at integer fillings in twisted graphene systems. These results offer insights into the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <title>Field-Resilient Supercurrent Diode in a Multiferroic Josephson Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The research on supercurrent diodes has surged rapidly due to their potential applications in electronic circuits at cryogenic temperatures. To unlock this functionality, it is essential to find supercurrent diodes that can work consistently at zero magnetic field and under ubiquitous stray fields generated in electronic circuits. However, a supercurrent diode with robust field tolerance is currently lacking. Here, we demonstrate a field-resilient supercurrent diode by incorporating a multiferroic material into a Josephson junction. We first observed a pronounced supercurrent diode effect at zero magnetic field. More importantly, the supercurrent rectification persists over a wide and bipolar magnetic field range beyond industrial standards for field tolerance. By theoretically modeling a multiferroic Josephson junction, we unveil that the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and multiferroicity underlies the unusual field resilience of the observed diode effect. This work introduces multiferroic Josephson junctions as a new field-resilient superconducting device for cryogenic electronics.</description>

      <title>Control of open quantum systems: Manipulation of a qubit coupled to a thermal bath by an external driving field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and reliable manipulation with qubits is fundamental for any quantum technology. The implementation of these manipulations in physical systems is the focus of studies involving optimal control theory. Realistic physical devices are open quantum systems. So far, studies in optimal control theory have primarily utilized the Redfield/Lindblad quantum master equation to simulate the dynamics of such systems. However, this Markov description is not always sufficient. Here, we present a study of qubit control utilizing the nonequilibrium Green's function method. We compare the traditional master equation with more general Green's function results and demonstrate that even in the parameter regime suitable for the application of the Redfield/Lindblad approach, the two methods yield drastically different results when addressing evolution involving mixed states. In particular, we find that, in addition to predicting different optimal driving profiles, a more accurate description of system evolution enables the system to reach the desired final state much more quickly. We argue that the primary reason for this is the significance of the non-Markov description of driven system dynamics due to the effect of time-dependent driving on dissipation.</description>

      <title>Optical detection of the sliding ferroelectric switching in hBN with a WSe2 monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When two BN layers are stacked in parallel in an AB or BA arrangement, a spontaneous out-of-plane electric polarization arises due to charge transfer in the out-of-plane B-N bonds. The ferroelectric switching from AB to BA (or BA to AB) can be achieved with a relatively small out-of-plane electric field through the in-plane sliding of one atomic layer over the other. However, the optical detection of such ferroelectric switching in hBN has not yet been demonstrated. In this study, we utilize an adjacent WSe2 monolayer to detect the ferroelectric switching in BN. This dynamic coupling between a 2D ferroelectric and a 2D semiconductor allows for the fundamental investigation of the ferroelectric material using a non-destructive, local optical probe, offering promising applications for compact and non-volatile memory devices.</description>

      <title>Noise-based Local Learning using Stochastic Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-inspired learning in physical hardware has enormous potential to learn fast at minimal energy expenditure. One of the characteristics of biological learning systems is their ability to learn in the presence of various noise sources. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a novel noise-based learning approach for physical systems implementing multi-layer neural networks. Simulation results show that our approach allows for effective learning whose performance approaches that of the conventional effective yet energy-costly backpropagation algorithm. Using a spintronics hardware implementation, we demonstrate experimentally that learning can be achieved in a small network composed of physical stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions. These results provide a path towards efficient learning in general physical systems which embraces rather than mitigates the noise inherent in physical devices.</description>

      <title>Origin of the rich polymorphism of gold in penta-twinned nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the crystallographic structure of penta-twinned gold nanoparticles. Although gold typically exhibits a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice, other phases have been reported in some nanoscale systems. We show that the crystallographic system and the lattice parameters of the gold unit cell strongly depend on the nanoparticle geometry, for a wide size range. Specifically, we show that decahedra exhibit a body-centered tetragonal structure (I4/mmm), whereas rods and bipyramids exhibit a body-centered orthorhombic structure (Immm). These changes in the crystallographic structure are explained by the elastic lattice distortions required to close the mismatch gap in penta-twinned nanoparticles, with respect to fcc single-crystal gold nanoparticles. The effects of nanoparticle shape and size on the surface pressure and the subsequent distortions are additionally discussed.</description>

      <title>Microwave-to-Optical Quantum Transduction with Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.</description>

Abstract: We propose powering a quantum clock with the non-thermal resources offered by the stationary state of an integrable quantum spin chain, driven out of equilibrium by a quench in a parameter of our choice. Analyzing the bias conditions of the clock, we establish a direct connection with the negativity of the steady-state response function. Using experimentally relevant examples of quantum spin chains, we suggest crossing a phase transition point is crucial for optimal performance. The coupling takes place through a global observable and, even in this case, the battery lifespan is found to be extensive in its size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat bands in moir\'e systems are exciting new playgrounds for the generation and study of exotic many-body physics phenomena in low-dimensional materials. Such physics is attributed to the vanishing kinetic energy and strong spatial localization of the flat-band states. Here we use numerical simulations to examine the electronic transport properties of such flat bands in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene in the presence of disorder. We find that while a conventional downscaling of the mean free path with increasing disorder strength occurs at higher energies, in the flat bands the mean free path can actually increase with increasing disorder strength.This phenomenon is also captured by the disorder-dependent quantum metric, which is directly linked to the ground state localization.This disorder-induced delocalization suggests that weak disorder may have a strong impact on the exotic physics of magic-angle bilayer graphene and other related moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>InP/GaSb core-shell nanowires: a novel hole-based platform with strong spin-orbit coupling for full-shell hybrid devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full-shell hybrid nanowires (NWs), structures comprising a superconductor shell that encapsulates a semiconductor (SM) core, have attracted considerable attention in the search for Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, the predicted Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the SM is too small to achieve substantial topological minigaps. In addition, the SM wavefunction spreads all across the section of the nanowire, leading typically to a finite background of trivial subgap states with which MZMs may coexist. To overcome both problems, we explore the advantages of utilizing core-shell hole-band NWs as the SM part of a full-shell hybrid, with an insulating core and an active SM shell. In particular, we consider InP/GaSb core-shell NWs, which allow to exploit the unique characteristics of the III-V compound SM valence bands. We demonstrate that they exhibit a robust hole SOC that emerges from the combination of the intrinsic spin-orbit interaction of the SM active shell and the confinement effects of the nanostructure, thus depending mainly on SM and geometrical parameters. In other words, the SOC is intrinsic and does not rely on red electric fields, which are non-tunable in a full-shell hybrid geometry. As a result, core-shell SM hole-band NWs are found to be a promising candidate to explore Majorana physics in full-hell hybrid devices, addressing several challenges in the field.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of the hydrostatic stress for Hall droplets with in-plane magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the hydrostatic stress of electrons strongly confined in a quasi-2D quantum well in the presence of a strong perpendicular and weak in-plane magnetic field. This introduces anisotropy into the stress tensor which is inconsistent with the notion of the quantum Hall droplet as a simple two-dimensional electron fluid. We show that the breaking of rotational symmetry is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an anisotropic ground state stress tensor, and that the anisotropic stress originates primarily from quantum effects. We demonstrate this by decomposing the semiclassical trajectories of electrons in the system onto planes in phase space which must be rotated relative to the plane of the fluid to decouple the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Dephasing and error dynamics affecting a singlet-triplet qubit during coherent spin shuttling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information transport over micron to millimeter scale distances is critical for the operation of practical quantum processors based on spin qubits. One method of achieving a long-range interaction is by coherent electron spin shuttling through an array of silicon quantum dots. In order to execute many shuttling operations with high fidelity, it is essential to understand the dynamics of qubit dephasing and relaxation during the shuttling process in order to mitigate them. However, errors arising after many repeated shuttles are not yet well documented. Here, we probe decay dynamics contributing to dephasing and relaxation of a singlet-triplet qubit during coherent spin shuttling over many $N$ repeated shuttle operations. We find that losses are dominated by magnetic dephasing for small $N&lt;10^3$ and by incoherent shuttle errors for large $N&gt;10^3$. Additionally, we estimate shuttle error rates below $1\times10^{-4}$ out to at least $N=10^3$, representing an encouraging figure for future implementations of spin shuttling to entangle distant qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12584v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the optical effect of chiral topological superconductors in two dimensions. The linear optical response from chiral Bogoliubov edge modes in clean superconductors has in-gap resonances, which is originated from the transitions within the edge particle-hole pair bands. Interestingly, the number of resonance peaks is determined by the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Chern number of topological superconductors. Such a sharply distinctive feature in optical absorption offers a simple way to distinguish topological superconductors with different Chern numbers. We further demonstrate that linear optical effect could probe different topological phases in quantum anomalous Hall insulator-superconductor junction devices. This finding provides an applicable method to detect chiral Bogoliubov edge states and is distinguishable from collective modes in superconductors and possible trivial explanations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-energy dynamics of two-dimensional topological matter hinges on its one-dimensional edge modes. Tunneling between fractional quantum Hall edge modes facilitates the study of anyonic statistics: it induces time-domain braiding that dominates signals from diluted anyon beams. We develop a framework for characterizing one-dimensional out-of-equilibrium anyonic states and define their effective potential and temperature, both arising from anyonic braiding, as well as the landscape of their excitations. Unlike fermions, the effective anyon potential depends on the type of the tunneling quasiparticles; non-equilibrium anyonic states are underlain by power-law energy distributions. This allows "hot" anyons to tunnel above the chemical potential of the source, which we capture by a measurable universal witness function. Our analysis raises the prospect of generalizing the kinetic approach to compressible anyonic matter in higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Periodically driven systems offer a perfect breeding ground for out-of-equilibrium engineering of topological boundary states at zero energy ($0$-mode), as well as finite energy ($\pi$-mode), with the latter having no static analog. The Floquet operator and the effective Floquet Hamiltonian, which encapsulate the stroboscopic features of the driven system, capture both spectral and localization properties of the $0$- and $\pi$-modes but sometimes fail to provide complete topological characterization, especially when $0$- and $\pi$-modes coexist. In this work, we utilize the spectral localizer, a powerful local probe that can provide numerically efficient, spatially local, and energy-resolved topological characterization. In particular, we apply the spectral localizer to the effective Floquet Hamiltonian for driven one- and two-dimensional topological systems with no or limited symmetries and are able to assign topological invariants, or local markers, that characterize the $0$- and the $\pi$-boundary modes individually and unambiguously. Due to the spatial resolution, we also demonstrate that the extracted topological invariants are suitable for studying driven disordered systems and can even capture disorder-induced phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: The combination of a strong pump and a weak probe has been widely applied to investigate both optical and nanomechanical devices. Such pump-probe measurements allows for the exploration of nonlinear dynamics, driven by the large pump tone, by measuring the system response to a probe tone. In contrast, here we report on the dynamics of a mechanical Duffing resonator driven with a combination of two large tones at different frequencies. Our results indicate the presence of various distinct regimes with very different dynamics. We systematically investigate the impact of the relative strength and detuning between the two drives on the dynamical response. This provides an illustrative example of dynamical phase transitions in out-of-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tunable Interband Collective Excitations in Biased Bilayer and Trilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective excitations of charged particles under the influence of an electromagnetic field give rise to a rich variety of hybrid light-matter quasiparticles with unique properties. In metals, intraband collective response manifested by negative permittivity leads to plasmon-polaritons with extreme field confinement, wavelength "squeezing", and potentially low propagation losses. In contrast, photons in semiconductors commonly couple to interband collective response in the form of exciton-polaritons, which give rise to completely different polaritonic properties, described by a superposition of the photon and exciton and an anti-crossing of the eigenstates. In this work, we identify the existence of plasmon-like collective excitations originating from the interband excitonic response of biased bilayer and trilayer graphene, in the form of graphene-exciton-polaritons (GEPs). We find that GEPs possess electrically tunable polaritonic properties and discover that such excitations follow a universal dispersion law for all surface polaritons in 2D excitonic systems. Accounting for nonlocal corrections to the excitonic response, we find that the GEPs exhibit confinement factors that can exceed those of graphene plasmons, and with moderate losses that would enable their observation in cryo-SNOM experiments. Furthermore, by electrically tuning the excitons energy into the Reststrahlen band of the surrounding hexagonal-boron-nitride, we demonstrate that strong coupling between the excitons and hyperbolic phonon polaritons can be achieved, and well-described by an electromagnetic transmission line model. These predictions of plasmon-like interband collective excitations in biased graphene systems open up new research avenues for tunable plasmonic phenomena based on excitonic systems, and the ability to control and manipulate such phenomena at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Shot noise and universal Fano factor as characterization of strongly correlated metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11735</link>

Abstract: Shot noise measures out-of-equilibrium current fluctuations and is a powerful tool to probe the nature of current-carrying excitations in quantum systems. Recent shot noise measurements in the heavy fermion strange metal YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ exhibit a strong suppression of the Fano factor ($F$) -- the ratio of the current noise to the average current in the DC limit. This system is representative of metals in which electron correlations are extremely strong. Here we carry out the first theoretical study on the shot noise of diffusive metals in the regime of strong correlations. A Boltzmann-Langevin equation formulation is constructed in a quasiparticle description in the presence of strong correlations. We find that $F = \sqrt{ 3}/{4}$ in such a correlation regime. Thus, we establish the aforementioned Fano factor as universal to Fermi liquids, and show that the Fano factor suppression observed in experiments on YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ necessitates a loss of the quasiparticles. Our work opens the door to systematic theoretical studies of shot noise as a means of characterizing strongly correlated metallic phases and materials.</description>

      <title>Bypassing the lattice BCS-BEC crossover in strongly correlated superconductors: resilient coherence from multiorbital physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09063v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity emerges from the spatial coherence of a macroscopic condensate of Cooper pairs. Increasingly strong binding and localization of electrons into these pairs compromises the condensate's phase stiffness, thereby limiting critical temperatures -- a phenomenon known as the BCS-BEC crossover in lattice systems. In this study, we demonstrate enhanced superconductivity in a multiorbital model of alkali-doped fullerides (A$_3$C$_{60}$) that goes beyond the limits of the lattice BCS-BEC crossover. We identify that the interplay of strong correlations and multiorbital effects results in a localized superconducting state characterized by a short coherence length but robust stiffness and a domeless rise in critical temperature with increasing pairing interaction. To derive these insights, we introduce a new theoretical framework allowing us to calculate the fundamental length scales of superconductors, namely the coherence length ($\xi_0$) and the London penetration depth ($\lambda_{\mathrm{L}}$), even in presence of strong electron correlations.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing topological invariants of two-dimensional quantum matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms provide a potential strategy for solving computational problems that are intractable by classical means. Computing the topological invariants of topological matter is one central problem in research on quantum materials, and a variety of numerical approaches for this purpose have been developed. However, the complexity of quantum many-body Hamiltonians makes calculations of topological invariants challenging for interacting systems. Here, we present two quantum circuits for calculating Chern numbers of two-dimensional quantum matter on quantum computers. Both circuits combine a gate-based adiabatic time-evolution over the discretized Brillouin zone with particular phase estimation techniques. The first algorithm uses many qubits, and we analyze it using a tensor-network simulator of quantum circuits. The second circuit uses fewer qubits, and we implement it experimentally on a quantum computer based on superconducting qubits. Our results establish a method for computing topological invariants with quantum circuits, taking a step towards characterizing interacting topological quantum matter using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Hermitian Topology of Multiband Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complex eigenenergies and non-orthogonal eigenstates of non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique topological phenomena that cannot appear in Hermitian systems. Representative examples are the non-Hermitian skin effect and exceptional points. In a two-dimensional parameter space, topological classifications of non-separable bands in multiband non-Hermitian systems can be established by invoking a permutation group, where the product of the permutation represents state exchange due to exceptional points in the space. We unveil in this work the role of pseudo-Hermitian lines in non-Hermitian topology for multiple bands. In particular, the non-separability of non-Hermitian multibands can be topologically non-trivial without exceptional points in two-dimensional space. As a physical illustration of the role of pseudo-Hermitian lines, we examine a multiband structure of a photonic crystal system with lossy materials. Our work builds on the fundamental and comprehensive understanding of non-Hermitian multiband systems and also offers versatile applications and realizations of non-Hermitian systems without the need to consider exceptional points.</description>

      <title>Entanglement scaling and charge fluctuations in a Fermi liquid of composite fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The composite fermion Fermi liquid (CFL) state at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a Landau level is a paradigmatic non-Fermi liquid borne out purely by Coulomb interactions. But in what ways is this exotic state of matter different from a Fermi liquid? The CFL entanglement entropy was indeed found to exhibit a significant enhancement compared to free electrons [Shao et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 206402 (2015)], which was subsequently ruled out as a finite-size effect by the study of a lattice CFL analog [Mishmash and Motrunich, Phys. Rev. B 94, 081110 (2016)]. Moreover, the enhancement was not observed in a quasi-one-dimensional limit of the Coulomb ground state at $\nu=1/2$ [Geraedts et al., Science 352, 197 (2016)]. Here, we revisit the problem of entanglement scaling in the CFL state realized in a two-dimensional electron gas. Using Monte Carlo evaluation of the second R\'enyi entropy $S_2$ for the CFL variational wave function, we show that the entanglement enhancement is present not only at $\nu=1/2$ but also at $\nu=1/4$, as well as in bosonic CFL states at $\nu=1$ and $\nu=1/3$ fillings. In all cases, we find the scaling of $S_2$ with subsystem size to be enhanced compared to the non-interacting case, and insensitive to the choice of geometry and projection to the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that, for CFL states, the variance of the particle number in a subsystem obeys area-law scaling with a universal subleading corner contribution, in stark contrast with free fermions. Our results establish the enhanced entanglement scaling and suppressed charge fluctuations as fingerprints of non-Fermi-liquid correlations in CFL states.</description>

      <title>Microwave-optics entanglement via coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microwave-optics entanglement plays a crucial role in building hybrid quantum networks with quantum nodes working in the microwave and optical frequency bands. However, there are limited efficient ways to produce such entanglement due to the large frequency mismatch between the two regimes. Here, we present a new mechanism to prepare microwave-optics entanglement based on a hybrid system of two coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres, i.e., a YIG sphere and a silica sphere. The YIG sphere holds a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction, while the silica sphere supports an optical whispering-gallery mode and a mechanical mode coupled via an optomechanical interaction. The two mechanical modes are close in frequency and directly coupled via physical contact of the two microspheres. We show that by simultaneously activating the magnomechanical (optomechanical) Stokes (anti-Stokes) scattering, stationary entanglement can be established between the magnon and optical modes via mechanics-mechanics coupling. This leads to stationary microwave-optics entanglement by further coupling the YIG sphere to a microwave cavity and utilizing the magnon-microwave state swapping. Our protocol is within reach of current technology and may become a promising new approach for preparing microwave-optics entanglement, which finds unique applications in hybrid quantum networks and quantum information processing with hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Facile synthesis of palladium hydride via ionic gate-driven protonation using a deep eutectic solvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing novel protocols for hydrogen (H) loading is crucial for furthering the investigation of hydrides as potential high-temperature superconductors at lower pressures compared to recent discoveries. Ionic gating-induced protonation (IGP) has emerged as a promising technique for H loading due to its inherent simplicity, but it can be limited in the maximum density of injected H when ionic liquids are used as a gating medium. Additionally, most ionic liquids are limited by high production costs, complex synthesis, and potential toxicity. Here, we demonstrate that large H concentrations can be successfully injected in both palladium (Pd) bulk foils and thin films (up to a stoichiometry PdH$_{0.89}$) by using a deep eutectic solvent (DES) choline chloride-glycerol 1:3 as gate electrolyte and applying gate voltages in excess of the cathodic stability limit. The attained H concentrations are large enough to induce superconductivity in Pd, albeit with an incomplete resistive transition which suggests a strongly inhomogeneous H incorporation in the Pd matrix. This DES-based IGP protocol can be used as a guideline for maximizing H loading in different materials, although specific details of the applied voltage profile might require adjustments based on the material under investigation.</description>

      <title>Rapid optimal work extraction from a quantum-dot information engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conversion of thermal energy into work is usually more efficient in the slow-driving regime, where the power output is vanishingly small. Efficient work extraction for fast driving protocols remains an outstanding challenge at the nanoscale, where fluctuations play a significant role. In this Letter, we use a quantum-dot Szilard engine to extract work from thermal fluctuations with maximum efficiency over two decades of driving speed. We design and implement a family of optimised protocols ranging from the slow- to the fast-driving regime, and measure the engine's efficiency as well as the mean and variance of its power output in each case. These optimised protocols exhibit significant improvements in power and efficiency compared to the naive approach. Our results also show that, when optimising for efficiency, boosting the power output of a Szilard engine inevitably comes at the cost of increased power fluctuations.</description>
