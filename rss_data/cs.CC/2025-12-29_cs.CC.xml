      <title>A Note on Avoid vs MCSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent result of Ghentiyala, Li, and Stephens-Davidowitz (ECCC TR 25-210) shows that any language reducible to the Range Avoidance Problem via deterministic or randomized Turing reductions is contained in AM $\cap$ coAM. In this note, we present a different potential avenue for obtaining the same result via the Minimal Circuit Size Problem.</description>

      <title>A Note on the NP-Hardness of PARTITION Via First-Order Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the article ''On the (Non) NP-Hardness of Computing Circuit Complexity'', Murray and Williams imply the PARTITION decision problem is not known to be NP-hard via $2^{n^{o(1)}}$-size AC0 reductions. In this note, we show PARTITION is NP-hard via first-order projections. Basically, we slightly modify well-known reductions from 3SAT to SUBSET-SUM and from SUBSET-SUM to PARTITION, but do so in the context of descriptive computational complexity, i.e., we use first-order logical formulas to define them. Hardness under polynomial-size AC0 reductions follows because first-order reductions are a particular type of them. Thus, this note fills a gap in the literature.</description>

      <title>Conserved active information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce conserved active information $I^\oplus$, a symmetric extension of active information that quantifies net information gain/loss across the entire search space, respecting No-Free-Lunch conservation. Through Bernoulli and uniform-baseline examples, we show $I^\oplus$ reveals regimes hidden from KL divergence, such as when strong knowledge reduces global disorder. Such regimes are proven formally under uniform baseline, distinguishing disorder (increasing mild knowledge from order-imposing strong knowledge. We further illustrate these regimes with examples from Markov chains and cosmological fine-tuning. This resolves a longstanding critique of active information while enabling applications in search, optimization, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Duality and Multiplicative Structures on Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum LDPC codes have attracted intense interest due to their advantageous properties for realizing efficient fault-tolerant quantum computing. In particular, sheaf codes represent a novel framework that encompasses all well-known good qLDPC codes with profound underlying mathematics. In this work, we generalize Poincar\'e duality from manifolds to both classical and quantum codes defined via sheaf theory on $t$-dimensional cell complexes. Viewing important code properties including the encoding rate, code distance, local testability soundness, and efficient decoders as parameters of the underlying (co)chain complexes, we rigorously prove a duality relationship between the $i$-th chain and the $(t-i)$-th cochain of sheaf codes.
  We further build multiplicative structures such as cup and cap products on sheaved chain complexes, inspired by the standard notions of multiplicative structures and Poincar\'e duality on manifolds. This immediately leads to an explicit isomorphism between (co)homology groups of sheaf codes via a cap product. As an application, we obtain transversal disjoint logical $\mathrm{C}Z$ gates with $k_{\mathrm{C}Z}=\Theta(n)$ on families of good qLDPC and almost-good quantum locally testable codes. Moreover, we provide multiple new methods to construct transversal circuits composed of $\mathrm{C}\mathrm{C}Z$ gates as well as for higher order controlled-$Z$ that are provably logical operations on the code space. We conjecture that they generate nontrivial logical actions, pointing towards fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates on nearly optimal qLDPC sheaf codes. Mathematically, our results are built on establishing the equivalence between sheaf cohomology in the derived-functor sense, \v{C}ech cohomology, and the cohomology of sheaf codes, thereby introducing new mathematical tools into quantum coding theory.</description>

      <title>Hierarchies within TFNP: building blocks and collapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In all well-studied $\mathsf{TFNP}$ subclasses (e.g. $\mathsf{PPA}, \mathsf{PPP}$ etc.), the canonical complete problem takes as input a polynomial-size circuit $C: \{ 0, 1\}^n \rightarrow \{ 0, 1\}^m$ whose input-output behavior implicitly encodes an exponentially large object $G$, i.e. $C$ is the succinct (polynomial-size) representation of the exponential size object $G$. The goal is to find some particular substructure in $G$ which can be confirmed in polynomial time using queries to $C$.
  We initiate the study of classes of the form $\mathsf{A}^{\mathsf{B}}$ where both $\mathsf{A}$ and $\mathsf{B}$ are $\mathsf{TFNP}$ subclasses. In particular, we define complete problems for these classes that take as input a circuit $C$ which is allowed oracle gates to another $\mathsf{TFNP}$ class.
  Beyond introducing definitions for $\mathsf{TFNP}$ oracle problems, our specific technical contributions include showing that several $\mathsf{TFNP}$ subclasses are self-low and hence their corresponding hierarchies collapse. In particular, $\mathsf{PPA^{PPA}} = \mathsf{PPA}$, $\mathsf{PLS^{PLS}} = \mathsf{PLS}$, and $\mathsf{LOSSY^{LOSSY}} = \mathsf{LOSSY}$. As an immediate consequence, we derive that when reducing to $\mathsf{PPA}$, one can always assume access to $\mathsf{PPA}$ -- and therefore factoring -- oracle gates.
  In addition to introducing a variety of hierarchies within $\mathsf{TFNP}$ that merit study in their own right, these ideas introduce a novel approach for classifying computational problems within $\mathsf{TFNP}$ and proving black-box separations. For example, we observe that the problem of deterministically generating large prime numbers, which has long resisted classification in a $\mathsf{TFNP}$ subclass, is in $\mathsf{PPP^{\mathsf{PPP}}}$ under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Multi-Pass Streaming Lower Bounds for Uniformity Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove multi-pass streaming lower bounds for uniformity testing over a domain of size $2m$. The tester receives a stream of $n$ i.i.d. samples and must distinguish (i) the uniform distribution on $[2m]$ from (ii) a Paninski-style planted distribution in which, for each pair $(2i-1,2i)$, the probabilities are biased left or right by $\epsilon/2m$. We show that any $\ell$-pass streaming algorithm using space $s$ and achieving constant advantage must satisfy the tradeoff $sn\ell=\tilde{\Omega}(m/\epsilon^2)$. This extends the one-pass lower bound of Diakonikolas, Gouleakis, Kane, and Rao (2019) to multiple passes.
  Our proof has two components. First, we develop a hybrid argument, inspired by Dinur (2020), that reduces streaming to two-player communication problems. This reduction relies on a new perspective on hardness: we identify the source of hardness as uncertainty in the bias directions, rather than the collision locations. Second, we prove a strong lower bound for a basic two-player communication task, in which Alice and Bob must decide whether two random sign vectors $Y^a,Y^b\in\{\pm 1\}^m$ are independent or identical, yet they cannot observe the signs directly--only noisy local views of each coordinate. Our techniques may be of independent use for other streaming problems with stochastic inputs.</description>
