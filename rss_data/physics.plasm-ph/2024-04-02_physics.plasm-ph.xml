      <title>Investigation of self-focusing of Gaussian laser beams within magnetized plasma via source-dependent expansion method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-focusing emerges as a nonlinear optical phenomenon resulting from an intense laser field and plasma interaction. This study investigates the self-focusing behavior of Gaussian laser beams within magnetized plasma environments utilizing a novel approach, source-dependent expansion. By employing source-dependent expansion, we explore the intricate dynamics of laser beam propagation, considering the influence of plasma density and external magnetic fields. The interplay between the beam's Gaussian profile and the self-focusing mechanism through rigorous mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, particularly in the presence of plasma-induced nonlinearities are elucidated here. Our findings reveal crucial insights into the evolution of laser beams under diverse parameters, the ponderomotive force, relativistic factors, plasma frequency, polarization states, external magnetic field, wavelength, and laser intensity. This research not only contributes to advancing our fundamental understanding of laser-plasma interactions but also holds promise for optimizing laser-driven applications.</description>

      <title>Characterization of uncertainties in electron-argon collision cross sections under statistical principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The predictive capability of a plasma discharge model depends on accurate representations of electron-impact collision cross sections, which determine the key reaction rates and transport properties of the plasma. Although many cross sections have been identified through experiments and quantum mechanical simulations, their uncertainties are not well-investigated. We characterize the uncertainties in electron-argon collision cross sections using a Bayesian framework. Six collision processes -- elastic momentum transfer, ionization, and four excitations -- are characterized with semi-empirical models, whose parametric uncertainties effectively capture the features important to the macroscopic properties of the plasma, namely transport properties and chemical reaction rates. The method is designed to capture the effects of systematic errors that lead to large discrepancies between some data sets. Specifically, for the purposes of Bayesian inference, each of the parametric cross section models is augmented with a Gaussian process representing systematic measurement errors as well as model inadequacies in the parametric form. The results show that the method is able to capture scatter in the data between the electron-beam experiments and ab-initio quantum simulations. The calibrated cross section models are further validated against measurements from swarm-parameter experiments.</description>

      <title>Modeling the low-pressure high-voltage branch of the Paschen curve for hydrogen and deuterium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A physical and numerical model of the Townsend discharge in molecular hydrogen and deuterium has been developed to meet the needs of designing a plasma-based switching device for power grid application. The model allows to predict the low-pressure branch of the Paschen curve for applied voltage in the range of several hundred kiloVolts. In the regime of interest, electrons are in a runaway state and ionization by ions and fast neutrals sustains the discharge. It was essential to correctly account for both gas-phase and surface interactions (electron emission and electron back-scattering), especially in terms of their dependence on particle energy. The model yields results consistent with prior data obtained for lower voltage. The three-species (electrons, ions and fast neutrals) model successfully captures the essential physics of the process.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of the solar coronal plasmas by magnetohydrodynamic waves: Magnetohydrodynamic seismology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic wave and oscillatory phenomena ubiquitously detected in the plasma of the corona of the Sun are interpreted in terms of magnetohydrodynamic theory. Fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves are clearly distinguished in observations. Properties of coronal magnetohydrodynamic waves are determined by local parameters of the plasma, including the field-aligned filamentation typical for the corona. It makes coronal magnetohydrodynamic waves reliable probes of the coronal plasma structures by the method of magnetohydrodynamic seismology. For example, propagating slow waves indicate the local direction of the guiding magnetic field. Standing, sloshing and propagating slow waves can be used for probing the coronal heating function and the polytropic index. Kink oscillations of coronal plasma loops provide us with the estimations of the absolute value of the magnetic field in oscillating plasma loops. This tutorial introduces several techniques of magnetohydrodynamic seismology of solar coronal plasmas. It includes the description of practical steps in the data acquisition, pre-processing, and processing using the open-access data of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on the Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft, and elaborated data analysis techniques of motion magnification and Bayesian statistics.</description>

      <title>The Collisional Particle-In-Cell Method for the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the particle-in-cell (PIC) method that captures the Landau collisional effects in the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau equations. The method arises from a regularisation of the variational formulation of the Landau equation, leading to a discretisation of the collision operator that conserves mass, charge, momentum, and energy, while increasing the (regularised) entropy. The collisional effects appear as a fully deterministic effective force, thus the method does not require any transport-collision splitting. The scheme can be used in arbitrary dimension, and for a general interaction, including the Coulomb case. We validate the scheme on scenarios such as the Landau damping, the two-stream instability, and the Weibel instability, demonstrating its effectiveness in the numerical simulation of plasma.</description>

      <title>Effects of Magnetic Helicity on 3D Equilibira and Self-Organized States in KTX Reversed Field Pinch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The RFP is a toroidal magnetic configuration in which plasmas can spontaneously transform into different self-organized states. Among various states, the QSH state has a dominant component for the magnetic field and significantly improves confinement. Many theoretical and experimental efforts have investigated the transitions among different states. This paper employs the MRxMHD model to study the properties of QSH and other states. The SPEC is used to compute MHD equilibria for the KTX. The toroidal volume of KTX is partitioned into two subvolumes by an internal transport barrier. The geometry of this barrier is adjusted to achieve force balance across the interface, ensuring that the plasma in each subvolume is force-free and that magnetic helicity is conserved. By varying the parameters, we generate distinct self-organized states in KTX. Our findings highlight the crucial role of magnetic helicity in shaping these states. In states with low magnetic helicity in both subvolumes, the plasma exhibits axisymmetric behavior. With increasing core helicity, the plasma gradually transforms from an axisymmetric state to a double-axis helical state and finally to a single-helical-axis state. Elevated core magnetic helicity leads to a more pronounced dominant mode of the boundary magnetic field and a reduced core magnetic shear. This is consistent with previous experimental and numerical results in other RFP devices. We find a linear relationship between the plasma current and helicity in different self-organized states. Our findings suggest that KTX may enter the QSH state when the toroidal current reaches 0.72 MA. This study demonstrates that the stellarator equilibrium code SPEC unveils crucial RFP equilibrium properties, rendering it applicable to a broad range of RFP devices and other toroidal configurations.</description>

      <title>Generation and Life Cycle of Solar Spicules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical mechanism for the creation of solar spicules is proposed with three stages of their life cycle. It is assumed that at stage-I, the density hump is formed locally in the xy-plane in lower chromosphere in the presence of temperature gradients of electrons and ions along z-axis (the vertical direction). In this region, the density structure of quasi-neutral $(n_i\simeq n_e=n)$ plasma after taking birth is accelerated in the vertical direction due to the thermal force ${\bf F}_{th} \propto \nabla n(x,y,t) \times (\nabla T_e + \nabla T_i)$. The exact time-dependent analytical solution of two fluid plasma equations is presented assuming that density is maximum at the center and decays away from it gradually. The two dimensional (2D) density structure is created as a step function $H(t)$ in time at bottom of the chromosphere and consequently the vertical plasma velocity turns out to be the ramp function of time $R(t)=t H(t)$ whereas the source term $S(x,y,t)$ for the density follows the delta function $\delta(t)$ form. The upward acceleration ${\bf a}=a(x,y)\hat{z}$ produced in this density structure is greater than the downward constant solar acceleration $-{\bf g}_\odot$ in the chromosphere. In the transition region (TR), the temperature gradients are steeper; therefore, the upward acceleration increases in magnitude $g_\odot &lt;&lt; a$ and the density hump spends lesser time there. This is stage-II of its life cycle. In stage-III, the density structure enters into corona where the gradients of temperatures vanish and the structure decelerates to zero velocity under the action of the solar gravitational force.</description>

      <title>Spin drag mechanism of giant thermal magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study hydrodynamic thermal transport in high-mobility two-dimensional electron systems placed in an in-plane magnetic field, and identify a new mechanism of thermal magnetotransport. This mechanism is caused by drag between the electron populations with opposite spin polarization, which arises in the presence of a hydrodynamic flow of heat. In high mobility systems, spin drag results in strong thermal magnetoresistance, which becomes of the order of 100% at relatively small spin polarization of the electron liquid. We express the thermal magnetoresistance in terms of intrinsic dissipative coefficients of electron fluid and show that it is primarily determined by the spin diffusion constant.</description>
