      <title>Effects of nonlinearity on Anderson localization of surface gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anderson localization is a multiple-scattering phenomenon of linear waves propagating within a disordered medium. Discovered in the late 50s for electrons, it has since been observed experimentally with cold atoms and with classical waves (optics, microwaves, and acoustics), but whether wave localization is enhanced or weakened for nonlinear waves is a long-standing debate. Here, we show that the nonlinearity strengthens the localization of surface-gravity waves propagating in a canal with a random bottom. We also show experimentally how the localization length depends on the nonlinearity, which has never been reported previously with any type of wave. To do so, we use a full space-and-time-resolved wavefield measurement as well as numerical simulations. The effects of the disorder level and the system's finite size on localization are also reported. We also highlight the first experimental evidence of the macroscopic analog of Bloch's dispersion relation of linear hydrodynamic surface waves over periodic bathymetry.</description>

      <title>Defects induce phase transition from dynamic to static rippling in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many of graphene's remarkable properties are intrinsically linked to its inherent ripples. Defects, whether naturally present or artificially introduced, are known to have a strong impact on the rippling of graphene. However, how defects alter ripple dynamics in two-dimensional (2D) materials in general, and graphene in particular, remains largely unexplored. Here, using machine learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal a fundamental connection between defect concentration and ripple dynamics in freestanding graphene sheets. Specifically, we find that at a critical concentration of approximately 0.1%, dynamic rippling undergoes a transition from freely propagating to static ripples. This is in quantitative alignment with the experimentally observed turning point in the non-monotonic scaling of the Young's modulus and emphasises the critical interplay between defects and material dynamics. Our work not only unveils the significant impact of defects on rippling dynamics in graphene but also paves the way to design two-dimensional devices with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Quantum-to-classical crossover in the spin glass dynamics of cavity QED simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By solving the quench dynamics of a frustrated many-body spin-boson problem, we investigate the role of spin size on the dynamical formation of spin glass order. In particular, we observe that quantum and classical spin glasses exhibit markedly different evolution. The former displays a quick relaxation of magnetization together with an exponential dependence of the spin glass order parameter on spin size, while the latter has long-lasting prethermal magnetization and a spin glass order parameter independent of spin size. The quantum-to-classical crossover is sharp and occurs for relatively small spins, highlighting the fragility of the quantum regime. Furthermore, we show that spin glass order is resonantly enhanced when the frequency of the bosonic mediators of the interactions approaches the value of the transverse field. Our predictions are relevant for all spin glass systems with $SU(2)$ degrees of freedom away from equilibrium, and can be examined in recently developed multi-mode cavity QED experiments.</description>

      <title>Far from equilibrium field theory for strongly coupled light and matter: dynamics of frustrated multi-mode cavity QED</title>

Abstract: Light-matter interfaces have now entered a new stage marked by the ability to engineer quantum correlated states under driven-dissipative conditions. To propel this new generation of experiments, we are confronted with the need to model non-unitary many-body dynamics in strongly coupled regimes, by transcending traditional approaches in quantum optics. In this work, we contribute to this program by adapting a functional integral technique, conventionally employed in high-energy physics, in order to obtain non-equilibrium dynamics for interacting light-matter systems. Our approach is grounded in constructing 'two-particle irreducible' (2PI) effective actions, which provide a non-perturbative and conserving framework for describing quantum evolution at a polynomial cost in time. We apply our method to complement the analysis of spin glass formation in the context of frustrated multi-mode cavity quantum electrodynamics, initiated in our accompanying work [H. Hosseinabadi, D. Chang, J. Marino, arXiv:2311.05682]. Finally, we outline the capability of the technique to describe other near-term platforms in many-body quantum optics, and its potential to make predictions for this new class of experiments.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Transformer Neural Network for Simulating Open Quantum Systems via a Probabilistic Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.05580v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of open quantum systems lays the foundations for a substantial part of modern research in quantum science and engineering. Rooted in the dimensionality of their extended Hilbert spaces, the high computational complexity of simulating open quantum systems calls for the development of strategies to approximate their dynamics. In this paper, we present an approach for tackling open quantum system dynamics. Using an exact probabilistic formulation of quantum physics based on positive operator-valued measure (POVM), we compactly represent quantum states with autoregressive transformer neural networks; such networks bring significant algorithmic flexibility due to efficient exact sampling and tractable density. We further introduce the concept of String States to partially restore the symmetry of the autoregressive transformer neural network and improve the description of local correlations. Efficient algorithms have been developed to simulate the dynamics of the Liouvillian superoperator using a forward-backward trapezoid method and find the steady state via a variational formulation. Our approach is benchmarked on prototypical one and two-dimensional systems, finding results which closely track the exact solution and achieve higher accuracy than alternative approaches based on using Markov chain Monte Carlo to sample restricted Boltzmann machines. Our work provides general methods for understanding quantum dynamics in various contexts, as well as techniques for solving high-dimensional probabilistic differential equations in classical setups.</description>

      <title>Gauge Invariant and Anyonic Symmetric Transformer and RNN Quantum States for Quantum Lattice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.07243v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetries such as gauge invariance and anyonic symmetry play a crucial role in quantum many-body physics. We develop a general approach to constructing gauge invariant or anyonic symmetric autoregressive neural network quantum states, including a wide range of architectures such as Transformer and recurrent neural network (RNN), for quantum lattice models. These networks can be efficiently sampled and explicitly obey gauge symmetries or anyonic constraint. We prove that our methods can provide exact representation for the ground and excited states of the 2D and 3D toric codes, and the X-cube fracton model. We variationally optimize our symmetry incorporated autoregressive neural networks for ground states as well as real-time dynamics for a variety of models. We simulate the dynamics and the ground states of the quantum link model of $\text{U(1)}$ lattice gauge theory, obtain the phase diagram for the 2D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, determine the phase transition and the central charge of the $\text{SU(2)}_3$ anyonic chain, and also compute the ground state energy of the SU(2) invariant Heisenberg spin chain. Our approach provides powerful tools for exploring condensed matter physics, high energy physics and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transitions in quantum-enhanced experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum-enhanced experiment, in which information is transduced from a system of interest and processed on a quantum computer, has the possibility of exponential advantage in sampling tasks over a traditional experiment, where only the measurement outcomes of projective or weak measurements are stored on a classical computer. In this work, we demonstrate that, similar to the measurement induced phase transition~(MIPT) occurring in traditional experiments, quantum-enhanced experiments can also show entanglement phase transitions. We introduce a noisy transduction operation which replaces projective measurements and acts independently on two qubits, recording the quantum state of one qubit in the measurement apparatus, while erasing the quantum state of the other qubit with the environment. We then construct a random brickwork circuit which shows an entanglement transition tuned by the rate of noisy transduction operations. Below the critical rate of noisy transduction, an extensive amount of entanglement is generated between regions of the system and apparatus, while above the critical rate, entanglement satisfies area law scaling. Our work delineates the prerequisites for quantum-enhanced experiments to manifest entanglement transitions, thereby establishing a foundational framework that connects quantum-enhanced sensing with emergent entanglement phenomena.</description>

      <title>Stability of topologically protected slow light against disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Slowing down light in on-chip photonic devices strongly enhances light-matter interaction, but typically also leads to increased backscattering and small-bandwidth operation. It was shown recently that, if one modifies the edge termination of a photonic Chern insulator such that the edge mode wraps many times around the Brillouin zone, light can be slowed to arbitrarily low group velocity over a large bandwidth, without being subject to backscattering. Here we study the robustness of these in-gap slow light modes against fabrication disorder, finding that disorder on scales significantly larger than the minigaps between edge bands is tolerable. We identify the mechanism for wavepacket breakup as disorder-induced velocity renormalization and calculate the associated breakup time.</description>

      <title>Generalizing measurement-induced phase transitions to information exchange symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the conditions for quantum back action to result in a phase transition in the information dynamics of a monitored system. We introduce a framework that captures a wide range of experiments encompassing probes comprised of projective measurements and probes which more generally transfer quantum information from the system to a quantum computer. Our framework explicitly uses a model of unitary evolution which couples system, apparatus and environment. Information dynamics is investigated using the R\'enyi and von-Neumann entropies of the evolving state, and we construct a replica theory for them. We identify the possible replica symmetries an experiment can possess and discuss their spontaneous symmetry breaking. In particular, we identify a minimum subgroup whose spontaneous symmetry breaking results in an entanglement transition. This symmetry is only possible when the information in the apparatus is as informative about the dynamics of the system as the information transferred to the environment. We call this requirement the information exchange symmetry and quantify it by a relationship between the entropies. We then show how the entanglement transition can be understood as the spontaneously breaking of the information exchange symmetry and without referring to the replica theory. Information exchange symmetry breaking is then shown to generalize the phenomenology of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We apply this theory to the brickwork quantum-enhanced experiment introduced in an accompanying Letter [1] in the case where the unitaries are chosen from the Haar measure, and identify a distinct universality from the MIPT. This notion of information exchange symmetry breaking generalizes the MIPT, and provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of quantum information in quantum-enhanced experiments.</description>

      <title>Fidelity decay and error accumulation in quantum volume circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of fidelity decay and error accumulation in faulty quantum circuit models. Our work devises an analytical bound for the average fidelity between desired and faulty output states, accounting for errors that may arise during the implementation of two-qubit gates and multi-qubit permutations. It is shown that fidelity decays exponentially with both circuit depth and the number of qubits raised to an architecture-dependent power, and determine the decay rates as a function of the two types of errors. Furthermore, we establish a robust linear relationship between fidelity and the heavy output frequency used in Quantum Volume tests to benchmark quantum processors, under the considered errors protocol. These findings pave the way for predicting the behavior of fidelity in the presence of specific errors and offer insights into the best strategies for increasing Quantum Volume.</description>
