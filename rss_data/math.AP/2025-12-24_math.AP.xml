      <title>Quantization for sequences of blow-up solutions to an elliptic equation having nonlocal exponential nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides a description of the asymptotic behavior of sequences of solutions to an elliptic equation with a nonlocal exponential nonlinearity of Choquard type. The equation under consideration is a nonlocal analog of the classical prescribed Gaussian curvature equation. A concentration-compactness alternative is established for sequences of solutions to the equation under consideration whenever suitable integrability assumptions on the solutions and the curvature functions are satisfied. Under further regularity assumptions on the curvature functions, and when blow-up occurs in the concentration-compactness alternative, an energy quantization result is established.</description>

      <title>On non-uniqueness for the system $\bu_t+(\bu\cdot\nabla)\bu=\mu\Delta{\bf u}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit irrotational solutions, obtained via the Cole-Hopf transform from the multi-d heat
  equation, give examples of non-uniqueness for the Cauchy problem in supercritical
  $L^p$, $W^{1,p}$, and $W^{2,p}$ regimes.
  We verify non-uniqueness of the trivial solution in the sense of $L^p(\RR^n)$, whenever $n\geq2$
  and $1\leq p&lt;n$. The same solutions give non-uniqueness in $W^{1,p}(\RR^n)$
  and $W^{2,p}(\RR^n)$ for $1\leq p&lt;\frac{n}{2}$ and $1\leq p&lt;\frac{n}{3}$,
  respectively. The main example provides solutions which are classical for
  strictly positive times, and vanish in the stated norms, but explode in $L^\infty(\RR^n)$,
  as $t\to0+$. The non-uniqueness is unrelated to the
  Tikhonov non-uniqueness phenomenon for the heat equation.</description>

      <title>The Boltzmann Equation for 2D Taylor-Couette Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence of 2-D Taylor-Couette flow for a rarefied gas between two coaxial rotating cylinders, characterized by differing angular velocities at the outer boundary $\{r=1\}$ and the inner boundary $\{r=r_{1}&gt;0\}$, with a small relative strength denoted by $\alpha$. We formulate the problem using the steady Boltzmann equation in polar coordinates and seek a solution invariant under rotation. We assume that the steady state has the specific form $F(r,v_{r},v_{\phi}-\alpha\frac{r-r_{1}}{1-r_{1}},v_{z})$, where the translation angular velocity $\alpha\frac{r-r_{1}}{1-r_{1}}$ is linearly sheared along the radial direction. With this ansatz, the problem is reduced to solve the nonlinear steady Boltzmann equation with geometric correction, subject to an external shear force of strength $\alpha$ and the homogeneous non-moving diffuse reflection boundary condition. We establish the existence of a non-equilibrium steady solution for any small enough shear rate $\alpha$ through Caflisch's decomposition, complemented by careful uniform estimates based on Guo's $L^{\infty} \cap L^2$ framework. The steady profile displays a polynomial tail behavior at large velocities. For the proof, we develop a delicate double-parameter $(\epsilon,\sigma)$-approximation argument for the construction of solutions. In particular, we obtain uniform macroscopic dissipation estimates in the absence of mass conservation for $\sigma \in [0,1)$ getting close to 1. Additionally, due to the non-trivial geometric effects, we develop subtle constructions of test functions by solving second-order ODEs with geometric corrections to establish macroscopic dissipation. Furthermore, we justify the non-negativity of the steady profile by demonstrating its large-time asymptotic stability with an exponential convergence rate under radial perturbations.</description>

      <title>Weighted Robin eigenvalue problems and nonlinear elliptic equations with general growth in the gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an existence result for Robin boundary value problems modeled on \[
  \begin{cases}
  \Delta u + |\nabla u|^2 + \lambda f(x) = 0 &amp; \text{in } \Omega
  \\ \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu} + \beta u = 0 &amp; \text{on } \partial\Omega \end{cases} \] where $\Omega$ is a bounded, sufficiently smooth open set in $\mathbb R^N$, $f(x)$ belongs to the Marcinkiewicz space $M^{\frac N2}$ and {$\beta&gt;0$}, under a smallness assumption on the datum $\lambda$. In order to study such problem, we will show several properties of the weighted, singular Robin eigenvalue problem \[ \lambda_{1,f,\gamma}(\Omega)= \inf_{\psi\in H^{1},\;\int_{\Omega}f\psi^{2}=1}\left\{\int_{\Omega}|\nabla \psi|^{2}dx+\gamma\int_{\partial\Omega}\psi^{2}\right\}. \]</description>

      <title>Fractional hypocoercivity in bounded domains in the anomalous diffusion limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a result of exponential stability for several dissipative linear kinetic equations with heavy-tailed equilibria. The approach, inspired by the so-called $L^2$-hypocoercivity method, is robust enough to provide estimates that are uniform in the anomalous diffusion limit. Moreover, it is able to deal with bounded domains with periodic boundary condition or general Maxwell boundary condition (from the pure specular to the pure diffusive case). In addition, our framework accommodates linear collisional operators that act simultaneously on the velocity and spatial variables.</description>

      <title>A supersolution approach to doubly degenerate parabolic equations with weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem in the Euclidean space for a doubly
  degenerate parabolic equation with a space-dependent exponential
  weight, where the exponent satisfies the doubling condition. In
  particular, both the so called logconvex and logconcave cases may be
  considered. Under the additional natural assumptions we construct
  supersolutions and subsolutions allowing us to control the precise
  sharp temporal decay bounds. We apply our results also to an
  equation with inhomogeneous density, via a suitable variable
  transformation.</description>

      <title>Supersonic sonic patch solution for the two-dimensional Euler equations with a van der Waals equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate supersonic transonic phenomena in the two-dimensional compressible Euler equations governed by a polytropic van der Waals equation of state. In contrast to the ideal gas setting, the non-ideal pressure law introduces stronger nonlinear effects and modifies the degeneracy structure near sonic states, which significantly complicates the analytical treatment of transonic flows. Within the self-similar framework associated with the four-state Riemann problem, we construct a supersonic sonic patch solution that connects a strictly supersonic region to a sonic boundary along a pseudo streamline. The analysis is based on a characteristic decomposition combined with a partial hodograph transformation, through which the problem is reformulated as a degenerate hyperbolic system. We establish the existence of a globally defined supersonic solution and prove its uniform regularity up to the sonic curve. In addition, we investigate the regularity properties of the resulting sonic boundary. Our results extend the theory of supersonic sonic patches from polytropic gases to a realistic non-ideal gas model.</description>

      <title>Global attractors for the Signorini problem with pointwise damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of global attractors is investigated for the Signorini problem with pointwise dissipation. It is shown that both the semilinear Signorini problem and the elastic obstacle problem with normal compliance exhibit exponential decay to zero and admit compact global attractors. To establish these results, the original problem is approximated by a hybrid PDE-ODE system, which allows for a rigorous analysis of well-posedness and the long-time behavior of its solutions.</description>

      <title>Localization of the eigenfunctions of a Bloch-Torrey operator on the half-plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a non-self adjoint operator of the form $-h^2 \Delta + i(V(x) + \alpha(x)y)$ on the upper half plane $y &gt; 0$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions on $\{y = 0\}$ with $V \geq 0$, $V$ admitting a non-degenerate minimum at $x = 0$ and $\alpha'(0) = 0$. We study its eigenfunctions associated to the smallest eigenvalues in magnitude in the semiclassical limit $h \to 0$. Elementary variational estimates show that these eigenfunctions are localized near the point $(0,0)$ at the scales $O(h^{1/3})$ in $x$ and $O(h^{2/3})$ in $y$. In this paper, we show that the $O(h^{1/3})$ localization in $x$ is not optimal; more precisely, we establish that the eigenfunctions are concentrated in a neighborhood of size $O(h^{1/2})$ of the axis $\{x = 0\}$, and this scale is shown to be sharp. The proof relies on the symbolic calculus of operator-valued pseudodifferential operators.</description>

      <title>Exact boundary controllability and stabilizability of a degenerated Timoshenko beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the boundary controllability and stabilizability of a Timoshenko beam subject to degeneracy at one end, while control is applied at the opposite boundary. Degeneracy in this context is measured by the real parameters for $\mu_a\in [0,2)$ for $a\in\{K,EI\}$, where $K(x)$ denotes shear stiffness and $EI(x)$ bending stiffness. We differentiate between weak degeneracy $\mu_a\in [0,1)$ and strong degeneracy $\mu_a\in [1,2)$, which may occur independently in shear and bending. Our study establishes observability inequalities for both weakly and strongly degenerate equations under Dirichlet, Robin, and Neumann boundary conditions. Using energy multiplier techniques and the Hilbert Uniqueness Method (HUM), we derive conditions for exact boundary controllability and show that appropriate boundary state and velocity feedback controls at the non-degenerate end can stabilize the system exponentially. Extending results previously obtained for the 1-dimensional wave equation in \cite{AlabauCannarsaLeugering2017}, this study highlights new control strategies and stabilization effects specific to the degenerate Timoshenko beam system, addressing challenges pertinent to real-world structural damping and control applications.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric exact controllability for networks of spatial elastic strings, springs and masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider networks of elastic strings with end masses, where the coupling is modeled via elastic springs. The model is representative of a network of nonlinear strings, where the strings are coupled to elastic bodies. The coupled system converges to the classical string network model with Kirchhoff and continuity transmission conditions as the spring stiffness terms approach infinity and the masses at the nodes vanish. Due to the presence of point masses at the nodes, the boundary conditions become dynamic, and consequently, the corresponding first-order system of quasilinear balance laws exhibits nonlocal boundary conditions. We demonstrate well-posedness in the sense of semi-global classical solutions \cite{li} (i.e., for arbitrarily large time intervals provided that the initial and boundary data are small enough) and observe extra regularity at the masses as in \cite{WangLeugeringLi2017,WangLeugeringLi2019}. We prove local and global-local exact boundary controllability of a star-like network when control is active at the endpoints of the string-spring-mass system, except for one clamped end. In this case, at multiple nodes, a complex smoothing pattern appears, leading to asymmetric control spaces when the springs and masses are present. Furthermore, the rank of the Laplacian matrix at the junction is crucial for the controllability property, particularly in models containing wave equations with degeneration at dynamic boundaries, which can be interpreted as damage in mechanical vibration systems where parts of the springs are missing.</description>

      <title>Quantitative approximation of a Keller--Segel PDE by a branching moderately interacting particle system and suppression of blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Keller--Segel PDE is a model for chemotaxis known to exhibit possible finite-time blow-up. Following a seminal work by Tello and Winkler, a logistic damping term is added in this PDE and local well-posedness of mild solutions is proven. When the space dimension is $2$ or when the damping is strong enough, the solution is global in time. In the second part of this work, a microscopic description of this model is introduced in terms of a system of stochastic moderately interacting particles. This system features two main characteristics: the interaction between particles happens through a singular (Coulomb-type) kernel which is attractive; and the particles are subject to demographic events, birth and death due to local competition with other particles. The latter induces a branching structure of the particle system. Then the main result of this work is the convergence of the empirical measure of the particle system towards the Keller--Segel PDE with logistic damping, with a rate of order $N^{-\frac{1}{2(d+1)}}$.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of optimal control problems governed by nonlinear stochastic equations of monotone type under certain coercivity and linear growth conditions. We give first order necessary conditions of optimality. A stochastic Pontryagin principle can be recovered in the case that the diffusion doesn't depend on the control. We give several applications, most notably for stochastic porous media equations in the Lipschitz case.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of a ground state and infinitely many geometrically distinct solutions for static nonlinear Maxwell's equations on $\mathbb{R}^3$. Our existence result relies on a variant of the Symmetric Mountain Pass Theorem that applies to periodic as well as vanishing nonlinearities. It is applied in a dual variational setting and thus provides an alternative approach with respect to the direct variational method introduced by Mederski.</description>

      <title>A survey on mass conservation, self-similarity and related topics in nonlinear diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the validity of the principle of mass conservation for solutions of some typical equations in the theory of nonlinear diffusion, including equations in standard differential form and also their fractional counterparts. In Part 1, consisting of the first 9 sections, we use as main examples the heat equation, the porous medium equation and the $p$-Laplacian equation. Though these equations have the form of conservation laws, it happens that in some ranges of exponents the solutions posed in the whole Euclidean space lose mass in time. From the start we pay attention to the close connection between the validity of mass conservation and the existence of finite-mass self-similar solutions, as well as their role in the asymptotic behaviour of more general classes of solutions. Describing the extent of this connection is the common thread throughout the manuscript. When mass conservation does not hold, we are led to examine the situation when it is replaced by its extreme alternative, extinction in finite time, a very surprising fact. The next sections extend the detailed study to other models that occupy a relevant role in the current literature. Thus, the 3 sections of Part 2 are devoted to the discussion of mass conservation for some fractional nonlinear diffusion equations, where the situation is surveyed and a number of new theorems are proved. This is followed by the analogous study of Scalar Conservation Laws in Part 3, with surprising similarities. We conclude with a long review of related equations and topics in Part 4. The survey contains an extensive bibliography.</description>

      <title>Global weak solutions for the inverse mean curvature flow in the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the inverse mean curvature flow (IMCF) in the Heisenberg group $(\He^n, d_\varepsilon)$, where $d_\varepsilon$ is distance associated to either $| \cdot |_\varepsilon$, $\varepsilon&gt;0$, the natural family of left-invariant Riemannian metrics, or with their sub-Riemannian counterparts for $\varepsilon=0$. For $\Omega \subseteq \He^n$ an open set with smooth boundary $\Sigma_0=\partial \Omega$ satisfying a uniform exterior gauge-ball condition and bounded complement we show existence of a global weak IMCF of generalized hypersurfaces $\{\Sigma^\varepsilon_s\}_{s \geq 0} \subseteq \mathbb{H}^n$ which are level sets of a proper globally Lipschitz function with logarithmic growth at infinity. Here, both in the Riemannian and in the sub-Riemannian setting, we adopt the weak formulation introduced by Huisken and Ilmanen in \cite{HuiskenIlmanen}, following the approach in \cite{Moser} due to Moser and based on the the link between IMCF and $p$-harmonic functions.</description>

      <title>On the nudging approach to continuous data assimilation in the limit of infinite error feedback gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article studies the intimate relationship between two filtering algorithms for continuous data assimilation, the synchronization filter and the nudging filter, in the paradigmatic context of the two-dimensional (2D) Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) for incompressible fluids. In this setting, the nudging filter can formally be viewed as an affine perturbation of the 2D NSE. Thus, in the degenerate limit of zero nudging parameter, the nudging filter converges to the solution of the 2D NSE. However, when the nudging parameter of the nudging filter is large, the perturbation becomes singular. It is shown that in the singular limit of infinite nudging parameter, the nudging filter converges to the synchronization filter. In establishing this result, the article fills a notable gap in the literature surrounding these algorithms. Numerical experiments are then presented that confirm the theoretical results and probes the issue of selecting a nudging strategy in the presence of observational noise. In this direction, an adaptive nudging strategy is proposed that leverages the insight gained from the relationship between the synchronization filter and the nudging filter that produces measurable improvement over the constant nudging strategy.</description>

      <title>A kinetic theory approach to consensus formation in financial markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is sometimes acknowledged that (sell-side) equity analysts' recommendations influence investors and therefore market prices. In particular, the S&amp;P 500 is expected to decline (respectively rise) when analysts revise their targets downward (respectively upward). Our findings indicate not only that analysts' consensus exert no influence on market prices, but also that, conversely, analysts appear to set their target prices based on markets prices. Employing a kinetic theory framework, we model the dynamics of analysts' opinions, by taking into account both the mutual influences shaping price consensus and the dynamics of the actual S&amp;P 500 index level. The model is calibrated on a training subset of data and tested on an independent set to assess its predictive power. Our tests show that just three free parameters are enough to accurately predict the one-year average price forecasts of analysts.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamically Consistent Free Boundary Model for Two-Phase Flows in an Evolving Domain with Bulk-Surface Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a thermodynamically consistent model, which describes the time evolution of a two-phase flow in an evolving domain. The movement of the free boundary of the domain is driven by the velocity field of the mixture in the bulk, which is determined by a Navier--Stokes equation. In order to take interactions between bulk and boundary into account, we further consider two materials on the boundary, which may be the same or different materials as those in the bulk. The bulk and the surface materials are represented by respective phase-fields, whose time evolution is described by a bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard equation. This approach allows for a transfer of material between bulk and surface as well as variable contact angles between the diffuse interface in the bulk and the boundary of the domain. To provide a more accurate description of the corresponding contact line motion, we include a generalized Navier slip boundary condition on the velocity field. We derive our model from scratch by considering local mass balance and energy dissipation laws. Finally, the derivation is completed via the Langrange multiplier approach. We further show that our model generalizes previous models from the literature, which can be recovered from our system by either dropping the dynamic boundary conditions or assuming a static boundary of the domain.</description>

Abstract: In this series of papers, we investigate coupled systems arising in the study of two-component Bose--Einstein condensates, and we establish classification results for solutions of De Giorgi conjecture type. In the first paper of the series, we focus on the local problem of the form $\Delta u = u(u^2+v^2-1) + v(\alpha uv - \omega)$, $\Delta v = v(u^2+v^2-1) + u(\alpha uv - \omega)$, and prove that positive global solutions in $\mathbb{R}^3$ satisfying $\partial u/\partial x_3 &gt; 0 &gt; \partial v/\partial x_3$ must be one-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the three-dimensional non-isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations under a scaling-invariant smallness condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem of the non-isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with far-field vacuum. By deriving delicate energy estimates and exploiting the intrinsic structure of the system, we establish the global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions provided that the scaling-invariant quantity \begin{align*} (1+\bar{\rho}+\tfrac{1}{\bar{\rho}}) [\|\rho_{0}\|_{L^{3}}+ ( \bar{\rho}^{2}+\bar{\rho})( \| \sqrt{\rho_{0}}u_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2}+\| b_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2}) ] [\|\nabla u_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2}+(\bar{\rho}+1)\|\sqrt{\rho_{0}} \theta_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2}+\| \nabla b_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2}+\| b_{0}\|_{L^{4}}^{4} ] \end{align*} is sufficiently small, where $\bar{\rho}$ denotes the essential supremum of the initial density. Our result may be regarded as an improved version compared with that of Liu and the second author (J. Differential Equations 336 (2022), pp. 456--478) in the sense that an artificial condition $3\mu&gt;\lambda$ on the viscosity coefficients is removed. In particular, we provide a new scaling-invariant quantity regarding the initial data.</description>

      <title>Ground state solutions to the nonlinear Born-Infeld problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper we show the existence of ground state solutions to the nonlinear Born-Infeld problem \[ \mathrm{div}\, \left( \frac{\nabla u}{\sqrt{1-|\nabla u|^2}} \right) + f(u) = 0, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^N \] in the zero and positive mass cases. Moreover, we find a new proof of the Sobolev-type inequality \[ \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \left(1 - \sqrt{1-|\nabla u|^2}\right) \, dx \geq C_{N,p} \left( \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} |u|^p \, dx \right)^{\frac{N}{N+p}}, \] for $p &gt; 2^*$ as well as the characterization of the optimal constant $C_{N,p}$ in terms of the ground state energy level. Previous approaches relied on approximation schemes and/or symmetry assumptions, which typically yield to compact embeddings and may lead to solutions that are not at the ground state energy level. In contrast, neither approximation arguments nor symmetry assumptions are employed in the paper to obtain a ground state solution. Instead, we develop a new direct variational approach based on minimization over a Poho\v{z}aev manifold combined with profile decomposition techniques. Finally, we show that nonradial solutions exist whenever $N \geq 4$; in particular, this settles a previously open problem in the case $N=5$.</description>

      <title>A priori bounds for geodesic diameter. Part II. Fine connectedness properties of varifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05955v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For varifolds whose first variation is representable by integration, we introduce the notion of indecomposability with respect to locally Lipschitzian real valued functions. Unlike indecomposability, this weaker connectedness property is inherited by varifolds associated with solutions to geometric variational problems phrased in terms of sets, $G$ chains, and immersions; yet it is strong enough for the subsequent deduction of substantial geometric consequences therefrom. Our present study is based on several further concepts for varifolds put forward in this paper: real valued functions of generalised bounded variation thereon, partitions thereof in general, partition thereof along a real valued generalised weakly differentiable function in particular, and local finiteness of decompositions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first establish local $C^2$ estimates of solutions to the $\sigma_2$-curvature equation with nonlinear Neumann boundary condition. Then, under assumption that the mean curvature of a background metric is nonnegative on totally non-umbilic boundary, for dimensions three and four there exists a conformal metric having a prescribed positive $\sigma_2$-curvature and a prescribed nonnegative boundary mean curvature. The local estimates play an important role in the blow up analysis for the latter existence result.</description>

      <title>A note on disjoint hypercyclicity for invertible bilateral pseudo-shifts on $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z})$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first give a note on disjoint hypercyclicity for invertible bilateral pseudo-shifts on $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z})$, $1\leq p &lt;\infty$. It is already known that if a tuple of bilateral weighted shifts on $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z})$, $1\leq p &lt;\infty$, is disjoint hypercyclic, then non of the weighted shifts is invertible. We show that as for pseudo-shifts which is a generalization of weighted shifts, this fact is not true. We give an example of invertible bilateral pseudo-shifts on $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z})$, $1\leq p &lt;\infty$, which are disjoint hypercyclic and whose inverses are also disjoint hypercyclic. Next we partially answer to the open problem posed by Martin, Menet and Puig (2022)\cite{MMP22} concerned with disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic, that is, we show that as for the operators on a reflexive Banach space, reiteratively hypercyclic ones are disjoint hypercyclic if and only if they are disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic.</description>

      <title>Bright and dark breathers on an elliptic wave in the defocusing mKdV equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Breathers on an elliptic wave background consist of nonlinear superpositions of a soliton and a periodic wave, both traveling with different wave speeds and interacting periodically in the space-time. For the defocusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation, the construction of general breathers has been an open problem since the elliptic wave is related to the elliptic degeneration of the hyperelliptic solutions of genus two. We have found the new representation of eigenfunctions of the Lax operator associated with the elliptic wave, which enables us to solve this open problem and to construct two families of breathers with bright (elevation) and dark (depression) profiles.</description>

      <title>Studies on the Rao-Nakra Sandwich Beam: Well-Posedness, Dynamics, and Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the well-posedness, stabilization, and boundary controllability of a linear Rao-Nakra type sandwich beam. The system consists of three coupled equations that represent the longitudinal displacements of the outer layers and the transverse displacement of the composite beam, all of which are coupled with dynamical boundary conditions. In the first problem, time-dependent weights and delays are considered. Then, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the Cauchy problem associated with the damped system using semigroup theory and a classical result by Kato. Furthermore, employing a Lyapunov-based approach, we prove that the system's energy decays exponentially, despite the presence of time-varying weights and delays. In the second problem, we consider a boundary linear control system and prove its well-posedness. By deriving an observability inequality for the adjoint system and applying the Hilbert Uniqueness Method (HUM), we show that the system is null controllable. A key contribution of this work lies in handling the full three-equation coupled system, which involves significant difficulty due to the dynamic boundary conditions, resolved via appropriately constructed Lyapunov functionals and intermediate observability inequalities.</description>
