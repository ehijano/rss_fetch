      <title>Disentangling individual-level from location-based income uncovers socioeconomic preferential mobility and impacts segregation estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segregation encodes information about society, such as social cohesion, mixing, and inequality. However, most past and current studies tackled socioeconomic (SE) segregation by analyzing static aggregated mobility networks, often without considering further individual features beyond income and, most importantly, without distinguishing individual-level from location-based income. Accessing individual-level income may help mapping macroscopic behavior into more granular mobility patterns, hence impacting segregation estimates. Here we combine a mobile phone dataset of daily mobility flows across Spanish districts stratified and adjusted by age, gender and income with census data of districts median income. We build mobility-based SE assortativity matrices for multiple demographics and observe mobility patterns of three income groups with respect to location-based SE classes. We find that SE assortativity differs when isolating the mobility of specific income groups: we observe that groups prefer to visit areas with higher average income than their own, which we call preferential mobility. Our analysis suggests substantial differences between weekdays and weekends SE assortativity by age class, with weekends characterized by higher SE assortativity. Our modeling approach shows that the radiation model, which typically performs best at reproducing inter-municipal population mobility, best fits middle income and middle-aged flows, while performing worse on young and low income groups. Our double-sided approach, focusing on assortativity patterns and mobility modeling, suggests that state of the art mobility models fail at capturing preferential mobility behavior. Overall, our work indicates that mobility models considering the interplay of SE preferential behavior, age and gender gaps may sensibly improve the state of the art models performance.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Network Size and Frequency of Information Receipt on Polarization in Social Networks</title>

Abstract: Opinion Dynamics is an interdisciplinary area of research. Psychology and Sociology have proposed models of how individuals form opinions and how social interactions influence this process. Socio-Physicists have interpreted patterns in opinion formation as arising from non-linearity in the underlying process, shaping the models. Agent-based modeling has offered a platform to study the Opinion Dynamics of large groups. This paper recasts recent models in opinion formation into a proper dynamical system, injecting the idea of clock time into evolving opinions. The time interval between successive receipts of new information (frequency of information receipts) becomes a factor to study. Social media has shrunk time intervals between information receipts, increasing their frequency. The recast models show that shorter intervals and larger networks increase an individual's propensity for polarization, defined as an inability to hold a neutral opinion. A Polarization number based on sociological parameters is proposed, with critical values beyond which individuals are prone to polarization, depending on psychological parameters. Reduced time intervals and larger interacting groups can push the Polarization number to critical values, contributing to polarization. The Extent of Polarization is defined as the width of the region around neutral within which an individual cannot hold an opinion. Results are reported for model parameters found in the literature. The findings offer an opportunity to adjust model parameters to align with empirical evidence, aiding the study of Opinion Dynamics in large social networks using Agent-Based Modeling.</description>

      <title>Early-Career Researchers' Perspective on Future Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since its inception, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has significantly advanced particle physics and will continue to do so in the context of the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) program to collect $3000$ fb$^{-1}$ by the end of 2041. The particle physics community worldwide is discussing which future collider could follow in the footsteps of the LHC and uncover yet inaccessible phenomena.
  To foster the discussion on this important topic among the young particle physicist community, the Early-Career Researchers (ECR) panel of the European Committee for Future Colliders (ECFA) has organized the Future Colliders for Early-Career Researchers workshop at CERN in September 2023. This document aims to summarise this event and present the ECR perspective, outline the key questions that came up during the discussions, and explore how ECRs can influence the decision process of future colliders community and beyond.</description>

      <title>A refractory density approach to a multi-scale SEIRS epidemic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel multi-scale modeling framework for infectious disease spreading, borrowing ideas and modeling tools from the so-called Refractory Density (RD) approach. We introduce a microscopic model that describes the probability of infection for a single individual and the evolution of the disease within their body. From the individual-level description, we then present the corresponding population-level model of epidemic spreading on the mesoscopic and macroscopic scale. We conclude with numerical illustrations taking into account either a white Gaussian noise or an escape noise to showcase the potential of our approach in producing both transient and asymptotic complex dynamics as well as finite-size fluctuations consistently across multiple scales. A comparison with the epidemiology of coronaviruses is also given to corroborate the qualitative relevance of our new approach.</description>

      <title>Emergence of economic and social disparities through competitive gift-giving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several tiers of social organization with varying economic and social disparities have been observed. However, a quantitative characterization of the types and the causal mechanisms for the transitions have hardly been explained. While anthropologists have emphasized that gift exchange, rather than market exchange, prevails in traditional societies and shapes social relations, few mathematical studies have explored its consequences for social organizations. In this study, we present a simple model of competitive gift-giving that describes how gifts bring goods to the recipient and honor to the donor, and simulate social change. Numerical simulations and an analysis of the corresponding mean-field theory demonstrate the transitions between the following four phases with different distribution shapes of wealth and social reputation: the band, without economic or social disparities; the tribe, with economic but without social disparities; the chiefdom, with both; and the kingdom, with economic disparity and weak social disparity except for an outlier, namely, the ``monarch''. The emergence of strong disparities is characterized by power law distributions and is attributed to the ``rich get richer'' process. In contrast, the absence of such a process leads to exponential distributions due to random fluctuations. The phases depend on the parameters characterizing the frequency and scale of gift interactions. Our findings provide quantitative criteria for classifying social organizations based on economic and social disparities, consistent with anthropological theory and empirical observations. Thus, we propose empirically measurable explanatory variables and characteristics for the evolution of social organizations. The constructive model, guided by social scientific theory, can provide the basic mechanistic explanation of social evolution and integrate theories of the social sciences.</description>

      <title>Indirect social influence and diffusion of innovations: An experimental approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental feature for understanding the diffusion of innovations through a social group is the manner in which we are influenced by our own social interactions. It is usually assumed that only direct interactions, those that form our social network, determine the dynamics of adopting innovations. Here, we put this assumption to the test by experimentally and theoretically studying the role of direct and indirect influences in the adoption of innovations. We perform experiments specifically designed to capture the influence that an individual receives from their direct social ties as well as from those socially close to them, as a function of the separation they have in their social network. The results of 21 experimental sessions with more than 590 participants show that the rate of adoption of an innovation is significantly influenced not only by our nearest neighbors but also by the second and third levels of influences an adopter has. Using a mathematical model that accounts for both direct and indirect interactions in a network, we fit the experimental results and determine the way in which influences decay with social distance. The results indicate that the strength of peer pressure on an adopter coming from its second and third circles of influence is approximately 2/3 and 1/3, respectively, relative to their closest neighbors. Our results strongly suggest that innovation adoption is a complex process in which an individual feels significant pressure not only from their direct ties but also by those socially close to them.</description>

      <title>A Mereological Approach to Higher-Order Structure in Complex Systems: from Macro to Micro with M\"obius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14423v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relating microscopic interactions to macroscopic observables is a central challenge in the study of complex systems. Addressing this question requires understanding both pairwise and higher-order interactions, but the latter are less well understood. We present a unified mathematical formalism for deriving higher-order interactions from macroscopic observables, relative to a chosen decomposition of the system into its parts. Applying this framework to a diverse range of systems, we demonstrate that many existing notions of higher-order interactions, from epistasis in genetics and many-body couplings in physics, to synergy in game theory and artificial intelligence, naturally and uniquely arise from an appropriate mereological decomposition through the M\"obius inversion theorem. By revealing the common mathematical structure underlying seemingly disparate phenomena, our work highlights the fundamental role of decomposition choice in the definition and estimation of higher-order interactions. We discuss how this unifying perspective can facilitate the transfer of insights across domains, guide the selection of appropriate system decompositions, and enable the search for new notions of interaction. To illustrate how this works in practice, we derive a new decomposition of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and show that it correctly disentangles divergences among the variables of simulated spin models. Our results suggest that the M\"obius inversion theorem provides a powerful and practical lens for understanding the emergence of complex behaviour from the interplay of microscopic parts, with applications across a wide range of disciplines.</description>
