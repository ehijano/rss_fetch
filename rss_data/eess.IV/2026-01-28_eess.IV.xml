      <title>Lossy Image Compression -- A Frequent Sequence Mining perspective employing efficient Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the scope of Frequent Sequence Mining in the domain of Lossy Image Compression. The proposed work is based on the idea of clustering pixels and using the cluster identifiers in the compression. The DCT phase in JPEG is replaced with a combination of closed frequent sequence mining and k-means clustering to handle the redundant data effectively. This method focuses mainly on applying k-means clustering in parallel to all blocks of each component of the image to reduce the compression time. Conventional GSP algorithm is refined to optimize the cardinality of patterns through a novel pruning strategy, thus achieving a good reduction in the code table size. Simulations of the proposed algorithm indicate significant gains in compression ratio and quality in relation to the existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>OCTA-Based Biomarker Characterization in nAMD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to enhance ophthalmologists' decision-making when diagnosing the Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration (nAMD). We developed three tools to analyze Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography images: (1) extracting biomarkers such as mCNV area and vessel density using image processing; (2) generating a 3D visualization of the neovascularization for a better view of the affected regions; and (3) applying an ensemble of three white box machine learning algorithms (decision tree, support vector machines and DL-Learner) for nAMD diagnosis. The learned expressions reached 100% accuracy for the training data and 68% accuracy in testing. The main advantage is that all the learned models white-box, which ensures explainability and transparency, allowing clinicians to better understand the decision-making process.</description>

      <title>Advances in Diffusion-Based Generative Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Popularized by their strong image generation performance, diffusion and related methods for generative modeling have found widespread success in visual media applications. In particular, diffusion methods have enabled new approaches to data compression, where realistic reconstructions can be generated at extremely low bit-rates. This article provides a unifying review of recent diffusion-based methods for generative lossy compression, with a focus on image compression. These methods generally encode the source into an embedding and employ a diffusion model to iteratively refine it in the decoding procedure, such that the final reconstruction approximately follows the ground truth data distribution. The embedding can take various forms and is typically transmitted via an auxiliary entropy model, and recent methods also explore the use of diffusion models themselves for information transmission via channel simulation. We review representative approaches through the lens of rate-distortion-perception theory, highlighting the role of common randomness and connections to inverse problems, and identify open challenges.</description>

      <title>Optimized $k$-means color quantization of digital images in machine-based and human perception-based colorspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color quantization represents an image using a fraction of its original number of colors while only minimally losing its visual quality. The $k$-means algorithm is commonly used in this context, but has mostly been applied in the machine-based RGB colorspace composed of the three primary colors. However, some recent studies have indicated its improved performance in human perception-based colorspaces. We investigated the performance of $k$-means color quantization at four quantization levels in the RGB, CIE-XYZ, and CIE-LUV/CIE-HCL colorspaces, on 148 varied digital images spanning a wide range of scenes, subjects and settings. The Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) measure numerically assessed the quality of the quantized images, and showed that in about half of the cases, $k$-means color quantization is best in the RGB space, while at other times, and especially for higher quantization levels ($k$), the CIE-XYZ colorspace is where it usually does better. There are also some cases, especially at lower $k$, where the best performance is obtained in the CIE-LUV colorspace. Further analysis of the performances in terms of the distributions of the hue, chromaticity and luminance in an image presents a nuanced perspective and characterization of the images for which each colorspace is better for $k$-means color quantization.</description>

      <title>Recover Cell Tensor: Diffusion-Equivalent Tensor Completion for Fluorescence Microscopy Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy (FM) imaging is a fundamental technique for observing live cell division, one of the most essential processes in the cycle of life and death. Observing 3D live cells requires scanning through the cell volume while minimizing lethal phototoxicity. That limits acquisition time and results in sparsely sampled volumes with anisotropic resolution and high noise. Existing image restoration methods, primarily based on inverse problem modeling, assume known and stable degradation processes and struggle under such conditions, especially in the absence of high-quality reference volumes. In this paper, from a new perspective, we propose a novel tensor completion framework tailored to the nature of FM imaging, which inherently involves nonlinear signal degradation and incomplete observations. Specifically, FM imaging with equidistant Z-axis sampling is essentially a tensor completion task under a uniformly random sampling condition. On one hand, we derive the theoretical lower bound for exact cell tensor completion, validating the feasibility of accurately recovering 3D cell tensor. On the other hand, we reformulate the tensor completion problem as a mathematically equivalent score-based generative model. By incorporating structural consistency priors, the generative trajectory is effectively guided toward denoised and geometrically coherent reconstructions. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on SR-CACO-2 and three real \textit{in vivo} cellular datasets, showing substantial improvements in both signal-to-noise ratio and structural fidelity.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Simulation of Effective Transverse Relaxation (T2*)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To simulate effective transverse relaxation ($T_2^*$) as a part of MR simulation. $T_2^*$ consists of reversible ($T_2^{\prime}$) and irreversible ($T_2$) components. Whereas simulations of $T_2$ are easy, $T_2^{\prime}$ is not easily simulated if only magnetizations of individual isochromats are simulated.
  Theory and Methods: Efficient methods for simulating $T_2^{\prime}$ were proposed. To approximate the Lorentzian function of $T_2^{\prime}$ realistically, conventional simulators require 100+ isochromats. This approximation can be avoided by utilizing a linear phase model for simulating an entire Lorentzian function directly. To represent the linear phase model, the partial derivatives of the magnetizations with respect to the frequency axis were also simulated. To accelerate the simulations with these partial derivatives, the proposed methods introduced two techniques: analytic solutions, and combined transitions. For understanding the fundamental mechanism of the proposed method, a simple one-isochromat simulation was performed. For evaluating realistic cases, several pulse sequences were simulated using two phantoms with and without $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations.
  Results: The one-isochromat simulation demonstrated that $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations were possible. In the realistic cases, $T_2^{\prime}$ was recovered as expected without using 100+ isochromats for each point. The computational times with $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations were only 2.0 to 2.7 times longer than those without $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations. When the above-mentioned two techniques were utilized, the analytic solutions accelerated 19 times, and the combined transitions accelerated up to 17 times.
  Conclusion: Both theory and results showed that the proposed methods simulated $T_2^{\prime}$ efficiently by utilizing a linear model with a Lorentzian function, analytic solutions, and combined transitions.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Rate Control for Neural Video Compression via Inter-Frame Rate-Distortion Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has demonstrated superior compression efficiency, yet effective rate control remains a significant challenge due to complex temporal dependencies. Existing rate control schemes typically leverage frame content to capture distortion interactions, overlooking inter-frame rate dependencies arising from shifts in per-frame coding parameters. This often leads to suboptimal bitrate allocation and cascading parameter decisions. To address this, we propose a reinforcement-learning (RL)-based rate control framework that formulates the task as a frame-by-frame sequential decision process. At each frame, an RL agent observes a spatiotemporal state and selects coding parameters to optimize a long-term reward that reflects rate-distortion (R-D) performance and bitrate adherence. Unlike prior methods, our approach jointly determines bitrate allocation and coding parameters in a single step, independent of group of pictures (GOP) structure. Extensive experiments across diverse NVC architectures show that our method reduces the average relative bitrate error to 1.20% and achieves up to 13.45% bitrate savings at typical GOP sizes, outperforming existing approaches. In addition, our framework demonstrates improved robustness to content variation and bandwidth fluctuations with lower coding overhead, making it highly suitable for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>AMGFormer: Adaptive Multi-Granular Transformer for Brain Tumor Segmentation with Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal MRI is essential for brain tumor segmentation, yet missing modalities in clinical practice cause existing methods to exhibit &gt;40% performance variance across modality combinations, rendering them clinically unreliable. We propose AMGFormer, achieving significantly improved stability through three synergistic modules: (1) QuadIntegrator Bridge (QIB) enabling spatially adaptive fusion maintaining consistent predictions regardless of available modalities, (2) Multi-Granular Attention Orchestrator (MGAO) focusing on pathological regions to reduce background sensitivity, and (3) Modality Quality-Aware Enhancement (MQAE) preventing error propagation from corrupted sequences. On BraTS 2018, our method achieves 89.33% WT, 82.70% TC, 67.23% ET Dice scores with &lt;0.5% variance across 15 modality combinations, solving the stability crisis. Single-modality ET segmentation shows 40-81% relative improvements over state-of-the-art methods. The method generalizes to BraTS 2020/2021, achieving up to 92.44% WT, 89.91% TC, 84.57% ET. The model demonstrates potential for clinical deployment with 1.2s inference. Code: https://github.com/guochengxiangives/AMGFormer.</description>

      <title>Interpretable and backpropagation-free Green Learning for efficient multi-task echocardiographic segmentation and classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Echocardiography is a cornerstone for managing heart failure (HF), with Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) being a critical metric for guiding therapy. However, manual LVEF assessment suffers from high inter-observer variability, while existing Deep Learning (DL) models are often computationally intensive and data-hungry "black boxes" that impede clinical trust and adoption. Here, we propose a backpropagation-free multi-task Green Learning (MTGL) framework that performs simultaneous Left Ventricle (LV) segmentation and LVEF classification. Our framework integrates an unsupervised VoxelHop encoder for hierarchical spatio-temporal feature extraction with a multi-level regression decoder and an XG-Boost classifier. On the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, our MTGL model achieves state-of-the-art classification and segmentation performance, attaining a classification accuracy of 94.3% and a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.912, significantly outperforming several advanced 3D DL models. Crucially, our model achieves this with over an order of magnitude fewer parameters, demonstrating exceptional computational efficiency. This work demonstrates that the GL paradigm can deliver highly accurate, efficient, and interpretable solutions for complex medical image analysis, paving the way for more sustainable and trustworthy artificial intelligence in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Towards Gold-Standard Depth Estimation for Tree Branches in UAV Forestry: Benchmarking Deep Stereo Matching Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous UAV forestry operations require robust depth estimation with strong cross-domain generalization, yet existing evaluations focus on urban and indoor scenarios, leaving a critical gap for vegetation-dense environments. We present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of eight stereo methods spanning iterative refinement, foundation model, diffusion-based, and 3D CNN paradigms. All methods use officially released pretrained weights (trained on Scene Flow) and are evaluated on four standard benchmarks (ETH3D, KITTI 2012/2015, Middlebury) plus a novel 5,313-pair Canterbury Tree Branches dataset ($1920 \times 1080$). Results reveal scene-dependent patterns: foundation models excel on structured scenes (BridgeDepth: 0.23 px on ETH3D; DEFOM: 4.65 px on Middlebury), while iterative methods show variable cross-benchmark performance (IGEV++: 0.36 px on ETH3D but 6.77 px on Middlebury; IGEV: 0.33 px on ETH3D but 4.99 px on Middlebury). Qualitative evaluation on the Tree Branches dataset establishes DEFOM as the gold-standard baseline for vegetation depth estimation, with superior cross-domain consistency (consistently ranking 1st-2nd across benchmarks, average rank 1.75). DEFOM predictions will serve as pseudo-ground-truth for future benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Extensions on Low-complexity DCT Approximations for Larger Blocklengths Based on Minimal Angle Similarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discrete cosine transform (DCT) is a central tool for image and video coding because it can be related to the Karhunen-Lo\`eve transform (KLT), which is the optimal transform in terms of retained transform coefficients and data decorrelation. In this paper, we introduce 16-, 32-, and 64-point low-complexity DCT approximations by minimizing individually the angle between the rows of the exact DCT matrix and the matrix induced by the approximate transforms. According to some classical figures of merit, the proposed transforms outperformed the approximations for the DCT already known in the literature. Fast algorithms were also developed for the low-complexity transforms, asserting a good balance between the performance and its computational cost. Practical applications in image encoding showed the relevance of the transforms in this context. In fact, the experiments showed that the proposed transforms had better results than the known approximations in the literature for the cases of 16, 32, and 64 blocklength.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-enhanced Pretraining for Vision-language Pathology Foundation Model on Cancer Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language foundation models have shown great promise in computational pathology but remain primarily data-driven, lacking explicit integration of medical knowledge. We introduce KEEP (KnowledgE-Enhanced Pathology), a foundation model that systematically incorporates disease knowledge into pretraining for cancer diagnosis. KEEP leverages a comprehensive disease knowledge graph encompassing 11,454 diseases and 139,143 attributes to reorganize millions of pathology image-text pairs into 143,000 semantically structured groups aligned with disease ontology hierarchies. This knowledge-enhanced pretraining aligns visual and textual representations within hierarchical semantic spaces, enabling deeper understanding of disease relationships and morphological patterns. Across 18 public benchmarks (over 14,000 whole-slide images) and 4 institutional rare cancer datasets (926 cases), KEEP consistently outperformed existing foundation models, showing substantial gains for rare subtypes. These results establish knowledge-enhanced vision-language modeling as a powerful paradigm for advancing computational pathology.</description>

      <title>Hint: hierarchical inter-frame correlation for one-shot point cloud sequence compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated strong capability in compressing point clouds. Within this area, entropy modeling for lossless compression is widely investigated. However, most methods rely solely on parent/sibling contexts and level-wise autoregression, which suffers from decoding latency on the order of 10^1-10^2 seconds. We propose HINT, a method that integrates temporal and spatial correlation for sequential point cloud compression. Specifically, it first uses a two-stage temporal feature extraction: (i) a parent-level existence map and (ii) a child-level neighborhood lookup in the previous frame. These cues are fused with the spatial features via element-wise addition and encoded with a group-wise strategy. Experimental results show that HINT achieves encoding and decoding time at 105 ms and 140 ms, respectively, equivalent to 49.6x and 21.6x acceleration in comparison with G-PCC, while achieving up to 43.6% bitrate reduction and consistently outperforming the spatial-only baseline (RENO).</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, coupled with increasing data bandwidth requirements, in applications such as video processing and high-resolution sensing, have created a growing demand for high computational performance under stringent energy constraints, especially for battery-powered and edge devices. To address this, we present a mixed-signal adiabatic capacitive neural network chip, designed in a 130$nm$ CMOS technology, to demonstrate significant energy savings coupled with high image classification accuracy. Our dual-layer hardware chip, incorporating 16 single-cycle multiply-accumulate engines, can reliably distinguish between 4 classes of 8x8 1-bit images, with classification results over 95\%, within 2.7\% of an equivalent software version. Energy measurements reveal average energy savings between 2.1x and 6.8x, compared to an equivalent CMOS capacitive implementation.</description>

      <title>Q-Probe: Scaling Image Quality Assessment to High Resolution via Context-Aware Agentic Probing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to achieve superior human preference alignment in Image Quality Assessment (IQA). However, existing RL-based IQA models typically rely on coarse-grained global views, failing to capture subtle local degradations in high-resolution scenarios. While emerging "Thinking with Images" paradigms enable multi-scale visual perception via zoom-in mechanisms, their direct adaptation to IQA induces spurious "cropping-implies-degradation" biases and misinterprets natural depth-of-field as artifacts. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Probe, the first agentic IQA framework designed to scale IQA to high resolution via context-aware probing. First, we construct Vista-Bench, a pioneering benchmark tailored for fine-grained local degradation analysis in high-resolution IQA settings. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage training paradigm that progressively aligns the model with human preferences, while simultaneously eliminating causal bias through a novel context-aware cropping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Probe achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-resolution settings while maintaining superior efficacy across resolution scales.</description>

      <title>Assessing metadata privacy in neuroimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ethical and legal imperative to share research data without causing harm requires careful attention to privacy risks. While mounting evidence demonstrates that data sharing benefits science, legitimate concerns persist regarding the potential leakage of personal information that could lead to reidentification and subsequent harm. We reviewed metadata accompanying neuroimaging datasets from heterogeneous studies openly available on OpenNeuro, involving participants across the lifespan, from children to older adults, with and without clinical diagnoses, and including associated clinical score data. Using metaprivBIDS (https://github.com/CPernet/metaprivBIDS), a software application for BIDS compliant tsv/json files that computes and reports different privacy metrics (k-anonymity, k-global, l-diversity, SUDA, PIF), we found that privacy is generally well maintained, with serious vulnerabilities being rare. Nonetheless, issues were identified in nearly all datasets and warrant mitigation. Notably, clinical score data (e.g., neuropsychological results) posed minimal reidentification risk, whereas demographic variables: age, sex assigned at birth, sexual orientations, race, income, and geolocation, represented the principal privacy vulnerabilities. We outline practical measures to address these risks, enabling safer data sharing practices.</description>

      <title>Universal Beta Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Universal Beta Splatting (UBS), a unified framework that generalizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to N-dimensional anisotropic Beta kernels for explicit radiance field rendering. Unlike fixed Gaussian primitives, Beta kernels enable controllable dependency modeling across spatial, angular, and temporal dimensions within a single representation. Our unified approach captures complex light transport effects, handles anisotropic view-dependent appearance, and models scene dynamics without requiring auxiliary networks or specific color encodings. UBS maintains backward compatibility by approximating to Gaussian Splatting as a special case, guaranteeing plug-in usability and lower performance bounds. The learned Beta parameters naturally decompose scene properties into interpretable without explicit supervision: spatial (surface vs. texture), angular (diffuse vs. specular), and temporal (static vs. dynamic). Our CUDA-accelerated implementation achieves real-time rendering while consistently outperforming existing methods across static, view-dependent, and dynamic benchmarks, establishing Beta kernels as a scalable universal primitive for radiance field rendering.

      <title>Adaptive Multimodal Person Recognition: A Robust Framework for Handling Missing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Person identification systems often rely on audio, visual, or behavioral cues, but real-world conditions frequently present with missing or degraded modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a multimodal person identification framework incorporating upper-body motion, face, and voice. Experimental results demonstrate that body motion outperforms traditional modalities such as face and voice in within-session evaluations, while serving as a complementary cue that enhances performance in multi-session scenarios. Our model employs a unified hybrid fusion strategy, fusing both feature-level and score-level information to maximize representational richness and decision accuracy. Specifically, it leverages multi-task learning to process modalities independently, followed by cross-attention and gated fusion mechanisms to exploit both unimodal information and cross-modal interactions. Finally, a confidence-weighted strategy and mistake-correction mechanism dynamically adapt to missing data, ensuring that our single classification head achieves optimal performance even in unimodal and bimodal scenarios. We evaluate our method on CANDOR, a newly introduced interview-based multimodal dataset, which we benchmark in this work for the first time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed trimodal system achieves 99.51% Top-1 accuracy on person identification tasks. In addition, we evaluate our model on the VoxCeleb1 dataset as a widely used evaluation protocol and reach 99.92% accuracy in bimodal mode, outperforming conventional approaches. Moreover, we show that our system maintains high accuracy even when one or two modalities are unavailable, making it a robust solution for real-world person recognition applications. The code and data for this work are publicly available.</description>
