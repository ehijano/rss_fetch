Abstract: A new coordinate system on the tangent space to planar configurations is introduced to simplify some calculations on central configurations and relative equilibria in the $N$-body problem with a homogeneous potential, which includes the case of Newtonian gravity. These coordinates are applied to some problems on four-body central configurations to illustrate their utility.</description>

      <title>Learning the Chaotic and Regular Nature of Trajectories in Hamiltonian Systems with Lagrangian descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of Machine Learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM), to unveil the chaotic and regular nature of trajectories in Hamiltonian systems using Lagrangian descriptors. Traditional chaos indicators, while effective, are computationally expensive and require an exhaustive study of the parameter space to establish the classification thresholds. By using SVMs trained on a dataset obtained from the analysis of the dynamics of the double pendulum Hamiltonian system, we aim at reducing the complexity of this process. Our trained SVM models demonstrate high accuracy when it comes to classifying trajectories in diverse Hamiltonian systems, such as for example in the four-well Hamiltonian, the H\'enon-Heiles system and the Chirikov Standard Map. The results indicate that SVMs, when combined with Lagrangian descriptors, offer a robust and efficient method for chaos classification across different dynamical systems. Our approach not only simplifies the classification process but also is highlighting the potential of Machine Learning algorithms in the study of nonlinear dynamics and chaos.</description>

      <title>Spatial analysis of tails of air pollution PDFs in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Outdoor air pollution is estimated to cause a huge number of premature deaths worldwide, it catalyses many diseases on a variety of time scales, and it has a detrimental effect on the environment. In light of these impacts it is necessary to obtain a better understanding of the dynamics and statistics of measured air pollution concentrations, including temporal fluctuations of observed concentrations and spatial heterogeneities. Here we present an extensive analysis for measured data from Europe. The observed probability density functions (PDFs) of air pollution concentrations depend very much on the spatial location and on the pollutant substance. We analyse a large number of time series data from 3544 different European monitoring sites and show that the PDFs of nitric oxide ($NO$), nitrogen dioxide ($NO_{2}$) and particulate matter ($PM_{10}$ and $PM_{2.5}$) concentrations generically exhibit heavy tails. These are asymptotically well approximated by $q$-exponential distributions with a given entropic index $q$ and width parameter $\lambda$. We observe that the power-law parameter $q$ and the width parameter $\lambda$ vary widely for the different spatial locations. We present the results of our data analysis in the form of a map that shows which parameters $q$ and $\lambda$ are most relevant in a given region. A variety of interesting spatial patterns is observed that correlate to properties of the geographical region. We also present results on typical time scales associated with the dynamical behaviour.</description>

      <title>Phase transition in a kinetic mean-field game model of inertial self-propelled agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The framework of Mean-field Games (MFGs) is used for modelling the collective dynamics of large populations of non-cooperative decision-making agents. We formulate and analyze a kinetic MFG model for an interacting system of non-cooperative motile agents with inertial dynamics and finite-range interactions, where each agent is minimizing a biologically inspired cost function. By analyzing the associated coupled forward-backward in time system of nonlinear Fokker-Planck and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, we obtain conditions for closed-loop linear stability of the spatially homogeneous MFG equilibrium that corresponds to an ordered state with non-zero mean speed. Using a combination of analysis and numerical simulations, we show that when energetic cost of control is reduced below a critical value, this equilibrium loses stability, and the system transitions to a travelling wave solution. Our work provides a game-theoretic perspective to the problem of collective motion in non-equilibrium biological and bio-inspired systems.</description>

      <title>Overlapping substitutions and tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by \cite{DBZ},we generalize the notion of (geometric) substitution rule to obtain overlapping substitutions. For such a substitution, the substitution matrix may have non-integer entries. We give the meaning of such a matrix by showing that the right Perron--Frobenius eigenvector gives the patch frequency of the resulting tiling. We also show that the expansion constant is an algebraic integer under mild conditions. In general, overlapping substitutions may yield a patch with contradictory overlaps of tiles, even if it is locally consistent. We give a sufficient condition for an overlapping substitution to be consistent, that is, no such contradiction will emerge. We also give many one-dimensional examples of overlapping substitution. We finish by mentioning a construction of overlapping substitutions from Delone multi-sets with inflation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for predicting the occurrence of tipping points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tipping points occur in many real-world systems, at which the system shifts suddenly from one state to another. The ability to predict the occurrence of tipping points from time series data remains an outstanding challenge and a major interest in a broad range of research fields. Particularly, the widely used methods based on bifurcation theory are neither reliable in prediction accuracy nor applicable for irregularly-sampled time series which are commonly observed from real-world systems. Here we address this challenge by developing a deep learning algorithm for predicting the occurrence of tipping points in untrained systems, by exploiting information about normal forms. Our algorithm not only outperforms traditional methods for regularly-sampled model time series but also achieves accurate predictions for irregularly-sampled model time series and empirical time series. Our ability to predict tipping points for complex systems paves the way for mitigation risks, prevention of catastrophic failures, and restoration of degraded systems, with broad applications in social science, engineering, and biology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For control-affine systems on non-compact manifolds, the notion of strong chain control sets is introduced and related to the strong chain transitivity of the associated control flows. Affine control systems on R^n are embedded into bilinear control systems in an extended state space and it is shown that they are topologically conjugate to the induced system on the northern hemisphere of the Poincar\'e sphere. This preserves strong chain control sets. Further chain controllability properties on spheres are analyzed</description>

      <title>Learning Chaotic Systems and Long-Term Predictions with Neural Jump ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Path-dependent Neural Jump ODE (PD-NJ-ODE) is a model for online prediction of generic (possibly non-Markovian) stochastic processes with irregular (in time) and potentially incomplete (with respect to coordinates) observations. It is a model for which convergence to the $L^2$-optimal predictor, which is given by the conditional expectation, is established theoretically. Thereby, the training of the model is solely based on a dataset of realizations of the underlying stochastic process, without the need of knowledge of the law of the process. In the case where the underlying process is deterministic, the conditional expectation coincides with the process itself. Therefore, this framework can equivalently be used to learn the dynamics of ODE or PDE systems solely from realizations of the dynamical system with different initial conditions. We showcase the potential of our method by applying it to the chaotic system of a double pendulum. When training the standard PD-NJ-ODE method, we see that the prediction starts to diverge from the true path after about half of the evaluation time. In this work we enhance the model with two novel ideas, which independently of each other improve the performance of our modelling setup. The resulting dynamics match the true dynamics of the chaotic system very closely. The same enhancements can be used to provably enable the PD-NJ-ODE to learn long-term predictions for general stochastic datasets, where the standard model fails. This is verified in several experiments.</description>

      <title>Behaviors, trajectories and data: A novel perspective on the design of unknown-input observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel perspective, based on Willems' "behavior theory", on the design of an unknown-input observer for a given linear time-invariant discrete-time state-space model, with unknown disturbances affecting both the state and the output equations. The problem is first addressed assuming that the original system model is known, and later assuming that the model is unknown but historical data satisfying a certain assumption are available. In both cases, fundamental concepts in behavior theory, as the projection of a behavior, the inclusion of a behavior in another one, and the use of kernel and image representations, provide quite powerful tools to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an unknown-input observer (UIO), as well as algorithms to design one of them, if it exists.</description>

      <title>ESDIRK-based nonlinear model predictive control for stochastic differential-algebraic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) algorithm for systems modeled by semi-explicit stochastic differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) of index 1. The NMPC combines a continuous-discrete extended Kalman filter (CD-EKF) with an optimal control problem (OCP) for setpoint tracking. We discretize the OCP using direct multiple shooting. We apply an explicit singly diagonal implicit Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK) integration scheme to solve systems of DAEs, both for the one-step prediction in the CD-EKF and in each shooting interval of the discretized OCP. The ESDIRK methods use an iterated internal numerical differentiation approach for precise sensitivity computations. These sensitivities are used to provide accurate gradient information in the OCP and to efficiently integrate the covariance information in the CD-EKF. Subsequently, we present a simulation case study where we apply the NMPC to a simple alkaline electrolyzer stack model. We use the NMPC to track a time-varying setpoint for the stack temperature subject to input bound constraints.</description>

      <title>Unstable Invariant Measures and Connecting Orbits of Cooperative McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general framework for studying McKean-Vlasov SDEs via monotone dynamical systems is established in this paper. Under a cooperative condition, we show McKean-Vlasov SDEs admit a comparison principle with respect to the stochastic order, and generate monotone dynamical systems on the $2$-Wasserstein space. Our main results prove the existence of unstable invariant measures, total orderedness of invariant measures, and the existence of monotone connecting orbits between order-related invariant measures for general cooperative McKean-Vlasov SDEs. To achieve our goals, we adopt the theory of monotone dynamical systems, extend the connecting orbit theorem, and deduce a dichotomy structure of equilibria. This method is different from existing approaches, like propagation of chaos and Fokker-Planck equations. A wide range of classical examples are covered by our framework, such as granular media equations in double-well and multi-well confinement potentials with quadratic interaction, double-well landscapes with perturbation, and higher dimensional equations, even driven by multiplicative noises.</description>

Abstract: The paper is concerned with random $S$-adic systems arising from an i.i.d. sequence of unimodular substitutions. Using equidistribution results of Benoist and Quint, we show in Theorem 3.3 that, under some natural assumptions, if the Lyapunov exponent of the spectral cocycle is strictly less that 1/2 of the Lyapunov exponent of the random walk on $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ driven by the sequence of substitution matrices, then almost surely the spectrum of the $S$-adic $\mathbb{Z}$-action is singular with respect to any (fixed in advance) continuous measure. Finally, the appendix discusses the weak-mixing property for random $S$-adic systems associated to the family of substitutions introduced in Example 4.2.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Fourier transform of Patterson-Sullivan measures associated to convex cocompact groups of isometries of real hyperbolic space decays polynomially quickly at infinity. The proof is based on the $L^2$-flattening theorem obtained in prior work of the author, combined with a method based on dynamical self-similarity for ruling out the sparse set of potential frequencies where the Fourier transform can be large.</description>

Abstract: This article investigates the Kuramoto model with three oscillators that are interconnected by an isosceles triangle network. The characteristic of this model is that the coupling connections between the oscillators can be either attractive or repulsive. We list all critical points and investigate their stability. We furthermore present a framework studying convergence towards stable critical points under special coupled strengths. The main tool is the linearization and the monotonicity arguments of oscillator diameter.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Phi$ be a $C^\omega (\mathbb{C})$ self-conformal IFS on the plane, satisfying some mild non-linearity and irreducibility conditions. We prove a uniform spectral gap estimate for the transfer operator corresponding to the derivative cocycle and every given self-conformal measure. Building on this result, we establish polynomial Fourier decay for any such measure. Our technique is based on a refinement of a method of Oh-Winter (2017) where we do not require separation from the IFS or the Federer property for the underlying measure.</description>

Abstract: We compute the resultant measures for iterations $P^j$, $j\ge 1$, of a polynomial $P$ of degree $&gt;1$ on the $n$-th level Trucco's trees $\Gamma_n$, $n\ge 0$, in the Berkovich projective line over a non-archimedean field and also determine their barycenters. As applications, we study the asymptotic of those barycenters as $n\to\infty$, and establish a uniform stationarity of Rumely's minimal resultant loci of $P^j$ or equivalently that of the potential semistable reduction loci of $P^j$ as $j\to\infty$. We also establish several equidistribution results for the resultant measures themselves as $n\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Conjugacy for certain automorphisms of the one-sided shift via transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the following open problem, implicit in the 1990 article "Automorphisms of one-sided subshifts of finite type" of Boyle, Franks and Kitchens (BFK):
  "Does there exists an element $\psi$ in the group of automorphisms of the one-sided shift $\operatorname{Aut}(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}^{\mathbb{N}}, \sigma_{n})$ so that all points of $\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ have orbits of length $n$ under $\psi$ and $\psi$ is not conjugate to a permutation?"
  Here, by a 'permutation' we mean an automorphism of one-sided shift dynamical system induced by a permutation of the symbol set $\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$.
  We resolve this question by showing that any $\psi$ with properties as above must be conjugate to a permutation.
  Our techniques naturally extend those of BFK using the strongly synchronizing automata technology developed here and in several articles of the authors and collaborators (although, this article has been written to be largely self-contained).</description>

      <title>Principal spectral theory and asymptotic behavior of the spectral bound for partially degenerate nonlocal dispersal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16221</link>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the principal spectral theory and asymptotic behavior of the spectral bound for cooperative nonlocal dispersal systems, specifically focusing on the case where partial diffusion coefficients are zero, referred to as the partially degenerate case. We propose two sufficient conditions that ensure the existence of the principal eigenvalue in these partially degenerate systems. Additionally, we study the asymptotic behavior of the spectral bound for nonlocal dispersal operators with small and large diffusion coefficients, considering both non-degenerate and partially degenerate cases. Notably, we find a threshold-type result as the diffusion coefficients tend towards infinity in the partially degenerate case. Finally, we apply these findings to discuss the asymptotic behavior of the basic reproduction ratio in a viral diffusion model.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Solutions for Complex PDEs: Introducing Complementary Convolution and Equivariant Attention in Fourier Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators improve conventional neural networks by expanding their capabilities of functional mappings between different function spaces to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). One of the most notable methods is the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), which draws inspiration from Green's function method and directly approximates operator kernels in the frequency domain. However, after empirical observation followed by theoretical validation, we demonstrate that the FNO approximates kernels primarily in a relatively low-frequency domain. This suggests a limited capability in solving complex PDEs, particularly those characterized by rapid coefficient changes and oscillations in the solution space. Such cases are crucial in specific scenarios, like atmospheric convection and ocean circulation. To address this challenge, inspired by the translation equivariant of the convolution kernel, we propose a novel hierarchical Fourier neural operator along with convolution-residual layers and attention mechanisms to make them complementary in the frequency domain to solve complex PDEs. We perform experiments on forward and reverse problems of multiscale elliptic equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and other physical scenarios, and find that the proposed method achieves superior performance in these PDE benchmarks, especially for equations characterized by rapid coefficient variations.</description>

      <title>Spherical higher order Fourier analysis over finite fields III: a spherical Gowers inverse theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the third part of the series "Spherical higher order Fourier analysis over finite fields", aiming to develop the higher order Fourier analysis method along spheres over finite fields, and to solve the geometric Ramsey conjecture in the finite field setting.
  In this paper, we prove an inverse theorem over finite field for spherical Gowers norms, i.e. a local Gowers norm supported on a sphere. We show that if the $(s+1)$-th spherical Gowers norm of a 1-bounded function $f\colon\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}\to \mathbb{C}$ is at least $\epsilon$ and if $d$ is sufficiently large depending only on $s$, then $f$ correlates on the sphere with a $p$-periodic $s$-step nilsequence, where the bounds for the complexity and correlation depend only on $d$ and $\epsilon$. This result will be used in later parts of the series to prove the geometric Ramsey conjecture in the finite field setting.</description>

      <title>Spherical higher order Fourier analysis over finite fields IV: an application to the Geometric Ramsey Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the fourth and the last part of the series "Spherical higher order Fourier analysis over finite fields", aiming to develop the higher order Fourier analysis method along spheres over finite fields, and to solve the Geometric Ramsey Conjecture in the finite field setting.
  In this paper, we proof a conjecture of Graham on the Remsey properties for spherical configurations in the finite field setting. To be more precise, we show that for any spherical configuration $X$ of $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$ of complexity at most $C$ with $d$ being sufficiently large with respect to $C$ and $\vert X\vert$, and for some prime $p$ being sufficiently large with respect to $C$, $\vert X\vert$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, any set $E\subseteq \mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$ with $\vert E\vert&gt;\epsilon p^{d}$ contains at least $\gg_{C,\epsilon,\vert X\vert}p^{(k+1)d-(k+1)k/2}$ congruent copies of $X$, where $k$ is the dimension of $\text{span}_{\mathbb{F}_{p}}(X-X)$. The novelty of our approach is that we avoid the use of harmonic analysis, and replace it by the theory of spherical higher order Fourier analysis developed in previous parts of the series.</description>

      <title>Spherical higher order Fourier analysis over finite fields I: equidistribution for nilsequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the first part of the series "Spherical higher order Fourier analysis over finite fields", aiming to develop the higher order Fourier analysis method along spheres over finite fields, and to solve the geometric Ramsey conjecture in the finite field setting.
  In this paper, we prove a quantitative equidistribution theorem for polynomial sequences in a nilmanifold, where the average is taken along spheres instead of cubes. To be more precise, let $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{Z}^{d}$ be the preimage of a sphere $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$ under the natural embedding from $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ to $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$. We showed that if a rational polynomial sequence $(g(n)\Gamma)_{n\in\Omega}$ is not equidistributed on a nilmanifold $G/\Gamma$, then there exists a nontrivial horizontal character $\eta$ of $G/\Gamma$ such that $\eta\circ g \mod \mathbb{Z}$ vanishes on $\Omega$.
  We also prove quantitative equidistribution and factorization theorems for more general sets arising from quadratic forms defined over $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$. These results will serve as fundamental tools in later parts of the series to proof the spherical Gowers inverse theorem and the geometric Ramsey conjecture.</description>

      <title>An optimal transport model for dynamical shapes, collective motion and cellular aggregates</title>

Abstract: Many biological systems such as cell aggregates, tissues or bacterial colonies behave as unconventional systems of particles that are strongly constrained by volume exclusion and shape interactions. Understanding how these constraints lead to macroscopic self-organized structures is a fundamental question in e.g. developmental biology. To this end, various types of computational models have been developed: phase fields, cellular automata, vertex models, level-set, finite element simulations, etc. We introduce a new framework based on optimal transport theory to model particle systems with arbitrary dynamical shapes and deformability. Our method builds upon the pioneering work of Brenier on incompressible fluids and its recent applications to materials science. It lets us specify the shapes of individual cells and supports a wide range of interaction mechanisms, while automatically taking care of the volume exclusion constraint at an affordable numerical cost. We showcase the versatility of this approach by reproducing several classical systems in computational biology.

      <title>Irregular Fixation: I. Fixed points and librating orbits of the Brown Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In hierarchical triple systems, the inner binary is slowly perturbed by a distant companion, giving rise to large-scale oscillations in eccentricity and inclination, known as von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations. Stable systems with a mild hierarchy, where the period ratio is not too small, require an additional corrective term, known as the Brown Hamiltonian, to adequately account for their long-term evolution. Although the Brown Hamiltonian has been used to accurately describe the highly eccentric systems on circulating orbits where the periapse completes a complete revolution, the analysis near its elliptical fixed points had been overlooked. We derive analytically the modified fixed points including the Brown Hamiltonian and analyse its librating orbits (where the periapse motion is limited in range). We compare our result to the direct three-body integrations of millions of orbits and discuss the regimes of validity. We numerically discover the regions of orbital instability, allowed and forbidden librating zones with a complex, fractal, structure. The retrograde orbits, where the mutual inclination is $\iota &gt; 90\ \rm deg$, are more stable and allowed to librate for larger areas of the parameter space. We find numerical fits for the librating-circulating boundary. Finally, we discuss the astrophysical implications for systems of satellites, stars and compact objects. In a companion paper (paper II), we apply our formalism to the orbits of irregular satellites around giant planets.</description>
