      <title>Conjugate gradient direct minimization on the complex Stiefel manifold in Kohn-Sham density functional theory for finite and extended systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct minimization method on the complex Stiefel manifold in Kohn-Sham density functional theory is formulated to treat both finite and extended systems in a unified manner. This formulation is well-suited for scenarios where straightforward iterative diagonalization becomes challenging, especially when the Aufbau principle is not applicable. We present the theoretical foundation and numerical implementation of the Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) within a localized non-orthogonal basis set. Riemannian Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (RBFGS) method is tentatively implemented. Extensive testing compares the performance of the proposed RCG method with the traditional self-consistent field (SCF) algorithm and shows that it is less efficient. For molecular systems, the RBFGS method requires a computing time comparable to that of SCF calculations. However, for extended systems these methods require much more iterations compared to SCF. Preconditioning can potentially improve its efficiency, especially for metallic systems.</description>

      <title>Solving Crystal Structures by Carrying Out the Calculation of the Single-Atom R1 Method in a Lottery Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As originally designed [Zhang &amp; Donahue (2024), Acta Cryst. A80, 2370248.], after one cycle of calculation, the single-atom R1 (sR1) method required a user to intelligently determine a partial structure to start the next cycle. In this paper, a lottery scheme has been designed to randomly split a parent model into two child models. This allows the calculation to be carried out in care-free manner. By chance, one child model may have higher amounts of "good" atoms than the parent model. Thus, its expansion in the next cycle favors an improved model. These "lucky" results are carried onto the next cycles. while "unlucky" results in which no improvements occur are discarded. Furthermore, unchanged models are carried onto the next cycles in those "unlucky" occasions. On average a child model has the same fraction of "good" atoms as the parent. Only a substantial statistical fluctuation results in appreciable deviation. This lottery scheme works because such fluctuations do happen. Indeed, test applications with the computing power accessibly by the author have demonstrated that the designed scheme can drive an sR1 calculation to or close to reaching a correct structure solution.</description>

      <title>BoostMD: Accelerating molecular sampling by leveraging ML force field features from previous time-steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating atomic-scale processes, such as protein dynamics and catalytic reactions, is crucial for advancements in biology, chemistry, and materials science. Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as powerful tools that achieve near quantum mechanical accuracy, with promising generalization capabilities. However, their practical use is often limited by long inference times compared to classical force fields, especially when running extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations required for many biological applications. In this study, we introduce BoostMD, a surrogate model architecture designed to accelerate MD simulations. BoostMD leverages node features computed at previous time steps to predict energies and forces based on positional changes. This approach reduces the complexity of the learning task, allowing BoostMD to be both smaller and significantly faster than conventional MLFFs. During simulations, the computationally intensive reference MLFF is evaluated only every $N$ steps, while the lightweight BoostMD model handles the intermediate steps at a fraction of the computational cost. Our experiments demonstrate that BoostMD achieves an eight-fold speedup compared to the reference model and generalizes to unseen dipeptides. Furthermore, we find that BoostMD accurately samples the ground-truth Boltzmann distribution when running molecular dynamics. By combining efficient feature reuse with a streamlined architecture, BoostMD offers a robust solution for conducting large-scale, long-timescale molecular simulations, making high-accuracy ML-driven modeling more accessible and practical.</description>

      <title>Dissipation Dilution-Driven Topology Optimization for Maximizing the $Q$ Factor of Nanomechanical Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality factor ($Q$ factor) of nanomechanical resonators is influenced by geometry and stress, a phenomenon called dissipation dilution. Studies have explored maximizing this effect, leading to softly-clamped resonator designs. This paper proposes a topology optimization methodology to design two-dimensional nanomechanical resonators with high $Q$ factors by maximizing dissipation dilution. A formulation based on the ratio of geometrically nonlinear to linear modal stiffnesses of a prestressed finite element model is used, with its corresponding adjoint sensitivity analysis formulation. Systematic design in square domains yields geometries with comparable $Q$ factors to literature. We analyze the trade-offs between resonance frequency and quality factor, and how these are reflected in the geometry of resonators. We further apply the methodology to optimize a resonator on a full hexagonal domain. By using the entire mesh -- i.e., without assuming any symmetries -- we find that the optimizer converges to a two-axis symmetric design comprised of four tethers.</description>

      <title>Predicting Accurate X-ray Absorption Spectra for CN$^+$, CN$^\bullet$, and CN$^-$: Insights from First-Principles Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is an essential tool in X-ray astronomy, enabling detailed studies of celestial objects and their physical and chemical properties. However, comprehensive mapping of high-resolution X-ray spectra for even simple interstellar and circumstellar molecules is still lacking. In this study, we conducted systematic quantum chemical simulations to predict the C1s X-ray absorption spectra of CN$^+$, CN, and CN$^-$. Our findings provide valuable references for both X-ray astronomy and laboratory studies. We assigned the first electronic peak of CN$^+$ and CN to C1s $\rightarrow \sigma^*$ transitions, while the peak for CN$^-$ corresponds to a C1s $\rightarrow \pi^*$ transition. We further calculated the vibronic fine structures for these transitions using the quantum wavepacket method based on multiconfigurational-level, anharmonic potential energy curves, revealing distinct energy positions for the 0-0 absorptions at 280.7 eV, 279.6 eV, and 285.8 eV. Each vibronic profile features a prominent 0-0 peak, showing overall similarity but differing intensity ratios of the 0-0 and 0-1 peaks. Notably, introducing a C1s core hole leads to shortened C-N bond lengths and increased vibrational frequencies across all species. These findings enhance our understanding of the electronic structures and X-ray spectra of carbon-nitrogen species, emphasizing the influence of charge state on X-ray absorptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for accelerating the search of molecule's adsorption site based on global optimization of surface adsorbate geometries. Our approach uses a machine-learning interatomic potential (moment tensor potential) to approximate the potential energy surface and an active learning algorithm for the automatic construction of an optimal training dataset. To validate our methodology, we compare the results across various well-known catalytic systems with surfaces of different crystallographic orientations and adsorbate geometries, including CO/Pd(111), NO/Pd(100), NH$_3$/Cu(100), C$_6$H$_6$/Ag(111), and CH$_2$CO/Rh(211). In the all cases, we observed an agreement of our results with the literature.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds Parameter Estimation in Pulsar Timing Arrays with Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are essential tools for detecting the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), but their analysis faces significant computational challenges. Traditional methods like Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) struggle with high-dimensional parameter spaces where noise parameters often dominate, while existing deep learning approaches fail to model the Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation or are validated only on synthetic datasets. We propose a flow-matching-based continuous normalizing flow (CNF) for efficient and accurate PTA parameter estimation. By focusing on the 10 most contributive pulsars from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, our method achieves posteriors consistent with MCMC, with a Jensen-Shannon divergence below \(10^{-2}\) nat, while reducing sampling time from 50 hours to 4 minutes. Powered by a versatile embedding network and a reweighting loss function, our approach prioritizes the SGWB parameters and scales effectively for future datasets. It enables precise reconstruction of SGWB and opens new avenues for exploring vast observational data and uncovering potential new physics, offering a transformative tool for advancing gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>VQE for Ising Model \&amp; A Comparative Analysis of Classical and Quantum Optimization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we delved into several optimization methods, both classical and quantum, and analyzed the quantum advantage that each of these methods offered, and then we proposed a new combinatorial optimization scheme, deemed as QN-SPSA+PSR which combines calculating approximately Fubini-study metric (QN-SPSA) and the exact evaluation of gradient by Parameter-Shift Rule (PSR). The QN-SPSA+PSR method integrates the QN-SPSA computational efficiency with the precise gradient computation of the PSR, improving both stability and convergence speed while maintaining low computational consumption. Our results provide a new potential quantum supremacy in the VQE's optimization subroutine and enhance viable paths toward efficient quantum simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Computing (NISQ) devices. Additionally, we also conducted a detailed study of quantum circuit ansatz structures in order to find the one that would work best with the Ising model and NISQ, in which we utilized the symmetry of the investigated model.</description>

      <title>Role of phonon coupling in driving photo-excited Mott insulators towards a transient superconducting steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding light-induced hidden orders is relevant for nonequilibrium materials control and future ultrafast technologies. Hidden superconducting order, in particular, has been a focus of recent experimental and theoretical efforts. In this study, we investigate the stability of light-induced $\eta$ pairing. Using a memory truncated implementation of nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) and entropy cooling techniques, we study the long-time dynamics of the photoinduced superconducting state. In the presence of coupling to a cold phonon bath, the photodoped system reaches a quasi-steady state, which can be sustained over a long period of time in large-gap Mott insulators. We show that this long-lived prethermalized state is well described by the nonequilibrium steady state implementation of DMFT.</description>

      <title>Are Two Hidden Layers Still Enough for the Physics-Informed Neural Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article discusses the development of various methods and techniques for initializing and training neural networks with a single hidden layer, as well as training a separable physics-informed neural network consisting of neural networks with a single hidden layer to solve physical problems described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). A method for strictly deterministic initialization of a neural network with one hidden layer for solving physical problems described by an ODE is proposed. Modifications to existing methods for weighting the loss function are given, as well as new methods developed for training strictly deterministic-initialized neural networks to solve ODEs (detaching, additional weighting based on the second derivative, predicted solution-based weighting, relative residuals). An algorithm for physics-informed data-driven initialization of a neural network with one hidden layer is proposed. A neural network with pronounced generalizing properties is presented, whose generalizing abilities of which can be precisely controlled by adjusting network parameters. A metric for measuring the generalization of such neural network has been introduced. A gradient-free neuron-by-neuron fitting method has been developed for adjusting the parameters of a single-hidden-layer neural network, which does not require the use of an optimizer or solver for its implementation. The proposed methods have been extended to 2D problems using the separable physics-informed neural networks approach. Numerous experiments have been carried out to develop the above methods and approaches. Experiments on physical problems, such as solving various ODEs and PDEs, have demonstrated that these methods for initializing and training neural networks with one or two hidden layers (SPINN) achieve competitive accuracy and, in some cases, state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Identifying Split Vacancies with Foundation Models and Electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point defects are ubiquitous in solid-state compounds, dictating many functional properties such as conductivity, catalytic activity and carrier recombination. Over the past decade, the prevalence of metastable defect geometries and their importance to relevant properties has been increasingly recognised. A particularly striking example of this is split vacancies, where an isolated atomic vacancy transforms to a stoichiometry-conserving complex of two vacancies and an interstitial ($V_X \rightarrow [V_X + X_i + V_X]$), which can be accompanied by a dramatic lowering of the defect energy and change in behaviour. Such species are particularly challenging to identify from computation, due to the `non-local' nature of this reconstruction. Here, I present an approach for efficiently identifying such species in solid-state compounds, through tiered screening which combines geometric analysis, electrostatic energies and foundation machine learning (ML) models. This approach allows the screening of all compounds in the Materials Project database (including all entries in the ICSD, along with several thousand predicted metastable materials), identifying thousands of split vacancy configurations, hitherto unknown. This study highlights both the potential utility of machine-learning potentials for defect investigations, with important caveats, and the importance of global optimisation approaches for correctly identifying stable defect geometries.</description>

      <title>Transit-Length Distribution for Particle Transport in Binary Markovian Mixed Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correspondence between the telegraph random process and transport within a binary stochastic Markovian mixture is established. This equivalence is used to derive the distribution function for the transit length, defined as the distance a particle moving along a straight-line trajectory travels through a specific material zone within the random mixture. A numerically robust asymptotic form of this distribution is obtained for highly mixed materials and the convergence to the atomic-mix limit is shown. The validity of the distribution is verified using a Monte Carlo simulation of the transport process. The distribution is applied to particle transport in slab geometry containing porous media for two cases: the transmission of light and the stopping of charged particles. For both of these applications, analytical forms using the approximate asymptotic model for the transmission probability of beam sources are obtained and illustrative numerical results are provided. These results show that in cases of highly mixed materials, the asymptotic forms are more accurate than the atomic-mix limit.</description>

Abstract: This paper reviews the standard algorithm for converting spacecraft state vectors to Keplerian orbital elements with a focus on its computer implementation. It analyzes the shortcomings of the scheme as described in the literature, and proposes changes to the implementation to address orbits of arbitrary eccentricity and inclination in a simple and robust way. It presents two coding strategies that simplify the program structure while improving the accuracy and speed of the transformation on modern computer architectures. Comprehensive numerical benchmarks demonstrate accuracy improvements by two orders of magnitude, together with a 40% reduction of computational cost relative to the standard implementation.</description>

      <title>Learning tensor networks with tensor cross interpolation: new algorithms and libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm is a rank-revealing algorithm for decomposing low-rank, high-dimensional tensors into tensor trains/matrix product states (MPS). TCI learns a compact MPS representation of the entire object from a tiny training data set. Once obtained, the large existing MPS toolbox provides exponentially fast algorithms for performing a large set of operations. We discuss several improvements and variants of TCI. In particular, we show that replacing the cross interpolation by the partially rank-revealing LU decomposition yields a more stable and more flexible algorithm than the original algorithm. We also present two open source libraries, xfac in Python/C++ and TensorCrossInterpolation.jl in Julia, that implement these improved algorithms, and illustrate them on several applications. These include sign-problem-free integration in large dimension, the superhigh-resolution quantics representation of functions, the solution of partial differential equations, the superfast Fourier transform, the computation of partition functions, and the construction of matrix product operators.</description>

      <title>The Quantum and Stochastic Toolbox: xSPDE4.2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the fourth major release of the xSPDE toolbox, which solves stochastic partial and ordinary differential equations, with applications in biology, chemistry, engineering, medicine, physics and quantum technologies. It computes statistical averages, including time-step and sampling error estimation. xSPDE can provide higher order convergence, Fourier spectra and probability densities. The toolbox has graphical output and $\chi^{2}$ statistics, as well as weighted, projected, or forward-backward equations. It can generate input-output quantum spectra. The equations can have independent periodic, Dirichlet, and Neumann or Robin boundary conditions in any dimension, for any vector component, and at either end of any interval. xSPDE has functions that can numerically solve both ordinary and partial differential stochastic equations of any type, obtaining correlations, probabilities and averages. The toolbox has a core treating stochastic differential equations, with averages, probability distributions and full error estimates. There are stochastic extensions treating applications to partial differential equations, projected equations, quantum stochastic equations, master equations and quantum phase-space simulations including Gaussian boson sampling experiments.</description>

      <title>A generative machine learning surrogate model of plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence methods are employed for the first time to construct a surrogate model for plasma turbulence that enables long time transport simulations. The proposed GAIT (Generative Artificial Intelligence Turbulence) model is based on the coupling of a convolutional variational auto-encoder, that encodes precomputed turbulence data into a reduced latent space, and a recurrent neural network and decoder that generates new turbulence states 400 times faster than the direct numerical integration. The model is applied to the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) plasma turbulence model, that is closely related to the quasigeostrophic model used in geophysical fluid dynamics. Very good agreement is found between the GAIT and the HW models in the spatio-temporal Fourier and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition spectra, and the flow topology characterized by the Okubo-Weiss decomposition. The GAIT model also reproduces Lagrangian transport including the probability distribution function of particle displacements and the effective turbulent diffusivity.</description>

      <title>Boundary layer stability and transition analysis using the nonlinear One-Way Navier-Stokes approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the One-Way Navier Stokes (OWNS) approach to support nonlinear interactions between waves of different frequencies, which will enable nonlinear analysis of instability and transition. In OWNS, the linearized Navier-Stokes equations are parabolized and solved in the frequency domain as a spatial initial-value (marching) problem. OWNS yields a reduced computational cost compared to global solvers, while also conferring numerous advantages over the parabolized stability equations (PSE), despite its higher computational cost relative to PSE, that we seek to extend to nonlinear analysis. We validate the nonlinear OWNS (NOWNS) method by examining nonlinear evolution of two- and three-dimensional disturbances in a low-speed Blasius boundary layer compared to nonlinear PSE (NPSE) and direct numerical simulation (DNS) results from the literature. We demonstrate that NOWNS can be used to simulate flows involve blowing/suction strips, is more robust to numerical noise, and converges for stronger nonlinearities, as compared to NPSE.</description>

      <title>CrystalFlow: A Flow-Based Generative Model for Crystalline Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based generative models have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex data distributions and generating high-fidelity samples, offering a transformative approach to efficiently explore the configuration space of crystalline materials. In this work, we present CrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model specifically developed for the generation of crystalline materials. CrystalFlow constructs Continuous Normalizing Flows to model lattice parameters, atomic coordinates, and/or atom types, which are trained using Conditional Flow Matching techniques. Through an appropriate choice of data representation and the integration of a graph-based equivariant neural network, the model effectively captures the fundamental symmetries of crystalline materials, which ensures data-efficient learning and enables high-quality sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that CrystalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard generation benchmarks, and exhibits versatile conditional generation capabilities including producing structures optimized for specific external pressures or desired material properties. These features highlight the model's potential to address realistic crystal structure prediction challenges, offering a robust and efficient framework for advancing data-driven research in condensed matter physics and material science.</description>

      <title>Neural Canonical Transformations for Quantum Anharmonic Solids of Lithium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lithium is a typical quantum solid, characterized by cubic structures at ambient pressure. As the pressure increases, it forms more complex structures and undergoes a metal-to-semiconductor transformation, complicating theoretical and experimental analyses. We employ the neural canonical transformation approach, an \textit{ab initio} variational method based on probabilistic generative models, to investigate the quantum anharmonic effects in lithium solids at finite temperatures. This approach combines a normalizing flow for phonon excited-state wave functions with a probabilistic model for the occupation of energy levels, optimized jointly to minimize the free energy. Our results indicate that quantum anharmonicity lowers the \textit{bcc}-\textit{fcc} transition temperature compared to classical molecular dynamics predictions. At high pressures, the predicted fractional coordinates of lithium atoms in the \textit{cI16} structure show good quantitative agreement with experimental observations. Finally, contrary to previous beliefs, we find that the poor metallic \textit{oC88} structure is stabilized by the potential energy surface obtained via high-accuracy electronic structure calculations, rather than thermal or quantum nuclear effects.</description>
