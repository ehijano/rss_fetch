      <title>One rule does not fit all: deviations from universality in human mobility modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate modeling of individual movement in cities has significant implications for policy decisions across various sectors. Existing research emphasizes the universality of human mobility, positing that simple models can capture population-level movements. However, population-level accuracy does not guarantee consistent performance across all individuals. By overlooking individual differences, universality laws may accurately describe certain groups while less precisely representing others, resulting in aggregate accuracy from a balance of discrepancies. Using large-scale mobility data, we assess individual-level accuracy of a universal model, the Exploration and Preferential Return (EPR), by examining deviations from expected behavior in two scaling laws - one related to exploration and the other to return patterns. Our findings reveal that, while the model can describe population-wide movement patterns, it displays widespread deviations linked to individuals' behavioral traits, socioeconomic status, and lifestyles, contradicting model assumptions like non-bursty exploration and preferential return. Specifically, individuals poorly represented by the EPR model tend to visit routine locations in sequences, exploring rarely but in a bursty manner when they do. Among socioeconomic factors, income most strongly correlates with significant deviations. Consequently, spatial inhomogeneity emerges in model accuracy, with lower performance concentrated in urbanized, densely populated areas, underscoring policy implications. Our results show that emphasizing population-wide models can propagate socioeconomic inequalities by poorly representing vulnerable population sectors.</description>

      <title>Geographic Space as Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The communications and interrelations between different locations on the Earth's surface have far-reaching implications for both social and natural systems. Effective spatial analytics ideally require a spatial representation, where geographic principles are succinctly expressed within a defined metric space. However, common spatial representations, including map-based or network-based approaches, fall short by incompletely or inaccurately defining this metric space. Here we show, by introducing an inverse friction factor that captures the spatial constraints in spatial networks, that a homogeneous, low-dimensional spatial representation - termed the Geographic Manifold - can be achieved. We illustrate the effectiveness of the Geographic Manifold in two classic scenarios of spatial analytics - location choice and propagation, where the otherwise complicated analyses are reduced to straightforward regular partitioning and concentric diffusing, respectively on the manifold with a high degree of accuracy. We further empirically explain and formally prove the general existence of the Geographic Manifold, which is grounded in the intrinsic Euclidean low-dimensional statistical physics properties of geographic phenomena. This work represents a step towards formalizing Tobler's famous First Law of Geography from a geometric approach, where a regularized geospace thereby yielded is expected to contribute in learning abstract spatial structure representations for understanding and optimization purposes.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Ridership Weighting on Targeting and Recovery Strategies for Urban Rail Rapid Transit Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resilience of urban rapid transit systems (URTs) to a rapidly evolving threat space is of much concern. Extreme rainfall events are both intensifying and growing more frequent under continuing climate change, exposing transit systems to flooding, while cyber threats and emerging technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles are exposing such systems to targeted disruptions. An imperative has emerged to model how networked infrastructure systems fail and devise strategies to efficiently recover from disruptions. Passenger flow approaches can quantify more dimensions of resilience than network science-based approaches, but the former typically requires granular data from automatic fare collection and suffers from large runtime complexities. Some attempts have been made to include accessible low-resolution ridership data in topological frameworks. However, there is yet to be a systematic investigation of the effects of incorporating low-dimensional, coarsely-averaged ridership volume into topological network science methodologies. We simulate targeted attack and recovery sequences using station-level ridership, four centrality measures, and weighted combinations thereof. Resilience is quantified using two topological measures of performance: the node count of a network's giant connected component (GCC), and a new measure termed the "highest ridership connected component" (HRCC). Three transit systems are used as case studies: the subways of Boston, New York, and Osaka. Results show that centrality-based strategies are most effective when measuring performance via GCC, while centrality-ridership hybrid strategies perform strongest by HRCC. We show that the most effective strategies vary by network characteristics and the mission goals of emergency managers, highlighting the need to plan for strategic adversaries and rapid recovery according to each city's unique needs.</description>

      <title>Training on inclusivity and cultural diversity in the ALICE Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large experimental Collaborations at the LHC (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb) bring together over 13,000 people from hundreds of institutes over the world. There are many (working) cultures inside these international Collaborations. It is important to acknowledge that cultural differences exist and manifest in our workspaces in various ways such as communication style, attitude and expectations, and ways to provide feedback on work, just to name a few examples.
  Various studies over the world have raised concerns on mental wellbeing of academics, especially PhD students. A survey on mental wellbeing was conducted among all major LHC Collaborations in 2023. The survey attracted a total of 404 replies ranging from students to experienced researchers. Although the number of responses is not small, it corresponds to only a few per cent of the whole LHC community, and hence we cannot be sure of how representative the sample is. However, this limited sample contained worrisome findings on wellbeing among LHC researchers.
  While moderate stress can enhance working performance and help in keeping deadlines, stress should remain in manageable level and one should take care of adequate recovery. However, there are some stress factors related to environment and ways we work that cause unnecessary load. In these proceedings, we will raise a few results on the LHC mental wellbeing survey and discuss trainings on inclusivity and cultural diversity in ALICE. These trainings aim to create a welcoming and positive work environment by strengthening the sense of community and commitment to the Collaboration. These, in turn, can have a positive impact both on wellbeing and productivity.</description>

      <title>Social contagion with emotional group interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual decisions and behaviors are shaped not only by direct interactions with others but also by the collective emotional dynamics within groups. In this work, we introduce the signed simplicial contagion model, integrating both pairwise and emotional group interactions to investigate contagion dynamics in signed networks. Through mean field analysis and numerical simulations, we show that emotional group interactions can induce discontinuous phase transitions, bistable behavior, and hysteresis loops. However, as the proportion of negative edges q increases, the influence of group interactions weakens under a given transmission strength, driving a shift from discontinuous to continuous phase transitions. Our findings reveal that pairwise and group interactions respond differently to changes in q: group interactions display nonlinear sensitivity, while pairwise interactions exhibit a more gradual, linear response. This divergence shifts the dominant mechanisms of contagion, depending on the levels of trust and distrust in the network, providing deeper insights into how emotional relational shape the spread of contagion in social systems.</description>

      <title>Projections of Earth's Technosphere: Luminosity and Mass as Limits to Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth remains the only known example of a planet with technology, and future projections of Earth's trajectory provide a basis and motivation for approaching the search for extraterrestrial technospheres. Conventional approaches toward projecting Earth's technosphere include applications of the Kardashev scale, which suggest the possibility that energy-intensive civilizations may expand to harness the entire energy output available to their planet, host star, or even the entire galaxy. In this study, we argue that the Kardashev scale is better understood as a "luminosity limit" that describes the maximum capacity for a civilization to harvest luminous stellar energy across a given spatial domain, and we note that thermodynamic efficiency will always keep a luminosity-limited technosphere from actually reaching this theoretical limit. We suggest the possibility that an advanced technosphere might evolve beyond this luminosity limit to draw its energy directly from harvesting stellar mass, and we also discuss possible trajectories that could exist between Earth today and such hypothetical "stellivores." We develop a framework to describe trajectories for long-lived technospheres that optimize their growth strategies between exploration and exploitation, unlike Earth today. We note that analyses of compact accreting stars could provide ways to test the stellivore hypothesis, and we more broadly suggest an expansion of technosignature search strategies beyond those that reside exactly at the luminosity limit.</description>
