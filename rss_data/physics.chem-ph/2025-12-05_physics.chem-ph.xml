      <title>Quantum Chemistry Simulation of Dibenzothiophene for Asphalt Aging Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the execution and analysis of a comprehensive quantum chemistry pipeline for gathering actionable insight into asphalt aging mechanisms through the study of dibenzothiophene (DBT), a key sulfur-containing compound in asphalt binders. Using advanced quantum algorithms, specifically Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with k-UpCCGSD and ADAPT-VQE ansatze, we achieved ground state energy calculations with accuracies reaching -864.69 Ha. Our implementation demonstrates quantum advantages in handling strongly correlated electron systems while providing actionable insights for designing oxidation-resistant asphalt formulations. The work also establishes a scalable framework for quantum-enhanced materials design.</description>

      <title>Retrieving missing data in electron diffraction of gas-phase molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an iterative algorithm to retrieve accurate real space information from gas electron diffraction measurements with missing data at low momentum transfer. The algorithm is similar to phase retrieval algorithms which transform signals back and forth between the signal domain and the Fourier domain and apply constraints to retrieve the missing phase. The difference in our case is that the goal is not retrieval of the phase of the diffraction signal but the missing data at low momentum transfer, which is necessary for generating the real-space pair distribution function. The missing data is a common problem in static and ultrafast gas phase electron diffraction experiments due to experimental constraints. We demonstrated successful restoration of the missing data in simulated data and in experimentally measured diffraction signals of static and photo-dissociated trifluoroiodomethane and iodobenzene molecules.</description>

      <title>Fate of amine-based selenenyl sulfides during interaction with glutathione reductase: a molecular dynamics perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the search for small organoselenium-based mimics of the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme, it has been observed that selenenyl sulfides (RSeSG) derived from amine-based GPx mimics have the potential to be reduced at the catalytic site of glutathione reductase (GR), thereby enhancing the catalytic efficiency of these mimics in biological systems. However, molecular insights into these interactions are lacking due to the absence of force field parameters for Se-S containing compounds. In this study, we present force field parameters for selenenyl sulfides with a phenyl selenide backbone developed using the General Amber Force Field (GAFF). Employing these parameters, a 200 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of RSeSG was performed. The results indicate that both the amino nitrogen and its substituent significantly influence the interaction of RSeSG at the catalytic site of GR.</description>

      <title>Teaching a Transformer to Think Like a Chemist: Predicting Nanocluster Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically precise metal nanoclusters bridge the molecular and bulk regimes, but designing bimetallic motifs with targeted stability and reactivity remains challenging. Here we combine density functional theory (DFT) and physics-grounded predictive artificial intelligence to map the configurational landscape of 13-atom icosahedral nanoclusters X$_{12}$TM, with hosts X = (Ti, Zr, Hf), and Fe and a single transition--metal dopant spanning the 3$d$-5$d$ series. Spin-polarized DFT calculations on 240 bimetallic clusters reveal systematic trends in binding and formation energies, distortion penalties, effective coordination number, d-band centre, and HOMO-LUMO gap that govern the competition between core-shell (in) and surface-segregated (out) arrangements. We then pretrain a transformer architecture on a curated set of 2968 unary clusters from the Quantum Cluster Database and fine-tune it on bimetallic data to predict formation energies and in/out preference, achieving mean absolute errors of about $0.6-0.7$eV and calibrated uncertainty intervals. The resulting model rapidly adapts to an unseen Fe-host domain with only a handful of labelled examples. At the same time, attention patterns and Shapley attributions highlight size mismatch, $d$-electron count, and coordination environment as key descriptors. All data, code, and workflows follow FAIR/TRUE principles, enabling reproducible, interpretable screening of unexplored nanocluster chemistries for catalysis and energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Nano-capattery: Taming electron traffic for a 367% leap in biohydrogen surge through suppressing competing pathways in photo photo-fermentative system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electron flux diverts electrons from optimal hydrogen production pathways to competitive pathways, which overall reduces the efficiency of the photo fermentation hydrogen production (PFHP) system. For tackling electron flux and metabolic pathway regulation, a hybrid material (nano-capattery (NC)) was developed based on cobalt-iron-nitrogen doped biochar (Co-Fe-NBC). The NC possessed both the capacitor property (287.91 F/g) and battery-like charge storage 38.3 mC/g with the highest energy density of 159.95 mWh/g. These properties existed due to its Fe2+/Fe3+ and Co2+/Co3+ redox cycle ability, a highly porous surface (291.81 m2/g BET surface area) caused by the defects (AD/AG 3.13) and abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) observed through electro paramagnetic resonance. During PFHP, there is an 85% reduction in propionic acid, a 65.3% record electron management efficiency, an improved 1.34 NAD+/NADH ratio, along with a 87% increase in dehydrogenase activity, confirming the superior role of NC in efficient regulation of the metabolic pathway and electron flux management. These exceptional properties of biochar-based NC raised the cumulative hydrogen production from 151.03 mL (control) to 589.54 mL, which was an enormous increase of 367%.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Defect Dynamics in Silicon Carbide Using Symmetry-Adapted Collective Variables and Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) divacancies are attractive candidates for spin defect qubits possessing long coherence times and optical addressability. The high activation barriers associated with SiC defect formation and motion pose challenges for their study by first-principles molecular dynamics. In this work, we develop and deploy machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to accelerate defect dynamics simulations while retaining ab initio accuracy. We employ an active learning strategy comprising symmetry-adapted collective variable discovery and enhanced sampling to compile configurationally diverse training data, calculation of energies and forces using density functional theory (DFT), and training of an E(3)-equivariant MLIP based on the Allegro model. The trained MLIP reproduces DFT-level accuracy in defect transition activation free energy barriers, enables the efficient and stable simulation of multi-defect 216-atom supercells, and permits an analysis of the temperature dependence of defect thermodynamic stability and formation/annihilation kinetics to propose an optimal annealing temperature to maximally stabilize VV divacancies.</description>

      <title>More is different: How chemical complexity influences stability in high entropy oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tailoring the chemical composition of a high entropy oxide (HEO) is a powerful approach to enhancing desirable material properties. However, the targeted synthesis of HEO materials is often hindered by competing stabilizing and destabilizing factors, which are difficult to predict. This work examines the effects of increased configurational entropy on the phase formation and stability of four notable complex oxide families: perovskite ($AB$O$_3$}), pyrochlore ($A_2B_2$O$_7$), Ruddlesden-Popper ($A_2B$O$_4$), and zirconium tungstate ($AB_2$O$_8$). Each of these structures has a tetravalent cation site, which we attempt to substitute with an entropic mixture of four cations, benchmarked by the parallel synthesis of a non-disordered reference compound. While all four target high entropy materials can be expected to form based on ionic radii criteria, only the high entropy perovskite Ba(Ti,Zr,Hf,Sn)O$_3$ is successfully synthesized. In the case of the pyrochlore, an entropy-stabilized defect fluorite is formed instead, while the Ruddlesden-Popper phase co-exists with multiple competing phases. For the tungstate, an unexpected deep eutectic point between the precursors results in melting that precedes the formation of a high entropy phase. Our case studies therefore illustrate that the stability of HEOs cannot be straightforwardly predicted based on ionic radii, lattice geometry, and charge-balancing considerations alone due to the underlying complexity of the interactions between the many chemical constituents.</description>

      <title>Collective adsorption of pheromones at the water-air interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the phase behaviour of pheromones and other messaging molecules remains a significant and largely unexplored challenge, even though it plays a central role in chemical communication. Here, we present all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the behavior of bombykol, a model insect pheromone, adsorbed at the water-air interface. This system serves as a proxy for studying the amphiphilic nature of pheromones and their interactions with aerosol particles in the atmosphere. Our simulations reveal the molecular organization of the bombykol monolayer and its adsorption isotherm. A soft-sticky particle equation of state accurately describes the monolayer's behavior. The analysis uncovers a two-dimensional liquid-gas phase transition within the monolayer. Collective adsorption stabilises the molecules at the interface and the calculated free energy gain is approximately $2\:k_\mathrm{B}T$. This value increases under lower estimates of the condensing surface concentration, thereby enhancing pheromone adsorption onto aerosols. Overall, our findings hold broad relevance for molecular interface science, atmospheric chemistry, and organismal chemical communication, particularly in highlighting the critical role of phase transition phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the development of a new instrument for cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy of the fundamental rovibrational transitions of molecules in the long-wave mid-infrared (LWIR) region from 6500 to 10000 nm. Our setup combines a LWIR frequency comb, a high-finesse optical enhancement cavity, a cryogenic buffer gas cooling cell, and a Fourier transform interferometer to obtain broadband, high-resolution, and high-sensitivity molecular absorption spectra. Here, we showcase the capabilities of this setup by presenting the gas-phase LWIR spectra of the $\nu_6$ band of ethane and the $\nu_{10}$ band of ethanol near 7200 nm under both room temperature and cryogenic conditions.</description>

      <title>Supramolecular approach-based intermolecular interaction energy calculations using quantum phase estimation algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate computation of non-covalent, intermolecular interaction energies is important to understand various chemical phenomena, and quantum computers are anticipated to accelerate it. Although the state-of-the-art quantum computers are still noisy and intermediate-scale ones, development of theoretical frameworks those are expected to work on a fault-tolerant quantum computer is an urgent issue. In this work, we explore resource-efficient implementation of the quantum phase estimation-based complete active space configuration interaction (QPE-CASCI) calculations, with the aid of the second-order M{\o}ller--Plesset perturbation theory (MP2)-based active space selection with Boys localized orbitals. We performed numerical simulations of QPE for the supramolecular approach-based intermolecular interaction energy calculations of the hydrogen-bonded water dimer, using 6 system and 6 ancilla qubits. With the aid of algorithmic error mitigation, the QPE-CASCI simulations achieved interaction energy predictions with an error of 0.02 kcal mol$^{-1}$ relative to the CASCI result, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology. Preliminary results on quantum circuit compression for QPE are also presented to reduce the number of two-qubit gates and depth.</description>

      <title>A quantitative Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and the unexpected regularity of density functional theory in one spatial dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the (Kohn-Sham) density-to-potential map in the case of spinless fermions in one spatial dimension, whose existence has been rigorously established by the first author in [arXiv:2504.05501 (2025)]. Here, we focus on the regularity of this map as a function of the density and the coupling constant in front of the interaction term. More precisely, we first prove a quantitative version of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, thereby showing that this map is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the natural Sobolev norms in the space of densities and potentials. In particular, this implies that the inverse (Kohn-Sham) problem is not only well-posed but also Lipschitz stable. Using this result, we then show that the density-to-potential map is in fact real analytic with respect to both the density and the interaction strength. As a consequence, we obtain a holomorphic extension of the universal constrained-search functional to a suitable subset of complex-valued densities. This partially extends the DFT framework to non-self-adjoint Schr\"odinger operators. As further applications of these results, we also establish the existence of an exchange-only part of the exchange-correlation potential, and justify the G\"orling-Levy perturbation expansion for the correlation energy.</description>

      <title>Convergence of sample-based quantum diagonalization on a variable-length cuprate chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) is an algorithm for hybrid quantum-classical molecular simulation that has been of broad interest for application with noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, SQD does not always converge on a practical timescale. Here, we explore scaling of the algorithm for a variable-length molecule made up of 2 to 6 copper oxide plaquettes with a minimal molecular orbital basis. The results demonstrate that enabling all-to-all connectivity, instituting a higher expansion order for the SQD algorithm, and adopting a non-Hartree-Fock molecular orbital basis can all play significant roles in overcoming sampling bottlenecks, though with tradeoffs that need to be weighed against the capabilities of quantum and classical hardware. Additionally, we find that noise on a real quantum computer, the Quantinuum H2 trapped ion device, can improve energy convergence beyond expectations based on noise-free statevector simulations.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Role of pH and Counterions in the Intrinsic Fluorescence of Solid-State L-Lysine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is currently a growing interest in understanding the origins of intrinsic fluorescence as a way to design non-invasive probes for biophysical processes. In this regard, understanding how pH influences fluorescence in non-aromatic biomolecular assemblies is key to controlling their optical properties in realistic cellular conditions. Here, we combine experiments and theory to investigate the pH-dependent emission of solid-state L-Lysine (Lys). Lys aggregates prepared at different pH values using HCl and H$_2$SO$_4$ exhibit protonation- and counterion-dependent morphology and fluorescence, as shown by microscopy and steady-state measurements. We find an enhancement in the fluorescence moving from acidic to basic conditions. To uncover the molecular origin of these trends, we performed non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations on three Lys crystal models representing distinct protonation states. Our simulations indicate that enhanced protonation under acidic conditions facilitates non-radiative decay via proton transfer, whereas basic conditions favor radiative decay. Our combined experimental-theoretical work highlights pH and counterion identity as key factors tuning fluorescence in Lys assemblies, offering insights for designing pH responsive optical materials based on non-aromatic amino acids.</description>

      <title>VEDA: 3D Molecular Generation via Variance-Exploding Diffusion with Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for 3D molecular generation, but face a fundamental trade-off between sampling efficiency and conformational accuracy. While flow-based models are fast, they often produce geometrically inaccurate structures, as they have difficulty capturing the multimodal distributions of molecular conformations. In contrast, denoising diffusion models are more accurate but suffer from slow sampling, a limitation attributed to sub-optimal integration between diffusion dynamics and SE(3)-equivariant architectures. To address this, we propose VEDA, a unified SE(3)-equivariant framework that combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing to efficiently generate conformationally accurate 3D molecular structures. Specifically, our key technical contributions include: (1) a VE schedule that enables noise injection functionally analogous to simulated annealing, improving 3D accuracy and reducing relaxation energy; (2) a novel preconditioning scheme that reconciles the coordinate-predicting nature of SE(3)-equivariant networks with a residual-based diffusion objective, and (3) a new arcsin-based scheduler that concentrates sampling in critical intervals of the logarithmic signal-to-noise ratio. On the QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets, VEDA matches the sampling efficiency of flow-based models, achieving state-of-the-art valency stability and validity with only 100 sampling steps. More importantly, VEDA's generated structures are remarkably stable, as measured by their relaxation energy during GFN2-xTB optimization. The median energy change is only 1.72 kcal/mol, significantly lower than the 32.3 kcal/mol from its architectural baseline, SemlaFlow. Our framework demonstrates that principled integration of VE diffusion with SE(3)-equivariant architectures can achieve both high chemical accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

Abstract: A first-principles coupled electron-nuclear dynamics simulation based on real-time, time-dependent density functional theory and Ehrenfest dynamics quantitatively repro-duces bimodal translational energy loss and angular distributions observed in experiment for hydrogen atom scattering from Ge(111)-c(2*8). The theory elucidates a site-selective mechanism of electronically nonadiabatic energy transfer associated with the formation of different Ge-H bonds. When a hydrogen atom approaches a Ge rest-atom, it is strongly accelerated toward the potential minimum forming a transient Ge-H bond and then re-flected by the repulsive wall. This transient bond formation triggers an ultrafast electron transfer event from the rest-atom to an adjacent Ge-adatom, involving several crossings between valence and conduction bands of the substrate. Electronic equilibration is impos-sible within such a short time (Born-Oppenheimer failure) allowing the H-atom kinetic energy to be converted to inter-band electronic excitation of the substrate. H-atom colli-sions at other Ge atoms also form a transient bond but exhibit no electronic excitation, resulting in distinctly less efficient energy loss in scattered H-atoms. The nucle-ar-to-electronic energy transfer observed in this system reflects the electronic dynamics of covalent bond formation at a semiconductor surface, a mechanism that is quite distinct from previously identified nonadiabatic energy transfer mechanisms at metal surfaces mediated by electronic friction or transient negative ions.</description>
