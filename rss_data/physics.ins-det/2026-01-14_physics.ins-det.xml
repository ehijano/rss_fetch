      <title>Cyclotron Radiation Signal Characterization in Resonant Cavities for the Project 8 Neutrino Mass Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07848v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many experimental methods in physics require understanding radiation from single particles into non-trivial electromagnetic mode structures. Such characterization is critical for Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES), an advancing new measurement technique that has the potential to greatly benefit fundamental physics measurements. In CRES, charged particles emit cyclotron radiation at frequencies that provide their energy measurement. As a notable example, the Project 8 experiment aims to kinematically infer the neutrino mass by measuring the energies of electrons emitted in tritium beta decay using CRES. In near-term realizations of Project 8, resonant cylindrical cavities will be used for CRES readout, in a configuration with a magnetic field oriented along the symmetry axis, and electrons following helical cyclotron trajectories confined to the cavity interior. The physics of electromagnetic radiation in these environments is complicated, since it involves both the motion of the emitting particle and the mode structure imposed by the cavity. In this work, we derive and validate an analytic model for how an oscillating, trapped electron radiates into cavity modes, and the power and frequency content of the radiation that can be read out from these events. These results can be used to guide the design of cavities for future CRES and other experiments.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Surrogate for Detector Simulation and Design with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a conditional denoising-diffusion surrogate for electromagnetic calorimeter showers that is trained to generate high-fidelity energy-deposition maps conditioned on key detector and beam parameters. The model employs efficient inference using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model sampling and is pre-trained on GEANT4 simulations before being adapted to a new calorimeter geometry through Low-Rank Adaptation, requiring only a small post-training dataset. We evaluate physically meaningful observables, including total deposited energy, energy-weighted radius, and shower dispersion, obtaining relative root mean square error values below 2% for representative high-energy cases. This is in line with state-of-the-art calorimeter surrogates which report comparable fidelity on high-level observables. Furthermore, we compare gradients of a reconstruction-based utility function with respect to design parameters between the surrogate and finite-difference references. The diffusion surrogate reproduces the qualitative structure and directional trends of the true utility landscape, providing usable sensitivities for gradient-based optimization. These results show that diffusion-based surrogates can accelerate simulation-driven detector design while enabling differentiable, gradient-informed analysis.</description>

      <title>Achieving Ultrahigh Resolution with High Efficiency: Optical Design of the 2D-RIXS Spectrometer at NanoTerasu BL02U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A state-of-the-art Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) facility, composed of a dedicated beamline and a 2D-RIXS spectrometer, has been constructed and commissioned at BL02U in NanoTerasu, Japan. This paper reports the optical design and optimization of this spectrometer, aiming for an ultrahigh energy resolution of &lt;10 meV in the soft X-ray range. Conventional RIXS spectrometers using monochromatic incident X-rays suffer from a severe trade-off between energy resolution and measurement efficiency, which makes achieving resolutions of &lt;10 meV practically unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we adopted the $h\nu^2$ concept using dispersive incident X-rays, based on a comparative study. This approach decouples the energy resolution from the incident bandwidth. We estimate that our 2D-RIXS spectrometer improves efficiency by more than a factor of 10 compared to conventional spectrometers. The 2D-RIXS spectrometer has been successfully commissioned, demonstrating that sub-10 meV resolution measurement is achievable with practical throughput. While development continues towards the ultimate design resolution, the successful implementation validates the design strategy and offers a pathway for future high-performance RIXS instrumentation.</description>

      <title>A New Beam Monitor at NFS/SPIRAL2 Based on Position-Sensitive PPACs Detecting Fission Fragments from ${}^{238}$U$(n,f)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new experimental setup has been installed at the Time-Of-Flight area of the Neutrons For Science facility (NFS) at GANIL/SPIRAL2 for neutron beam monitoring. This setup consists of an array of Position-Sensitive Parallel-Plate Avalanche Counters (PS-PPACs) that detects both fission fragments in coincidence from secondary neutron-induced fission reactions in several ${}^{238}$U targets. The neutron energy is determined on an event-by-event basis using the Time-of-Flight method, and the reaction point within the U targets is reconstructed, enabling the measurement of the neutron beam flux and beam profile. The high transparency of the setup allows it to operate in parallel with other experiments running at NFS, thus providing an in-beam monitor of the neutron intensity. In this work, we report on the characteristics of this new setup, its operating principle, and the first results obtained using the high-intensity white-spectrum neutron beam at NFS. This beam is produced via reactions between a primary 40-MeV deuteron beam, accelerated in the SPIRAL2 LINAC, and a 8 mm-thick rotating beryllium converter target.</description>

      <title>Design and construction of a cryogenic subcooler-box for supplying single phase supercritical helium to dark matter and gravitational wave experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the design, development, and installation of the ALPS Cryo-Platform Subcooler Box (ACPS), which is part of the cryogenic platform being established in the HERA North Hall at DESY to supply helium for cooling large-scale dark-matter and gravitational-wave experiments with very high heat loads. The ACPS is capable of subcooling supercritical helium supplied via the 1.6-km-long HERA transfer line by means of a pipe heat exchanger immersed in a subcooler bath filled with liquid helium produced through Joule-Thomson valves. It is also equipped with numerous cryogenic components, including control valves, flow meters, and safety valves, enabling experimental operation to be carried out directly by the ACPS itself and thereby reducing the cryogenic requirements imposed on the experiments. To support a wide range of experiments, the ACPS provides three transfer lines that deliver different levels of cooling power.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Athermal Phonon Responsivity in a Kinetic Inductance Detector with Integrated Phonon Collectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryogenic phonon detectors are adopted in light dark matter searches and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments as they can achieve low energy thresholds. The phonon mediated sensing of silicon particle absorbers has already been proved with Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs), acting both as sensors and athermal phonon absorbers at the same time. In this work we present the design and the performance of an improved detector, where the KID acts only as sensor and is coupled to dedicated phonon collectors. The separation between the detector and the collectors increases the variation of the quasi-particle density within the device, thereby enhancing its responsivity. The meander of the KID is composed of a 77nm trilayer wire of Aluminum-Titanium-Aluminum, while the phonon collectors are made of a 100nm Aluminum layer and act as quasi-particles funnels. Inside the collectors, the absorbed athermal phonons generate quasi-particles which, after diffusion, are trapped in the lower-gap superconducting trilayer. The performance of this setup is compared to that of a standard phonon-mediated KID, showing an increase in responsivity by around a factor of five.</description>

      <title>Commercial Accelerometers for Vibration Sensing at mK Temperatures in Dry Dilution Refrigerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents an evaluation of off-the-shelf commercial accelerometers at the mixing chamber stage of a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator at temperatures down to 8 mK. In addition, we present results of radioassay of accelerometer samples using a high purity germanium detector counting setup. Cryogen-free dilution refrigerators using pulse-tube cryocoolers (PTs)-due to recent advances in their cooling capacity, long-term stability, and operational costs-have become ubiquitous tools in a wide range of fields ranging from experimental particle physics to quantum information sciences. However, vibrations induced by PTs can negatively impact the experimental payload in these applications. This work demonstrates that commercially available accelerometers can not only measure vibrations at millikelvin cryogenic temperatures but also pave the way for continuous, in situ, real-time vibration monitoring of dry dilution refrigerators.</description>

      <title>Bridging Theory and Experiment in Virtually Imaged Phased Array (VIPA) Spectrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtually imaged phased array (VIPA) spectrometers provide high resolution and fast acquisition in a compact design, but their performance as dispersive instruments is sensitive to fabrication tolerances, component dimensions, and alignment. Here, leveraging numerical simulations validated by experimental data, we present a framework to identify the parameters that limit VIPA spectrometer resolution. This framework is applied to the construction of a new mid infrared VIPA spectrometer, tested at wavelengths near 4.6 um with both continuous-wave and frequency-comb laser sources, with a resolving power predicted by analytical expressions to be as high as RP = 830 000 (corresponding to a resolution of 78 MHz). Validated numerical simulations, however, provided a more realistic estimate that captures limits set by all the optical components. By correcting aberrations and optimizing alignment, a resolving power of RP = 440 000 (150 MHz) was experimentally achieved, corresponding to 80% of the value predicted by numerical simulation of the entire spectrometer. These results bridge the gap between analytical design expressions and experimental results for compact, high-resolution VIPA spectrometers to enable more efficient fabrication and advanced design across critical areas like applied space optics, line-by-line pulse shaping, and broadband spectral sensors.</description>

      <title>Search for Cosmic Ray Electron Boosted Dark Matter with the CDEX-10 Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new constraints on the cosmic ray electron boosted light dark matter (CReDM) using the 205.4 kg$\cdot$day data of the CDEX-10 experiment located at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory. The cosmic ray electron spectrum and distribution in the Galaxy are generated by the $\tt GALPROP$ code package. In the calculation process of DM-electron scattering process in the Galaxy, we consider the energy-dependency of the DM-electron scattering cross section. The constraints on CReDM are set for both heavy and light mediator scenarios using the CDEX-10 dataset. The result exceeds previous Standard Halo Model (SHM) limits for DM mass lower than 0.6 MeV in heavy mediator case and corresponds to the best sensitivity among all direct detection experiments from 1 keV to 0.5 MeV in the light mediator scenario.</description>

      <title>Forbidden second harmonics in centrosymmetric bilayer crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical spectroscopy based on second-order nonlinearity is a critical technique for characterizing two-dimensional (2D) crystals as well as bioimaging and quantum optics. It is generally believed that second-harmonic generation (SHG) in centrosymmetric crystals, such as graphene and other bilayer 2D crystals, is negligible without externally breaking the inversion symmetry. Here, we show that with a new homodyne detection technique, we can apparently circumvent this symmetry-imposed constraint and observe robust SHG in pristine centrosymmetric crystals, without any symmetry-breaking field. With its exceptional sensitivity, we resolve polarization-resolved SHG in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), bilayer 2H-WSe$_2$, and remarkably, Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, allowing us to unambiguously identify the crystallographic orientation in these crystals via SHG for the first time. We also demonstrate that the new technique can be used to non-invasively detect uniaxial strain and optical geometric phase in these crystals. The observed SHG in our experiments is attributed to second-order nonlinearity in the quadrupole channel, which is controlled by the presence of the $C_2$ symmetry instead of the inversion symmetry. Our new technique expands the capability of nonlinear optical spectroscopy to encompass a large class of centrosymmetric materials that could never be measured before, and can be used for quantum sensing of moir\'e materials and twisted epitaxial films.</description>

      <title>Observation of narrow-band $\gamma$ radiation from a boron-doped diamond superlattice with an 855 MeV electron beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first observation of narrow band 1.3 MeV $\gamma$ radiation from a crystalline micro-undulator. A diamond superlattice was grown with a periodical varying boron doping profile. Four sinusoidally deformed (110) planes resulted with a period length of 5.0 $\mu$m and an amplitude of 0.098 nm. A channeling experiment was performed with the 855 MeV electron beam of the Mainz Microtron MAMI A accelerator facility. A clear peak was detected with a large sodium iodide scintillation detector close to the expected photon energy of 1.28 MeV. Key characteristics of the peak, including photon energy, width and intensity, were reproduced fairly well by Monte-Carlo simulation calculations. Based on the latter, optimized boron doping profiles were designed for the 1.6 GeV beam of MAMI C and a hypothetical 3 GeV beam, enabling preparation of highly directional $\gamma$-ray beams with photon energies of 4.2 and 14.5 MeV. The predicted spectral bandwidths are, respectively, about 18\% and 13\%, however, with a high energy continuum tail. The on-target photon flux at a beam current of 100 $\mu$A would be about $10^{12}$/s for the 14.5 MeV photon beam.</description>

      <title>Challenges and strategies in verification of FastRICH ASIC for the LHCb RICH detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The FastRICH ASIC provides high-precision, triggerless readout for the LS3 Enhancements and Upgrades II of the LHCb RICH detector. The demands of continuous data acquisition and varying hit rates across the detector impose unique challenges on the ASIC's design and verification. This work presents the verification strategy for FastRICH, focusing on functional correctness, timing performance, and operational robustness. The methodology includes simulations across occupancy scenarios, validation of timing precision, and stress testing under pile-up and high-rate conditions. Results demonstrate that FastRICH meets its performance requirements over the full range of expected occupancies. Key design and verification challenges specific to triggerless, fast-timing ASICs are discussed, along with lessons learned for future developments.</description>
