      <title>Teleportation = Translation: Continuous recovery of black hole information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \textit{Teleportation = Translation} conjecture posits that the recovery of information from a black hole is dual to a geometric translation in the emergent spacetime. In this paper, we rigorously establish this equivalence by constructing a continuous family of unitaries that bridges the discrete algebraic teleportation protocol and modular flow. We resolve the obstruction of dynamic idempotency, inherent in Type III von Neumann algebras, by employing the Haagerup-Kosaki crossed-product construction. This lift to the semifinite envelope yields a canonical, dynamically consistent path whose unique self-adjoint generator $\tilde{G}$ is proven to be exactly twice the modular Hamiltonian difference, $\tilde{G}=2(K_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}-K_{\tilde{\mathcal{N}}})$. We establish this identity as a closed operator equivalence using Nelson's analytic vector theorem and quantify its structural robustness via Kosaki's non-commutative $L^p$ theory. Our results provide a concrete analytic mechanism for probing emergent geometry from quantum information, offering a kinematic framework naturally extendable to include gravitational back-reaction.</description>

      <title>Non-Tonelli Finsler Geometry of Exotic Superconductivity: Metastable Vortex Phases and Geometric Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a thermally coupled Ginzburg-Landau theory on \emph{Weakly Non-Tonelli (WNT) Finsler manifolds}, extending classical vortex analysis beyond the Tonelli convexity paradigm. The WNT framework weakens global $1$-homogeneity and strict convexity while preserving superlinearity and local ellipticity, enabling a geometric treatment of superconductors whose anisotropic energy landscapes are nonconvex and temperature-dependent. Within this setting, we construct the generalized Legendre correspondence, Hamiltonian metric, and WNT Laplacian, proving existence and sharp Coulomb asymptotics of the three-dimensional Green kernel. We then establish the $\Gamma$--convergence of the WNT-GL energy and identify metastable vortex filaments minimizing a renormalized geometric functional. Finally, a dynamic $\Gamma$-limit yields an effective filament flow governed by the WNT Finsler curvature and thermally induced geometric forces, predicting curvature focusing and phase bifurcation at a critical transition temperature $T_c$. This theory unifies convex-analytic, geometric, and physical perspectives, showing that Non-Tonelli Finsler structures form a natural analytic bridge between classical Finsler geometry, anisotropic variational models, and the nonlinear thermodynamics of exotic superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Geometric Formulation of Combined Conservative Dissipative Mechanics via Contact Hamiltonian Dynamics Symmetries, Reduction, and Variational Integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified geometric framework for mechanical systems that combine conservative and dissipative dynamics by formulating them on contact manifolds. Within this setting, we identify the Reeb vector field as the intrinsic generator of irreversibility and derive explicit laws describing how dissipation modifies symmetry reduction and momentum evolution. As a concrete application, we construct the contact Hamiltonian formulation of the rigid body with isotropic and anisotropic damping, classify all equilibrium configurations, and analyze their stability. Building on this continuous formulation, we design a second-order structure preserving contact variational integrator obtained by a symmetric splitting of kinetic, potential, and dissipative components. Numerical experiments for representative dissipative systems demonstrate accurate energy decay, geometric consistency, and recovery of the symplectic Verlet scheme in the conservative limit. The proposed framework provides a coherent connection between the geometry of contact dynamics, physical irreversibility, and numerically stable integration, offering new tools for the analysis of mixed conservative dissipative mechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Universal Curvature Force on Dislocations from a Cartan Geometric Defect Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified Cartan geometric framework where dislocations and disclinations correspond to torsion and curvature of the material coframe connection, respectively, and phase defects emerge as U(1) vortices. This single action principle produces coupled equations of motion and conservation laws governing these defects. Our theory predicts a universal Magnus-like force exerted by curvature on moving dislocations, as well as disclination-driven reconnection events. These phenomena offer experimentally testable signatures in colloidal crystals and mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Perfect state transfer in inhomogeneous XX model of q-Racah type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New exactly solvable one-dimensional XX spin chain models that exhibit perfect state transfer are defined. These models have inhomogeneous couplings and magnetic fields determined from the three-term recurrence relations satisfied by the q-Racah and para q-Racah polynomials. Due to this connection with orthogonal polynomials, the one-excitation sector can be solved analytically. This allows us to provide explicit sets of conditions on the polynomial parameters that guarantee the occurrence of perfect state transfer across these spin chains.</description>

      <title>Continuous binary Darboux transformation as an abstract framework for KdV soliton gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified operator-theoretic framework for constructing deterministic KdV soliton gases and step-type KdV solutions. Starting from Dyson's determinantal formula, we obtain a broad class of reflectionless solutions and describe their basic spectral and analytic properties, including their interpretation as deterministic soliton gases. We then introduce a continuous binary Darboux transformation that acts directly on the scattering data and generates general step-type solutions, with particular emphasis on reflectionless hydraulic-jump-type profiles modelling a soliton condensate on the left and vacuum on the right. The paper is methodological in nature: our goal is not to develop a full kinetic or probabilistic theory, but to show how classical tools from spectral and scattering theory can be combined into a conceptually simple framework that accommodates both reflectionless and non-reflectionless soliton gas configurations, including step-like backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Reversibility in finite-dimensional collapse dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite-dimensional quantum systems with arbitrary, discontinuous collapse events. Formally, we fix a realization map (a physically admissible selector of the collapse dynamics) and do not rely on any regularity of the induced dynamics. We prove the existence of a topologically closed, invariant subset of the projective state space in which any two states can be connected with arbitrarily fine Fubini-Study precision and arbitrarily small integrated energetic cost. This shows that the preservation of information along a realized branch guarantees islands of quasi-reversibility, while genuine irreversibility requires additional ingredients such as non-compactness, explicit erasure, or coupling to reservoirs.

      <title>Operadic Calculus for Higher Colour-Kinematics Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for algebraic foundations of colour-kinematics duality and the double-copy construction has brought into focus a generalization of Batalin--Vilkovisky algebras, referred to here as coexact BV-algebras and as $\textrm{BV}^\square$-algebras in other sources. While these structures capture the cubic sector, they fail to encode higher-valence phenomena, for which a homotopy-theoretic extension becomes necessary. This work introduces a conceptual notion of homotopy coexact BV-algebra, defined through the homotopical interplay of commutative and BV structures, and provides a concrete model in terms of generators and relations, obtained through an extension the theory of Koszul duality for operads. The resulting framework enables the systematic use of homotopical tools -- $\infty$-morphisms, homotopy transfer, rectification, and deformation theory -- and naturally accommodates the quartic-level structures recently identified in Yang--Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Improved Approximation of Infinite Thermostat by Finite Reservoir Using the 3D Kac Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a system of $M$ particles interacting with a reservoir of $N$ particles, where $N &gt;&gt; M$, and compare this setup to one where the $M$-particle system interacts with a thermostat of infinite particles. Our goal is to prove a suitable upper bound, uniform in time, on the distance between the states of these two setups, given an initial Maxwellian state for both the reservoir and thermostat. Previous work has analyzed this problem using the one-dimensional Kac Model of gas collisions and an $L^2$ norm to define distance; the result was a bound which scaled with $M/\sqrt{N}$. In this paper, we use the $L^2$ norm and the three-dimensional generalization of the Kac Model to prove a bound whose long-term behavior scales with $M/N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an abstract Dyson expansion for perturbations that are merely relatively form-bounded, and apply it to the polaron problem. For a large class of polaron-type models, including the Fr\"ohlich and Nelson models, we prove that the vacuum expectation value of the heat semi-group is a completely monotone function of the square of the total momentum. Consequently, the ground state energy is a concave function of the square of the momentum, a result recently proved for the Fr\"ohlich model in \cite{polzer} using a probabilistic approach via Wiener integrals.</description>

      <title>Gibbs state postulate from dynamical stability -- Redundancy of the zeroth law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gibbs states play a central role in quantum statistical mechanics as the standard description of thermal equilibrium. Traditionally, their use is justified either by a heuristic, a posteriori reasoning, or by derivations based on notions of typicality or passivity. In this work, we show that Gibbs states are completely characterized by assuming dynamical stability of the system itself and of the system in weak contact with an arbitrary environment. This builds on and strengthens a result by Frigerio, Gorini, and Verri (1986), who derived Gibbs states from dynamical stability using an additional assumption that they referred to as the "zeroth law of thermodynamics", as it concerns a nested dynamical stability of a triple of systems. We prove that this zeroth law is redundant and that an environment consisting solely of harmonic oscillators is sufficient to single out Gibbs states as the only dynamically stable states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a ``two-particle factorization'' condition which allows us to formulate the homogeneous Boltzmann equation
  for non-reversible collision kernels in terms of an entropy inequality.
  This formulation yields an H-Theorem.
  We provide some examples of non-reversible binary collision models
  with a concentration/dispersion mechanism, as in opinion
  dynamics, which satisfy this condition.
  As a preliminary step, we also provide an analogous variational formulation of non-reversible continuous time
  Markov chains, expressed in terms of an entropy dissipation inequality.</description>

      <title>Perturbation of Traveling Boussinesq Solitons by Periodic Bathymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the perturbations induced by a periodic bathymetry on traveling Boussinesq solitons in a two-dimensional configuration. We present two perturbation approaches to solve the nonlinear, dispersive and non-autonomous differential equations of the model and compare the solutions with numerical simulations of the original system of equations. In the approximation for small periodic corrugations we built the solutions as modulated traveling waves using Fourier series. The coefficients of the series are solved using the Green function method and the pathordered exponential method. At the second order in the relative height of bed corrugations, we obtain the perturbation as the fourth-order linear dispersive waves generated by the modulated traveling soliton in its wake. In the second approach, we rewrite the Boussinesq system into a perturbed Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) nonlinear equation, and obtain the corresponding perturbed solitons. These analytic solutions are compared with the results of numerical simulations, for various parameters that characterize the effects of nonlinearity, dispersion, and bottom bathymetry. We also discuss the stability of the perturbed solitons in time. The perturbation approaches developed in this study are valid for any type of periodic bathymetries, and the method can readily be extended to non-periodic ones.</description>

      <title>Multichannel Kondo Effect in Superconducting Leads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional multichannel Kondo effect takes place when several gapless metallic electronic channels interact with a localized spin-$S$ impurity, with the number of channels $n$ exceeding the size of the impurity spin, $n&gt;2S$, leading to the emergence of non-Fermi liquid impurity behavior at low temperatures. Here, we show that the effect can be realized even when the electronic degrees of freedom are strongly correlated and gapped. The system under consideration consists of a single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity coupled isotropically to $n$ spin singlet superconducting channels realized by one-dimensional leads with quasi-long-range superconducting order. The competition between the Kondo and superconducting fluctuations induces multiple distinct ground states and boundary phases depending on the relative strengths of the bulk and boundary interactions. Using the Bethe Ansatz technique, we identify four regimes: an overscreened Kondo phase, a zero-mode phase, a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) phase, and a local-moment phase with an unscreened impurity, each with its own experimental characteristic. We describe the renormalization-group flow, the excitation spectrum, and the full impurity thermodynamics in each phase. Remarkably, even in the presence of a bulk mass gap, the boundary critical behavior in the Kondo phase is governed by the same exponents as in the gapless theory with the low-energy impurity sector flowing to the $SU(2)_n$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) fixed point, and the impurity entropy monotonically decreasing as a function of temperature. In both the overscreened Kondo and zero-mode phases, the residual impurity entropy is $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T \to 0) = \ln[2\cos(\pi/(n+2))]$. In the YSR and unscreened phases on the other hand the impurity entropy exhibits non-monotonic temperature dependence and is effectively free at low temperatures with $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T \to 0) = \ln 2$.</description>

      <title>Uniform matrix product states with a boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Canonical forms are central to the analytical understanding of tensor network states, underpinning key results such as the complete classification of one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phases within the matrix product state (MPS) framework. Yet, the established theory applies only to uniform MPS with periodic boundary conditions, leaving many physically relevant states beyond its reach. Here we introduce a generalized canonical form for uniform MPS with a boundary matrix, thus extending the analytical MPS framework to a more general setting of wider physical significance. This canonical form reveals that any such MPS can be represented as a block-invertible matrix product operator acting on a structured class of algebraic regular language states that capture its essential long-range and scale-invariant features. Our construction builds on new algebraic results of independent interest that characterize the span and algebra generated by non-semisimple sets of matrices, including a generalized quantum Wielandt's inequality that gives an explicit upper bound on the blocking length at which the fixed-length span stabilizes to an algebra. Together, these results establish a unified theoretical foundation for uniform MPS with boundaries, bridging the gap between periodic and arbitrary-boundary settings, and providing the basis for extending key analytical and classification results of matrix product states to a much broader class of states and operators.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Cumulant Expansion and Polynomial-Time Algorithm for Weakly Interacting Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a randomized algorithm to compute the log-partition function of weakly interacting fermions with polynomial runtime in both the system size and precision. Although weakly interacting fermionic systems are considered tractable for many computational methods such as the diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo, a mathematically rigorous proof of polynomial runtime has been lacking. In this work we first extend the proof techniques developed in previous works for proving the convergence of the cumulant expansion in periodic systems to the non-periodic case. A key equation used to analyze the sum of connected Feynman diagrams, which we call the tree-determinant expansion, reveals an underlying tree structure in the summation. This enables us to design a new randomized algorithm to compute the log-partition function through importance sampling augmented by belief propagation. This approach differs from the traditional method based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, whose efficiency is hard to guarantee, and enables us to obtain a algorithm with provable polynomial runtime.</description>

      <title>Robust series linearization of nonlinear advection-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) for advection-diffusion processes which are augmented by an auxiliary parameter $\delta$ such that $\delta=0$ corresponds to linear advection-diffusion. We derive potentially non-perturbative series expansions in $\delta$ that provide a process to obtain the solution of the nonlinear PDE through solving a hierarchical system of linear, forced PDEs with the forcing terms dependent on solutions at lower orders in the hierarchy. We rigorously detail our approach for a particular deformation that interpolates between linear advection-diffusion and the canonical Burgers' equation modeling nonlinear advection. In this case, we prove that the series has infinite radius of convergence for arbitrary integrable initial data, analyze the cases of a Dirac-delta initial condition (IC) (i.e., the fundamental solution) in an infinite domain and arbitrary IC in a periodic domain, and demonstrate the approach to turbulent behavior in a scenario with periodic forcing. We then treat models of nonlinear diffusion involving the $p$-Laplacian operator, including generalizations of the Poisson equation in $1$ and $2$ dimensions, and the heat equation in $1+1$ dimensions. We detail series expansions for two different deformations of these equations about their linear (ordinary Laplacian) counterparts, providing numerical evidence for the convergence of the series outside of a perturbative regime and demonstrating that the rate and radius of convergence are affected by choice of deformation. Our results provide a rigorous foundation for using series expansion techniques to study nonlinear advection-diffusion PDEs, opening new pathways for analysis and potential applications for quantum-assisted computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks to solve inverse problems in unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems are extensively studied in applied mathematics, with applications ranging from acoustic tomography for medical diagnosis to geophysical exploration. Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving such problems, while Physics informed Kolmogorov Arnold networks (PIKANs) represent a recent benchmark that, in certain problems, promises greater interpretability and accuracy compared to PINNs, due to their nature, being constructed as a composition of polynomials. In this work, we develop a methodology for addressing inverse problems in infinite and semi infinite domains. We introduce a novel sampling strategy for the network's training points, using the negative exponential and normal distributions, alongside a dual network architecture that is trained to learn the solution and parameters of an equation with the same loss function. This design enables the solution of inverse problems without explicitly imposing boundary conditions, as long as the solutions tend to stabilize when leaving the domain of interest. The proposed architecture is implemented using both PINNs and PIKANs, and their performance is compared in terms of accuracy with respect to a known solution as well as computational time and response to a noisy environment. Our results demonstrate that, in this setting, PINNs provide a more accurate and computationally efficient solution, solving the inverse problem 1,000 times faster and in the same order of magnitude, yet with a lower relative error than PIKANs.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Rota--Baxter Operators of Weight~0 on $B(q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a complete and rigorous classification of homogeneous weight $0$ Rota--Baxter operators on the Block-type Witt algebra $B(q)$, assuming the operator has integral degree $(k,k') \in \mathbb{Z}^2$. A key correction is established in the non+resonant regime $q \ne k'$ with $k \ne 0$: the profile function $g(i) = f(-k,i)$ must satisfy the nonlinear functional equation \[ (i - j)g(i)g(j) = g(i+j+k')\big[(i + k' + q)g(i) - (j + k' + q)g(j)\big], \] which admits only constant, Kronecker-delta, or finite-support solutions. This excludes previously and erroneously claimed families such as non-constant polynomials, exponentials, or nontrivial periodic functions. In contrast, the resonant case $q = k'$ exhibits full flexibility: any profile $g$ is admissible, provided the operator is supported on the single line $m = -k$. The classification is cohomologically exhaustive for generic $q$ (i.e., when $H^1(B(q),B(q)) = 0$), and is applied to derive all homogeneous post-Lie structures and associated Lie algebra deformations.</description>

      <title>An explicit integrator uniform in the true anomaly and exactly preserving all integrals of motion in the three-dimensional Kepler problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a numerical scheme for the Kepler problem that preserves exactly all first integrals: angular momentum, total energy, and the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector. This property ensures that orbital trajectories retain their precise shape and orientation over long times, avoiding the spurious precession typical of many standard methods. The scheme uses an adaptive time step derived from a constant angular increment. Analytical considerations and numerical experiments demonstrate that the algorithm combines high accuracy with long-term stability.</description>

      <title>A discontinuous percolation phase transition on the hierarchical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}$ with translation-invariant edge kernel $J$, it is a classical theorem of Aizenman and Newman (1986) that the phase transition is discontinuous when $J(x,y)$ is of order $|x-y|^{-2}$ and that there is no phase transition at all when $J(x,y)=o(|x-y|^{-2})$. We prove a strengthened version of this theorem for the hierarchical lattice, where the relevant threshold is at $|x-y|^{-2d} \log\log |x-y|$ rather than $|x-y|^{-2}$: There is a continuous phase transition for kernels of larger order, a discontinuous phase transition for kernels of exactly this order, and no phase transition at all for kernels of smaller order. As such, $|x-y|^{-2d} \log\log |x-y|$ is essentially the \emph{only} kernel that produces a discontinuous phase transition. We also prove a hierarchical analogue of the ``$M^2\beta=1$'' conjecture of Imbrie and Newman (1988), which gives an exact formula for the density of the infinite cluster at the point of discontinuous phase transition and remains open in the Euclidean setting.</description>

      <title>Some Novel Aspects of the Plane Pendulum in Classical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a novel connection between the exact solutions of the plane pendulum, hyperbolic plane pendulum and inverted plane pendulum equations as well as the static solutions of the sine-Gordon and the sine hyperbolic-Gordon equations and obtain a few exact solutions of the above mentioned equations. Besides, we consider the plane pendulum equation in the first anharmonic approximation and obtain its large number of exact periodic as well as hyperbolic solutions.In addition, we obtain two exact solutions of the plane pendulum equation in the second anharmonic approximation. Further, we introduce an elliptic plane pendulum equation in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions $-{\rm sn}(\theta,m)/{\rm dn}(\theta,m)$ which smoothly goes over to the the plane pendulum equation in the $m=0$ limit and the hyperbolic plane pendulum equation in the $m = 1$ limit where $m$ is the modulus of the Jacobi elliptic functions. We show that in the harmonic approximation, the elliptic pendulum problem represents a one-parameter family of isochronous system. Further, for the special case of $m = 1/2$, we show that one has an isochronous system even in the first anharmonic approximation. Finally, we also briefly discuss the hyperbolic plane pendulum and obtain a few of its exact solutions in the harmonic as well as the first anharmonic approximation.</description>

Abstract: We show that a fifth order KdV-type equation admits several real as well as complex parity-time reversal or PT-invariant solutions with linear superposition of quadratic functions involving Jacobi elliptic functions of the form ${\rm dn}^2(x,m)$, ${\rm cn}(x,m){\rm dn}(x,m)$, ${\rm sn}(x,m) {\rm cn}(x,m)$ and ${\rm sn}(x,m){\rm dn}(x,m)$. These results must be contrasted with only partial superposition of such functions in Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), $\phi^3$ and a few other nonlinear equations.</description>

      <title>Geodesic structure of spacetime near singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geodesic flows emanating from an arbitrary point $\mathscr{P}$ in a manifold $\mathscr{M}$ carry important information about the geometric properties of $\mathscr{M}$. These flows are characterized by Synge's world function and van Vleck determinant - important bi-scalars that also characterize quantum description of physical systems in $\mathscr{M}$. If $\mathscr{P}$ is a regular point, these bi-scalars have well known expansions around their flat space expressions, quantifying \textit{local flatness} and equivalence principle. We show that, if $\mathscr{P}$ is a singular point, the scaling behavior of these bi-scalars changes drastically, capturing the non-trivial structure of geodesic flows near singularities. This yields remarkable insights into classical structure of spacetime singularities and provides useful tool to study their quantum structure.</description>

      <title>Structure and positivity of linear maps preserving covariance under unitary evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a complex finite-dimensional or infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space, $\mathcal{B(H)}$ and $\mathcal{T(H)}$ be the Banach spaces of all bounded linear operators and of all trace class operators on $\mathcal{H},$ respectively. In this paper, we give a concrete description of the linear maps $\Phi:\mathcal{T(H)}\rightarrow \mathcal{B(H\otimes H)}$ that are continuous relative to the norm topology and covariance under unitary evolution (i.e., $\Phi(UXU^*)=(U\otimes U)\Phi(X)(U^*\otimes U^*)$ for all $X\in\mathcal{T(H)}$ and unitary operators $U\in\mathcal{B(H)}).$ Using this, we obtain the equivalent conditions for this class of maps to be self-adjoint or positive. As a corollary, we get that the virtual broadcasting map $\mathcal{B}_{vb}:\mathcal{T(H)}\rightarrow \mathcal{B(H\otimes H)}$ with the form $\mathcal{B}_{vb}(X)=\frac{ 1}{2}[S(I\otimes X)+S(X\otimes I)]$ is uniquely determined by three conditions: covariance under unitary evolution, invariance under permutation of the copies and consistency with classical broadcasting, where $S\in\mathcal{B(H\otimes H)}$ is the swap operator. Moreover, the linear maps $\Psi:\mathcal{B(H)}\rightarrow \mathcal{B(H\otimes H)}$ that are continuous relative to the $W^*$-topology and covariance under unitary evolution are also characterized.</description>

      <title>A boundary integral equation method for wave scattering in periodic structures via the Floquet-Bloch transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of an acoustic wave scattering in a locally perturbed periodic structure. As the total wavefield is non-quasi-periodic, effective truncation techniques are pursued for high-accuracy numerical solvers. We adopt the Green's function for the background periodic structure to construct a boundary integral equation (BIE) on an artificial curve enclosing the perturbation. It serves as a transparent boundary condition (TBC) to truncate the unbounded domain. We develop efficient algorithms to compute such background Green's functions based on the Floquet-Bloch transform and its inverse. Spectrally accurate quadrature rules are developed to discretize the BIE-based TBC. Effective algorithms based on leap and pullback procedures are further developed to compute the total wavefield everywhere in the structure. A number of numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the new solver. They exhibit that our method for the non-quasi-periodic problem has a time complexity that is even comparable to that of a single quasi-periodic problem.</description>

      <title>Complete Topological Quantization of Higher Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After global completion of higher gauge fields (as appearing in higher-dimensional supergravity) by proper flux quantization in extraordinary nonabelian cohomology, the (non-perturbative, renormalized) topological quantum observables and quantum states of solitonic field histories are completely determined through a topological form of light-front quantization. We survey the logic of this construction and expand on aspects of the quantization argument.
  In the instructive example of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory (the gauge sector of 5D SuGra) dimensionally reduced to 3D, a suitable choice of flux quantization in Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis h") recovers this way the fine detail of the traditionally renormalized (Wilson loop) quantum observables of abelian Chern-Simons theory and makes novel predictions about anyons in fractional quantum (anomalous) Hall systems.
  An analogous choice ("Hypothesis H") of global completion of 11D higher Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory (the higher gauge sector of 11D SuGra) realizes various aspects of the topological sector of the conjectural "M-theory" and its M5-branes.</description>

      <title>Existence and nonexistence results for a nonlocal isoperimetric problem on $\mathbb{H}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, the minimization problem of a nonlocal isoperimetric functional with a competition between perimeter and a nonlocal term derived from the negative power of the distance function, has been extensively studied. In this paper, we investigate this nonlocal isoperimetric problem in hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$, we prove that the geodesic balls are unique minimizers (up to hyperbolic isometries) for small volumes $m$ and obtain nonexistence results for large volumes $m$ under certain ranges of the exponent in the nonlocal term.</description>

      <title>Expected values for SUSY hierarchies of Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this letter is to compute the evolution of some expected values, such as the field operators $a^{\pm}$, quadratures and atomic inversion, under SUSY partner Hamiltonians associated to the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian of quantum optics. This kind of SUSY partners are characterized by having spectra which differ in a finite number of energy levels. We wish to elucidate if the partner connection has any influence on these expected values. In particular, we want also to know in which way the classical and revival times are affected by such SUSY partners.</description>

      <title>Spectral Theory of Almost Periodic Banach--Malcev Algebras and Applications to Moufang Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce almost periodic Banach--Malcev algebras as a non-associative extension of Bohr's classical theory. Our framework is based on the relative compactness of adjoint orbits $\{e^{t\,\mathrm{ad}(x)}(y)\}$, which yields the spectral characterization $\sigma(\mathrm{ad}(x)) \subseteq i\mathbb{R}$, uniform boundedness of orbit closures in the strong operator topology, and a continuous functional calculus for almost periodic derivations. Compact Malcev algebras -- most notably the imaginary octonions $\mathrm{Im}(\mathbb{O})$ -- provide canonical finite-dimensional examples, and their associated Moufang loops carry strictly periodic flows. We also analyze structural actions on eigenspaces of the Malcev Laplacian as a concrete case study, where the bounded defect operator $S(x,y) \in \mathcal{B}(M)$ quantifies the non-associative correction. While speculative links to non-associative gauge theory are noted, they lie beyond the established mathematical scope. The recent convergence control of the BCH series for special Banach--Malcev algebras \cite{Athmouni2025} provides analytic justification for the local Moufang structure used throughout.</description>

      <title>Boundary-driven quantum systems near the Zeno limit: steady states and long-time behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study composite open quantum systems with a finite-dimensional state space ${\mathcal H}_A\otimes {\mathcal H}_B$ governed by a Lindblad equation $\rho'(t) = {\mathcal L}_\gamma \rho(t)$ where ${\mathcal L}_\gamma\rho = -i[H,\rho] + \gamma {\mathcal D} \rho$, and ${\mathcal D}$ is a dissipator ${\mathcal D}_A\otimes I$ acting non-trivially only on part $A$ of the system, which can be thought of as the boundary, and $\gamma$ is a parameter. It is known that the dynamics simplifies for large $\gamma$: after a time of order $\gamma^{-1}$, $\rho(t)$ is well approximated for times small compared to $\gamma^2$ by $\pi_A\otimes R(t)$ where $\pi_A$ is a steady state of ${\mathcal D}_A$, and $R(t)$ is a solution of $\frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}t}R(t) = {\mathcal L}_{P,\gamma}R(t)$ where ${\mathcal L}_{P,\gamma} R := -i[H_P,R] + \gamma^{-1} {\mathcal D}_P R$ with $H_P$ being a Hamiltonian on ${\mathcal H}_B$ and ${\mathcal D}_P$ being a Lindblad generator over ${\mathcal H}_B$. We prove this assuming only that ${\mathcal D}_A$ is ergodic and gapped. In order to better control the long time behavior, and study the steady states $\bar\rho_\gamma$, we introduce a third Lindblad generator ${\mathcal D}_P^\sharp$ that does not involve $\gamma$, but still closely related to ${\mathcal L}_\gamma$. We show that if ${\mathcal D}_P^\sharp$ is ergodic and gapped, then so is ${\mathcal L}_\gamma$ for all large $\gamma$, and if $\bar\rho_\gamma$ denotes the unique steady state for ${\mathcal L}_\gamma$, then $\lim_{\gamma\to\infty}\bar\rho_\gamma = \pi_A\otimes \bar R$ where $\bar R$ is the unique steady state for ${\mathcal D}_P^\sharp$. We show that there is a convergent expansion $\bar\rho_\gamma = \pi_A\otimes\bar R +\gamma^{-1} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^{-k} \bar n_k$ where, defining $\bar n_{-1} := \pi_A\otimes\bar R$, ${\mathcal D} \bar n_k = -i[H,\bar n_{k-1}]$ for all $k\geq 0$.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Geometry of Operational Contexts: A Riemannian-Style Framework for Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an intrinsic geometric framework on the space of operational contexts, specified by channels, stationary states, and self-preservation functionals. Each context C carries a pointer algebra, internal charges, and a self-consistent configuration minimizing a self-preservation functional. The Hessian of this functional yields an intrinsic metric on charge space, while non-commutative questioning loops dN -&gt; dPhi -&gt; d rho^circ define a notion of curvature. In suitable regimes, this N-Q-S geometry reduces to familiar Fisher-type information metrics and admits charts that resemble Riemannian or Lorentzian space-times. We outline how gauge symmetries and gravitational dynamics can be interpreted as holonomies and consistency conditions in this context geometry.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory Amplitudes from Cubic Scalar Feynman diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feynman diagrams are the foremost tool in the perturbative study of quantum field theory. In gauge theories, the full potential of this tool is revealed when it is combined with the Slavanov-Taylor identities associated with the local gauge symmetry. Hence, it is desirable to have perturbative expansion of scattering amplitudes that combine the graphical nature of Feynman diagram expansion and the reations among various diagrams due to the Slavanov-Taylor identities. In a remarkable paper, motivated by the similarity between graph homology and the gauge theory BRST homology, Kreimer, Sars and van Suijlekom found such an expansion. The implication of this expansion is that the amplitudes in a generic non-abelian gauge theory can be constructed by transmuting the renormalised integrands of trivalent Feynman diagrams in a scalar quantum field theory. In this paper, we show that this surprising connection naturally emerges from Witten's open string field theory in the field theory limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conservation laws are computed for various nonlinear partial differential equations that arise in elasticity and acoustics. Using a scaling homogeneity approach, conservation laws are established for two models describing shear wave propagation in a circular cylinder and a cylindrical annulus. Next, using the multiplier method, conservation laws are derived for a parameterized system of constitutive equations in cylindrical coordinates involving a general expression for the Cauchy stress. Conservation laws for the Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya-Kuznetsov equation and Westervelt-type equations in various coordinate systems are also presented.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for non-linear functionals of Gaussian fields via Wiener chaos decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review and present some known results for non-linear functionals of Gaussian variables in the context of discrete Gaussian fields defined on the $d$ dimensional lattice. Our main result is a Central Limit Theorem in the spirit of the classical Breuer-Major theorem, together with applications to the powers of the Gaussian Free Field. Notably, we show that even powers of the discrete Gaussian Free Field converge to the Gaussian white noise, while odd powers converge to a continuous Gaussian Free Field with explicit covariance. The proofs are based on the Wiener chaos decomposition and the fourth moment theorem (Nualart-Peccati, 2005), and include a tightness result. Even if these tools are well-known in the literature, their application to Gaussian fields on the lattice appears to be new.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for stationary Navier-Stokes-Fourier flows and the unreasonable effectiveness of hydrodynamics at the molecular level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics provides a universal description of the emergent collective dynamics of vastly different many-body systems, based solely on their symmetries and conservation laws. Here we harness this universality, encoded in the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations, to find general scaling laws for the stationary uniaxial solutions of the compressible NSF problem far from equilibrium. We show for general transport coefficients that the steady density and temperature fields are functions of the pressure and a kinetic field that quantifies the quadratic excess velocity relative to the ratio of heat flux and shear stress. This kinetic field obeys in turn a spatial scaling law controlled by pressure and stress, which is inherited by the stationary density and temperature fields. We develop a scaling approach to measure the associated master curves, and confirm our predictions through compelling data collapses in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of paradigmatic model fluids. Interestingly, the robustness of the scaling laws in the face of significant finite-size effects reveals the surprising accuracy of NSF equations in describing molecular-scale stationary flows. Overall, these scaling laws provide a novel characterization of stationary states in driven fluids.</description>

      <title>Through the Singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a dangerous journey -- a journey through the strong singularity from one universe to another or from inside of a black hole to its 'inverse' as a white hole. Such singularities are hidden in the Friedman and Schwarzschild solutions; we call them malicious singularities. The journey is made possible owing to two generalizations. The first generalization consists in considering spaces with differential structures on them (the so-called ringed spaces) rather than the usual manifolds. This entails a generalization of the concept of smoothness, which allows us to think about a smooth passage through the singularity. The second generalization is related to the concept of curve. We show that if a kind of singularity is implanted in the set of curve's parameters, along with an appropriate topology, in such a way that the structure of the set of parameters corresponds to the structure of the singular space-time, the curve can smoothly -- in a generalized sense -- pass through the singularity.</description>

Abstract: The magnetic Dirac operator describes the relativistic motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field. Although this operator got a lot of attention in physics many of its fundamental mathematical properties remain unexplored and this article is a first step towards filling this gap. To this end we provide a number of eigenvalue estimates for the magnetic Dirac operator on closed Riemannian manifolds and explicitly compute its spectrum for specific choices of the magnetic field on the flat torus and on the three-dimensional round sphere.</description>

      <title>Tropical KP Theory on Banana Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation is the cornerstone of integrable systems, whose solutions reflect deep connections in algebraic geometry. Banana curves are reducible rational curves obtained as a degeneration of hyperelliptic curves. In this work, we relate the family of KP multi-solitons arising from banana curves together with non-special divisors of fixed degree to the combinatorics of the tropical theta divisor of the curve. We describe the Voronoi and Delaunay polytopes and show that the latter are combinatorially equivalent to uniform matroid polytopes. As a consequence, the combinatorics of the tropical theta divisor canonically encodes the matroid and Grassmannian structures underlying the associated KP multi-soliton solutions. We define the Hirota variety of a banana graph, which parametrizes all tau functions arising from such a graph. Starting from the matroid arising from Delaunay polytopes and the periods in the tropical limit, we construct an explicit parametrization of this variety which realizes the tau function as a multi-soliton. Our framework specializes naturally to real and positive settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A broad class of inverse problems deals with determining certain parameters, from measurement data, in models which are associated to certain partial differential equations. In this work we focus on the heat equation on a finite interval and we determine the dimensionless diffusion parameter from a single measurement. Our results extend to estimating additional parameters of the initial-boundary value problem, such as the length of the interval and/or the time required for the solution to achieve a specific state. Our approach relies on the asymptotic solution of an integral equation: The formulation of this integral equation is based on the solution of the direct problem via the Fokas method; the solution of this equation is achieved through the asymptotic evaluation of the associated integrals which yield an effective approximate solution, supported by numerical verifications. We apply these approximations to well-established problems in soil science and we compare our results with existing ones, displaying clear improvement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the notion of Gaussian domination for the spin $O(N)$ model on general finite graphs. We begin by proving a general inequality for spin correlations under the assumption of Gaussian domination, which directly implies long-range order at low temperatures for graphs with bounded Green's function. Usually, Gaussian domination is proved via reflection positivity, but this requires strict symmetries and is very rigid. In this article we also probe the boundaries of elementary methods for proving Gaussian domination. Although we did not find a way to get uniform bounds, we do offer new views for Gaussian domination at low and high temperatures for finite graphs, and a few counterexamples illustrating the interplay between correlation estimates and Gaussian domination and how local changes in the graph structure can affect the presence of Gaussian domination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal growth of structures governed by spatially stochastic dynamics arises in many scientific settings, for example in processes such as solution-based crystallization and the formation of microbial biofilms on patterned substrates or microfluidic networks. In this work, we investigate lattice growth using a two-dimensional, zero-temperature stochastic model of short-range spin interactions. Our goal is to determine how external perturbations can be optimized to steer the system efficiently toward the uniformly positive state, starting from two initial clusters of positive sites. To achieve this, we cast the problem as a Markov decision process adapted for a two-dimensional Ising model with zero-temperature dynamics. Within this framework, we compare alternative growth geometries and identify the structure of optimal strategies across three representative regimes.</description>

Abstract: We establish local-in-time existence and uniqueness results for nonlocal conservation laws with a nonlinear mobility, in several space dimensions, under weak assumptions on the kernel, which is assumed to be bounded and of finite total variation. Contrary to the linear mobility case, solutions may develop shocks in finite time, even when the kernel is smooth. We construct entropy solutions via a vanishing viscosity method, and provide a rate of convergence for this approximation scheme.</description>

      <title>Flow topology classification of limit cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent topological tools offer a powerful way to classify how phases of nonlinear bosonic resonators are organized. Yet, they remain incomplete. In particular, self-sustained oscillations in the form of limit cycles act as robust organizing centers in phase space that are not captured by existing fixed-point-based approaches. In this work, we extend the flow topology framework for nonlinear resonators to include limit cycles as fundamental topological elements. Using a graph-based construction, we show how periodic attractors impact the global connectivity of phase-space flows. We illustrate the approach with a minimal nonlinear Van der Pol resonator model, where limit cycles coexist with stationary points. Our results provide a unified topological description of stationary and time-periodic phases in nonlinear bosonic systems, with direct relevance to photonic, superconducting, and optomechanical platforms, and raise new questions on synchronization and the extension of flow topology to the quantum regime.</description>

Abstract: We consider Bernoulli percolation on $\mathbb Z^d$ with $d&gt;6$. We prove an up-to-constant estimate for the critical two-point function restricted to a half-space. This completes previous results of Chatterjee and Hanson (Commun. Pure Appl. Math., 2021), and Chatterjee, Hanson, and Sosoe (Commun. Math. Phys., 2023), and solves a question asked by Hutchcroft, Michta, and Slade (Ann. Probab., 2023).</description>

      <title>Quantum Integrability of Hamiltonians with Time-Dependent Interaction Strengths and the Renormalization Group Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider quantum Hamiltonians with time-dependent interaction strengths, and following the recently formulated generalized Bethe ansatz framework [P. R. Pasnoori, Phys. Rev. B 112, L060409 (2025)], we show that constraints imposed by integrability take the same form as the renormalization group flow equations corresponding to the respective Hamiltonians with constant interaction strengths. As a concrete example, we consider the anisotropic time-dependent Kondo model characterized by the time-dependent interaction strengths $J_{\parallel}(t)$ and $J_{\perp}(t)$. We construct an exact solution to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation and by applying appropriate boundary conditions on the fermion fields we obtain a set of matrix difference equations called the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equations corresponding to the XXZ R-matrix. The consistency of these equations imposes constraints on the time-dependent interaction strengths $J_{\parallel}(t)$ and $J_{\perp}(t)$, such that the system is integrable. Remarkably, the resulting temporal trajectories of the couplings are shown to coincide exactly with the RG flow trajectories of the static Kondo model, establishing a direct and universal correspondence between integrability and renormalization-group flow in time-dependent quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18349v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements have been made to understand the statistics of the Aztec diamond dimer model under general periodic weights. In this work we define a model that breaks periodicity in one direction by combining two different two-periodic weightings. We compute the correlation kernel for this Aztec diamond dimer model by extending the methods developed by Berggren and Duits (2019), which utilize the Eynard-Mehta theorem and a Wiener-Hopf factorization. From a form of the correlation kernel that is suitable for asymptotics, we compute the local asymptotics of the model in the different macroscopic regions present. We prove that the local asymptotics of the model agree with the typical two-periodic model in the highest order, however the sub-leading order terms are affected.</description>

Abstract: In the present article, we assume that the first approximation of the scattering operator is given and that it has the logarithmic divergence. This first approximation allows us to construct the so called deviation factor. Using the deviation factor, we regularize all terms of the scattering operator's approximations. The infrared and ultraviolet cases as well as concrete examples are considered. Thus, for a wide range of cases, we provide a positive answer to the well-known problem of J. R. Oppenheimer regarding scattering operators in QED: ``Can the procedure be freed of the expansion in $\varepsilon$ and carried out rigorously?"</description>

      <title>Acoustic pulse propagation in a non-ideal shallow-water model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study develops a theoretical framework for modeling acoustic pulse propagation in a non-ideal shallow-water waveguide. We derive an {\epsilon}-pseudodifferential operator ({\epsilon}-PDO) formulation from the general three-dimensional wave equation, that accounts for vertical stratification, bottom interaction, and slow horizontal inhomogeneity. Using the operator separation of variables method and the WKB-ansatz, we obtain single-mode equations describing the evolution of amplitude and phase along rays. The approach incorporates non-self-adjoint operators to model energy leakage through the bottom and introduces a Hamiltonian formalism for eikonal and transport equations, enabling the computation of amplitude, time, and phase fronts. Analytical and numerical examples are provided for different boundary conditions, including Neumann (ideal), self-adjoint, and partially reflecting interfaces. The results extend previous semiclassical and ray-based theories of wave propagation by including dissipative effects and improving the physical realism of shallow-water acoustic modeling.</description>

      <title>Braided QM and Majorana qubits at third root of unity: a color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebra framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebras graded by the abelian groups $Z_3^2$, $Z_2^p\times Z_3^2$ for $p=1,2,3$, and investigate the properties of their associated multi-particle quantum paraoscillators. In the Rittenberg-Wyler's color Lie (super)algebras framework the above abelian groups are the simplest ones which induce mixed brackets interpolating commutators and anticommutators. These mixed brackets allow to accommodate two types of parastatistics: one based on the permutation group (beyond bosons and fermions in any space dimension) and an anyonic parastatistics based on the braid group. In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions. Mixed-bracket parafermions are created by nilpotent operators; they satisfy a generalized Pauli exclusion principle leading to roots-of-unity truncations in their multi-particle energy spectrum (braided Majorana qubits and their Gentile-type parastatistics are recovered in this color Lie superalgebra setting). Mixed-bracket parabosons do not admit truncations of the spectrum; the minimal detectable signature of their parastatistics is encoded in the measurable probability density of two indistinguishable parabosonic oscillators in a given energy eigenstate.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the triangular prism equations (TPE) for fusion categories, obtained by evaluating triangular prisms in terms of tetrahedra. Using an oriented graphical calculus, we show that the geometric symmetries of the regular tetrahedron are preserved. In the spherical case, we prove that the TPE are equivalent to the pentagon equations after a suitable change of basis. These equations provide new insight for managing complexity via localization. As a consequence, and using the Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert theorem on the second Frobenius-Schur indicator, we obtain new categorification criteria. As an application, we solve all remaining open cases to complete the classification of unitary 1-Frobenius simple integral fusion categories up to rank 8 and up to Frobenius-Perron dimension 20000.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the energy landscape near the ground state of a model of a single particle in a random potential with trivial topology. More precisely, we find the large dimensional limit of the Hessian spectrum at the global minimum of the Hamiltonian $X_N(x) +\frac\mu2 \|x\|^2, x\in\mathbb{R}^N,$ when $\mu$ is above the phase transition threshold so that the system has only one critical point. Here $X_N$ is a locally isotropic Gaussian random field. The same idea is also applied to study the more general model of elastic manifold. In the replica symmetric regime, our results confirm the predictions of Fyodorov and Le Doussal made in 2018 and 2020 using the replica method.</description>

      <title>The scaling limit of the volume of loop O(n) quadrangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the volume of rigid loop-$O(n)$ quadrangulations with a boundary of length $2p$ in the non-generic critical regime. We prove that, as the half-perimeter $p$ goes to infinity, the volume scales in distribution to an explicit random variable. This limiting random variable is described in terms of the multiplicative cascades of Chen, Curien and Maillard arXiv:1702.06916, or alternatively (in the dilute case) as the law of the area of a unit-boundary $\gamma$-quantum disc, as determined by Ang and Gwynne arXiv:1903.09120, for suitable $\gamma$. Our arguments go through a classification of the map into several regions, where we rule out the contribution of bad regions to be left with a tractable portion of the map. One key observable for this classification is a Markov chain which explores the nested loops around a size-biased vertex pick in the map, making explicit the spinal structure of the discrete multiplicative cascade. We stress that our techniques enable us to include the boundary case $n=2$, that we define rigorously, and where the nested cascade structure is that of a critical branching random walk. In that case the scaling limit is given by the limit of the derivative martingale and is inverse-exponentially distributed, which answers a conjecture of arXiv:2005.06372v2.</description>

      <title>Instanton Density Operator in Lattice QCD from Higher Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A natural definition for instanton density operator in lattice QCD has long been desired. We show this problem is, and has to be, solved by higher category theory. The problem is solved by refining at a conceptual level the Yang-Mills theory on lattice, in order to recover the homotopy information in the continuum, which would have been lost if we put the theory on lattice in the traditional way.
  The refinement needed is a generalization--through the lens of higher category theory--of the familiar process of Villainization that captures winding in lattice XY model and Dirac quantization in lattice Maxwell theory. The apparent difference is that Villainization is in the end described by principal bundles, hence familiar, but more general topological operators can only be captured on the lattice by more flexible structures beyond the usual group theory and fibre bundles, making the language of categories natural and necessary. The key structure we need for our particular problem is called multiplicative bundle gerbe, based upon which we can construct suitable structures to naturally define the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten term, 3d skyrmion density operator and 4d hedgehog defect for lattice $S^3$ pion vacua non-linear sigma model, and the 3d Chern-Simons term, 4d instanton density operator and 5d Yang monopole defect for lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory; the structures behind the non-linear sigma model and the Yang-Mills theory are related via an implicit Yang-Baxter equation.
  In a broader perspective, higher category theory enables us to rethink more systematically the relation between continuum quantum field theory and lattice quantum field theory. We sketch a proposal towards a general machinery that constructs the suitably refined lattice degrees of freedom for a given non-linear sigma model or gauge theory in the continuum, realizing the desired topological operators on the lattice.</description>

      <title>A new construction of $c=1$ Virasoro blocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nonabelianization map for conformal blocks, which relates $c=1$ Virasoro blocks on a Riemann surface $C$ to Heisenberg blocks on a branched double cover $\widetilde{C}$ of $C$. The nonabelianization map uses the datum of a spectral network on $C$. It gives new formulas for Virasoro blocks in terms of fermion correlation functions determined by the Heisenberg block. The nonabelianization map also intertwines with the action of Verlinde loop operators, and can be used to construct eigenblocks. This leads to new Kyiv-type formulas and regularized Fredholm determinant formulas for $\tau$-functions.</description>

      <title>Dissipative spectral form factor for elliptic Ginibre unitary ensemble and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dissipative spectral form factor (DSFF)--a widely used probe of non-Hermitian quantum chaos--in the elliptic Ginibre unitary ensemble (eGinUE), which interpolates between the non-Hermitian Ginibre unitary ensemble (GinUE) and the Hermitian Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) via a symmetry breaking parameter. We derive exact finite-dimensional results and large-dimensional approximations for the DSFF, revealing a scaling relationship that connects the DSFF of eGinUE to that of GinUE and the spectral form factor of GUE. This relation explains the distinct time scales underlying the characteristic \emph{dip-ramp-plateau} structure across GinUE, GUE, and crossover regimes. Additionally, we refine estimates of dip-ramp and ramp-plateau transition times for different symmetry regimes. We validate our results with Monte Carlo simulations and demonstrate applications to paradigmatic quantum-chaotic systems: the crossover Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the crossover Power-law Banded random matrices. We highlight an analogy between eGinUE eigenvalues and the positions of a rotating fermionic gas in a two-dimensional anisotropic trap.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the perturbed Landau-Dirac operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the Dirac operator with constant magnetic field in $\mathbb R^2$. Its spectrum consists of eigenvalues of infinite multiplicities, known as the Landau-Dirac levels. Under compactly supported perturbations, we study the distribution of the discrete eigenvalues near each Landau-Dirac level. Similarly to the Landau (Schr\"odinger) operator, we demonstrate that a three-terms asymptotic formula holds for the eigenvalue counting function. One of the main novelties of this work is the treatment of some perturbations of variable sign. In this context we explore some remarkable phenomena related to the finiteness or infiniteness of the discrete eigenvalues, which depend on the interplay of the different terms in the matrix perturbation.</description>

      <title>Unified error bounds for perturbations of non-Markovian open quantum systems in Gaussian environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present perturbative error bounds for the non-Markovian dynamics of observables in open quantum systems interacting with Gaussian environments, governed by a general Liouville dynamics. This extends the work of [Mascherpa et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 100401, 2017], which demonstrated qualitatively tighter bounds over the standard Gr\"onwall-type inequality for unitary system-bath evolution. Our results apply to systems with both bosonic and fermionic environments. Our approach utilizes a superoperator formalism, which avoids the need for formal coherent state path integral calculations, or the dilation of Lindblad dynamics into an equivalent unitary framework with infinitely many degrees of freedom. This enables a unified treatment of a wide range of open quantum systems. These findings provide a solid theoretical basis for various recently developed pseudomode methods in simulating open quantum system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Holographic R\'enyi $n\to 0$ entropy and Euclidean fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the holographic prescription for computing the refined R\'enyi entropies $\tilde S_n$ in the $n \to 0$ limit within the AdS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_d$ framework. This limit can be interpreted as a high-temperature regime with respect to the energy defined by the modular Hamiltonian of the state reduced to a subregion. To leading order in $n$, we find that the system attains local equilibrium and admits a CFT description in terms of a Euclidean, irrotational perfect fluid. This fluid exhibits vortex-like boundary conditions at the entangling surface. Guided by this physical picture, we construct an ansatz for the dual geometry in terms of the boundary fluid variables. We show that our anzats solves Einstein's equations coupled to a cosmic brane at leading order in $n$, in agreement with Dong's proposal for the holographic dual to the refined R\'enyi entropy. The resulting conical singularity, signaling the brane's location, can be understood from this perspective as the bulk extension of the boundary fluid vortices.</description>

      <title>Quantized Markov Chain Couplings that Prepare Qsamples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to quantizing Markov chains. The approach is based on the Markov chain coupling method, which is frequently used to prove fast mixing. Given a particular coupling, e.g., a grand coupling, we construct a completely positive and trace preserving map. This quantum map has a unique fixed point, which corresponds to the quantum sample (qsample) of the classical Markov chain's stationary distribution. We show that the convergence time of the quantum map is directly related to the coupling time of the Markov chain coupling.</description>

      <title>Vielbein Lattice Boltzmann approach for fluid flows on spherical surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a lattice Boltzmann scheme based on the Vielbein formalism for the study of fluid flows on spherical surfaces. The Vielbein vector field encodes all details related to the geometry of the underlying spherical surface, allowing the velocity space to be treated as on the Cartesian space. The resulting Boltzmann equation exhibits inertial (geometric) forces that ensure that fluid particles follow paths that remain on the spherical manifold, which we compute by projection onto the space of Hermite polynomials. Due to the point-dependent nature of the advection velocity in the polar coordinate $\theta$ , exact streaming is not feasible, and we instead employ finite-difference schemes. We provide a detailed formulation of the lattice Boltzmann algorithm, with particular attention to boundary conditions at the north and south poles. We validate our numerical implementation against two analytical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations derived in this work: the propagation of sound and shear waves. Additionally, we assess the robustness of the scheme by simulating the compressible flow of an axisymmetric shock wave and analyzing vortex dynamics on the spherical surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While highly entangled ground states of gapless local Hamiltonians have been known to exist in one dimension, their two-dimensional counterparts were only recently found, with rather sophisticated interactions involving at least four neighboring degrees of freedom. Here, we show that similar bipartite entanglement properties can be realized on a square lattice with anisotropic interactions in four different quadrants. The interaction to generate such entanglement is much simpler than the previous constructions by coupling orthogonal arrays of highly entangled chains. The new construction exhibits an entanglement phase transition with different scalings of entanglement entropy at the critical point and in the lowly entangled phase, and faster decay of the spectral gap in the highly entangled phase. The tensor network representation of the new ground state consists of tensors with lower rank, while preserving a global geometry similar to that of the original networks.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity and Fourier asymptotics of spectral measures for 1D Schr\"odinger operators under exponentially decaying perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03971v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity, or even the Lipschitz property, for the spectral measures of half-line discrete Schr\"odinger operators under suitable boundary conditions and exponentially decaying small potentials. These are the first known examples, apart from the free case, of Schr\"odinger operators with Lipschitz continuous spectral measures up to the spectral edge, and it was obtained as a consequence of the Dirichlet boundary condition. Notably, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the time-averaged quantum return probability, either $\log (t) / t$ or $1 / t$, as in the case of the free Laplacian, remains unchanged in this setting. Furthermore, we prove the persistence of the purely absolutely continuous spectrum and the $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity of the spectral measures for (Diophantine) quasi-periodic operators under exponentially decaying small perturbations. These results are optimal and hold for all energies, up to the border of the absolutely continuous spectrum.</description>

      <title>Full-scatter vector field analysis of an overmoded and periodically-loaded cylindrical structure for the transportation of THz radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Highly overmoded and periodically loaded structures, such as the iris-line waveguide, offer an attractive solution for the efficient transportation of diffraction-prone THz pulses over long distances (hundreds of meters). This paper presents the full-scatter field theory that allows us to analytically derive all the spectral (modal) coefficients on the discontuities of the iris line. The spectral analysis uses vector fields, superseding scalar field descriptions, to account for diffraction loss as well as polarization effects and ohmic loss on practical conductive surfaces. An advanced application of Lorentz's reciprocity theory, using a generalized guided-field configuration, is developed to reduce complexity of the mode-matching problem over nonuniform sections. The used technique is quite general and applies to a wide class of structures, as it only assumes a paraxial incidence (i.e. a parabolic wave equation) along the axis of the structure. It removes the traditional assumption of very thin screens, allowing for the study of thicker screens in the high-frequency limit, while formulating the problem efficiently by scattering matrices whose coefficients are found analytically. The theory agrees with and expands previously established techniques, including Vainstein's asymptotic limit and the forward-scatter approximation. The used formulation also facilitates accurate visualization of the transient regime at the entrance of the structure and how it evolves to reach steady state.</description>

      <title>(2+1)d Lattice Models and Tensor Networks for Gapped Phases with Categorical Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gapped phases in 2+1 dimensional quantum field theories with fusion 2-categorical symmetries were recently classified and characterized using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach arXiv:2408.05266, arXiv:2502.20440. In this paper, we provide a systematic lattice model construction for all such gapped phases. Specifically, we consider "all-boson type" fusion 2-category symmetries, all of which are obtainable from 0-form symmetry groups $G$ (possibly with an 't Hooft anomaly) via generalized gauging--that is, by stacking with an $H$-symmetric TFT and gauging a subgroup $H$. The continuum classification directly informs the lattice data, such as the generalized gauging that determines the symmetry category, and the data that specifies the gapped phase. We construct commuting projector Hamiltonians and ground states applicable to any non-chiral gapped phase with such symmetries. We also describe the ground states in terms of tensor networks. In light of the length of the paper, we include a self-contained summary section presenting the main results and examples.</description>

      <title>On the completeness of contraction map proof method for holographic entropy inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The contraction map proof method is the commonly used method to prove holographic entropy inequalities. Existence of a contraction map corresponding to a holographic entropy inequality is a sufficient condition for its validity. But is it also necessary? In this note, we answer that question in affirmative for all linear holographic entropy inequalities with rational coefficients. We show that the pre-image of a non-contraction map is not a hypercube, but a proper cubical subgraph, and show that this manifests as alterations to the geodesic structure in the bulk, which leads to the violation of inequalities by holographic geometries obeying the RT formula.</description>

      <title>Analogue of Goeritz matrices for computation of bipartite HOMFLY-PT polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Goeritz matrix is an alternative to the Kauffman bracket and, in addition, makes it possible to calculate the Jones polynomial faster with some minimal choice of a checkerboard surface of a link diagram. We introduce a modification of the Goeritz method that generalizes the Goeritz matrix for computing the HOMFLY-PT polynomials for any $N$ in the special case of bipartite links. Our method reduces to purely algebraic operations on matrices, and therefore, it can be easily implemented as a computer program. Bipartite links form a rather large family including a special class of Montesinos links constructed from the so-called rational tangles. We demonstrate how to obtain a bipartite diagram of such links and calculate the corresponding HOMFLY-PT polynomials using our developed generalized Goeritz method.</description>

      <title>Positive paths in diffeomorphism groups of manifolds with a contact distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a cooriented contact manifold $(M,\xi)$, it is possible to define a notion of positivity on the group $\mathrm{Diff}(M)$ of diffeomorphisms of $M$, by looking at paths of diffeomorphisms that are positively transverse to the contact distribution $\xi$. We show that, in contrast to the analogous notion usually considered on the group of diffeomorphisms preserving $\xi$, positivity on $\mathrm{Diff}(M)$ is completely flexible. In particular, we show that for the standard contact structure on $\mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$ any two diffeomorphisms are connected by a positive path. This result generalizes to compactly supported diffeomorphisms on a large class of contact manifolds. As an application we answer a question about Legendrians in thermodynamic phase space posed by Entov, Polterovich and Ryzhik in the context of thermodynamic processes.</description>

      <title>Individual-Based Foundation of SIR-Type Epidemic Models: mean-field limit and large time behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a kinetic framework for modeling the time evolution of the statistical distributions of the population densities in the three compartments of susceptible, infectious, and recovered individuals, under epidemic spreading driven by susceptible-infectious interactions. The model is based on a system of Boltzmann-type equations describing binary interactions between susceptible and infectious individuals, supplemented with linear redistribution operators that account for recovery and reinfection dynamics. The mean values of the kinetic system recover a SIR-type model with reinfection, where the macroscopic parameters are explicitly derived from the underlying microscopic interaction rules. In the grazing collision regime, the Boltzmann system can be approximated by a system of coupled Fokker-Planck equations. This limit allows for a more tractable analysis of the dynamics, including the large-time behavior of the population densities. In this context, we rigorously prove the convergence to equilibrium of the resulting mean-field system in a suitable Sobolev space by means of the so-called energy distance. The analysis reveals the dissipative structure of the dynamics and the role of the interaction terms in driving the system toward a stable equilibrium configuration. These results provide a multi-scale perspective connecting kinetic theory with classical epidemic models.</description>

Abstract: Presently integrability turned the key property in the study of duality between superconformal gauge theories and strings in anti-de Sitter superspaces. Complexity of the study of integrable structure in string theory is caused by complicated dependence of background fields of the Type II supergravity multiplets, with which strings interact, on the superspace coordinates. This explains an interest to study of limiting cases, in which superstring equations simplify. In the present work considered is the limiting case of zero tension corresponding to null string. It is obtained the representation in the form of the Lax equation of null-string equations in (anti-)de Sitter space realized as coset manifold. Proposed is twistor interpretation of the Lagrangian of (null) string in anti-de Sitter space expressed in terms of group variables.</description>

      <title>Spectral Criteria for Unique Signal Recovery from Two-Sided Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The identification of sampling sets that enable unique signal recovery is fundamental to many applications in signal processing and remains a central problem in mathematical analysis. Recent studies in the mathematical literature, particularly in the context of the Fourier transform and crystalline measures, have developed a theory that empowers signal recovery from two-sided sampling in both time and frequency domains. Kulikov, Nazarov, and Sodin introduced a method for identifying pairs of sets that enable unique recovery, based on functional inequalities of the Wirtinger-Poincar\'{e} type. In this work, we propose an alternative, spectral approach based on analogies with quantum mechanics. By relating uniqueness pairs to eigenvalue estimates of associated self-adjoint operators, our method offers a conceptually simpler and more flexible framework for studying signal recovery from two-sided sampling. Our approach extends naturally to other unitary transforms commonly used in signal processing. We demonstrate its effectiveness in the contexts of the Fractional Fourier transform and the Hankel transform.</description>

      <title>Approximating the coefficients of the Bessel functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10370v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the type A, BC, and D root systems, we determine equivalent conditions between the coefficients of an exponential holomorphic function and the asymptotic values taken by the Dunkl bilinear form when one of its entries is the function. We establish these conditions over the $|\theta N| \rightarrow\infty$ regime for the type A and D root systems and over the $|\theta_0 N|\rightarrow \infty, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system. We also generalize existing equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type A root system and over the $\theta_0 N\rightarrow c_0\in\mathbb{C}, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c_1\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system and prove new equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type D root system. Furthermore, we determine the asymptotics of the coefficients of the Bessel functions over the regimes that we have mentioned.</description>

      <title>Superintegrability for some $(q,t)$-deformed matrix models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Macdonald's $(q,t)$-deformed hypergeometric functions with one and two set variables and present their constraints. We prove the uniqueness to the solution of these constraints. We propose a concise method to prove the superintegrability relations for some well-known $(q,t)$-deformed matrix models, where the constraints of hypergeometric functions play a crucial role.</description>

      <title>CLT for the trace functional of the IDS of magnetic random Schr\"{o}dinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the existence of the integrated density of states (IDS) of the magnetic Schr\"{o}dinger operator with a random potential on the Hilbert space \( L^2(\mathbb{R}^d) \), as an analogue of the law of large numbers (LLN) for trace functionals. In this work, we establish an analogue of the central limit theorem (CLT), which describes the fluctuations of the trace functionals of the IDS, for a class of test functions denoted by \( C^1_{d,0}(\mathbb{R}) \). This class consists of real-valued, continuously differentiable functions on \( \mathbb{R} \) that decay at the rate \( O(|x|^{-m}) \) as \( |x| \to \infty \), where \( m &gt; d + 1 \).</description>

      <title>Homogeneous potentials, Lagrange's identity and Poisson geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lagrange identity expresses the second derivative of the moment of inertia of a system of material points through kinetic energy and homogeneous potential energy, from which follows the Jacobi well-known result on the instability of a system of gravitating bodies. In this work, it is proven that if a Hamiltonian system satisfies the Lagrange identity, then it possesses additional tensor invariants that are not expressed through the basic invariants existing for all Hamiltonian systems. A new class of Hamiltonian systems with inhomogeneous potentials is considered, which also possess similar additional tensor invariants.</description>

      <title>Quantum resource degradation theory within the framework of observational entropy decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of quantum resource degradation grounded in a decomposition of observational entropy, which partitions the total resource into inter-block coherence ($\mathcal{C}_{\text{rel}}$) and intra-block noise ($\mathcal{D}_{\text{rel}}$). Under free operations, the total quantum resource is transformed into classical noise while its overall quantity remains conserved. We demonstrate that the metric $\eta$ functions as a diagnostic indicator, providing a new lens on optimization stagnation, particularly the barren plateau phenomenon in variational quantum algorithms. We substantiate this framework through rigorous mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, and we explore how these channels can be physically implemented in real quantum systems. Our approach offers a unified viewpoint on quantum thermalization, measurement-induced disturbance, and the degradation of quantum advantage in practical devices, while also improving optimization strategies for current and near-term noisy quantum hardware.</description>
