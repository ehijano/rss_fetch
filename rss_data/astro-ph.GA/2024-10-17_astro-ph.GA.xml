      <title>Globular cluster ages and their relation to high-redshift stellar cluster formation times from different globular cluster models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation details of globular clusters (GCs) are still poorly understood due to their old ages and the lack of detailed observations of their formation. A large variety of models for the formation and evolution of GCs have been created to improve our understanding of their origins, based on GC properties observed at z=0. We present the first side-by-side comparison of six current GC formation models with respect to their predictions for the GC ages and formation redshifts in Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies. We find that all the models are capable of forming most of the surviving GCs at more than 10 Gyr ago, in general agreement with the observation that most GCs are old. However, the measured MW GC ages are still systematically older than those predicted in the galaxies of four of the models. Investigating the variation of modelled GC age distributions for general MW-mass galaxies, we find that some of the models predict that a significant fraction of MW-mass galaxies would entirely lack a GC population older than 10 Gyr, whereas others predict that all MW-mass galaxies have a significant fraction of old GCs. This will have to be further tested in upcoming surveys, as systems without old GCs in that mass range are currently not known. Finally, we show that the models predict different formation redshifts for the oldest surviving GCs, highlighting that models currently disagree about whether the recently observed young star clusters at high redshifts could be the progenitors of today's GCs.</description>

      <title>Prevention is better than cure? Feedback from high specific energy winds in cosmological simulations with Arkenstone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deploy the new Arkenstone galactic wind model in cosmological simulations for the first time, allowing us to robustly resolve the evolution and impact of high specific energy winds. In a (25$\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc)$^3$ box we perform a set of numerical experiments that systematically vary the mass and energy loadings of such winds, finding that their energy content is the key parameter controlling the stellar to dark matter mass ratio. Increasing the mass loading, at fixed energy, actually results in mildly enhanced star formation, counter to prevailing wisdom but in agreement with recent analytic models. Of the simple parametrisations that we test, we find that an energy loading that scales inversely with halo mass best matches a wide range of observations, and can do so with mass loadings drastically lower than those in most previous cosmological simulations. In this scenario, much less material is ejected from the interstellar medium. Instead, winds both heat gas in the circumgalactic medium, slowing infall onto the galaxy, and also drive shocks beyond the virial radius, preventing accretion onto the halo in the first place. We have not yet tied the mass and energy loadings to high-resolution simulations (a key goal of the Learning the Universe collaboration); however, we can already report that a much lower fraction of the available supernova energy is needed in preventative galaxy regulation than required by ejective wind feedback models such as IllustrisTNG.</description>

      <title>Effects of Cloud Geometry and Metallicity on Shattering and Coagulation of Cold Gas, and Implications for Cold Streams Penetrating Virial Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theory and observations reveal that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the cosmic web at high redshifts are multiphase, with small clouds of cold gas embedded in a hot, diffuse medium. A proposed mechanism is `shattering' of large, thermally unstable, pressure-confined clouds into tiny cloudlets of size $\ell_{\rm shatter}\sim {\rm min}(c_{\rm s}t_{\rm cool})$. These cloudlets can then disperse throughout the medium like a `fog', or recoagulate to form larger clouds. We study these processes using idealized numerical simulations of thermally unstable gas clouds. We expand upon previous works by exploring the effects of cloud geometry (spheres, streams, and sheets), metallicity, and the inclusion of an ionizing UV background. We find that `shattering' is triggered by clouds losing sonic contact and rapidly imploding, leading to a reflected shock which causes the cloud to re-expand and induces Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities at its interface. In all cases, the expansion velocity of the cold gas is of order the cold gas sound speed, $c_{\rm s,c}$, slightly smaller in sheets than in streams and spheres due to geometrical effects. After fragmentation the cloudlets experience a drag force from the surrounding hot gas, dominated by condensation rather than ram pressure due to their low relative velocity, leading to recoagulation into larger clouds. We apply our results to the case of cold streams feeding massive ($M_{\rm v}\gtrsim 10^{12}M_\odot$) high-$z$ ($z\gtrsim 2$) galaxies from the cosmic web, finding that streams are likely to shatter upon entering the CGM through the virial shock. This offers a possible explanation for the large clumping factors and covering fractions of cold gas in the CGM around such galaxies, and may be related to galaxy quenching by providing a mechanism to prevent cold streams from reaching the central galaxy.</description>

      <title>The masses of open star clusters and their tidal tails and the stellar initial mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unresolved binaries have a strong influence on the observed parameters of stellar clusters (SCs). We quantify this influence and compute the resulting mass underestimates and stellar mass function (MF). N-body simulations of realistic SCs were used to investigate the evolution of the binary population in a SC and its tidal tails. Together with an empirically gauged stellar mass-luminosity relation, the results were then used to determine how the presence of binaries changes the photometric mass and MF of the SC and its tails as deduced from observations. Tail 1 (T1), which is the tidal tail caused by gas expulsion, contains a larger fraction of binaries than both the SC and tail 2 (T2), which forms after gas expulsion. Additionally, T1 has a larger velocity dispersion. Using the luminosity of an unresolved binary, an observer would underestimate its mass. This bias sensitively depends on the companion masses due to the structure of the stellar mass-luminosity relation. Combining the effect of all binaries in the simulation, the total photometric mass of the SC is underestimated by 15%. Dark objects (black holes/neutron stars) increase the difference between the real and observed mass of the SC further. For both the SC and the tails, the observed power-law index of the MF between a stellar mass of 0.3 and 0.7 $M_\odot$ is smaller by up to 0.2 than the real one, the real initial mass function (IMF) being steeper by this amount. This difference is larger for stars with a larger velocity dispersion or binary fraction. Since the stars formed in SCs are the progenitors of the Galactic field stars, this work suggests that the binary fractions of different populations of stars in the Galactic disc will differ as a function of the velocity dispersion. The direction of this correlation is currently unclear and a complete population synthesis will be needed to investigate this effect.</description>

      <title>Failed supernova explosions increase the duration of star formation in globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The duration of star formation (SF) in globular clusters (GCs) is an essential aspect for understanding their formation. Contrary to previous presumptions that all stars above 8 M explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), recent evidence suggests a more complex scenario. Aims. We analyse iron spread observations from 55 GCs to estimate the number of CCSNe explosions before SF termination, thereby determining the SF duration. This work for the first time takes the possibility of failed CCSNe into account, when estimating the SF duration. Methods. Two scenarios are considered: one where all stars explode as CCSNe and another where only stars below 20 M lead to CCSNe, as most CCSN models predict that no failed CCSNe happen below 20 M . Results. This establishes a lower ($\approx$ 3.5 Myr) and an upper ($\approx$ 10.5 Myr) limit for the duration of SF. Extending the findings of our previous paper, this study indicates a significant difference in SF duration based on CCSN outcomes, with failed CCSNe extending SF by up to a factor of three. Additionally, a new code is introduced to compute the SF duration for a given CCSN model. Conclusions. The extended SF has important implications on GC formation, including enhanced pollution from stellar winds and increased binary star encounters. These results underscore the need for a refined understanding of CCSNe in estimating SF durations and the formation of multiple stellar populations in GCs.</description>

      <title>Energy equipartition in multiple-population globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of Monte Carlo simulations aimed at exploring the evolution towards energy equipartition of first- (1G) and second-generation (2G) stars in multiple-population globular clusters and how this evolution is affected by the initial differences between the spatial distributions of the two populations. Our results show that these initial differences have fundamental implications for the evolution towards energy equipartition of the two populations. We find that 2G stars, which are assumed to be initially more centrally concentrated than 1G stars, are generally characterized by a more rapid evolution towards energy equipartition. The evolution towards energy equipartition depends on the velocity dispersion component and is more rapid for the tangential velocity dispersion. The extent of the present-day differences between the degree of energy equipartition of 2G and 1G stars depends on the cluster's dynamical age and may be more significant in the tangential velocity dispersion and at intermediate distances from the cluster's center around the half-mass radius.</description>

      <title>PGC 44685: A Dwarf Star-forming Lenticular Galaxy with Wolf-Rayet Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lenticular galaxies (S0s) are formed mainly from the gas stripping of spirals in the cluster. But how S0s form and evolve in the field is still untangled. Based on spatially resolved observations from the optical Hispanic Astronomical Center in Andalusia 3.5-m telescope with the PPAK Integral Field Spectroscopy instrument and NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array, we study a dwarf (M*&lt;10^9 Msun) S0, PGC 44685, with triple star-forming regions in the central region, namely A, B, and C, respectively. In northwest region C, we clearly detect the spectral features of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars and quantify the WR population by stacking spectra with high WR significance. Most of the molecular gas is concentrated in the region C(WR), and there is diffuse gas around regions A and B. The WR region possesses the strongest intensities of Ha, CO(1-0), and 3mm continuum, indicating its ongoing violent star formation (gas depletion timescale $\lesssim$25 Myr) with tentative hundreds (&lt;500) km/s stellar winds accompanied by the WR phase. Most (~96%) of three star-forming regions show relatively low metallicity distributions, suggesting possible (minor) accretions of metal-poor gas that trigger the subsequent complex star formation in a field S0 galaxy. We speculate that PGC 44685 will become quiescent in less than 30 Myr if there is no new molecular gas to provide raw materials for star formation. The existence of this dwarf star-forming S0 presents an example of star formation in the low-mass/metallicity S0 galaxy.</description>

      <title>The influence of the cloud virial parameter on the initial mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crucial for star formation is the interplay between gravity and turbulence. The observed cloud virial parameter, $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$, which is the ratio of twice the turbulent kinetic energy to the gravitational energy, is found to vary significantly in different environments, where the scatter among individual star-forming clouds can exceed an order of magnitude. Therefore, a strong dependence of the initial mass function (IMF) on $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ may challenge the notion of a universal IMF. To determine the role of $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ on the IMF, we compare the star-particle mass functions obtained in high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical simulations including jet and heating feedback, with $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}=0.0625$, $0.125$, and $0.5$. We find that varying $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ from $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}\sim0.5$ to $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}&lt;0.1$ shifts the peak of the IMF to lower masses by a factor of $\sim2$ and increases the star formation rate by a similar factor. The dependence of the IMF and star formation rate on $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ is non-linear, with the dependence subsiding at $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}&lt;0.1$. Our study shows a systematic dependence of the IMF on $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$. Yet, it may not be measurable easily in observations, considering the uncertainties, and the relatively weak dependence found in this study.</description>

      <title>Bridging Scales: Coupling the galactic nucleus to the larger cosmic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling black hole (BH) feeding and feedback involves interactions across vast spatial and temporal scales that is computationally challenging. Tracking gas inflows and outflows from kilo-parsec scales to the event horizon for non-spinning BHs in the presence of strong magnetic fields, Cho et al. (2023, 2024) report strong suppression of accretion on horizon scales and low (2%) feedback efficiency. In this letter, we explore the impact of these findings for the supermassive BHs M87* and Sgr A*, using high-resolution, non-cosmological, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) model. With no feedback, we find rapid BH growth due to "cooling flows," and for 2% efficiency feedback, while accretion is suppressed, the rates still remain higher than constraints from Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2021, 2022) for M87* and Sgr A*. To match EHT observations of M87*, a feedback efficiency greater than 15% is required, suggesting the need to include enhanced feedback from BH spin. Similarly, a feedback efficiency of $&gt;15\%$ is needed for Sgr A* to match the estimated observed star formation rate of $\lesssim 2 {\rm M_\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. However, even with 100% feedback efficiency, the accretion rate onto Sgr A* matches with EHT data only on rare occasions in the simulations, suggesting that Sgr A* is likely in a temporary quiescent phase currently. Bridging accretion and feedback across scales, we conclude that higher feedback efficiency, possibly due to non-zero BH spin, is necessary to suppress "cooling flows" and match observed accretion and star formation rates in M87* and Sgr A*.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from a high-resolution interstellar turbulence simulation and show that it closely reproduces recent $Planck$ measurements. Our model captures the scaling of $EE$ and $BB$ spectra, and the $EE/BB$ ratio in the inertial range. The PDF of the dust polarization fraction is also consistent with observations. The $TE$ cross-correlation is in broad agreement with observations. This simulation provides new insights into the physical origins of the observed $E/B$ asymmetry and positive $TE$ signal, facilitating the development of advanced Galactic dust emission models for current and future CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>Lyman Continuum leakage from massive leaky starbursts: A different class of emitters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of Lyman Continuum (LyC) photons responsible for reionizing the universe remains a mystery, with the fraction of escaping LyC photons from galaxies at z$\sim$ 6 to 12 being highly uncertain. While direct detection of LyC photons from this epoch is hindered by absorption from the intergalactic medium, lower redshift analogs offer a promising avenue to study LyC leakage. We present Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (HST COS) observations of five low redshift (z$\sim$ 0.3) massive starburst galaxies, selected for their high stellar mass and weak [SII] nebular emission - an indirect tracer of LyC escape. Three of the five galaxies show LyC leakage, highlighting the reliability of weak [SII] as a tracer, especially in light of recent JWST discoveries of z $&gt;$ 5 galaxies with similarly weak [SII] emission. The dust corrected LyC escape fractions, which represent the LyC photons that would escape in the absence of dust, range from 33% to 84%. However, the absolute escape fractions, which show the LyC photons escaping after passing through both neutral hydrogen absorption and dust attenuation, are significantly lower, ranging between 1% and 3%. This suggests that while the galaxies are nearly optically thin to HI, their high dust content significantly suppresses LyC photon escape. These [SII] weak, massive leakers are distinct from typical low-redshift LyC emitters, showing higher metallicity, lower ionization states, more dust extinction and higher star formation surface densities. This suggests that these galaxies constitute a distinct population, likely governed by a different mechanism facilitating LyC photon escape. We propose that the feedback-driven winds in these compact starbursts create ionized channels through which LyC photons escape, aligning with a picket-fence model.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way Radial Metallicity Gradient as an Equilibrium Phenomenon: Why Old Stars are Metal-Rich</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallicities of both gas and stars decline toward large radii in spiral galaxies, a trend known as the radial metallicity gradient. We quantify the evolution of the metallicity gradient in the Milky Way as traced by APOGEE red giants with age estimates from machine learning algorithms. Stars up to ages of $\sim$9 Gyr follow a similar relation between metallicity and Galactocentric radius. This constancy challenges current models of Galactic chemical evolution, which typically predict lower metallicities for older stellar populations. Our results favor an equilibrium scenario, in which the gas-phase gradient reaches a nearly constant normalization early in the disk lifetime. Using a fiducial choice of parameters, we demonstrate that one possible origin of this behavior is an outflow that more readily ejects gas from the interstellar medium with increasing Galactocentric radius. A direct effect of the outflow is that baryons do not remain in the interstellar medium for long, which causes the ratio of star formation to accretion, $\dot{\Sigma}_\star / \dot{\Sigma}_\text{in}$, to quickly become constant. This ratio is closely related to the local equilibrium metallicity, since its numerator and denominator set the rates of metal production by stars and hydrogen gained through accretion, respectively. Building in a merger event results in a perturbation that evolves back toward the equilibrium state on $\sim$Gyr timescales. Under the equilibrium scenario, the radial metallicity gradient is not a consequence of the inside-out growth of the disk but instead reflects a trend of declining $\dot{\Sigma}_\star / \dot{\Sigma}_\text{in}$ with increasing Galactocentric radius.</description>

      <title>Applying the Velocity Gradient Technique in NGC 1333: Comparison with Dust Polarization Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields (B-fields) are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium (ISM), and they play an essential role in the formation of molecular clouds and subsequent star formation. However, B-fields in interstellar environments remain challenging to measure, and their properties typically need to be inferred from dust polarization observations over multiple physical scales. In this work, we seek to use a recently proposed approach called the Velocity Gradient Technique (VGT) to study B-fields in star-forming regions and compare the results with dust polarization observations in different wavelengths. The VGT is based on the anisotropic properties of eddies in magnetized turbulence to derive B-field properties in the ISM. We investigate that this technique is synergistic with dust polarimetry when applied to a turbulent diffused medium for the purpose of measuring its magnetization. Specifically, we use the VGT on molecular line data toward the NGC~1333 star-forming region ($\rm ^{12}CO$, $\rm ^{13}CO$, $\rm C^{18}O$, and $\rm N_{2}H^{+}$), and we compare the derived B-field properties with those inferred from 214 and 850~$\mu$m dust polarization observations of the region using SOFIA/HAWC+ and JCMT/POL-2, respectively. We estimate both the inclination angle and the 3D Alfv\'enic Mach Number $M_A$ from the molecular line gradients. Crucially, testing this technique on gravitationally bound, dynamic, and turbulent regions, and comparing the results with those obtained from polarization observations at different wavelength, such as the plane-of-the-sky field orientation, is an important test on the applicability of the VGT in various density regimes of the ISM.</description>

      <title>Dynamical resonances in PHANGS galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bars are remarkable stellar structures that can transport gas toward centers and drive the secular evolution of galaxies. In this context, it is important to locate dynamical resonances associated with bars. For this study, we used ${Spitzer}$ near-infrared images as a proxy for the stellar gravitational potential and the ALMA CO(J=2-1) gas distribution from the PHANGS survey to determine the position of the main dynamical resonances associated with the bars in the PHANGS sample of 74 nearby star-forming galaxies. We used the gravitational torque method to estimate the location of the bar corotation radius ($R_{\rm CR}$), where stars and gas rotate at the same angular velocity as the bar. Of the 46 barred galaxies in PHANGS, we have successfully determined the corotation (CR) for 38 of them. The mean ratio of the $R_{\rm CR}$ to the bar radius ($R_{\rm bar}$) is $\mathcal{R} = R_{\rm CR}/R_{\rm bar} = 1.12$, with a standard deviation of $0.39$. This is consistent with the average value expected from theory and suggests that bars are predominantly fast. We also compared our results with other bar CR measurements from the literature, which employ different methods, and find good agreement ($\rho = 0.64$). Finally, using rotation curves, we have estimated other relevant resonances such as the inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) and the outer Lindblad resonance (OLR), which are often associated with rings. This work provides a useful catalog of resonances for a large sample of nearby galaxies and emphasizes the clear connection between bar dynamics and morphology.</description>

      <title>From outskirts to core: the suppression and activation of radio AGN around galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate how the radio-identified active galactic nuclei (AGN) fraction varies with cluster-centric radius, we present the projected and de-projected distributions of a large sample of LOFAR-identified radio AGN out to $30R_{500}$ around galaxy clusters. The AGN fraction experiences a $\sim 25\%$ increase above the field fraction in the cluster outskirts at around $10R_{500}$, a $\sim 20\%$ decrease around $\sim 0.5R_{500}$, and an increase of over three times the field fraction value in the very cluster core. We label these three radial windows the outer, intermediate and inner regions respectively, and investigate how these radial trends might arise due to intrinsic properties of the AGN population. The only difference seen in host galaxy stellar mass is in the inner region, where there is a much higher fraction of massive host galaxies. Analysing AGN radio luminosity, regions with a higher AGN fraction tend to have more radio luminous AGN, and vice versa. We discuss the physical mechanisms that might be responsible for these results with reference to the literature.</description>

      <title>The S$^4$G-WISE View of Global Star Formation in the Nearby Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present source-tailored WISE mid-infrared photometry (at 3.4$\mu$m, 4.6$\mu$m, 12$\mu$m, and 23$\mu$m) of 2812 galaxies in the extended Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^4$G) sample, and characterise the mid-infrared colors and dust properties of this legacy nearby galaxy data set. Informed by the relative emission between W3 (12$\mu$ m) and W4 (23$\mu$ m), we re-derive star formation rate (SFR) scaling relations calibrated to L$_{\rm TIR}$, which results in improved agreement between the two tracers. By inverse-variance weighting the W3 and W4-derived SFRs, we generate a combined mid-infrared SFR that is a broadly robust measure of star formation activity in dusty, star-forming galaxies in the nearby Universe. In addition, we investigate the use of a W3-derived dust density metric, $\Sigma_{\rm 12\mu m}$ (L$_\odot$/kpc$^2$), to estimate the SFR deficit of low mass, low dust galaxies. This is achieved by combining WISE with existing GALEX ultraviolet (UV) photometry, which we further use to explore the relationship between dust and UV emission as a function of morphology. Finally, we use our derived SFR prescriptions to examine the location of galaxies in the log SFR - log M$_\textrm{stellar}$ plane, as a function of morphological type, which underscores the complexity of dust-derived properties seen in galaxies of progressively earlier type.</description>

      <title>Progenitor diversity in the accreted stellar halos of Milky Way-like galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ongoing large stellar spectroscopic surveys of the Milky Way seek to reconstruct the major events in the assembly history of the Galaxy. Chemical and kinematic observations can be used to separate the contributions of different progenitor galaxies to the present-day stellar halo. Here we compute the number of progenitors that contribute to the accreted stellar halos of simulated Milky Way-like galaxies as a function of radius (the radial diversity) in three suites of models: Bullock &amp; Johnston, Aquarius and Auriga. We show that there are significant differences between the predictions of these three models, beyond the halo-to-halo scatter expected in $\Lambda$CDM. Predictions of diversity from numerical simulations are sensitive to model-dependent assumptions regarding the efficiency of star formation in dwarf galaxies. We compare, at face value, to current constraints on the radial diversity of the Milky Way's accreted halo. These constraints imply that the halo of our Galaxy is dominated by $\sim2$ progenitors in the range $8-45\,\mathrm{kpc}$, in contrast to averages of $7$ progenitors in the Bullock &amp; Johnston models, $3.5$ in Aquarius and $4.2$ in Auriga over the same region. We additionally find that the models with radial diversity most similar to that of the Milky Way are predominantly those with ongoing merger events. The Milky Way therefore appears unusual in having an accreted stellar halo dominated by a small number of progenitors accreted at very early times.</description>

      <title>Connection between Non-Axisymmetric Structures and Neutral Gas Distribution in Disk Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-axisymmetric structures, such as bars and spiral arms, are known to concentrate molecular gas and star formation in galaxy centers, actively building up the pseudo-bulges. However, a direct link between the neutral (i.e., molecular and atomic) gas distribution and the exerted torque forces over a broader radial range of galactic disks still remains to be explored. In the present work, we investigate this link by carefully evaluating the torque force field using the $3.6\, \mathrm{\mu m}$ images for 17 The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) galaxies, and measuring neutral gas distribution on resolved atomic and molecular line maps. We find that galaxies with stronger torque forces show a more concentrated neutral gas distribution over the disk-scale, defined as half the isophotal radius at $25.5\, \mathrm{mag\, arcsec^{-2}}$. The correlation holds regardless of whether the neutral gas fraction, or the effective stellar mass surface density is controlled for. In addition, $\mathrm{kpc}$-scale neutral gas over-densities tend to be located close to the local maxima of torque forces. Most of these correlations involving the torque forces are comparatively stronger than those using the traditional Fourier amplitudes to quantify the non-axisymmetric structures. These results are consistent with the scenario that non-axisymmetric structures exert torque forces, and trigger dissipative processes to transport gas inward, not only to build the pseudo-bulges, but also fuel the inner disk growth. In this regard, non-axisymmetric structures inducing stronger torque forces appear to be more efficient in these processes.</description>

      <title>Multiple collisions in N59 bubble: Sequential cloud-cloud collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report that the gas components in the N59 bubble suffered from sequential multiple cloud-cloud collision (CCC) processes. The molecular gas in the N59 bubble can be decomposed into four velocity components, namely Cloud A [95, 108] km s$^{-1}$, Cloud B [86, 95] km s$^{-1}$, Cloud C [79, 86] km s$^{-1}$ and Cloud D [65, 79] km s$^{-1}$. Four CCC processes occurred among these four velocity components, i.e., Cloud A vs. Cloud B, Cloud A vs. Cloud C, Cloud C vs. Cloud D, and Cloud A vs. Cloud D. Using Spitzer MIR and UKIDSS NIR photometric point source catalogs, we identified 514 YSO candidates clustered in 13 YSO groups, and most of them (~60$\%$) were located at the colliding interfaces, indicating that they were mainly triggered by these four CCC processes. We also found that these four collisions occurred in a time sequential order: the earliest and most violent collision occurred between Cloud A and Cloud D about 2 Myr ago, then Cloud B collided with Cloud A about 1 Myr ago, and finally, Cloud C collided with Clouds A and D simultaneously about 0.4 Myr ago.</description>

      <title>BayeSN and SALT: A Comparison of Dust Inference Across SN Ia Light-curve Models with DES5YR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the probabilistic hierarchical SN Ia SED model BayeSN to analyse SALT-based simulations of SNe Ia to probe consistency between the two models. This paper is the first cross-comparison of dust inference methods using SALT and BayeSN, of great importance given the history of conflicting conclusions regarding the distributions of host galaxy dust properties between the two. Overall we find that BayeSN is able to accurately recover our simulated SALT inputs, establishing excellent consistency between the two models. When inferring dust parameters with simulated samples including non-Ia contamination, we find that our choice of photometric classifier causes a bias in the inferred dust distribution; this arises because SNe Ia heavily impacted by dust are misclassified as contaminants and excluded. We then apply BayeSN to a sample of SNe from DES5YR to jointly infer host galaxy dust distributions and intrinsic differences on either side of a `mass step' at $10^{10}$ M$\odot$. We find evidence in favour of an intrinsic contribution to the mass step and a considerably smaller difference in $R_V$ distributions than most SALT-based analyses, at most $\Delta\mu_{R_V}=0.72\pm0.26$. We also build on recent results in favour of an environmental-dependence on the secondary maximum of SNe Ia in $i$-band. Twenty days post-peak, we find a offset in intrinsic $i$-band light curve between each mass bin at a significance in excess of $3\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Origin of spectral bands in the Crab pulsar radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The model explaining the spectral "zebra" pattern of the high-frequency interpulse (HFIP) of the Crab pulsar radio emission is proposed. The observed emission bands are diffraction fringes in the spectral domain. The pulsar's own plasma-filled magnetosphere plays a role of a frequency-dependent "diffraction screen". The observed features such as the proportional band spacing, high polarization, constant position angle, and others are explained. The model allows one to perform "tomography" of the pulsar magnetosphere. Indeed, we have obtained the plasma density profile directly from observations, without assuming a particular magnetosphere. Our model is testable and several predictions are made. The two "high-frequency components" observed at the same frequencies as the HFIP are proposed to be related to HFIP.</description>

      <title>Chemical abundances of 20 barium stars from the OHP spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the high resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra, we derived the chemical abundances of 20 elements for 20 barium (Ba-) stars. For the first time, the detailed abundances of four sample stars, namely HD 92482, HD 150430, HD 151101 and HD 177304 have been analyzed. Additionally, Ba element abundance has been measured using high resolution spectra for the first time in six of the other 16 sample stars. Based on the [s/Fe] ratios, the Ba-unknown star HD 115927 can be classified as a strong Ba-star, while the Ba-likely star HD 160538 can be categorized into a mild Ba-star. Consequently, our sample comprises three strong and 17 mild Ba-stars. The light odd-Z metal elements and Fe-peak elements exhibit near-solar abundances. The [{\alpha}/Fe] ratios demonstrate decreasing trends with increasing metallicity. Moreover, the abundances of n-capture elements show significant enhancements in different degrees. Using a threshold of the signed distances to the solar r-process abundance pattern ds = 0.6, we find that all of our sample stars are normal Ba-stars, indicating that the enhancements of s-process elements should be attributed to material transfer from their companions. We compare the observed n-capture patterns of sample stars with the FRUITY models, and estimate the mass of the Thermally-Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch stars that previously contaminated the Ba-stars. The models with low masses can successfully explain the observations. From a kinematic point of view, we note that most of our sample stars are linked with the thin disk, while HD 130255 may be associated with the thick disk.</description>

      <title>HI line observations of 290 evolved stars made with the Nancay Radio Telescope -- I. Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a compendium of HI 21-cm line observations of circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of 290 evolved stars, mostly (~84%) on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), made with the 100m-class, single-dish Nancay Radio Telescope. The observational and data reduction procedures were optimised for separating genuine CSE HI emission from surrounding Galactic line features. For most targets (254) the results have not been previously published. Clear detections were made of 34 objects, for 33 of which the total HI flux and the size of the CSE could be determined. Possible detections were made of 21 objects, and upper limits could be determined for 95 undetected targets, while for 140 objects confusion from Galactic HI emission along the line-of-sight precluded meaningful upper limits. The collective results of this survey can provide guidance on detectability of circumstellar HI gas for future mapping and imaging studies.</description>

      <title>Abundances of iron-peak elements in 58 bulge spheroid stars from APOGEE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars presently identified in the bulge spheroid are probably very old, and their abundances can be interpreted as due to the fast chemical enrichment of the early Galactic bulge. The abundances of the iron-peak elements are important tracers of nucleosynthesis processes, in particular oxygen burning, silicon burning, the weak s-process, and alpha-rich freeze-out. Aims. The aim of this work is to derive the abundances of V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu in 58 bulge spheroid stars and to compare them with the results of a previous analysis of data from APOGEE. We selected the best lines for V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu located within the H-band of the spectrum, identifying the most suitable ones for abundance determination, and discarding severe blends. Using the stellar physical parameters available for our sample from the DR17 release of the APOGEE project, we derived the individual abundances through spectrum synthesis. We then complemented these measurements with similar results from different bulge field and globular cluster stars, in order to define the trends of the individual elements and compare with the results of chemical-evolution models. We verify that the H-band has useful lines for the derivation of the elements V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu in moderately metal-poor stars. The resulting abundances indicate that: V, Cr, and Ni vary in lockstep with Fe; Co tends to vary in lockstep with Fe, but could be showing a slight decrease with decreasing metallicity; and Mn and Cu decrease with decreasing metallicity. These behaviours are well reproduced by chemical-evolution models except for Cu, which appears to drop faster than the models predict for moderate metallicities. Finally, abundance indicators combined with kinematical and dynamical criteria appear to show that our 58 sample stars are likely to have originated in situ.</description>

The rest-frame optical line ratios of the median stacked spectrum (median $M_{\rm{UV}}=-19.65^{+0.59}_{-1.05}$) indicate negligible dust attenuation, low metallicity ($12+\log(\rm{O/H})= 7.2-7.7$) and a high ionisation parameter $\log_{10}U \simeq -2.5$. We find a factor $\times 1.3$ difference in the number density of $6.8&lt;z&lt;9.0$ galaxies between GOODS-South and GOODS-North, which is caused by a single overdensity at $7.0&lt;z&lt;7.2$ in GOODS-North. The bright end of the UV luminosity function of spectroscopically-confirmed [OIII] emitters is in good agreement with HST dropout-selected samples. Discrepancies between the observed [OIII] LF, [OIII]/UV ratio and [OIII] equivalent widths, and that predicted by theoretical models, suggest burstier star-formation histories and/or more heterogeneous metallicity and ionising conditions in $z&gt;7$ galaxies. We report a rapid decline of the [OIII] luminosity density at $z\gtrsim 6-7$ which cannot be explained by the evolution of the cosmic star-formation rate density. Finally we find that FRESCO detects in only 2h galaxies likely accounting for $\sim 10-20\%$ of the ionising budget at $z=7-8$ (assuming an escape fraction of 10%), raising the prospect of directly detecting a significant fraction of the sources of reionisation with JWST.</description>

      <title>A kiloparsec-scale ordered magnetic field in a galaxy at z=5.6</title>

Abstract: Magnetic fields are prevalent on almost all astronomical scales, but their importance in different systems and over cosmic time is yet to be understood. Our current knowledge of the evolution of magnetic fields is limited by scarce observations in the distant Universe, where galaxies have recently been found to be more evolved than most model predictions. In this study, we conducted rest-frame 131 um full-polarisation observations of dust emission in a strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxy, SPT0346-52, at z=5.6, when the Universe was only 1 Gyr old. Dust grains can become aligned with local magnetic fields, resulting in the emission of linearly polarised thermal infrared radiation. Our observations have revealed a median polarisation level of $0.9\pm0.2$ per cent with a variation of $\pm0.4$ per cent across the regions with polarisation detection, similar to that of local starburst galaxies. The polarised dust emission is patchy and mostly overlaps with the [C II] emission at a velocity of about -150 km/s, and extends over 3 kiloparsecs. The bimodal distribution of field orientations, their spatial distribution, and the connection with the cold gas kinematics further emphasise the complexity of the magnetic environment in this galaxy and the potential role of mergers in shaping its magnetic fields. Such early formation of ordered galactic magnetic fields also suggests that both small-scale and large-scale dynamos could be efficient in early galaxies. Continued observations of magnetic fields in early galaxies, as well as expanding surveys to a wider galaxy population, are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence and impact of magnetic fields in the evolving Universe.</description>

      <title>On the Nature of the C IV-bearing Circumgalactic Medium at z~1</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a detailed study of the physical properties of seven C IV absorbers identified at z_abs = 0.68-1.28 along the line of sight toward QSO PG 1522+101 (z_QSO = 1.330). The study leverages high-quality QSO spectra from HST COS and STIS, and Keck HIRES to resolve component structures and to constrain the gas density and elemental abundances of individual components. Under the assumption of photoionization equilibrium (PIE), five of the 12 C IV components require a mixture of high- and low-density phases to fully explain the observed relative abundances between low-, intermediate-, and high-ionization species. In addition, galaxy surveys carried out using VLT MUSE and Magellan LDSS3C are utilized to characterize the galaxy environments. The results of this analysis are summarized as follows: (1) no luminous galaxies (&gt; 0.1 L*) are found within 100 kpc in projected distance from the C IV absorbers; (2) the C IV selection preferentially targets high-metallicity (near solar) and chemically-evolved gas (~ solar [C/O] elemental abundances) in galaxy halos; (3) the observed narrow line widths of individual C IV components, places a stringent limit on the gas temperature (&lt; 5e4 K) and supports a photoionization origin; (4) additional local ionizing sources beyond the UV ionizing background may be necessary for at least one absorber based on the observed deficit of He I relative to H I; and (5) a PIE assumption may not apply when the gas metallicity exceeds the solar value and the component line width implies a warmer temperature than expected from PIE models.</description>

      <title>Temporal Evolution of the Radial Distribution of Milky Way Satellite Galaxies</title>

Abstract: The Milky Way (MW) is surrounded by dozens of satellite galaxies, with six-dimensional (6D) phase space information measured for over 80% of this population. The spatial distribution of these satellites is an essential probe of galaxy formation and for mapping the MW's underlying dark matter distribution. Using measured 6D phase space information of known MW satellites, we calculate orbital histories in a joint MW+LMC potential, including the gravitational influence of the LMC on all satellites, on the MW's center of mass, and dynamical friction owing to both galaxies, to investigate the evolution of the MW's cumulative radial profile. We conclude radial profiles become more concentrated over time when we consider the LMC's gravitational influence and the group infall of LMC-associated satellites. The MW's radial distribution is consistently more concentrated at present-day, 1 Gyr, and 2 Gyr ago compared to recent surveys of nearby MW-like systems. Compared to MW-mass hosts in cosmological, zoom-in simulations, we find the MW's radial profile is also more concentrated than those of simulated counterparts; however, some overlap exists between simulation results and our analysis of the MW's satellite distribution 2 Gyr ago, pre-LMC infall. Finally, we posit radial profiles of simulated MW-mass analogs also hosting an LMC companion are likely to evolve similarly to our results, such that the accretion of a massive satellite along with its satellites will lead to a more concentrated radial profile as the massive satellite advances toward its host galaxy.</description>

      <title>The Correlation Between Dust and Gas Contents in Molecular Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02057v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular clouds are regions of dense gas and dust in space where new stars and planets are born. There is a strong correlation between the distribution of dust and molecular gas in molecular clouds. The present work focuses on the three-dimensional morphological comparisons between dust and gas within 567 molecular clouds identified in a previously published catalog. We confirm a sample of 112 molecular clouds, where the cloud morphology based on CO observations and dust observations displays good overall consistency. There are up to 334 molecular clouds whose dust distribution might be related to the distribution of gas. We are unable to find gas structures that correlate with the shape of the dust distribution in 24 molecular clouds. For the 112 molecular clouds where the dust distribution correlates very well with the distribution of gas, we use CO observational data to measure the physical properties of these molecular clouds and compare them with the results derived from dust, exploring the correlation between gas and dust in the molecular clouds. We found that the gas and dust in the molecular clouds have a fairly good linear relationship, with a gas-to-dust ratio of $\mathrm{GDR}=(2.80_{-0.34}^{+0.37})\times10^{21}\mathrm{\,cm^{-2}\, mag^{-1}}$. The ratio varies considerably among different molecular clouds. We measured the scale height of dust-CO clouds exhibiting strong correlations, finding $h_{Z} = 43.3_{-3.5}^{+4.0}\mathrm{\,pc}$.</description>

      <title>Multiple-scale gas infall through gravity torques on Milky Way twins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main problems raised by the feeding of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centres of galaxies is the huge angular momentum of the circumnuclear gas and of the gas reservoir in the galaxy disk. Because viscous torques are not efficient at kiloparsec or 100 pc scales, the angular momentum must be exchanged through gravity torques that arise from the non-axisymmetric patterns in the disks. Our goal here is to quantify the efficiency of bars and spirals in driving the gas towards the centre at different scales in galaxies. We selected a sample of nearby galaxies considered to be analogues of the Milky Way, that is, galaxies of late morphological type Sbc. Their bar strength was variable, either SB, or SAB, or SA, so that we were able to quantify the influence of the bar. The gravitational potential was computed from deprojected red images, either from Hubble Space Telescope or Legacy survey, depending on the spatial resolution and field of view considered. The torques were computed on the gas through CO emission maps from ALMA at different resolutions. H$\alpha$ maps from MUSE were used, when available. Eight out of ten galaxies are barred. The torques are found to be negative in the eight barred objects at kiloparsec scales, between corotation and the inner Lindblad resonance (ILR), with a loss of angular momentum in a few rotations. Inside the ILR, the torques are negative in only five cases, with a timescale of one to two rotations. The torques are positive for the galaxies without bars. The torques applied on the ionized gas are comparable to what is deduced from molecular gas. The bars are confirmed to be the essential pattern in the SMBH feeding at kiloparsec and 100 pc scales; higher-resolution gas maps are required to explore scales of 10 pc.</description>

Abstract: In the first two years of operation JWST has delivered key new insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies in the early Universe. By combining imaging with spectroscopy, we discovered and characterised the first generation of galaxies, probing the Universe at an age of 300 million years. While the current JWST observations confirm the overall cosmological framework and the paradigm of galaxy formation, there are also surprises, including large abundances of bright galaxies and accreting black holes in the early Universe. These observations, together with detailed measurements of the stellar populations and morphological structure, will help us to develop in the coming years a more refined understanding of the baryonic physics (including star formation and feedback processes) that leads to the formation of mature systems at later epochs, including our own Milky Way galaxy.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS &amp; EIGER: A merging quasar host at z=7 with an overmassive black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope is revolutionising our ability to understand the host galaxies and local environments of high-z quasars. Here we obtain a comprehensive understanding of the host galaxy of the z=7.08 quasar J1120+0641 by combining NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy with NIRCam photometry of the host continuum emission. Our emission line maps reveal that this quasar host is undergoing a merger with a bright companion galaxy. The quasar host and the companion have similar dynamical masses of $\sim10^{10}M_\odot$, suggesting that this is a major galaxy interaction. Through detailed quasar subtraction and SED fitting using the NIRCam data, we obtain an estimate of the host stellar mass of $M_{\ast}\simeq2.6\times10^9M_\odot$, with $M_{*}\simeq5.0\times10^9M_\odot$ for the companion galaxy. Using the H$\beta$ Balmer line we estimate a virial black hole mass of $M_{\rm{BH}}\simeq1.4\times10^9 M_\odot$. Thus, J1120+0641 has an extreme black hole - stellar mass ratio of $M_{\rm{BH}}/M_\ast\simeq0.54$, which is ~3 dex larger than expected by the local scaling relations between black hole and stellar mass. J1120+0641 is powered by an overmassive black hole with the highest reported black hole - stellar mass ratio, in a quasar host that is currently undergoing a major merger -- these new insights highlight the power of JWST for measuring and understanding these extreme first quasars.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way atlas for linear filaments II. clump rotation versus filament orientation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense clumps distributed along filaments are the immediate medium for star formation. Kinematic properties of the clumps, such as velocity gradient and angular momentum, combined with filament orientation, provide important clues to the formation mechanism of filament-clump configurations and the role of filaments in star formation. By cross-matching the Milky Way atlas for linear filaments and the Structure, Excitation and Dynamics of the Inner Galactic Interstellar Medium (SEDIGISM) 13CO (2-1) data, we aim to derive the velocity gradient and its direction, the specific angular momentum (J/M), and the ratio (\beta) between the rotational energy and gravitational energy of clumps, as well as to investigate the alignment between clump rotation and filament orientation. We found a monotonic increase in J/M as a function of clump size (R), following a power-law relation J/M~\propto~R^{1.5\pm0.2}. The ratio \beta ranges from 1.1~\times~10^{-5} to 0.1, with a median value 1.0~\times~10^{-3}, suggesting that clump rotation provides insignificant support against gravitational collapse. The distribution of the angle between clump rotation and natal filament orientation is random, indicating that the clumps' rotational axes have no discernible correlation with the orientation of their hosting filaments. Counting only the most massive clump in each filament also finds no alignment between clump rotation and filament orientation.</description>

Abstract: The LHAASO Collaboration has recently reported a measurement of the diffuse gamma-ray emission from the Galactic Plane at energies between 10 TeV and 1 PeV. While this emission is brighter than that expected from cosmic-ray interactions in the interstellar medium alone, we show that the intensity, spectrum, and morphology of this excess are in good agreement with that predicted from the "TeV halos" which surround the Milky Way's pulsar population. These results support the conclusion that TeV halos dominate the ultra-high-energy sky, and that these objects convert $\sim 5\%$ of their total spindown power into very-high and ultra-high-energy photons.</description>

      <title>The dependence of halo bias on the protohalo shape alignment with the initial tidal field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical evidence supporting the primordial origin of secondary halo bias even on the galactic mass scale. Analyzing the data from the IllustrisTNG 300-1 simulations, we investigate the dependence of halo bias on the degree of misalignment between the protohalo inertia and initial tidal tensors, $\tau$, measured at redshift, $z_{i}=127$. From the TNG 300-1 galactic halos in logarithmic mass range of $10.5&lt; m\equiv \log[M/(h^{-1}M_{\odot})]\le 13$ identified at $z=0,\ 0.5$ and $1$, a clear signal of $\tau$ bias is detected. For the case that $\tau$ is measured from the initial tidal field smoothed on the scale of $R_{f}/(h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc})\lesssim 1$, the halo $\tau$ bias is found to be very similar in its tendency and amplitude to the spin bias at all of the three redshifts, if the effects of backsplash halos are properly eliminated. For the case of $R_{f}/(h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc})=2$, the $\tau$ bias at $z=1$ turns out to behave like the age bias, diminishing rapidly in the range of $m&gt; 12$. At $z=0$ and $0.5$, however, the $\tau$ and age bias factors show large differences in their overall strengths, which is attributed to the dominant nonlinear effects that undermine the former but enhance the latter. Given these numerical results along with the previous finding that $\tau$ shares a large amount of mutual information with the formation epochs and spin parameters of galactic halos, it is concluded that the origins of halo age and spin bias must be closely linked with the primordial factor, $\tau$, and that the difference in the tendency between the two bias factors on the galactic mass scale reflects the multi-scale influence of $\tau$ on the halo secondary properties.</description>

      <title>A two-minute burst of highly polarised radio emission originating from low Galactic latitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several sources of repeating coherent bursts of radio emission with periods of many minutes have now been reported in the literature. These "ultra-long period" (ULP) sources have no clear multi-wavelength counterparts and challenge canonical pulsar emission models, leading to debate regarding their nature. In this work we report the discovery of a bright, highly-polarised burst of radio emission at low Galactic latitude as part of a wide-field survey for transient and variable radio sources. ASKAP\,J175534.9$-$252749.1 does not appear to repeat, with only a single intense two-minute $\sim$200-mJy burst detected from 60~hours of observations. The burst morphology and polarisation properties are comparable to those of classical pulsars but the duration is more than one hundred times longer, analogous to ULPs. Combined with the existing ULP population, this suggests that these sources have a strong Galactic latitude dependence and hints at an unexplored population of transient and variable radio sources in the thin disk of the Milky Way. The resemblance of this burst with both ULPs and pulsars calls for a unified coherent emission model for objects with spin periods from milliseconds to tens of minutes. However, whether or not these are all neutron stars or have the same underlying power source remains open for debate.</description>

Abstract: With increasing amounts of data in astronomy, automated analysis methods have become crucial. Synthetic data are required for developing and testing such methods. Current simulations often suffer from insufficient detail or inaccurate representation of source type occurrences. To overcome those deficiencies, we implemented a deep generative model trained on observations to generate realistic radio galaxy images with full control over the flux and source morphology. We used a diffusion model, trained with continuous time steps to reduce sampling time without quality impairments. Two models were trained on two different datasets, respectively. One set was a selection of images from the second data release of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). The model is conditioned on peak flux values to preserve signal intensity information after re-scaling image pixel values. The other, smaller set was obtained from the VLA survey of Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST). In that set, every image was provided with a morphological class label the corresponding model was conditioned on. Conditioned sampling is realized with classifier-free diffusion guidance. We evaluated the quality of generated images by comparing distributions of different quantities over the real and generated data, including results from the standard source-finding algorithms. The class conditioning was evaluated by training a classifier and comparing its performance on both real and generated data. We were able to generate realistic images of high quality using 25 sampling steps, which is unprecedented in the field of radio astronomy. The generated images are visually indistinguishable from the training data and the distributions of different image metrics were replicated. The classifier performs equally well for real and generated images, indicating strong sampling control over morphological properties.</description>

      <title>Evolution From Asymptotic Giant Branch to Pre-planetary Nebula: Whorled Patterns and Stellar Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11244</link>

Abstract: Bipolar or multipolar lobes in pre-planetary nebulae (pPNe) often exhibit intertwined outer whorled patterns, resulting from stellar wind matter accumulation during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. These structures are likely triggered by stellar or substellar companions. We regard that CW Leonis currently stands at a critical transition moment, providing a vivid illustration of the progression from an AGB star in a binary system to a pPN. We have found that CW Leonis has shown significant enhancements in its optical and near-infrared light curves over the past two decades, with the recent Hubble Space Telescope image finally revealing the long-awaited central star. Utilizing an eccentric-orbit binary model, we can reproduce the position-angle dependence of the expansion velocity in the whorled pattern around CW Leonis, suggesting a nearly face-on orbital inclination. Its contradiction to the features in the innermost circumstellar envelope, corresponding to a nearly edge-on inclination, may imply the presence of an additional companion. Our updated theoretical framework explores the complexity of the whorled pattern. Further identifying and monitoring phase-transition candidates at the tip of the AGB will provide valuable insights into the AGB-pPN transition and the role of companions in shaping the morphological evolution of these stellar objects.</description>

      <title>HOLESOM: Constraining the Properties of Slowly-Accreting Massive Black Holes with Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accreting massive black holes (MBHs, with M$_\bullet &gt; 10^3$ M$_{\odot}$) are known for their panchromatic emission, spanning from radio to gamma rays. While MBHs accreting at significant fractions of their Eddington rate are readily detectable, those accreting at much lower rates in radiatively inefficient modes often go unnoticed, blending in with other astrophysical sources. This challenge is particularly relevant for gas-starved MBHs in external galaxies and those possibly wandering in the Milky Way. We present HOLESOM, a machine learning-powered tool based on the Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) algorithm, specifically designed to identify slowly-accreting MBHs using sparse photometric data. Trained on a comprehensive set of $\sim$ 20, 000 spectral energy distributions (SEDs), HOLESOM can (i) determine if the photometry of a source is consistent with slowly-accreting MBHs and (ii) estimate its black hole mass and Eddington ratio, including uncertainties. We validate HOLESOM through extensive tests on synthetic data and real-world cases, including Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying slowly-accreting MBHs. Additionally, we derive analytical relations between radio and X-ray luminosities to further constrain physical parameters. The primary strength of HOLESOM lies in its ability to accurately identify MBH candidates, which can then be targeted for follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations. Fast and scalable, HOLESOM offers a robust framework for automatically scanning large multi-wavelength datasets, making it a valuable tool for unveiling hidden MBH populations in the local Universe.</description>
