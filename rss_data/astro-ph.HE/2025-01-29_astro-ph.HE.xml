      <title>Tackling artefacts in the timing of relativistic pulsar binaries: towards the SKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common signal-processing approximations produce artefacts when timing pulsars in relativistic binary systems, especially edge-on systems with tight orbits, such as the Double Pulsar. In this paper, we use extensive simulations to explore various patterns that arise from the inaccuracies of approximations made when correcting dispersion and Shapiro delay. In a relativistic binary, the velocity of the pulsar projected onto the line-of-sight varies significantly on short time scales, causing rapid changes in the apparent pulsar spin frequency, which is used to convert dispersive delays to pulsar rotational phase shifts. A well-known example of the consequences of this effect is the artificial variation of dispersion measure (DM) with binary phase, first observed in the Double Pulsar 20 years ago. We show that ignoring the Doppler shift of the spin frequency when computing the dispersive phase shift exactly reproduces the shape and magnitude of the reported DM variations. We also simulate and study two additional effects of much smaller magnitude, which are caused by the assumption that the spin frequency used to correct dispersion is constant over the duration of the sub-integration and over the observed bandwidth. We show that failure to account for these two effects leads to orbital phase-dependent dispersive smearing that leads to apparent orbital DM variations. The functional form of the variation depends on the orbital eccentricity. In addition, we find that a polynomial approximation of the timing model is unable to accurately describe the Shapiro delay of edge-on systems with orbits less than 4 hours, which poses problems for the measurements of timing parameters, most notably the Shapiro delay. This will be a potential issue for sensitive facilities like the FAST and the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA); therefore, a more accurate phase predictor is indispensable.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave inference of star cluster properties from intermediate-mass black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation ground-based gravitational wave observatories will observe mergers of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) out to high redshift. Such IMBHs can form through runaway tidal encounters in the cores of dense stellar clusters. In this paper, we ask if the gravitational wave observation of a single merger event between two IMBHs, occurring in the aftermath of the coalescence of the clusters in which they formed, can be used to infer the properties of their host clusters, such as mass, redshift, and half-mass radius. We implement an astrophysically motivated analytic model for cluster evolution and IMBH growth, and we perform IMBH binary parameter estimation using a network of three next-generation detectors. We find that inferring the structural properties of clusters in this way is challenging due to model degeneracy. However, the posteriors on the cluster formation redshifts have relatively narrow peaks, and it may still be possible to infer the cluster formation history by measuring a whole population of IMBH binary merger events.</description>

      <title>Time-Integrated Southern-Sky Neutrino Source Searches with 10 Years of IceCube Starting-Track Events at Energies Down to 1 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, a signal of astrophysical neutrinos is obscured by backgrounds from atmospheric neutrinos and muons produced in cosmic-ray interactions. IceCube event selections used to isolate the astrophysical neutrino signal often focus on t/he morphology of the light patterns recorded by the detector. The analyses presented here use the new IceCube Enhanced Starting Track Event Selection (ESTES), which identifies events likely generated by muon neutrino interactions within the detector geometry, focusing on neutrino energies of 1-500 TeV with a median angular resolution of 1.4{\deg}. Selecting for starting track events filters out not only the atmospheric-muon background, but also the atmospheric-neutrino background in the southern sky. This improves IceCube's muon neutrino sensitivity to southern-sky neutrino sources, especially for Galactic sources that are not expected to produce a substantial flux of neutrinos above 100 TeV. In this work, the ESTES sample was applied for the first time to searches for astrophysical sources of neutrinos, including a search for diffuse neutrino emission from the Galactic plane. No significant excesses were identified from any of the analyses; however, constraining limits are set on the hadronic emission from TeV gamma-ray Galactic plane objects and models of the diffuse Galactic plane neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>Multi-Messenger and Cosmological Constraints on Dark Matter through Two-Fluid Neutron Star Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of dark matter (DM) on neutron stars (NSs) using a two-fluid formalism that treats nuclear matter (NM) and DM as gravitationally coupled components. Employing NM equations of state spanning a wide range of stiffness and a self-interacting asymmetric fermionic DM framework, we explore the emergence of DM core- and halo-dominated structures and their observational implications. Constraints from gravitational waves (GW170817), NICER X-ray measurements (PSR J0030+0451), and pulsar mass limits (PSR J0740+6620) delineate a consistent parameter space for DM properties derived from these multi-messenger observations. DM halo-dominated configurations, while consistent with PSR J0740+6620's mass limits and NICER's radius measurements for PSR J0030+0451, are ruled out by the tidal deformability bounds inferred from the GW170817 event. Consequently, the combined limits inferred from the observational data of GW170817, PSR J0030+0451, and PSR J0740+6620 support the plausibility of DM core-dominated configurations. Constraints on the DM self-interaction strength from galaxy cluster dynamics further refine the DM parameter space permitted by NS observations. This work bridges multi-messenger astrophysics and cosmology, providing insights into DM interactions and their implications for NS structure, evolution, and observational signatures.</description>

      <title>A failed wind candidate in NGC 3783 from the 2001 year campaign with Chandra/HETGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reanalyze the Chandra/HETGS observations of NGC 3783 from the campaign in the year 2001, identifying significant spectral variations in the Fe unresolved transition array (UTA) over timescales of weeks to months. These changes correlate with a $1.4-2$ fold increase in the ionizing continuum and exceed $10 \, \sigma$ significance. The variations primarily originate from a low-ionization state ($\rm log \xi = 1.65$) component of the warm absorber. Time-dependent photoionization modelling confirms the sensitivity of this low-ionization component to continuum variations within the Fe UTA band. Local fitting indicates a lower density limit of $&gt;10^{12.3} \, \rm m^{-3}$ at $3 \, \sigma$ statistical uncertainty, with the component located within $0.27 \, \rm pc$. Our findings suggest that this low-ionization component is a potential failed wind candidate.</description>

      <title>Influence of the Galactic Halo on the UHECR Multipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the effects of a giant magnetized halo around the Galaxy on the angular distribution of the arriving ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) observed at Earth. We investigate three injection scenarios for UHECRs, and track them through isotropic turbulent magnetic fields of varying strengths in the Galactic halo. We calculate the resultant dipole and quadrupole amplitudes for the arriving UHECRs detected by an observer in the Galactic plane region. We find that, regardless of the injection scenario considered, when the scattering length of the particles is comparable to the size of the halo, the UHECRs skymap resembles a dipole. However, as the scattering length is increased, the dipolar moment always increases, and the quadrupolar moment increases rapidly for two of the three cases considered. Additionally, the quadrupole amplitude is highlighted to be a key discriminator in discerning the origin of the observed dipole. We conclude that, to understand the origin of the UHECR dipole, one has to measure the strength of the quadrupole amplitude as well.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in astrophysical gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes from proton-proton cross-sections in the GeV to PeV range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of Cosmic Ray (CR) sources represents one of the biggest and long-standing questions in astrophysics. Direct measurements of cosmic rays cannot provide directional information due to their deflection in (extra)galactic magnetic fields. Cosmic-ray interactions at the sources lead to the production of high-energy gamma rays and neutrinos, which, combined in the multimessenger picture, are the key to identifying the origins of CRs and estimating transport properties. While gamma-ray observations alone raise the question of whether their origin is hadronic or leptonic, the observation of high-energy neutrino emission directly points to the presence of CR hadrons. To identify the emission signatures from acceleration and transport effects a proper modeling of those interactions in a transport framework is needed. Significant work has been done to tune the production cross sections to accelerator data and different models exist that put the exact evolution of the Monte-Carlo generated showers into a statistical approach of a probabilistic description of the production of the final states of the showers relevant for astrophysical observations.
  In this work, we present the implementation of different hadronic interaction (HI) models into the publicly available transport code CRPropa. We apply different descriptions of the HI, trained on observational data in different energy regimes to a nearby, giant molecular cloud. In this case, the resulting gamma-ray flux can differ by a factor $\sim 2$ dependent on the choice of the HI model.</description>

      <title>Optical investigation of supernova remnant G206.7+5.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) G206.7+5.9 was recently discovered in the radio band with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The remnant spans about 3.5 in diameter and exhibits bilateral shells. In this work, we present optical spectra of G206.7+5.9 with the Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), and narrow-band (H$\alpha$ and [SII]) images with the 1-m T100 telescope. The filamentary structure seen in H$\alpha$ image shows a clear correlation with the radio emission. We use optical line ratios to determine the physical parameters of G206.7+5.9. The LAMOST spectra reveal large ratios of [SII]/H$\alpha$ $\sim$ (0.61-1.78) and [NII]/H$\alpha$ $\sim$ (0.63-1.92) consistent with that expected for a shock-heated SNR. The emission lines [OI] $\lambda$6300, $\lambda$6363 detected in the spectra also support the presence of shocks. Electron density ($n_{\rm e}$) measurements based on the [SII] $\lambda$6716/$\lambda$6731 ratio suggest densities between 117 and 597 cm$^{-3}$. We estimate the pre-shock cloud density ($n_{\rm c}$) to be approximately 2.6$-$13.3 cm$^{-3}$. We also investigate the archival HI data and have newly identified an expanding gas motion of the HI, whose velocity span is approximately 10 km s$^{-1}$. We conclude that G206.7+5.9 is an SNR exhibiting properties remarkably similar to those seen in Galactic SNRs.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks for Signal Classification in Simulated Gamma-Ray Burst Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the use of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) for identifying signals resembling Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) within simulated astrophysical datasets in the form of light curves. The task addressed here focuses on distinguishing GRB-like signals from background noise in simulated Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) data, the next-generation astrophysical observatory for very high-energy gamma-ray science. QCNNs, a quantum counterpart of classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), leverage quantum principles to process and analyze high-dimensional data efficiently. We implemented a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning technique using the Qiskit framework, with the QCNNs trained on a quantum simulator. Several QCNN architectures were tested, employing different encoding methods such as Data Reuploading and Amplitude encoding. Key findings include that QCNNs achieved accuracy comparable to classical CNNs, often surpassing 90\%, while using fewer parameters, potentially leading to more efficient models in terms of computational resources. A benchmark study further examined how hyperparameters like the number of qubits and encoding methods affected performance, with more qubits and advanced encoding methods generally enhancing accuracy but increasing complexity. QCNNs showed robust performance on time-series datasets, successfully detecting GRB signals with high precision. The research is a pioneering effort in applying QCNNs to astrophysics, offering insights into their potential and limitations. This work sets the stage for future investigations to fully realize the advantages of QCNNs in astrophysical data analysis.</description>

      <title>Detection of extended X-ray emission surrounding PSR B0656+14 with eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission from middle-aged pulsars as revealed recently by several groundbased $\gamma$-ray experiments has strong implication on the transport of high-energy particles in the interstellar medium surrounding those pulsars. The $\gamma$-ray emission is widely believed to be produced by high-energy electrons and positrons accelerated by the pulsar wind nebulae when scattering off the interstellar radiation field via the inverse Compton process. Multiwavelength counterparts of the $\gamma$-ray halos are expected to be present, which are, however, not observed yet. In this work, we report for the first time the detection of extended X-ray emission from $\sim 0.2^{\circ}$ radius region of PSR B0656+14 with eROSITA. The spectrum of the emission can be described by a power-law function with an index of $\sim3.7$. The fluxes decrease with radius faster than the prediction of the particle diffusion and synchrotron radiation in a uniform magnetic field, suggesting the existence of a radial gradient of the magnetic field strength as $\sim r^{-1}$. The magnetic field strength in the X-ray emitting region is constrained to be $4-10~\mu$G.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR Observations of the Neutron Star Low-mass X-ray Binary Serpens X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first contemporaneous NICER and NuSTAR analysis of the low-mass X-ray binary Serpens X-1 obtained in June 2023, performing broadband X-ray spectral analysis modeling of the reprocessed emission with RELXILLNS from $0.4-30$ keV. We test various continuum and background estimation models to ensure that our results do not hinge on the choice of model used and found that the detection of reflection features is independent of the choice of both continuum and background model. The position of the inner accretion disk is consistent with the last stable circular orbit ($R_{\rm in} \leq 1.2$~$R_{ISCO}$) and a low inclination of $i\leq 8.3 ^{\circ}$. Additionally, we investigate the presence of the low energy ($\sim$ 1 keV) Fe L complex in the data from NICER and the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) on XMM-Newton that was previously reported in the literature. We find that the line is at most a 2% feature relative to the reprocessed continuum and are unable to claim a definitive detection for the current dataset. However, we discuss plausible conditions and systems that would increase the likelihood of detecting this feature in the future.</description>

      <title>A new approximation for heavy-lepton neutrino pair processes in simulations of core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new approximation for efficiently and effectively including heavy-lepton neutrino pair-production processes in neutrino transport simulations of core-collapse supernovae. In the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism, the electron neutrinos and anti-neutrinos are the main players in transporting the energy of the cooling PNS to the matter behind the shock. While heavy-lepton neutrinos, $\nu_x$, play a smaller role in the heating of the gain region, they dominate the cooling of the proto-neutron star (PNS) and therefore still play a crucial role in the explosion mechanism. In this study, we explore the impacts of modifications in the transport and formalisms of pair ($\nu_x\bar{\nu}_x$) emission and absorption processes. We quantify the impact in terms of the emergent neutrino signal and the nature of the PNS convection and early cooling. For this, we perform a set of simulations, spherically symmetric and axisymmetric, of a 20 M$_\odot$ progenitor using two different state-of-the-art equations of state (EOS). First and foremost, we show that our new efficient approximation for neutrino pair production matches the results of a full treatment very well. Furthermore, for this progenitor, we show that the impact of the modifications is dependent on the EOS used, as the EOS drives the PNS evolution. The variations we explore, including variations due to the nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung formalism, have a comparatively smaller impact than the EOS has as a whole.</description>

      <title>Theory of neutrino slow flavor evolution. Part II. Space-time evolution of linear instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Slow flavor evolution (defined as driven by neutrino masses and not necessarily ``slow'') is receiving fresh attention in the context of compact astrophysical environments. In Part~I of this series, we have studied the slow-mode dispersion relation following our recently developed analogy to plasma waves. The concept of resonance between flavor waves in the linear regime and propagating neutrinos is the defining feature of this approach. It is best motivated for weak instabilities, which probably is the most relevant regime in self-consistent astrophysical environments because these will try to eliminate the cause of instability. We here go beyond the dispersion relation alone (which by definition applies to infinite media) and consider the group velocities of unstable modes that determines whether the instability relaxes within the region where it first appears (absolute), or away from it (convective). We show that all weak instabilities are convective so that their further evolution is not local. Therefore, studying their consequences numerically in small boxes from given initial conditions may not always be appropriate.</description>

      <title>Greybody factors, reflectionless scattering modes, and echoes of ultracompact horizonless objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a recently discovered connection between the greybody factors of black holes and the ringdown signal, we investigate the greybody factors of ultracompact horizonless objects, also elucidating their connection to echoes. The greybody factor of ultracompact objects features both low-frequency resonances and high-frequency, quasi-reflectionless scattering modes, which become purely reflectionless in the presence of symmetric cavity potentials, as it might be the case for a wormhole. We show that it is these high-frequency (quasi-)reflectionless scattering modes, rather than low-frequency resonances, to be directly responsible for the echoes in the time-domain response of ultracompact objects or of black holes surrounded by matter fields localized at large distances.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Neural Network Surrogate Models: Application to Black Hole Merger Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surrogate models of numerical relativity simulations of merging black holes provide the most accurate tools for gravitational-wave data analysis. Neural network-based surrogates promise evaluation speedups, but their accuracy relies on (often obscure) tuning of settings such as the network architecture, hyperparameters, and the size of the training dataset. We propose a systematic optimization strategy that formalizes setting choices and motivates the amount of training data required. We apply this strategy on NRSur7dq4Remnant, an existing surrogate model for the properties of the remnant of generically precessing binary black hole mergers and construct a neural network version, which we label NRSur7dq4Remnant_NN. The systematic optimization strategy results in a new surrogate model with comparable accuracy, and provides insights into the meaning and role of the various network settings and hyperparameters as well as the structure of the physical process. Moreover, NRSur7dq4Remnant_NN results in evaluation speedups of up to $8$ times on a single CPU and a further improvement of $2,000$ times when evaluated in batches on a GPU. To determine the training set size, we propose an iterative enrichment strategy that efficiently samples the parameter space using much smaller training sets than naive sampling. NRSur7dq4Remnant_NN requires $O(10^4)$ training data, so neural network-based surrogates are ideal for speeding-up models that support such large training datasets, but at the moment cannot directly be applied to numerical relativity catalogs that are $O(10^3)$ in size. The optimization strategy is available through the gwbonsai package.</description>

      <title>A central TDE candidate detected through spectroscopic continuum emission properties in a SDSS blue quasar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, properties of spectroscopic continuum emissions are considered to detect potential tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates among SDSS quasars. After considering the simple blackbody photosphere model applied to describe quasar continuum emissions with parameters of blackbody temperature $T_{BB}$ and blackbody radius $R_{BB}$, SDSS quasars and reported optical TDEs occupy distinct regions in the space of $T_{BB}$ and $R_{BB}$. Then, through the dependence of $R_{BB}$ on $T_{BB}$ for SDSS quasars, 402 outliers in SDSS Stripe82 region can be collected. Among the 402 outliers, the SDSS J2308 at $z=1.16$ is mainly considered, due to its SDSS spectrum observed around the peak brightness of the light curves. With the 7.2-year-long light curves described by theoretical TDE model, the determined $T_{BB}$ and $R_{BB}$ through its spectroscopic continuum emissions are consistent with the TDE model determined values, to support the central TDE. Moreover, considering simulated results on continuum emissions of SDSS quasars around $z\sim1.16$, confidence level higher than 4$\sigma$ can be confirmed that the continuum emissions of SDSS J2308 are not related to normal quasars. Furthermore, accepted CAR process to simulate intrinsic AGN variability, the confidence level higher than $3\sigma$ can be confirmed that the long-term light curves of SDSS J2308 are related to a central TDE. Jointed the probabilities through both spectroscopic and photometric simulations, the confidence level higher than $5\sigma$ can be confirmed to support the central TDE in SDSS J2308.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Milky Way's Dispersion Measure Using FRB and X-ray Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion measures (DMs) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a valuable tool for probing the baryonic content of the intergalactic and the circumgalactic medium of the intervening galaxies along the sightlines. However, interpreting the DMs is complicated by the contributions from the hot gas in and around our Milky Way. This study examines the relationship between DM_MW, derived from localized FRBs, and the Galaxy's hot gas, using X-ray absorption and emission data from O VII and O VIII. We find evidence for a positive correlation between DM_MW and O VII absorption, reflecting contributions from both the disk and halo components. This conclusion is supported by two lines of evidence: (1) No correlation between DM_MW and O VII/O VIII emission, which primarily traces dense disk regions; and (2) the comparison with electron density models, where DM_MW aligns with models that incorporate both disk and halo components but significantly exceeds predictions from pure disk-only models, emphasizing the halo's role. Furthermore, the lack of correlation with O VIII absorption suggests that the primary temperature of the Galaxy's hot gas is likely around 2 x 10^6 K or less, as traced by O VII absorption, while gas at higher temperatures (~3 x 10^6 K to 5 x 10^6 K) is present but less abundant. Our findings provide insights into the Milky Way's gas distribution and improve DM_MW estimates for future cosmological studies.</description>

      <title>The thermal index of neutron-star matter in the virial approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by gravitational wave observations of binary neutron-star mergers, we study the thermal index of low-density, high-temperature dense matter. We use the virial expansion to account for nuclear interaction effects. We focus on the region of validity of the expansion, which reaches $10^{-3}$ fm$^{-3}$ at $T=5$ MeV up to almost saturation density at $T=50$ MeV. In pure neutron matter, we find an analytical expression for the thermal index, and show that it is nearly density- and temperature-independent, within a fraction of a percent of the non-interacting, non-relativistic value of $\Gamma_\text{th} \approx 5/3$. When we incorporate protons, electrons and photons, we find that the density and temperature dependence of the thermal index changes significantly. We predict a smooth transition between an electron-dominated regime with $\Gamma_\text{th} \approx 4/3$ at low densities to a neutron-dominated region with $\Gamma_\text{th} \approx 5/3$ at high densities. This behavior is by and large independent of proton fraction and is not affected by nuclear interactions in the region where the virial expansion converges. We model this smooth transition analytically and provide a simple but accurate parametrization of the inflection point between these regimes. When compared to tabulated realistic models of the thermal index, we find an overall agreement at high temperatures that weakens for colder matter. The discrepancies can be attributed to the missing contributions of nuclear clusters. The virial approximation provides a clear and physically intuitive framework for understanding the thermal properties of dense matter, offering a computationally efficient solution that makes it particularly well-suited for the regimes relevant to neutron star binary remnants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extract the equation of state for hot quark matter from a holographic $2+1$ flavor QCD model, which could form the core of a stable compact star. By adding a thin hadron shell, a new type of hybrid star is constructed. With the temperature serving as a parameter, the EoS varies and we obtain stable stars with the maximum mass of around 23 to 30 solar masses, and the compactness around $0.1$. The I-Love-Q-C relations are further discussed, and compared with the neutron star cases. These compact stars are candidates for black hole mimickers, which could be observed by gravitational waves and distinguished by properties like nonzero tidal Love number and electromagnetic signals.</description>

      <title>Revealing Physical Properties of a Tidal Disruption Event: iPTF16fnl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal disruption event (TDE) iPTF16fnl shows a relatively low optical flare with observationally very weak X-ray emission and the spectroscopic property that the helium emission line from the source dominates over the hydrogen emission line at early times. We explore these observed signatures by calculating spectral emission lines with the publicly available code, CLOUDY. We estimate five physical parameters by fitting the observed optical UV spectra on multiple days to a theoretical model of a steady-state, slim disk with a spherical outflow. The resultant key parameters among them are black hole mass $M_{\bullet} \sim 4.43 \times 10^5 M_{\odot}$, stellar mass $M_{\star} \sim 0.46 M_{\odot}$, and wind velocity $v_{\rm w} \sim 5382.7~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$. The disk-wind model also estimates the radiative efficiency to be $0.01\lesssim\eta\lesssim0.04$ over the observational time, resulting in the disk being radiatively inefficient. In our CLOUDY model, the filling factor of the wind is also estimated to be 0.8, suggesting that the wind is moderately clumpy. We reveal that the helium-to-hydrogen number density ratio of the wind lies between 0.1 and 0.15, which is nearly the same as the solar case, suggesting the tidally disrupted star is originally a main sequence star. Because the optical depth of the helium line is lower than the hydrogen line by two orders of magnitude, the helium line is significantly optically thinner than the hydrogen line. Consequently, our results indicate that the helium line luminosity dominates the hydrogen line luminosity due to the optical depth effect despite a small helium-to-hydrogen number density ratio value.</description>

      <title>The JADES Transient Survey: Discovery and Classification of Supernovae in the JADES Deep Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05060v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) is a multi-cycle JWST program that has taken among the deepest near-/mid-infrared images to date (down to $\sim$30 ABmag) over $\sim$25 arcmin$^2$ in the GOODS-S field in two sets of observations with one year of separation. This presented the first opportunity to systematically search for transients, mostly supernovae (SNe), out to $z$$&gt;$2. We found 79 SNe: 38 at $z$$&lt;$2, 23 at 2$&lt;$$z$$&lt;$3, 8 at 3$&lt;$$z$$&lt;$4, 7 at 4$&lt;$$z$$&lt;$5, and 3 with undetermined redshifts, where the redshifts are predominantly based on spectroscopic or highly reliable JADES photometric redshifts of the host galaxies. At this depth, the detection rate is $\sim$1-2 per arcmin$^2$ per year, demonstrating the power of JWST as a supernova discovery machine. We also conducted multi-band follow-up NIRCam observations of a subset of the SNe to better constrain their light curves and classify their types. Here, we present the survey, sample, search parameters, spectral energy distributions (SEDs), light curves, and classifications. Even at $z$$\geq$2, the NIRCam data quality is high enough to allow SN classification via multi-epoch light-curve fitting with confidence. The multi-epoch SN sample includes a Type Ia SN at $z_{\mathrm{spec}}$$=$2.90, Type IIP SN at $z_{\mathrm{spec}}$$=$3.61, and a Type Ic-BL SN at $z_{\mathrm{spec}}$$=$2.83. We also found that two $z$$\sim$16 galaxy candidates from the first imaging epoch were actually transients that faded in the second epoch, illustrating the possibility that moderate/high-redshift SNe could mimic high-redshift dropout galaxies.</description>

      <title>Dynamical confirmation of a black hole in the X-ray transient Swift J1727.8-1613</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13310v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The X-ray transient Swift J1727.8-1613 ended its 10-month discovery outburst on June of 2024, when it reached an optical brightness comparable to pre-discovery magnitudes. With the aim of performing a dynamical study, we launched an optical spectroscopy campaign with the GTC telescope. We detect the companion star and construct its radial velocity curve, yielding a binary orbital period of Porb = 10.8038 +- 0.0010 h and a radial velocity semi-amplitude of K2 = 390 +- 4 km/s. This results in a mass function of f(M1)=2.77 +- 0.09 Msun. Combined with constraints on the binary inclination, it sets a lower limit to the compact object mass of M1 &gt; 3.12 +- 0.10 Msun, dynamically confirming the black hole nature of the accretor. Comparison of the average spectrum in the rest frame of the companion with synthetic stellar templates supports a K4V donor partially veiled (74%) by the accretion disc. A refined distance measurement of 3.7+- 0.3 kpc, together with the astrometric proper motion and the systemic velocity derived from the radial velocity curve (-181 +-4 km/s), supports a natal kick velocity of 220 +40 -50 km/s, at the upper end of the observed distribution.</description>

      <title>Tracking the jet-like corona of black hole Swift J1727.8-1613 during a flare state through Type-C quasi-periodic oscillations</title>

Abstract: Type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in black hole X-ray transients typically manifest in the low-hard and hard-intermediate states. This study presents a detailed spectral and temporal analysis of the black hole candidate Swift J1727.8-1613 using NICER observations from August and September 2023, with a focus on the first flare period. The time-averaged spectra, along with the rms and phase-lag spectra of the QPOs, were jointly fitted using the time-dependent Comptonization model vkompthdk to examine the geometry of the corona during this flare. The results offer a comprehensive view of how the QPO and its associated spectral properties evolve over time. Type-C QPOs were detected, with the centroid frequency increasing from 0.33 Hz to 2.63 Hz, and the frequency elevated when this outburst entered the flare state. Correlations between spectral and temporal properties suggest that type-C QPOs are primarily modulated by Lense-Thirring precession. Leveraging simultaneous radio observations that indicate discrete jet ejections, we have, for the first time, proposed a scenario describing the co-evolution of the disk-corona-jet during a flare (~ 3 days), partially supported by polarization data in soft gamma-ray band from INTEGRAL/IBIS. A phenomenological analysis of the corona scenario was also conducted.</description>

      <title>On the Temporal Variability of the Galactic Multi-TeV Interstellar Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the GALPROP cosmic ray (CR) framework to model the Galactic CR distributions and associated non-thermal diffuse emissions up to PeV energies. We consider ensembles of discrete, finite lifetime CR sources, e.g.\ supernova remnants (SNRs), for a range of creation rates and lifetimes. We find that global properties of the CR sources are likely not directly recoverable from the current `snapshot' of the historic injection and propagation of CRs within the Galaxy that are provided by the data. We show that models for the diffuse $\gamma$ rays based on the discrete/time-dependent scenarios we consider are able to explain LHAASO very-/ultra-high energy (VHE/UHE) $\gamma$-ray data with up to 50\% contribution by unresolved leptonic sources at the highest energies. Over the models that we consider, variations in the diffuse VHE emissions can be $\sim$25\%, which is comparable to those for steady-state models that we investigated in earlier work. Such variations due to the discrete/finite nature of the CR sources are an important factor that are necessary to construct accurate physical models of the diffuse emissions from the Galaxy at VHE/UHEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs are one of the densest form of matter following neutron star and black holes. A typical white dwarf is as massive as our sun has radius comparable to the earth. This paper reviewed the Fermi gas model Equation of State of white dwarfs and numerical computation of mass-radius and pressure density profile. A section in brief has been included for the calculation of average speed of electrons in the white dwarf environment.</description>

      <title>High Frequency Gravitational Wave Bounds from Galactic Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-Frequency Gravitational Waves (HFGWs) constitute a unique window on the early Universe as well as exotic astrophysical objects. If the current gravitational wave experiments are more dedicated to the low frequency regime, the graviton conversion into photons in a strong magnetic field constitutes a powerful tool to probe HFGWs. In this paper, we show that neutron stars, due to their extreme magnetic field, are a perfect laboratory to study the conversion of HFGWs into photons. Using realistic models for the galactic neutron star population, we calculate for the first time the expected photon flux induced by the conversion of an isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background in the magnetosphere of the ensemble of neutron stars present in the Milky Way. We compare this photon flux to the observed one from several telescopes and derive upper limits on the stochastic gravitational wave background in the frequency range $10^8 \, \rm Hz$ - $10^{25}\, \rm Hz$. We find our limits to be competitive in the frequency range $10^8 \, \rm Hz$ - $10^{15}\, \rm Hz$.</description>

      <title>SIRIUS: Identifying Metal-poor Stars Enriched by a Single Supernova in a Dwarf Galaxy Cosmological Zoom-in Simulation Resolving Individual Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal-poor stars enriched by a single supernova (mono-enriched stars) are direct proof (and provide valuable probes) of supernova nucleosynthesis. Photometric and spectroscopic observations have shown that metal-poor stars have a wide variety of chemical compositions; the star's chemical composition reflects the nucleosynthesis process(es) that occurred before the star's formation. While the identification of mono-enriched stars enables us to study the ejecta properties of a single supernova, the fraction of mono-enriched stars among metal-poor stars remains unknown. Here we identify mono-enriched stars in a dwarf galaxy cosmological zoom-in simulation resolving individual massive stars. We find that the fraction of mono-enriched stars is higher for lower metallicity, stars with [Fe/H] $&lt; -2.5$. The percentages of mono-enriched stars are 11% at [Fe/H] = $-$5.0 and 1% at [Fe/H] = $-$2.5, suggesting that most metal-poor stars are affected by multiple supernovae. We also find that mono-enriched stars tend to be located near the center of the simulated dwarf. Such regions will be explored in detail in upcoming surveys such as the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) on the Subaru telescope.</description>
