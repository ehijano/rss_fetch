      <title>A Data-Driven Framework for Koopman Semigroup Estimation in Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Stochastic Dynamic Mode Decomposition (SDMD), a novel data-driven framework for approximating the Koopman semigroup in stochastic dynamical systems. Unlike existing methods, SDMD explicitly incorporates sampling time into its approximation, ensuring numerical stability and precision. By directly approximating the Koopman semigroup instead of the generator, SDMD avoids computationally expensive matrix exponential computations, which offers a more efficient and practical pathway for analyzing stochastic dynamics. The framework further integrates neural networks to automate basis selection, which reduces the reliance on manual intervention while maintaining computational efficiency. Rigorous theoretical guarantees, including convergence in the large data limit, zero-limit of sampling time, and large dictionary size, establish the method's reliability. Numerical experiments on canonical stochastic systems validate SDMD's effectiveness in approximating eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the stochastic Koopman operator.</description>

      <title>Brownian approximation of dynamical systems by Stein's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt Stein's method of diffusion approximations, developed by Barbour, to the study of chaotic dynamical systems. We establish an error bound in the functional central limit theorem with respect to an integral probability metric of smooth test functions under a functional correlation decay bound. For systems with a sufficiently fast polynomial rate of correlation decay, the error bound is of order $O(N^{-1/2})$, under an additional condition on the linear growth of variance. Applications include a family of interval maps with neutral fixed points and unbounded derivatives, and two-dimensional dispersing Sinai billiards.</description>

      <title>Phase portraits of a family of Kolmogorov systems depending on six parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a general $3$-dimensional Lotka-Volterra system with a rational first integral of degree two of the form $H=x^i y^j z^k$. The restriction of this Lotka-Volterra system to each surface $H(x,y,z)=h$ varying $h\in \mathbb{R}$ provide Kolmogorov systems. With the additional assumption that they have a Darboux invariant of the form $x^\ell y^m e^{st}$ they reduce to the Kolmogorov systems \begin{equation*} \begin{split} \dot{x}&amp;=x \left( a_0- \mu (c_1 x + c_2 z^2 + c_3 z)\right),\\ \dot{z}&amp;=z\left( c_0+ c_1 x + c_2 z^2 + c_3 z\right). \end{split} \end{equation*} In this paper we classify the phase portraits in the Poincar\'e disc of all these Kolmogorov systems which depend on six parameters.</description>

Abstract: We classify the global dynamics of a family of Kolmogorov systems depending on three parameters which has ecological meaning as it modelizes a predator-prey system. We obtain all their topologically distinct global phase portraits in the positive quadrant of the Poincar\'e disc, so we provide all the possible distinct dynamics of these systems.</description>

      <title>On the $L^q$ dimension of stationary measures for M\"{o}bius iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $L^q$ dimension $D(\nu,q)\ (q&gt;1)$ of stationary measures $\nu$ for M\"{o}bius iterated function systems on $\mathbb{R}$ satisfying the strongly Diophantine condition, and try the extension of Shmerkin's result \cite[Theorem 6.6]{Shm19}. As the result, we show that there is the dichotomy: the $L^q$ spectrum $\tau(\nu,q)=(q-1)D(\nu,q)$ is equal to the desired value $\min\{\widetilde{\tau}(\nu,q),q-1\}$ for any $q&gt;1$, where $\widetilde{\tau}(\nu,q)$ is the zero of the canonical pressure function, or there exist $q_0&gt;1$ and $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ such that $\tau(\nu,q)=\min\{\widetilde{\tau}(\nu,q),q-1\}$ for $1&lt;q&lt;q_0$ and $\tau(\nu,q)=\alpha q$ for $q\geq q_0$. In addition, we give examples of M\"{o}bius iterated function systems which show the latter case by giving an affirmative answer to Solomyak's question \cite[Question 2]{Sol24}.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model of CAR-T cell therapy in combination with chemotherapy for malignant gliomas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and interactions between combined chemotherapy and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) cells therapy and malignant gliomas (MG). MG is one of the most common primary brain tumor, with high resistance to therapy and unfavorable prognosis. Here, we develop a mathematical model that describes the application of chemo- and CAR-T cell therapies and the dynamics of sensitive and resistant populations of tumor cells. This model is a five-dimensional dynamical system with impulsive inputs corresponding to clinical administration of chemo- and immunotherapy. We provide a proof of non-negativeness of solutions of the proposed model for non-negative initial data. We demonstrate that if we apply both therapies only once, the trajectories will be attracted to an invariant surface that corresponds to the tumor carrying capacity. On the other hand, if we apply both treatments constantly, we find regions of the parameter where the tumor is eradicated. Moreover, we study applications of different combinations of the above treatments in order to find an optimal combination at the population level. To this aim, we generate a population of $10^{4}$ virtual patients with the model parameters uniformly distributed in the medically relevant ranges and perform \emph{in silico} trials with different combinations of treatments. We obtain optimal protocols for several different relations of tumor growth rates between sensitive and drug resistant cells. We demonstrate that the tumor growth rate, efficacy of chemotherapy, and tumor immunosuppression are the parameters that mostly impact survival time in \emph{in silico} trials. We believe that our results provide new theoretical insights to guide the design of clinical trials for MG therapies.</description>

      <title>On a Problem of Kac concerning Anisotropic Lacunary Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a lacunary sequence $(n_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, arbitrary positive weights $(c_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ that satisfy a Lindeberg-Feller condition, and a function $f: \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{R}$ whose Fourier coefficients $\hat{f_k}$ decay at rate $\frac{1}{k^{1/2 + \varepsilon}}$, we prove central limit theorems for $\sum_{k \leq N}c_kf(n_kx)$, provided $(n_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ satisfies a Diophantine condition that is necessary in general. This addresses a question raised by M. Kac [Ann. of Math., 1946].</description>

      <title>Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics and Koopman operators with Shallow Recurrent Decoder Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal modeling of real-world data poses a challenging problem due to inherent high dimensionality, measurement noise, and expensive data collection procedures. In this paper, we present Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics with SHallow REcurrent Decoder networks (SINDy-SHRED), a method to jointly solve the sensing and model identification problems with simple implementation, efficient computation, and robust performance. SINDy-SHRED uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model the temporal sequence of sensor measurements along with a shallow decoder network to reconstruct the full spatiotemporal field from the latent state space using only a few available sensors. Our proposed algorithm introduces a SINDy-based regularization; beginning with an arbitrary latent state space, the dynamics of the latent space progressively converges to a SINDy-class functional, provided the projection remains within the set. In restricting SINDy to a linear model, the architecture produces a Koopman-SHRED model which enforces a linear latent space dynamics. We conduct a systematic experimental study including synthetic PDE data, real-world sensor measurements for sea surface temperature, and direct video data. With no explicit encoder, SINDy-SHRED and Koopman-SHRED enable efficient training with minimal hyperparameter tuning and laptop-level computing; further, it demonstrates robust generalization in a variety of applications with minimal to no hyperparameter adjustments. Finally, the interpretable SINDy and Koopman models of latent state dynamics enables accurate long-term video predictions, achieving state-of-the-art performance and outperforming all baseline methods considered, including Convolutional LSTM, PredRNN, ResNet, and SimVP.</description>

      <title>Synchronization by noise for traveling pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider synchronization by noise for stochastic partial differential equations which support traveling pulse solutions, such as the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. We show that any two pulse-like solutions which start from different positions but are forced by the same realization of a multiplicative noise, converge to each other in probability on a time scale $\sigma^{-2} \ll t \ll \exp(\sigma^{-2})$, where $\sigma$ is the noise amplitude. The noise is assumed to be Gaussian, white in time, colored and periodic in space, and non-degenerate only in the lowest Fourier mode. The proof uses the method of phase reduction, which allows one to describe the dynamics of the stochastic pulse only in terms of its position. The position is shown to synchronize building upon existing results, and the validity of the phase reduction allows us to transfer the synchronization back to the full solution.</description>

      <title>Systolic $S^1$-index and characterization of non-smooth Zoll convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the systolic $S^1$-index of a convex body as the Fadell-Rabinowitz index of the space of centralized generalized systoles associated with its boundary. We show that this index is a symplectic invariant. Using the systolic $S^1$-index, we propose a definition of generalized Zoll convex bodies and prove that this definition is equivalent to the usual one in the smooth setting. Moreover, we show how the generalized Zoll convex bodies can be characterized in the term of their Gutt-Hutchings capacities. Additionally, we show that the space of generalized Zoll convex bodies is closed in the space of all convex bodies. As a corollary, we establish that if the interior of a convex body is symplectomorphic to the interior of a ball, then such a convex body must be generalized Zoll, and in particular Zoll if the boundary of that convex body is smooth. We also discuss some examples.</description>

      <title>Synchronizing Dynamical Systems: Finitely presented systems and Ruelle algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main goals of the present paper are to determine the structure of the $C^\ast$-algebras associated to a finitely presented system and to develop the basic theory of the Ruelle algebras associated to a general synchronizing system. The later is related to the former in the sense that we show that Ruelle algebras associated to a finitely presented system are explicitly related to the Smale space case. Nevertheless, we give an example of a sofic shift where the Ruelle algebras are not Poincare dual (whereas this duality holds in the Smale space case). The relevant $C^\ast$-algebras are the synchronizing heteroclinic algebras that were introduced in our previous work on synchronizing systems. They are very much related to previous work of Thomsen, who in turn was building on work of Ruelle, Putnam, and Spielberg.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the regularity of the Lyapunov exponent for quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger cocycles with $C^2$ cos-type potentials, large coupling constants, and a fixed Diophantine frequency. We obtain the absolute continuity of the Lyapunov exponent. Moreover, we prove the Lyapunov exponent is $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuous. Furthermore, for any given $r\in (\frac12, 1)$, we can find some energy in the spectrum where the local regularity of the Lyapunov exponent is between $(r-\epsilon)$-H\"older continuity and $(r+\epsilon)$-H\"older continuity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nonsmooth fold is where an equilibrium or limit cycle of a nonsmooth dynamical system hits a switching manifold and collides and annihilates with another solution of the same type. We show that beyond the bifurcation the leading-order truncation to the system in general has no bounded invariant set. This is proved for boundary equilibrium bifurcations of Filippov systems, hybrid systems, and continuous piecewise-smooth ODEs, and grazing-type events for which the truncated form is a continuous piecewise-linear map. The omitted higher-order terms are expected to be incapable of altering the local dynamics qualitatively, implying the system has no local invariant set on one side of a nonsmooth fold, and we demonstrate this with an example. Thus if the equilibrium or limit cycle is attracting the bifurcation causes the local attractor of the system to tip to a new state. The results also help explain global aspects of the bifurcation structures of the truncated systems.</description>

      <title>Positive entropy actions by higher-rank lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study smooth actions by lattices in higher-rank simple Lie groups. Assuming one element of the action acts with positive topological entropy, we prove a number of new rigidity results. For lattices in $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ acting on $n$-manifolds, if the action has positive topological entropy we show the lattice must be commensurable with $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{Z})$. Moreover, such actions admit an absolutely continuous probability measure with positive metric entropy; adapting arguments by Katok and Rodriguez Hertz, we show such actions are measurably conjugate to affine actions on (infra-)tori.
  In a main technical argument, we study families of probability measures invariant under sub-actions of the induced action by the ambient Lie group on an associated fiber bundle. To control entropy properties of such measures when passing to limits, in the appendix we establish certain upper semicontinuity of fiber entropy under weak-$*$ convergence, adapting classical results of Yomdin and Newhouse.</description>

      <title>New algebras of functions on topological groups arising from $G$-spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:math/0608575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a topological group G we introduce the algebra SUC(G) of strongly uniformly continuous functions. It contains the algebra WAP(G) of weakly almost periodic functions as well as the algebras LE(G) and Asp(G) of locally equicontinuous and Asplund functions respectively. For the Polish groups of order preserving homeomorphisms of the unit interval and of isometries of the Urysohn space of diameter 1, SUC(G) is trivial. We study the Roelcke algebra (= UC(G) = right and left uniformly continuous functions) and SUC compactifications of the groups S(N), of permutations of a countable set, and H(C), the group of homeomorphisms of the Cantor set. For the first group we show that WAP(G)=SUC(G)=UC(G) and also provide a concrete description of the corresponding metrizable (in fact Cantor) semitopological semigroup compactification. For the second group, in contrast, we show that SUC(G) is properly contained in UC(G) and for this group UC(G) does not yield a right topological semigroup compactification. We introduce the notion of fixed point on a class P of flows (P-fpp) and study in particular groups which are SUC-amenable and groups with the SUC-fpp (SUC-extreme amenability). We show that every Polish group G with metrizable M(G) is SUC-amenable and if, in addition, M(G) is proximal, then G is SUC-extremely amenable.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity of inhomogeneous Markov processes under general criteria</title>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with ergodic properties of inhomogeneous Markov processes. Since the transition probabilities depend on initial times, the existing methods to obtain invariant measures for homogeneous Markov processes are not applicable straightforwardly. We impose some appropriate conditions under which invariant measure families for inhomogeneous Markov processes can be studied. Specifically, the existence of invariant measure families is established by either a generalization of the classical Krylov-Bogolyubov method or a Lyapunov criterion. Moreover, the uniqueness and exponential ergodicity are demonstrated under a contraction assumption of the transition probabilities on a large set. Finally, three examples, including Markov chains, diffusion processes and storage processes, are analyzed to illustrate the practicality of our method.</description>

      <title>Growth of groups with incompressible elements, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the class of groups of bounded type from tile inflations. These tile inflations also determine some automata describing the groups. In the case when the automata are stationary, we show that if the set of incompressible elements of a group in this class is finite, then this group has subexponential growth with a bounded power in the exponent. Then we describe some examples with certain special structures of orbital graphs and give explicit ways to find the upper bounds for the growth functions of these groups.</description>

      <title>Deep polytopic autoencoders for low-dimensional linear parameter-varying approximations and nonlinear feedback design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polytopic autoencoders provide low-di\-men\-sion\-al parametrizations of states in a polytope. For nonlinear PDEs, this is readily applied to low-dimensional linear parameter-varying (LPV) approximations as they have been exploited for efficient nonlinear controller design via series expansions of the solution to the state-dependent Riccati equation. In this work, we develop a polytopic autoencoder for control applications and show how it improves on standard linear approaches in view of LPV approximations of nonlinear systems. We discuss how the particular architecture enables exact representation of target states and higher order series expansions of the nonlinear feedback law at little extra computational effort in the online phase and how the linear though high-dimensional and nonstandard Lyapunov equations are efficiently computed during the offline phase. In a numerical study, we illustrate the procedure and how this approach can reliably outperform the standard linear-quadratic regulator design.</description>

      <title>The role of edge states for early-warning of tipping points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tipping points (TP) are often described as low-dimensional bifurcations, and are associated with early-warning signals (EWS) due to critical slowing down (CSD). CSD is an increase in amplitude and correlation of noise-induced fluctuations away from a reference attractor as the TP is approached. But for high-dimensional systems it is not obvious which variables or observables would display the critical dynamics and carry CSD. Many variables may display no CSD, or show changes in variability not related to a TP. It is thus helpful to identify beforehand which observables are relevant for a given TP. Here we propose this may be achieved by knowledge of an unstable edge state that separates the reference from an alternative attractor that remains after the TP. This is because stochastic fluctuations away from the reference attractor are preferentially directed towards the edge state along a most likely path (the instanton). As the TP is approached the edge state and reference attractor typically become closer, and the fluctuations can evolve further along the instanton. This can be exploited to find observables with substantial CSD, which we demonstrate using conceptual dynamical systems models and climate model simulations of a collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).</description>
