      <title>Controller Adaptation via Learning Solutions of Contextual Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a framework for adapting the controller's parameters based on learning optimal solutions from contextual black-box optimization problems. We consider a class of control design problems for dynamical systems operating in different environments or conditions represented by contextual parameters. The overarching goal is to identify the controller parameters that maximize the controlled system's performance, given different realizations of the contextual parameters. We formulate a contextual Bayesian optimization problem in which the solution is actively learned using Gaussian processes to approximate the controller adaptation strategy. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework with a simulation-to-real example. We learn the optimal weighting strategy of a model predictive control for connected and automated vehicles interacting with human-driven vehicles from simulations and then deploy it in a real-time experiment.</description>

      <title>Almost Global Asymptotic Trajectory Tracking for Fully-Actuated Mechanical Systems on Homogeneous Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the design of tracking controllers that drive a mechanical system's state asymptotically towards a reference trajectory. Motivated by aerospace and robotics applications, we consider fully-actuated systems evolving on the broad class of homogeneous spaces (encompassing all vector spaces, Lie groups, and spheres of any dimension). In this setting, the transitive action of a Lie group on the configuration manifold enables an intrinsic description of the tracking error as an element of the state space, even in the absence of a group structure on the configuration manifold itself (e.g., for $\mathbb{S}^2$). Such an error state facilitates the design of a generalized control policy depending smoothly on state and time that drives this geometric tracking error to a designated origin from almost every initial condition, thereby guaranteeing almost global convergence to the reference trajectory. Moreover, the proposed controller simplifies naturally when specialized to a Lie group or the $n$-sphere. In summary, we propose a unified, intrinsic controller guaranteeing almost global asymptotic trajectory tracking for fully-actuated mechanical systems evolving on a broader class of manifolds. We apply the method to an axisymmetric satellite and an omnidirectional aerial robot.</description>

      <title>Power-Flow-Embedded Projection Conic Matrix Completion for Low-Observable Distribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A low-observable distribution system has insufficient measurements for conventional weighted least square state estimators. Matrix completion state estimators have been suggested, but their computational times could be prohibitive. To resolve this problem, a novel and efficient power-flow-embedded projection conic matrix completion method customized for low-observable distribution systems is proposed in this letter. This method can yield more accurate state estimations (2-fold improvement) in a much shorter time (5% or less) than other methods. Case studies on different-scale systems have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed method when applied to low-observable distribution system state estimation problems.</description>

      <title>Age of Computing: A Metric of Computation Freshness in Communication and Computation Cooperative Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In communication and computation cooperative networks (3CNs), timely computation is crucial but not always guaranteed. There is a strong demand for computational tasks to be processed at computational nodes as timely as possible. However, a measure of timeliness in computation is lacking. In this letter, we introduce the novel concept, Age of Computing, to capture computation freshness in 3CNs. We develop two methods for calculating this metric, applicable to a wide range of 3CNs. These calculations are applied to a queue-theoretic system comprising a source and a computational node, resulting in the derivation of two expressions for the AoC. Utilizing these expressions, we establish an upper bound and a tight lower bound. Subsequently, we illustrate two fundamental tradeoffs in M/M/1 systems: the communication-computation tradeoff, which arises from the utilization of the computation power under the joint influence of communication and computation efficiency, and the AoC-delay tradeoff, rooted in the fact that AoC assesses comprehensive and system-wide computation freshness while delay measures instantaneous and individual task computation freshness. While our models are simpler than their real-world counterparts, we believe the insights gained provide a valuable starting point for understanding computation freshness in 3CNs.</description>

      <title>Correlation analysis technique of key parameters for transformer material inspection based on FP-tree and knowledge graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the key equipment in the distribution system, the distribution transformer directly affects the reliability of the user power supply. The probability of accidents occurring in the operation of transformer equipment is high, so it has become a focus of material inspection in recent years. However, the large amount of raw data from sample testing is not being used effectively. Given the above problems, this paper aims to mine the relationship between the unqualified distribution transformer inspection items by using the association rule algorithm based on the distribution transformer inspection data collected from 2017 to 2021 and sorting out the key inspection items. At the same time, the unqualified judgment basis of the relevant items is given, and the internal relationship between the inspection items is clarified to a certain extent. Furthermore, based on material and equipment inspection reports, correlations between failed inspection items, and expert knowledge, the knowledge graph of material equipment inspection management is constructed in the graph database Neo4j. The experimental results show that the FP-Growth method performs significantly better than the Apriori method and can accurately assess the relationship between failed distribution transformer inspection items. Finally, the knowledge graph network is visualized to provide a systematic knowledge base for material inspection, which is convenient for knowledge query and management. This method can provide a scientific guidance program for operation and maintenance personnel to do equipment maintenance and also offers a reference for the state evaluation of other high-voltage equipment.</description>

      <title>Sampling Model for Grid Material Inspection Based on Analytic Hierarchy Process with Absolute Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of power grid equipment forms the material foundation for the safety of the large power grid. Ensuring the quality of equipment entering the grid is a core task in material management. Currently, the inspection of incoming materials involves the generation of sampling plans, sampling, sealing, sample delivery, and testing. Due to the lack of a comprehensive control system and effective control measures, it is not possible to trace the execution process of business operations afterward. This inability to trace hampers the investigation of testing issues and risk control, as it lacks effective data support. Additionally, a significant amount of original record information for key parameters in the testing process, which is based on sampling operation standards, has not been effectively utilized. To address these issues, we conduct researches on key monitoring technologies in the typical material inspection process based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and analyze the key parameters in inspection results. For purpose of complete the above tasks, this paper investigates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms for quality prediction in material equipment based on key inspection parameters. In summary, this paper aims to provide professional and reliable quality data support for various business processes within the company, including material procurement, engineering construction, and equipment operation.</description>

      <title>Fault Recovery and Transient Stability of Grid-Forming Converters Equipped with Current Saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) experience large grid disturbances (e.g., short-circuit faults), the current limiter may be triggered and GFM IBRs enter the current saturation mode, inducing nonlinear dynamical behaviors and imposing great challenges to the post-disturbance transient angle stability. This paper presents a systematic study to reveal the fault recovery behaviors of a GFM IBR and identify the risk of instability. The impact of the angle of the magnitude-saturated current on the post-fault recovery and transient stability is also investigated. The selection of the angle of magnitude-saturated current significantly influences the post-fault behaviors while a few additional dynamical conditions that have a substantial impact are also identified. It is found that the system may follow multiple post-fault recovery trajectories depending on those conditions: 1) Convergence to the normal stable equilibrium point (SEP), 2) convergence to the saturated stable equilibrium point (SSEP), and 3) divergence (instability). To examine the models' accuracy, several cases are simulated.</description>

      <title>Formal Verification of Unknown Stochastic Systems via Non-parametric Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel data-driven method for formal verification is proposed to study complex systems operating in safety-critical domains. The proposed approach is able to formally verify discrete-time stochastic dynamical systems against temporal logic specifications only using observation samples and without the knowledge of the model, and provide a probabilistic guarantee on the satisfaction of the specification. We first propose the theoretical results for using non-parametric estimation to estimate an asymptotic upper bound for the \emph{Lipschitz constant} of the stochastic system, which can determine a finite abstraction of the system. Our results prove that the asymptotic convergence rate of the estimation is $O(n^{-\frac{1}{3+d}})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the system and $n$ is the data scale. We then construct interval Markov decision processes using two different data-driven methods, namely non-parametric estimation and empirical estimation of transition probabilities, to perform formal verification against a given temporal logic specification. Multiple case studies are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Stability-Certified On-Policy Data-Driven LQR via Recursive Learning and Policy Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a data-driven framework to solve Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problems when the dynamics is unknown, with the additional challenge of providing stability certificates for the overall learning and control scheme. Specifically, in the proposed on-policy learning framework, the control input is applied to the actual (unknown) linear system while iteratively optimized. We propose a learning and control procedure, termed RELEARN LQR, that combines a recursive least squares method with a direct policy search based on the gradient method. The resulting scheme is analyzed by modeling it as a feedback-interconnected nonlinear dynamical system. A Lyapunov-based approach, exploiting averaging and singular perturbations theory for nonlinear systems, allows us to provide formal stability guarantees for the whole interconnected scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is corroborated by numerical simulations, where RELEARN LQR is deployed on an aircraft control problem, with both static and drifting parameters.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Links between the Fundamental Lemma and Kernel Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizations and variations of the fundamental lemma by Willems et al. are an active topic of recent research. In this note, we explore and formalize the links between kernel regression and known nonlinear extensions of the fundamental lemma. Applying a transformation to the usual linear equation in Hankel matrices, we arrive at an alternative implicit kernel representation of the system trajectories while keeping the requirements on persistency of excitation. We show that this representation is equivalent to the solution of a specific kernel regression problem. We explore the possible structures of the underlying kernel as well as the system classes to which they correspond.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Automated Vehicle Platooning Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated vehicle (AV) platooning has the potential to improve the safety, operational, and energy efficiency of surface transportation systems by limiting or eliminating human involvement in the driving tasks. The theoretical validity of the AV platooning strategies has been established and practical applications are being tested under real-world conditions. The emergence of sensors, communication, and control strategies has resulted in rapid and constant evolution of AV platooning strategies. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art knowledge in AV platooning using a five-component platooning framework, which includes vehicle model, information-receiving process, information flow topology, spacing policy, and controller and discuss the advantages and limitations of the components. Based on the discussion about existing strategies and associated limitations, potential future research directions are presented.</description>

      <title>Exploiting polar symmetry in designing equivariant observers for vision-based motion estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating camera motion from image sequences poses a significant challenge in computer vision and robotics. Many computer vision methods first compute the essential matrix associated with a motion and then extract orientation and normalized translation as inputs to pose estimation, reconstructing the scene scale (that is unobservable in the epipolar construction) from separate information. In this paper, we design a continuous-time filter that exploits the same perspective by using the epipolar constraint to define pseudo-measurements. We propose a novel polar symmetry on the pose of the camera that makes these measurements equivariant. This allows us to apply recent results from equivariant systems theory to estimating pose. We provide a novel explicit persistence of excitation condition to characterize observability of the full pose, ensuring reconstruction of the scale parameter that is not directly observable in the epipolar construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven control benefits from rich datasets, but constructing such datasets becomes challenging when gathering data is limited. We consider an offline experiment design approach to gathering data where we design a control input to collect data that will most improve the performance of a feedback controller. We show how such a control-oriented approach can be used in a setting with linear dynamics and quadratic objective and, through design of a gradient estimator, solve the problem via stochastic gradient descent. We contrast our method with a classical A-optimal experiment design approach and numerically demonstrate that our method outperforms A-optimal design in terms of improving control performance.</description>

      <title>Sparse dynamic network reconstruction through L1-regularization of a Lyapunov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important problem in many areas of science is that of recovering interaction networks from simultaneous time-series of many interacting dynamical processes. A common approach is to use the elements of the correlation matrix or its inverse as proxies of the interaction strengths, but the reconstructed networks are necessarily undirected. Transfer entropy methods have been proposed to reconstruct directed networks but the reconstructed network lacks information about interaction strengths. We propose a network reconstruction method that inherits the best of the two approaches by reconstructing a directed weighted network from noisy data under the assumption that the network is sparse and the dynamics are governed by a linear (or weakly-nonlinear) stochastic dynamical system. The two steps of our method are i) constructing an (infinite) family of candidate networks by solving the covariance matrix Lyapunov equation for the state matrix and ii) using L1-regularization to select a sparse solution. We further show how to use prior information on the (non)existence of a few directed edges to drastically improve the quality of the reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Blockchain-Enhanced UAV Networks for Post-Disaster Communication: A Decentralized Flocking Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have significant potential for agile communication and relief coordination in post-disaster scenarios, particularly when ground infrastructure is compromised. However, efficiently coordinating and securing flocks of heterogeneous UAVs from different service providers poses significant challenges related to privacy, scalability, lightweight consensus protocols, and comprehensive cybersecurity mechanisms. This study introduces a robust blockchain-enabled framework designed to tackle these technical challenges through a combination of consensus protocols, smart contracts, and cryptographic techniques. First, we propose a consortium blockchain architecture that ensures secure and private multi-agency coordination by controlling access and safeguarding the privacy of sensitive data. Second, we develop an optimized hybrid consensus protocol that merges Delegated Proof of Stake and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DPOS-PBFT), aiming to achieve an effective balance between efficiency, security, and resilience against node failures. Finally, we introduce decentralized flocking algorithms that facilitate adaptable and autonomous operations among specialized UAV clusters, ensuring critical disaster relief functions under conditions of uncertain connectivity. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the system achieved linear scaling of throughput up to 500 UAV nodes, with only a 50ms increase in latency from 10 to 500 nodes. The framework maintained high throughput and low latency despite spoofing, denial-of-service (DoS), and tampering attacks, showing strong cyber resilience. Communication latencies were kept under 10ms for diverse UAV operations through self-optimizing network intelligence, with median values around 2-3ms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of unsupervised graph representation learning by harnessing the control properties of dynamical networks defined on graphs. Our approach introduces a novel framework for contrastive learning, a widely prevalent technique for unsupervised representation learning. A crucial step in contrastive learning is the creation of 'augmented' graphs from the input graphs. Though different from the original graphs, these augmented graphs retain the original graph's structural characteristics. Here, we propose a unique method for generating these augmented graphs by leveraging the control properties of networks. The core concept revolves around perturbing the original graph to create a new one while preserving the controllability properties specific to networks and graphs. Compared to the existing methods, we demonstrate that this innovative approach enhances the effectiveness of contrastive learning frameworks, leading to superior results regarding the accuracy of the classification tasks. The key innovation lies in our ability to decode the network structure using these control properties, opening new avenues for unsupervised graph representation learning.</description>

      <title>Integrating Predictive Motion Uncertainties with Distributionally Robust Risk-Aware Control for Safe Robot Navigation in Crowds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safe navigation in human-populated environments is crucial for autonomous mobile robots. Although recent advances in machine learning offer promising methods to predict human trajectories in crowded areas, it remains unclear how one can safely incorporate these learned models into a control loop due to the uncertain nature of human motion, which can make predictions of these models imprecise. In this work, we address this challenge and introduce a distributionally robust chance-constrained model predictive control (DRCC-MPC) which: (i) adopts a probability of collision as a pre-specified, interpretable risk metric, and (ii) offers robustness against discrepancies between actual human trajectories and their predictions. We consider the risk of collision in the form of a chance constraint, providing an interpretable measure of robot safety. To enable real-time evaluation of chance constraints, we consider conservative approximations of chance constraints in the form of distributionally robust Conditional Value at Risk constraints. The resulting formulation offers computational efficiency as well as robustness with respect to out-of-distribution human motion. With the parallelization of a sampling-based optimization technique, our method operates in real-time, demonstrating successful and safe navigation in a number of case studies with real-world pedestrian data.</description>

      <title>Synthetic data generation for system identification: leveraging knowledge transfer from similar systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of overfitting in the learning of dynamical systems by introducing a novel approach for the generation of synthetic data, aimed at enhancing model generalization and robustness in scenarios characterized by data scarcity. Central to the proposed methodology is the concept of knowledge transfer from systems within the same class. Specifically, synthetic data is generated through a pre-trained meta-model that describes a broad class of systems to which the system of interest is assumed to belong. Training data serves a dual purpose: firstly, as input to the pre-trained meta model to discern the system's dynamics, enabling the prediction of its behavior and thereby generating synthetic output sequences for new input sequences; secondly, in conjunction with synthetic data, to define the loss function used for model estimation. A validation dataset is used to tune a scalar hyper-parameter balancing the relative importance of training and synthetic data in the definition of the loss function. The same validation set can be also used for other purposes, such as early stopping during the training, fundamental to avoid overfitting in case of small-size training datasets. The efficacy of the approach is shown through a numerical example that highlights the advantages of integrating synthetic data into the system identification process.</description>

      <title>Direction of slip modulates the perception of slip distance and slip speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychophysical understanding of the slip stimulus. We emphasized that the perception of slip and its characteristics, such as slip distance and slip speed depend on the interaction between slip direction, slip distance as well as slip speed. Methods: We developed a novel slip induction device to simulate the artificial sense of slip. We conducted a psychophysical experiment on eight healthy subjects. The experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of slip direction on slip perception as well as on the perception of slip distance and slip speed. A series of psychophysical questions were asked at the end of the slip stimulation to record the subjective responses of the participants. The average success rate (%) was used to quantify the subject responses. Results: We demonstrated that the perception of slip is independent of slip direction however, perception of slip distance and slip speed are significantly modulated by slip direction. We also observed that a significant interaction exists between slip distance and slip speed in the upward slip direction. It was also observed that the average success rate was significantly different for various combinations of slip distance and slip speed in the upward slip direction. Conclusions: Our study clearly establishes a significant interaction between the slip direction, slip distance, and slip speed for psychophysical understanding of the perception of slip distance and slip speed.</description>

      <title>On a Software Joint Velocity Limitation of a Spherical Parallel Manipulator with Coaxial Input Shafts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article discusses the implementation of a software joint velocity limitation dedicated to a Spherical Parallel Manipulator (SPM) with coaxial input shafts (CoSPM) using a speed control loop. Such an algorithm takes as input the current joint positions as well as the joint reference velocities computed by the speed controller and limit the latter in order to avoid any known singular configuration. This limitation takes into account the workspace properties of the mechanism and the physical characteristics of its actuators. In particular, one takes advantage of the coaxiality of the input shafts of the CoSPM and the resulting unlimited bearing.</description>

      <title>Sampling-Based Risk-Aware Path Planning Around Dynamic Engagement Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for avoiding dynamic engagement zones (EZs) and minimizing risk leverage the calculus of variations to obtain optimal paths. While such methods are deterministic, they scale poorly as the number of engagement zones increases. Furthermore, optimal-control based strategies are sensitive to initial guesses and often converge to local, rather than global, minima. This paper presents a novel sampling-based approach to obtain a feasible flight plan for a Dubins vehicle to reach a desired location in a bounded operating region in the presence of a large number of engagement zones. The dynamic EZs are coupled to the vehicle dynamics through its heading angle. Thus, the dynamic two-dimensional obstacles in the (x,y) plane can be transformed into three-dimensional static obstacles in a lifted (x,y,{\psi}) space. This insight is leveraged in the formulation of a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT*) algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated with a Monte Carlo experiment that randomizes EZ locations to characterize the success rate and average path length as a function of the number of EZs and as the computation time made available to the planner is increased.</description>

      <title>Risk Management Core -- Towards an Explicit Representation of Risk in Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While current automotive safety standards provide implicit guidance on how unreasonable risk can be avoided, manufacturers are required to specify risk acceptance criteria for Automated Driving Systems (SAE Level 3 and higher). However, the 'unreasonable' level of risk of Automated Driving Systems is not yet concisely defined. Solely applying current safety standards to such novel systems could potentially not be sufficient for their acceptance. As risk is managed with implicit knowledge about safety measures in existing automotive standards, an explicit alignment with risk acceptance criteria is challenging. Hence, we propose an approach for an explicit representation and management of risk, which we call the Risk Management Core. The proposal of this process framework is based on requirements elicited from current safety standards and is applied to the task of specifying safe behavior for an Automated Driving System in an example scenario.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Logical Execution Time Model for Both Determinism and Low Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Logical Execution Time (LET) programming model has recently received considerable attention, particularly because of its timing and dataflow determinism. In LET, task computation appears always to take the same amount of time (called the task's LET interval), and the task reads (resp. writes) at the beginning (resp. end) of the interval. Compared to other communication mechanisms, such as implicit communication and Dynamic Buffer Protocol (DBP), LET performs worse on many metrics, such as end-to-end latency (including reaction time and data age) and time disparity jitter. Compared with the default LET setting, the flexible LET (fLET) model shrinks the LET interval while still guaranteeing schedulability by introducing the virtual offset to defer the read operation and using the virtual deadline to move up the write operation. Therefore, fLET has the potential to significantly improve the end-to-end timing performance while keeping the benefits of deterministic behavior on timing and dataflow.
  To fully realize the potential of fLET, we consider the problem of optimizing the assignments of its virtual offsets and deadlines. We propose new abstractions to describe the task communication pattern and new optimization algorithms to explore the solution space efficiently. The algorithms leverage the linearizability of communication patterns and utilize symbolic operations to achieve efficient optimization while providing a theoretical guarantee. The framework supports optimizing multiple performance metrics and guarantees bounded suboptimality when optimizing end-to-end latency. Experimental results show that our optimization algorithms improve upon the default LET and its existing extensions and significantly outperform implicit communication and DBP in terms of various metrics, such as end-to-end latency, time disparity, and its jitter.</description>

      <title>Automated Lane Merging via Game Theory and Branch Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an integrated behavior and motion planning framework for the automated lane-merging problem. The behavior planner combines search-based planning with game theory to model the interaction between vehicles and select multi-vehicle trajectories. Inspired by human drivers, we model the lane-merging problem as a gap selection process. To overcome the challenge of multi-modal driving behavior exhibited by the surrounding vehicles, we formulate the trajectory selection as a matrix game and compute some equilibrium solutions. In practice, however, the surrounding vehicles might deviate from the computed equilibrium trajectories. Thus, we introduce a branch model predictive control (BMPC) framework to account for the uncertain behavior modes of the surrounding vehicles. A tailored numerical solver is developed to enhance computational efficiency by leveraging the tree structure inherent in BMPC. Finally, we validate our proposed integrated planner using real traffic data and demonstrate its effectiveness in handling interactions in dense traffic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Settling the Sample Complexity of Model-Based Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.05275v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with offline reinforcement learning (RL), which learns using pre-collected data without further exploration. Effective offline RL would be able to accommodate distribution shift and limited data coverage. However, prior algorithms or analyses either suffer from suboptimal sample complexities or incur high burn-in cost to reach sample optimality, thus posing an impediment to efficient offline RL in sample-starved applications.
  We demonstrate that the model-based (or "plug-in") approach achieves minimax-optimal sample complexity without burn-in cost for tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs). Concretely, consider a finite-horizon (resp. $\gamma$-discounted infinite-horizon) MDP with $S$ states and horizon $H$ (resp. effective horizon $\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$), and suppose the distribution shift of data is reflected by some single-policy clipped concentrability coefficient $C^{\star}_{\text{clipped}}$. We prove that model-based offline RL yields $\varepsilon$-accuracy with a sample complexity of \[ \begin{cases} \frac{H^{4}SC_{\text{clipped}}^{\star}}{\varepsilon^{2}} &amp; (\text{finite-horizon MDPs}) \frac{SC_{\text{clipped}}^{\star}}{(1-\gamma)^{3}\varepsilon^{2}} &amp; (\text{infinite-horizon MDPs}) \end{cases} \] up to log factor, which is minimax optimal for the entire $\varepsilon$-range. The proposed algorithms are "pessimistic" variants of value iteration with Bernstein-style penalties, and do not require sophisticated variance reduction. Our analysis framework is established upon delicate leave-one-out decoupling arguments in conjunction with careful self-bounding techniques tailored to MDPs.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Convex Hull of the Image of a Set with Smooth Boundary: Error Bounds and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the convex hull of the image $f(X)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ of a compact set $X\subset\mathbb{R}^m$ with smooth boundary through a smooth function $f:\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^n$. Assuming that $f$ is a submersion, we derive a new bound on the Hausdorff distance between the convex hull of $f(X)$ and the convex hull of the images $f(x_i)$ of $M$ sampled inputs $x_i$ on the boundary of $X$. When applied to the problem of geometric inference from a random sample, our results give error bounds that are tighter and more general than in previous work. We present applications to the problems of robust optimization, of reachability analysis of dynamical systems, and of robust trajectory optimization under bounded uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Implicit Boundary Conditions in Partial Differential Equations Discretizations: Identifying Spurious Modes and Model Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of spurious modes that are sometimes encountered in partial differential equations discretizations. It is generally suspected that one of the causes for spurious modes is due to how boundary conditions are treated, and we use this as the starting point of our investigations. By regarding boundary conditions as algebraic constraints on a differential equation, we point out that any differential equation with homogeneous boundary conditions also admits a typically infinite number of hidden or implicit boundary conditions. In most discretization schemes, these additional implicit boundary conditions are violated, and we argue that this is what leads to the emergence of spurious modes. These observations motivate two definitions of the quality of computed eigenvalues based on violations of derivatives of boundary conditions on the one hand, and on the Grassmann distance between subspaces associated with computed eigenspaces on the other. Both of these tests are based on a standardized treatment of boundary conditions and do not require a priori knowledge of eigenvalue locations. The effectiveness of these tests is demonstrated on several examples known to have spurious modes. In addition, these quality tests show that in most problems, about half the computed spectrum of a differential operator is of low quality. The tests also specifically identify the low accuracy modes, which can then be projected out as a type of model reduction scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02338v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of megaconstellations is rapidly increasing the number of rocket launches. While Low Earth Orbit (LEO) broadband satellites help to connect unconnected communities and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there are also significant environmental emissions impacts from burning rocket fuels. We present sustainability analytics for phase 1 of the three main LEO constellations including Amazon Kuiper (3,236 satellites), Eutelsat Group`s OneWeb (648 satellites), and SpaceX Starlink (4,425 satellites). We find that LEO megaconstellations provide substantially improved broadband speeds for rural and remote communities, but are roughly 6-8 times more emissions intensive (250 kg CO2eq/subscriber/year) than comparative terrestrial mobile broadband. In the worst-case emissions scenario, this rises to 12-14 times more (469 kg CO2eq/subscriber/year). Policy makers must carefully consider the trade-off between connecting unconnected communities to further the SDGs and mitigating the growing space sector environmental footprint, particularly regarding phase 2 plans to launch an order-of-magnitude more satellites.</description>

      <title>ManyQuadrupeds: Learning a Single Locomotion Policy for Diverse Quadruped Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning a locomotion policy for quadruped robots has traditionally been constrained to a specific robot morphology, mass, and size. The learning process must usually be repeated for every new robot, where hyperparameters and reward function weights must be re-tuned to maximize performance for each new system. Alternatively, attempting to train a single policy to accommodate different robot sizes, while maintaining the same degrees of freedom (DoF) and morphology, requires either complex learning frameworks, or mass, inertia, and dimension randomization, which leads to prolonged training periods. In our study, we show that drawing inspiration from animal motor control allows us to effectively train a single locomotion policy capable of controlling a diverse range of quadruped robots. The robot differences encompass: a variable number of DoFs, (i.e. 12 or 16 joints), three distinct morphologies, a broad mass range spanning from 2 kg to 200 kg, and nominal standing heights ranging from 18 cm to 100 cm. Our policy modulates a representation of the Central Pattern Generator (CPG) in the spinal cord, effectively coordinating both frequencies and amplitudes of the CPG to produce rhythmic output (Rhythm Generation), which is then mapped to a Pattern Formation (PF) layer. Across different robots, the only varying component is the PF layer, which adjusts the scaling parameters for the stride height and length. Subsequently, we evaluate the sim-to-real transfer by testing the single policy on both the Unitree Go1 and A1 robots. Remarkably, we observe robust performance, even when adding a 15 kg load, equivalent to 125% of the A1 robot's nominal mass.</description>

Abstract: Optimal decision-making presents a significant challenge for autonomous systems operating in uncertain, stochastic and time-varying environments. Environmental variability over time can significantly impact the system's optimal decision making strategy for mission completion. To model such environments, our work combines the previous notion of Time-Varying Markov Decision Processes (TVMDP) with partial observability and introduces Time-Varying Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (TV-POMDP). We propose a two-pronged approach to accurately estimate and plan within the TV-POMDP: 1) Memory Prioritized State Estimation (MPSE), which leverages weighted memory to provide more accurate time-varying transition estimates; and 2) an MPSE-integrated planning strategy that optimizes long-term rewards while accounting for temporal constraint. We validate the proposed framework and algorithms using simulations and hardware, with robots exploring a partially observable, time-varying environments. Our results demonstrate superior performance over standard methods, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in stochastic, uncertain, time-varying domains.</description>

      <title>ComTraQ-MPC: Meta-Trained DQN-MPC Integration for Trajectory Tracking with Limited Active Localization Updates</title>

Abstract: Optimal decision-making for trajectory tracking in partially observable, stochastic environments where the number of active localization updates -- the process by which the agent obtains its true state information from the sensors -- are limited, presents a significant challenge. Traditional methods often struggle to balance resource conservation, accurate state estimation and precise tracking, resulting in suboptimal performance. This problem is particularly pronounced in environments with large action spaces, where the need for frequent, accurate state data is paramount, yet the capacity for active localization updates is restricted by external limitations. This paper introduces ComTraQ-MPC, a novel framework that combines Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimize trajectory tracking with constrained active localization updates. The meta-trained DQN ensures adaptive active localization scheduling, while the MPC leverages available state information to improve tracking. The central contribution of this work is their reciprocal interaction: DQN's update decisions inform MPC's control strategy, and MPC's outcomes refine DQN's learning, creating a cohesive, adaptive system. Empirical evaluations in simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that ComTraQ-MPC significantly enhances operational efficiency and accuracy, providing a generalizable and approximately optimal solution for trajectory tracking in complex partially observable environments.</description>

      <title>GMKF: Generalized Moment Kalman Filter for Polynomial Systems with Arbitrary Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a new filtering approach for state estimation in polynomial systems corrupted by arbitrary noise, which commonly arise in robotics. We first consider a batch setup where we perform state estimation using all data collected from the initial to the current time. We formulate the batch state estimation problem as a Polynomial Optimization Problem (POP) and relax the assumption of Gaussian noise by specifying a finite number of moments of the noise. We solve the resulting POP using a moment relaxation and prove that under suitable conditions on the rank of the relaxation, (i) we can extract a provably optimal estimate from the moment relaxation, and (ii) we can obtain a belief representation from the dual (sum-of-squares) relaxation. We then turn our attention to the filtering setup and apply similar insights to develop a GMKF for recursive state estimation in polynomial systems with arbitrary noise. The GMKF formulates the prediction and update steps as POPs and solves them using moment relaxations, carrying over a possibly non-Gaussian belief. In the linear-Gaussian case, GMKF reduces to the standard Kalman Filter. We demonstrate that GMKF performs well under highly non-Gaussian noise and outperforms common alternatives, including the Extended and Unscented Kalman Filter, and their variants on matrix Lie group.</description>
