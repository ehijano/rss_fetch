      <title>Approximate weighted 3-coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers the NP-hard graph vertex coloring problem, which differs from traditional problems in which it is required to color vertices with a given (or minimal) number of colors so that adjacent vertices have different colors. In the problem under consideration, a simple edge-weighted graph is given. It is required to color its vertices in 3 colors to minimize the total weight of monochromatic (one-color) edges, i.e. edges with the same colors of their end vertices. This problem is poorly investigated. Previously, we developed graph decomposition algorithms that, in particular, allowed us to construct lower bounds for the optimum, as well as several greedy algorithms. In this paper, several new approximation algorithms are proposed. Among them are variable neighborhood search, simulated annealing, genetic algorithm and graph clustering with further finding the optimal coloring in each cluster. A numerical experiment was conducted on random graphs, as well as on real communication graphs. The characteristics of the algorithms are presented both in tables and graphically. The developed algorithms have shown high efficiency.</description>

      <title>Fast and Furious: A study on Monotonicity and Speed in Cops-and-Robber Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study different variants of the Cops-and-Robber game with respect to cop- and robber\-/monotonicity.
  We study a visible and invisible robber and variants where the robber is lazy, thus can only move when the cops announce to move on top of him.
  In all four combinations, we also vary the number $s$ of edges that the robber can traverse in a single round, called speed.
  We complete the study of the unbounded speed case by showing that, besides the active variants, also the visible lazy variant has both the cop- and robber\-/monotonicity property.
  Furthermore, we prove that the cop\-/monotone invisible lazy copwidth characterizes path-width, while the non\-/monotone and robber\-/monotone is known to characterize tree-width, thus these variants differ even in the unbounded speed case.
  We find that, even with speed restriction, the cop\-/monotone invisible copwidth and the robber\-/monotone invisible active copwidth all characterize path-width.
  On the other hand, we show that the path-width of a graph can be arbitrarily larger than the number of cops needed to win the non\-/monotone invisible active variant.
  To complete our study of cop\-/monotone variants, we show that also in the visible variants the cop\-/monotone copwidth can be arbitrarily larger than the non\-/monotone.
  Regarding robber\-/monotonicity, for all speeds $s\geq 4$, we give graphs where the non\-/monotone and robber\-/monotone copwidth differ.
  On the other hand, we prove that there is a function that bounds the robber\-/monotone copwidth in terms of the non\-/monotone copwidth and the speed, thus the gap between the variants is bounded.
  This proof also yields that a graph class has bounded expansion if and only if, for every speed $s$, the number of cops needed in any robber\-/monotone lazy variant is bounded by some constant $c(s)$.</description>

      <title>An efficient algorithm for generating transmission irregular trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transmission of a vertex in a connected graph is the sum of distances from that vertex to all the other vertices. A connected graph is transmission irregular if any two distinct vertices have different transmissions. We present an efficient algorithm that generates all the transmission irregular trees up to a given order, up to isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Exploring subgraph complementation to bounded degree graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph modification problems are computational tasks where the goal is to change an input graph $G$ using operations from a fixed set, in order to make the resulting graph satisfy a target property, which usually entails membership to a desired graph class $\mathcal{C}$. Some well-known examples of operations include vertex-deletion, edge-deletion, edge-addition and edge-contraction. In this paper we address an operation known as subgraph complement. Given a graph $G$ and a subset $S$ of its vertices, the subgraph complement $G \oplus S$ is the graph resulting of complementing the edge set of the subgraph induced by $S$ in $G$. We say that a graph $H$ is a subgraph complement of $G$ if there is an $S$ such that $H$ is isomorphic to $G \oplus S$. For a graph class $\mathcal{C}$, subgraph complementation to $\mathcal{C}$ is the problem of deciding, for a given graph $G$, whether $G$ has a subgraph complement in $\mathcal{C}$. This problem has been studied and its complexity has been settled for many classes $\mathcal{C}$ such as $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs, for various families $\mathcal{H}$, and for classes of bounded degeneracy. In this work, we focus on classes graphs of minimum/maximum degree upper/lower bounded by some value $k$. In particular, we answer an open question of Antony et al. [Information Processing Letters 188, 106530 (2025)], by showing that subgraph complementation to $\mathcal{C}$ is NP-complete when $\mathcal{C}$ is the class of graphs of minimum degree at least $k$, if $k$ is part of the input. We also show that subgraph complementation to $k$-regular parameterized by $k$ is fixed-parameter tractable.</description>

      <title>List Decoding Quotient Reed-Muller Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reed-Muller codes consist of evaluations of $n$-variate polynomials over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$ with degree at most $d$. Much like every linear code, Reed-Muller codes can be characterized by constraints, where a codeword is valid if and only if it satisfies all \emph{degree-$d$} constraints.
  For a subset $\tilde{X} \subseteq \mathbb{F}^n$, we introduce the notion of \emph{$\tilde{X}$-quotient} Reed-Muller code. A function $F : \tilde{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ is a valid codeword in the quotient code if it satisfies all the constraints of degree-$d$ polynomials \emph{lying in $\tilde{X}$}. This gives rise to a novel phenomenon: a quotient codeword may have \emph{many} extensions to original codewords. This weakens the connection between original codewords and quotient codewords which introduces a richer range of behaviors along with substantial new challenges.
  Our goal is to answer the following question: what properties of $\tilde{X}$ will imply that the quotient code inherits its distance and list-decoding radius from the original code? We address this question using techniques developed by Bhowmick and Lovett [BL14], identifying key properties of $\mathbb{F}^n$ used in their proof and extending them to general subsets $\tilde{X} \subseteq \mathbb{F}^n$. By introducing a new tool, we overcome the novel challenge in analyzing the quotient code that arises from the weak connection between original and quotient codewords. This enables us to apply known results from additive combinatorics and algebraic geometry [KZ18, KZ19, LZ21] to show that when $\tilde{X}$ is a \emph{high rank variety}, $\tilde{X}$-quotient Reed-Muller codes inherit the distance and list-decoding parameters from the original Reed-Muller codes.</description>

      <title>Dataless Quadratic Neural Networks for the Maximum Independent Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19532v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization (CO) addresses many important problems, including the challenging Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. Alongside exact and heuristic solvers, differentiable approaches have emerged, often using continuous relaxations of ReLU-based or quadratic objectives. Noting that an MIS in a graph is a Maximum Clique (MC) in its complement, we propose a new quadratic formulation for MIS by incorporating an MC term, improving convergence and exploration. We show that every maximal independent set corresponds to a local minimizer, derive conditions for the MIS size, and characterize stationary points. To solve our non-convex objective, we propose solving parallel multiple initializations using momentum-based gradient descent, complemented by an efficient MIS checking criterion derived from our theory. Therefore, we dub our method as parallelized Clique-Informed Quadratic Optimization for MIS (pCQO-MIS). Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to exact, heuristic, sampling, and data-centric approaches. Notably, our method avoids the out-of-distribution tuning and reliance on (un)labeled data required by data-centric methods, while achieving superior MIS sizes and competitive runtime relative to their inference time. Additionally, a key advantage of pCQO-MIS is that, unlike exact and heuristic solvers, the runtime scales only with the number of nodes in the graph, not the number of edges.</description>

      <title>Directed branch-width: A directed analogue of tree-width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.08903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gurski and Wanke showed that a graph class C has bounded tree-width if and only if its associated class of directed line graphs has bounded clique-width. Inevitably -- asking whether this relationship lifts to directed graphs -- we introduce a new digraph width measure: we obtain it by investigating digraphs whose directed line graphs have bounded cliquewidth. Thus, to generalize Gurski and Wanke's aforementioned result, we introduce a natural generalization of branch-width to digraphs and we name it accordingly.
  Directed branch-width is a genuinely directed width-measure insofar as it cannot be used to bound the value of the underlying undirected tree-width. Despite this, the two measures are still closely related: the directed branch-width of a digraph D can differ from the branch-width of its underlying undirected graph only at sources and sinks. This relationship allows us to extend a range of algorithmic results from directed graphs with bounded underlying treewidth to the strictly larger class of digraphs having bounded directed branch-width.</description>

      <title>Path eccentricity of $k$-AT-free graphs and application on graphs with the consecutive ones property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The central path problem is a variation on the single facility location problem. The aim is to find, in a given connected graph $G$, a path $P$ minimizing its eccentricity, which is the maximal distance from $P$ to any vertex of the graph $G$. The path eccentricity of $G$ is the minimal eccentricity achievable over all paths in $G$. In this article we consider the path eccentricity of the class of the $k$-AT-free graphs. They are graphs in which any set of three vertices contains a pair for which every path between them uses at least one vertex of the closed neighborhood at distance $k$ of the third. We prove that they have path eccentricity bounded by $k$.
  Moreover, we answer a question of G\'omez and Guti\'errez asking if there is a relation between path eccentricity and the consecutive ones property. The latter is the property for a binary matrix to admit a permutation of the rows placing the 1's consecutively on the columns. It was already known that graphs whose adjacency matrices have the consecutive ones property have path eccentricity at most 1, and that the same remains true when the augmented adjacency matrices (with ones on the diagonal) has the consecutive ones property. We generalize these results as follow. We study graphs whose adjacency matrices can be made to satisfy the consecutive ones property after changing some values on the diagonal, and show that those graphs have path eccentricity at most 2, by showing that they are 2-AT-free.</description>

      <title>Enumerating minimal dominating sets and variants in chordal bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enumerating minimal dominating sets with polynomial delay in bipartite graphs is a long-standing open problem. To date, even the subcase of chordal bipartite graphs is open, with the best known algorithm due to Golovach, Heggernes, Kant\'e, Kratsch, Saether, and Villanger running in incremental-polynomial time. We improve on this result by providing a polynomial delay and space algorithm enumerating minimal dominating sets in chordal bipartite graphs. Additionally, we show that the total and connected variants admit polynomial and incremental-polynomial delay algorithms, respectively, within the same class. This provides an alternative proof of a result by Golovach et al. for total dominating sets, and answers an open question for the connected variant. Finally, we give evidence that the techniques used in this paper cannot be generalized to bipartite graphs for (total) minimal dominating sets, unless P = NP, and show that enumerating minimal connected dominating sets in bipartite graphs is harder than enumerating minimal transversals in general hypergraphs.</description>
