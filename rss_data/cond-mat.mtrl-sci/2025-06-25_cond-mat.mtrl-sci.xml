      <title>Discovery of magnon self-interaction in a strongly driven antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamics govern a wide array of natural phenomena and are essential for understanding nonequilibrium behaviors in condensed matter systems. In magnetically ordered materials, magnons - the quanta of spin waves - exhibit intrinsic nonlinearities that are of great interest in fundamental research and practical applications. Despite progress in the nonlinear control of magnon modes in antiferromagnetic materials, the transition from perturbative to non-perturbative regimes of magnon coherences has remained elusive. Here, we explore the nonlinear dynamics of a magnon mode in an antiferromagnet using two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy with waveguide-enhanced terahertz fields. By driving the magnon mode far from equilibrium, we demonstrate the emergence of high-order magnon coherences and delineate a distinct transition into non-perturbative magnon nonlinearities. This behavior originates from the intrinsic anharmonicity of the magnetic potential and marks a regime dominated by magnon self-interactions at large spin deflection angles. These findings provide fundamental mechanistic insights that might be exploited for ultrafast switching and other advanced magnonic applications.</description>

      <title>A Novel Analysis Framework for Microstructural Characterization of Ferroelectric Hafnia: Experimental Validation and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herein, we present a novel analysis framework for grain size profile of ferroelectric hafnia to tackle critical shortcomings inherent in the current microstructural analysis. We vastly enhanced visibility of grains with ion beam treatment and performed accurate grain segmentation using deep neural network (DNN). By leveraging our new method, we discovered unexpected discrepancies that contradict previous results, such as deposition temperature (Tdep) and post-metallization annealing (PMA) dependence of grain size statistics, prompting us to reassess earlier interpretations. Combining microstructural analysis with electrical tests, we found that grain size reduction had both positive and negative outcomes: it caused significant diminishing of die-to-die variation (~68 % decrease in standard deviation) in coercive field (Ec), while triggering an upsurge in leakage current. These uncovered results signify robustness of our method in characterization of ferroelectric hafnia for in-depth examination of both device variability and reliability.</description>

      <title>Exchange-correlation torques from gauge symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of predicting accurate exchange-correlation (xc) spin-torques in non-collinear magnetic systems has dominated the scene of spin-density functional theory (SDFT) in the last two decades. Progress has been hindered by the fact that the spin torque is directly connected to the divergence of the spin current, a quantity that is extraneous to SDFT. Furthermore, SDFT does not apply in the presence of vector potentials and spin-orbit couplings. Here, we propose a solution that exploits the physical implications of the U(1)xSU(2) gauge invariance of the xc energy in SpinCurrent-DFT. We derive explicit xc torque expressions based on meta-generalized-gradient approximations in the framework of the generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) formulation. One key term represents an xc-torque involving the GKS spin-kinetic energy density; and another term resembles the phenomenological spin current of the Landau-Lifshitz equations: both are derived from first-principles. We also show that the functional form ensures that the GKS particle- and spin-currents are identical, in form, to their interacting counterparts. Non-collinear equilibrium conditions and adiabatic dynamics are thus derived that resolve longstanding issues.</description>

      <title>Long-term atomistic finite-temperature substitutional diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating long-term mass diffusion kinetics with atomic precision is important to predict chemical and mechanical properties of alloys over time scales of engineering interest in applications, including (but not limited to) alloy heat treatment, corrosion resistance, and hydrogen embrittlement. We present a new strategy to bridge from the time scale of atomic vibrations to that of vacancy-mediated atomic hops by a combination of statistical mechanics-based Gaussian phase packets (GPP) relaxation and a nudged elastic band (NEB)-facilitated harmonic transition state theory (H-TST) time update. We validate the approach by simulating bulk self-diffusion in copper and the segregation of vacancies and magnesium to a stacking fault and a symmetric tilt grain boundary in aluminum, modeled with an embedded atom method (EAM) potential. The method correctly predicts the kinetics in bulk copper and equilibrium impurity concentrations in aluminum, in agreement with the Langmuir-Mclean solution in the dilute limit. Notably, this technique can reach realistic diffusion time scales of days, weeks, and even years in a computational time of hours, demonstrating its capability to study the long-term chemo-thermo-mechanically coupled behavior of atomic ensembles.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Magnetic Properties of Zigzag Structured Thin Films via Interface Engineering and Columnar Nano-structuring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the emergence of a novel interface-induced shape anisotropy component in zigzag-structured thin films fabricated via Sequential Oblique Angle Deposition (S-OAD). In this study, we systematically investigate cobalt (Co) and Co2FeAl (CFA) thin films by varying column length, number of bilayers, and magneto-crystalline anisotropy (MCA) to explore how structural modulation affects magnetic behavior. Using magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements in conjunction with synchrotron-based grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) and 2D X-ray diffraction (2DXRD), we reveal that the interplay between interface-induced, shape, and crystalline anisotropies allows for a tunable magnetic response, ranging from isotropic to anisotropic behavior. The observed uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA) exceeds that of conventional OAD films, while column merging is effectively suppressed through precise multilayer engineering. Structural analysis confirms that periodic, high-density interfaces at the junctions of oppositely tilted columns are central to this anisotropy control. These findings demonstrate that interface engineering and columnar nanostructuring within zigzag nanostructures offer a powerful route for tailoring magnetic properties in zigzag thin films, enabling their application in next-generation spintronic and magnetic sensor technologies.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Accelerates Raman Computations from Molecular Dynamics for Materials Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a powerful experimental technique for characterizing molecules and materials that is used in many laboratories. First-principles theoretical calculations of Raman spectra are important because they elucidate the microscopic effects underlying Raman activity in these systems. These calculations are often performed using the canonical harmonic approximation which cannot capture certain thermal changes in the Raman response. Anharmonic vibrational effects were recently found to play crucial roles in several materials, which motivates theoretical treatments of the Raman effect beyond harmonic phonons. While Raman spectroscopy from molecular dynamics (MD-Raman) is a well-established approach that includes anharmonic vibrations and further relevant thermal effects, MD-Raman computations were long considered to be computationally too expensive for practical materials computations. In this perspective article, we highlight that recent advances in the context of machine learning have now dramatically accelerated the involved computational tasks without sacrificing accuracy or predictive power. These recent developments highlight the increasing importance of MD-Raman and related methods as versatile tools for theoretical prediction and characterization of molecules and materials.</description>

      <title>Massive Atomic Diversity: a compact universal dataset for atomistic machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of machine-learning models for atomic-scale simulations has benefited tremendously from the large databases of materials and molecular properties computed in the past two decades using electronic-structure calculations. More recently, these databases have made it possible to train universal models that aim at making accurate predictions for arbitrary atomic geometries and compositions. The construction of many of these databases was however in itself aimed at materials discovery, and therefore targeted primarily to sample stable, or at least plausible, structures and to make the most accurate predictions for each compound - e.g. adjusting the calculation details to the material at hand. Here we introduce a dataset designed specifically to train machine learning models that can provide reasonable predictions for arbitrary structures, and that therefore follows a different philosophy. Starting from relatively small sets of stable structures, the dataset is built to contain massive atomic diversity (MAD) by aggressively distorting these configurations, with near-complete disregard for the stability of the resulting configurations. The electronic structure details, on the other hand, are chosen to maximize consistency rather than to obtain the most accurate prediction for a given structure, or to minimize computational effort. The MAD dataset we present here, despite containing fewer than 100k structures, has already been shown to enable training universal interatomic potentials that are competitive with models trained on traditional datasets with two to three orders of magnitude more structures. We describe in detail the philosophy and details of the construction of the MAD dataset. We also introduce a low-dimensional structural latent space that allows us to compare it with other popular datasets and that can be used as a general-purpose materials cartography tool.</description>

      <title>Flexoelectric Polarization Enhancement in Paraelectric $\mathrm{BaHfO_3}$ via Strain Gradient Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity - polarization induced by strain gradients - offers a route to polar functionality in centrosymmetric dielectrics, where traditional piezoelectric effects are absent. This study investigates the flexoelectric effect in epitaxial $\mathrm{BaHfO_3}$ (BHO) thin films, a centrosymmetric and paraelectric perovskite. While a large lattice mismatch induces defect-driven relaxation, a coherently grown BHO film undergoes elastic relaxation, forming intrinsic strain gradients exceeding $10^6\ \mathrm{m}^{-1}$. A 29-fold enhancement in spontaneous polarization is observed at an electric field of $4\ \mathrm{MV\,cm}^{-1}$ for BHO exhibiting a strain gradient compared to relaxed BHO. This enhancement is attributed to flexoelectric coupling, which is isolated from ferroelectric and piezoelectric contributions due to the centrosymmetric nature and the absence of phase transitions in BHO. The findings establish a clear link between engineered strain gradients and enhanced polarizability in oxide thin films, offering a benchmark system for deconvoluting the flexoelectric effect from other polar effects. These results provide a basis for exploiting flexoelectricity in dielectric devices and advance the fundamental understanding of strain-coupled phenomena in functional oxides.</description>

      <title>Atomic layer etching of InGaAs using sequential exposures of atomic hydrogen and oxygen gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high frequency performance and yield of III-V semiconductor devices such as InP HEMTs is negatively impacted by subsurface etch damage and non-uniform etch depth over the wafer. Atomic layer etching (ALE) has the potential to overcome this challenge because of its ability to etch with Angstrom-scale precision, low damage, and intrinsic wafer-scale uniformity. Here, we report an ALE process for InGaAs based on sequential atomic hydrogen and oxygen gas exposures. An etch rate of 0.095 \r{A}/cycle was observed at 350 {\deg}C using ex-situ spectroscopic ellipsometry. The sample remains atomically smooth after 200 cycles of ALE. This process could be employed as a gate recess etch step in InP HEMT fabrication to improve microwave performance and yield.</description>

      <title>Controlling Topological Quantum Transport via Non-Perturbative Light-Matter Interaction in Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the possibility to induce topological quantum transport in otherwise trivial systems through non-perturbative light-matter interactions, as well as the enhancement of this effect in the presence of disorder. Going beyond prior theoretical approaches, we introduce a computational framework which performs large-scale real-space quantum dynamics simulations, including carrier thermalization and disorder effects, in systems driven out of equilibrium by light or other external interactions. This methodology is illustrated in gapped single-layer and Bernal bilayer graphene but can be implemented in arbitrarily complex systems, including disordered and aperiodic systems, opening novel avenues for the design of multifunctional topological electronic devices that work in far-from-equilibrium regimes.</description>

      <title>Deposition-Dependent Coverage and Performance of Phosphonic Acid Interface Modifiers in Halide Perovskite Optoelectronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the effect of various deposition methods for phosphonic acid interface modifiers commonly pursued as self-assembled monolayers in high-performance metal halide perovskite photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes. We compare the deposition of (2-(3,6-diiodo-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid onto indium tin oxide (ITO) bottom contacts by varying three parameters: the method of deposition, specifically spin coating or prolonged dip coating, ITO surface treatment via HCl/FeCl3 etching, and use in combination with a second modifier, 1,6-hexylenediphosphonic acid. We demonstrate that varying these modification protocols can impact time-resolved photoluminescence carrier lifetimes and quasi-Fermi level splitting of perovskite films deposited onto the phosphonic-acid-modified ITO. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy shows an increase in effective work function after phosphonic acid modification and clear evidence for photoemission from carbazole functional groups at the ITO surface. We use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to probe differences in phosphonic acid coverage on the metal oxide contact and show that perovskite samples grown on ITO with the highest phosphonic acid coverage exhibit the longest carrier lifetimes. Finally, we establish that device performance follows these same trends. These results indicate that the reactivity, heterogeneity, and composition of the bottom contact help to control recombination rates and therefore power conversion efficiencies. ITO etching, prolonged deposition times for phosphonic acids via dip coating, and the use of a secondary, more hydrophilic bis-phosphonic acid, all contribute to improvements in surface coverage, carrier lifetime, and device efficiency. These improvements each have a positive impact, and we achieve the best results when all three strategies are implemented.</description>

      <title>Elastic heterogeneity governs anomalous scaling in a soft porous crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale molecular transport plays a crucial role in regulating mass diffusion and responsiveness in condensed matter systems. In soft porous crystals, in particular, adsorption of guest molecules induces host framework deformation and changes in rigidity, underpinning their characteristic stimuli-responsive behaviour. Surface-mediated adsorption leads to inhomogeneous adsorbate distribution, which, through local framework deformation, induces spatial variations in rigidity -- elastic heterogeneity. Although this heterogeneity is expected to affect adsorption kinetics and mechanical behaviour, its role remains poorly understood. Here we show that elastic heterogeneity governs adsorption kinetics, leading to emergent phenomena including size-dependent uptake, surface creasing, and anomalous dynamic scaling that is distinct from established scaling. Stress relaxation near corners facilitates adsorption, resulting in a size-dependent deviation from diffusive kinetics. Away from corners, flexible unadsorbed regions between rigid adsorbed domains relieve stress through crease formation. The resulting lateral correlations exhibit anomalous dynamic scaling, characterized by a breakdown of scale invariance between global and local interfacial fluctuations. These findings provide a mechanistic foundation for controlling adsorption and deformation kinetics in soft porous materials via elastic heterogeneity. Our work opens a route to engineering responsive materials, where mechanical feedback is harnessed to control cooperative molecular transport and drive macroscopic shape changes under external perturbations.</description>

      <title>Voltage-Induced Oxidation for Enhanced Purity and Reproducibility of Quantum Emission in Monolayer 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a voltage-induced oxidation technique using conductive atomic force microscopy to enhance the single-photon purity and reproducibility of quantum emitters in monolayer tung-sten diselenide (WSe2). By applying a controlled electric field across a monolayer WSe2/poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) on a silicon substrate, localized oxidation is induced around nanoindented emitter sites in the WSe2. This treatment selectively suppresses defect-bound exciton emissions while preserving emission from pristine regions within the indentations. Photoluminescence and second-order correlation measurements at 18 K demonstrate a substantial increase in single-photon purity when comparing emitters from untreated and voltage-treated regions. Emitters from untreated regions showed average values of g2(0) near or above the 0.5 threshold. In contrast, emitters from voltage-treated regions exhibited g2(0) values consistently below 0.14, with most falling near 0.05, demonstrating high-purity single-photon emission well below the g2(0) &lt; 0.5 threshold. This enhancement results from the oxidation-induced suppression of spurious luminescence from the area around the quantum emitter site that is spectrally degenerate with the single-photon wavelength. This approach offers nonvolatile, spatially selective control over the emitter environment without degrading the emission intensity, improving both purity and stability. It provides a scalable route for integrating high-quality quantum emitters in two-dimensional materials into photonic platforms. Integration with spectral tuning strategies such as strain engineering, local dielectric patterning, or electrostatic gating could further enable deterministic, wavelength-selective single-photon sources for advanced quantum photonic applications</description>

      <title>The electronic structure of a doped Mott-Hubbard surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sn/Si(111)-({\sqrt}3{\times}{\sqrt}3)R30{\deg} surface, a 2D Mott insulator, has long been predicted and then found experimetally to metallize and even turn superconducting upon boron doping. In order to clarify the structural, spectroscopic and theoretical details of that evolution, here we present ARPES data supplementing morphology and scanning tunneling measurements. These combined experimental results are compared with predictions from a variety of electronic structure approaches, mostly density functional DFT+U, but not neglecting Mott-Hubbard models, both ordered and disordered. These theoretical pictures address different spectroscopic aspects, including the 2D Fermi surface, the Hubbard bands, etc. While no single picture account for all observations at once,the emergent hypothesis compatible with all data is that metallization arises from sub-subsurface boron doping, additional to the main standard subsurface boron geometry, that would leave the surface insulating. These results advance the indispensable frame for the further understanding of this fascinating system.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e Collapse and Luttinger Liquids In Twisted Anisotropic Homobilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce twisted anisotropic homobilayers as a distinct class of moir\'e systems, characterized by a distinctive ``magic angle", $\theta_M$, where both the moir\'e unit cell and Brillouin zone collapse. Unlike conventional studies of moir\'e materials, which primarily focus on small lattice misalignments, we demonstrate that this moir\'e collapse occurs at large twist angles in generic twisted anisotropic homobilayers. The collapse angle, $\theta_M$, is likely to give rise quasi-crystal behavior as well as to the formation of strongly correlated states, that arise not from flat bands, but from the presence of ultra-anisotropic electronic states, where non-Fermi liquid phases can be stabilized. In this work, we develop a continuum model for electrons based on extensive \textit{ab initio} calculations for twisted bilayer black phosphorus, enabling a detailed study of the emerging moir\'e collapse features in this archetypal system. We show that the (temperature) stability criterion for the emergence of (sliding) Luttinger liquids is generally met as the twist angle approaches $\theta_M$. Furthermore, we explicitly formulate the collapsed single-particle one-dimensional (1D) continuum Hamiltonian and provide the \textit{fully interacting}, bosonized Hamiltonian applicable at low doping levels. Our analysis reveals a rich landscape of multichannel Luttinger liquids, potentially enhanced by valley degrees of freedom at large twist angles.</description>

      <title>Impact of static disorder on quasiparticle spectra: Debye-Waller, mean free path and potential fluctuation effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ARPES is a widely used characterization technique in condensed matter physics, providing direct access to the single-electron spectral function of crystals, including their electronic band structure and Fermi surface. Measuring the band structure of novel quantum materials has been fundamentally important for determining, for example, non-trivial band topology or for identifying new classes of materials. A key challenge with these emerging quantum materials is that their initial crystalline quality is rarely optimized, which directly affects the spectra measured by ARPES. Here, we present a theoretical framework and experimental evidence addressing two common consequences of static disorder in photoemission experiments: the loss of coherent spectral weight and the broadening of spectral features. ARPES spectra can be understood as a sum of coherent and incoherent intensities, with their relative contributions controlled by atomic disorder. Under thermal disorder, the coherent intensity is exponentially suppressed as temperature increases, a phenomenon analogous to the Debye-Waller factor in diffraction, where Bragg peaks diminish in favor of diffuse scattering as disorder increases. In this work, we report a soft X-ray study of the deliberately disordered (via Ar ion sputtering) InAs(110) surface, characterized both by STM and LEED. We introduce a new framework that enables quantification of coherent photoemission intensity loss with increasing disorder, allowing both thermal and static disorder to be treated within a unified approach. Additionally, we identify a second major effect of disorder beyond lifetime broadening: inhomogeneous spectral broadening arising from local potential fluctuations. We show that such fluctuations increase the linewidths of the spectra of localized and delocalized states, and contribute to the suppression of ARPES intensity from states near the Fermi level.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals heterostructure configuration effect on exciton and thermoelectric characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A GW calculation based on a truncated Coulomb interaction with an added small q limit was applied to 2D van der Waals heterolayered structures, and the Kane dispersion model was used to determine the accurate band gap edge. All ab initio calculations were performed with the gpaw package. Our findings show that layering the same or different types of atoms with a vacuum in between has an enormous impact on band alignment, effective mass of holes and electrons, exciton binding energy, thermoelectric characteristics, density of hot electrons, and electronic band gaps.Thus, layered interactions of the same kind constrain the configuration to have a direct band gap, whereas different kinds allow for an indirect gap, resulting in an indirect exciton with a greater binding energy due to the band confinement effect. Furthermore, the heterostructure of the highest configuration facilitates the relaxation of hot electrons by forming unoccupied states. This leads to a high density of hot electrons dispersing over unoccupied states, which lessens their sensitivity to temperature; in other words, thermal drop prolongs electron-hole pairing. $\mathrm{MoSe_{2}-MoS_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{MoSeSe-MoSSe}$ have an improved Seebeck coefficient among the various possible configurations because of their low heat conductivity, ability to produce a higher density of states and empty states, improved optical gap, and multiple excitation peaks that resemble the experimental photoluminescence spectrum.</description>

      <title>Theoretical insights into the role of lattice fluctuations on the excited behavior of lead halide perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskites have been extensively studied as a class of materials with unique optoelectronic properties. A fundamental aspect that governs optical and electronic behaviors within these materials is the intricate coupling between charges and their surrounding lattice. Unravelling the role of charge-lattice interactions on the optoelectronic properties in lead halide perovskites is necessary to understand their photophysics. Unlike traditional semiconductors where a harmonic approximation often suffices to capture lattice fluctuations, lead halide perovskites have a significant anharmonicity attributed from the rocking and tilting motions of inorganic framework. Thus, while there is broad consensus on the importance of the structural deformations and polar fluctuations on the behavior of charge carriers and quasiparticles, the strongly anharmonic nature of these fluctuations and their strong interactions render theoretical descriptions of lead halides perovskites challenging. In this Account, we review our recent efforts to understand how the soft, polar lattice of this class of materials alter their quasiparticle binding energies and fine structure, charge mobilities, and lifetimes of phonons and excess charges. Throughout, these are aimed at characterizing the interplay between lattice fluctuations and optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskites and are reviewed in the context of the effective models we have built, and the novel theoretical methods we have developed to understand bulk crystalline materials, as well as nanostructures, and lower dimensionality lattices. By integrating theoretical advances with experimental observations, the perspective we detail in this account provides a comprehensive picture that serves as both design principles for optoelectronic materials and a set of theoretical tools to study them when charge-lattice interactions are important.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Insights into Excitonic Effects in 2D Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding excitonic effects in two-dimensional (2D) materials is critical for advancing their potential in next-generation electronic and photonic devices. In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based framework to predict exciton binding energies in 2D materials, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional methods such as many-body perturbation theory (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Leveraging data from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), our ML models establish connections between cheaply available material descriptors and complex excitonic properties, significantly accelerating the screening process for materials with pronounced excitonic effects. Additionally, Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression was employed to efficiently filter materials with largest exciton binding energies, further enhancing the discovery process. Although developed for 2D systems, this approach is versatile and can be extended to three-dimensional materials, broadening its applicability in materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Chemically-Disordered Transparent Conductive Perovskites with High Crystalline Fidelity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript presents a working model linking chemical disorder and transport properties in correlated-electron perovskites with high-entropy formulations and a framework to actively design them. We demonstrate this new learning in epitaxial Sr$x$(Ti,Cr,Nb,Mo,W)O$3$ thin films that exhibit exceptional crystalline fidelity despite a diverse chemical formulation where most B-site species are highly misfit with respect to valence and radius. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy confirm a unique combination of chemical disorder and structural perfection in thick epitaxial layers. This combination produces significant electron correlation, low electrical resistivity, and an optical transparency window that surpasses that of constituent end-members, with a flattened frequency- and temperature-dependent response. We address the computational challenges of modeling such systems and investigate short-range ordering using cluster expansion. These results showcase that unusual d-metal combinations access an expanded property design space that is predictable using end-member characteristics -- though unavailable to them -- thus offering performance advances in optical, spintronic, and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>The effect of elastic-plastic mismatch and interface proximity on the fracture toughness of Ti-TiN thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetron sputtered titanium nitride (TiN) thin films are widely used as protective coatings due to their high hardness, but suffer from inherent brittleness and low fracture toughness, limiting their applicability. The multilayering of TiN films with metallic titanium (Ti) interlayers in the form of bi-layer and tri-layer systems have been studied using microcantilever fracture tests. Plastic dissipation in the Ti layer is shown to lead to an increase in crack growth resistance. The effect of the elastic-plastic mismatch between the two materials on the crack driving force, as well as the size of the fully developed plastic zone in Ti have been quantified in this work for the first time. It is shown that incorporating a Ti layer thickness of 250 nm can improve the fracture resistance by nearly ten times compared to the initiation fracture toughness in TiN, preventing catastrophic fracture of these multi-layered films. These results will aid in physics informed design of optimised thickness of metallic interlayers in multi-layered thin films.</description>

      <title>Efficient Crystal Structure Prediction Using Genetic Algorithm and Universal Neural Network Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is crucial for identifying stable crystal structures in given systems and is a prerequisite for computational atomistic simulations. Recent advances in neural network potentials (NNPs) have reduced the computational cost of CSP. However, searching for stable crystal structures across the entire composition space in multicomponent systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose a novel genetic algorithm (GA) -based CSP method using a universal NNP. Our GA-based methods are designed to efficiently expand convex hull volumes while preserving the diversity of crystal structures. This approach draws inspiration from the similarity between convex hull updates and Pareto front evolution in multi-objective optimization. Our evaluation shows that the present method outperforms the symmetry-aware random structure generation, achieving a larger convex hull with fewer trials. We demonstrated that our approach, combined with the developed universal NNP (PFP), can accurately reproduce and explore phase diagrams obtained through DFT calculations; this indicates the validity of PFP across a wide range of crystal structures and element combinations. This study, which integrates a universal NNP with a GA-based CSP method, highlights the promise of these methods in materials discovery.</description>

      <title>In-depth Investigation of Conduction Mechanism on Defect-induced Proton-conducting Electrolytes BaHfO$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study utilizes first-principles computational methods to comprehensively analyze the impact of A-site doping on the proton conduction properties of BaHfO$_3$. The goal is to offer theoretical support for the advancement of electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cells. Our research has uncovered that BaHfO$_3$ demonstrates promising potential for proton conduction, with a low proton migration barrier of $0.28$ eV, suggesting efficient proton conduction can be achieved at lower temperatures. Through A-site doping, particularly with low-valence-state ions and the introduction of Ba vacancies, we can effectively decrease the formation energy of oxygen vacancies (\( E_{\text{vac}} \)), leading to an increase in proton concentration. Additionally, our study reveals that the primary mechanism for proton migration in BaHfO$_3$ is the Grotthuss mechanism rather than the vehicle mechanism. Examination of the changes in lattice parameters during proton migration indicates that while doping or vacancy control strategies do not alter the mode of H$^+$ migration, they do influence the migration pathway and barrier. These findings provide valuable insights into optimizing the proton conduction properties of BaHfO$_3$ through A-site doping and lay a solid theoretical foundation for the development of novel, highly efficient solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte materials.</description>

      <title>First-principle Study of Multiple Metastable Charge Ordering States in La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: La doped SrFeO$_{3}$, La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$, exhibits a metal-to-insulator transition accompanied by both antiferromagnetic and charge ordering states along with the Fe-O bond disproportionation below a critical temperature near 200K. Unconventionally slow charge dynamics measured in this material near the critical temperature shows that its excited charge ordering states can exhibit novel electronic structures with nontrivial energy profiles. Here, we reveal possible metastable states of charge ordering structures in La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$ using the first-principle and climbing image nudged elastic band methods. In the strong correlation regime, La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$ is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a charge ordering state of the big-small-big pattern, consistent with the experimental measurement of this material at the low temperature. As the correlation effect becomes weak, we find at least two possible metastable charge ordering states with the distinct Fe-O bond disproportionation. Remarkably, a ferroelectric metallic state emerges with the small energy barrier of $\sim$7 meV, driven by a metastable CO state of the small-medium-big pattern. The electronic structures of these metastable charge ordering states are noticeably different from those of the ground-state. Our results can provide an insightful explanation to multiple metastable charge ordering states and the slow charge dynamics of this and related oxide materials.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find that magnetic field induces a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. Experimentally, the thermal Hall angle is maximal at the temperature of peak longitudinal thermal conductivity. At this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions dominate over Umklapp and boundary scattering events. In the presence of a magnetic field, Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a phase, due to the difference in the spatial distributions of the positive charge of the nuclei and the negative charge of the electrons. Combined with unavoidable anharmonicity, the field-induced phase of the molecular wave-function gives rise to a geometric [Berry] phase for phonons and modifies three-phonon interference. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest displacement, $\delta u_m$, of phonons at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of divacancies in 3C-, 4H- and 6H-SiC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The divacancy comprising two neighboring vacant sites in the SiC lattice is a promising defect for applications in quantum technology. So far, most work is concerned with the divacancy in 4H-SiC, whereas the divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC have received much less attention. Here, we outline arguments showing that the neutral charge state of the divacancies in the latter two polytypes is intrinsically stable, in contrast to that in 4H-SiC where the photoluminescence quenches in most materials for certain excitation energies (below approximately 1.3 eV). Divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC are anticipated to remain stable even with resonant excitation. We provide new ab initio calculation results for the charge transfer levels of divacancies in 6H- and 3C-SiC. Using the temperature dependence of the divacancy emission in 3C-SiC, we estimate the energy position of the (+|0) charge transfer level of the divacancy within the bandgap of this polytype and compare with theoretical results.</description>
