      <title>State-Space Dynamic Functional Regression for Multicurve Fixed Income Spread Analysis and Stress Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nelson-Siegel model is widely used in fixed income markets to produce yield curve dynamics. The multiple time-dependent parameter model conveniently addresses the level, slope, and curvature dynamics of the yield curves. In this study, we present a novel state-space functional regression model that incorporates a dynamic Nelson-Siegel model and functional regression formulations applied to multi-economy setting. This framework offers distinct advantages in explaining the relative spreads in yields between a reference economy and a response economy. To address the inherent challenges of model calibration, a kernel principal component analysis is employed to transform the representation of functional regression into a finite-dimensional, tractable estimation problem. A comprehensive empirical analysis is conducted to assess the efficacy of the functional regression approach, including an in-sample performance comparison with the dynamic Nelson-Siegel model. We conducted the stress testing analysis of yield curves term-structure within a dual economy framework. The bond ladder portfolio was examined through a case study focused on spread modelling using historical data for US Treasury and UK bonds.</description>

      <title>Evolving Dynamics: Bibliometric Insights into the Economics of the EU ETS Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to map the scientific production on the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) market from 2004 to 2024. By analyzing research articles collected from the Scopus database, this bibliometric review provides a comprehensive overview of the academic landscape surrounding the EU ETS. Utilizing the Bibliometrix package in R, we conducted an in-depth analysis of publication trends, key research themes, influential authors, and prominent journals in the field. Our findings reveal significant growth in scholarly interest, with notable peaks corresponding to major policy updates and economic events. The analysis highlights the most cited works and collaborative networks, offering insights into the evolution of research topics over the past two decades. This review serves as a valuable resource for researchers and policymakers, providing a detailed understanding of the academic contributions to the EU ETS market and identifying emerging trends and gaps in the literature. Through this bibliometric approach, we offer a nuanced perspective on the development and impact of the EU ETS in the context of global carbon markets and climate policy.</description>

      <title>Bayesian CART models for aggregate claim modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes three types of Bayesian CART (or BCART) models for aggregate claim amount, namely, frequency-severity models, sequential models and joint models. We propose a general framework for the BCART models applicable to data with multivariate responses, which is particularly useful for the joint BCART models with a bivariate response: the number of claims and aggregate claim amount. To facilitate frequency-severity modeling, we investigate BCART models for the right-skewed and heavy-tailed claim severity data by using various distributions. We discover that the Weibull distribution is superior to gamma and lognormal distributions, due to its ability to capture different tail characteristics in tree models. Additionally, we find that sequential BCART models and joint BCART models, which incorporate dependence between the number of claims and average severity, are beneficial and thus preferable to the frequency-severity BCART models in which independence is assumed. The effectiveness of these models' performance is illustrated by carefully designed simulations and real insurance data.</description>

      <title>Pump and Dumps in the Bitcoin Era: Real Time Detection of Cryptocurrency Market Manipulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.06610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last years, cryptocurrencies are increasingly popular. Even people who are not experts have started to invest in these securities and nowadays cryptocurrency exchanges process transactions for over 100 billion US dollars per month. However, many cryptocurrencies have low liquidity and therefore they are highly prone to market manipulation schemes. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of pump and dump schemes organized by communities over the Internet. We observe how these communities are organized and how they carry out the fraud. Then, we report on two case studies related to pump and dump groups. Lastly, we introduce an approach to detect the fraud in real time that outperforms the current state of the art, so to help investors stay out of the market when a pump and dump scheme is in action.</description>

      <title>Efficient convex PCA with applications to Wasserstein GPCA and ranked data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convex PCA, which was introduced in Bigot et al. (2017), modifies Euclidean PCA by restricting the data and the principal components to lie in a given convex subset of a Hilbert space. This setting arises naturally in many applications, including distributional data in the Wasserstein space of an interval, and ranked compositional data under the Aitchison geometry. Our contribution in this paper is threefold. First, we present several new theoretical results including consistency as well as continuity and differentiability of the objective function in the finite dimensional case. Second, we develop a numerical implementation of finite dimensional convex PCA when the convex set is polyhedral, and show that this provides a natural approximation of Wasserstein GPCA. Third, we illustrate our results with two financial applications, namely distributions of stock returns ranked by size and the capital distribution curve, both of which are of independent interest in stochastic portfolio theory. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.</description>
