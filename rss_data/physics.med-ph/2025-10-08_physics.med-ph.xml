      <title>A Novel Helical Thin-Film Flow Diverter: Design, Fabrication, and Computational Assessment of Hemodynamic Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow diversion has become a key treatment modality for selected intracranial aneurysms, relying on the principle that a dense mesh of stent wires disrupts blood flow into the aneurysm sac, promoting thrombosis and vessel reconstruction. Despite its clinical success, a subset of patients experiences incomplete occlusion or complications. This study investigates innovative helical thin-film implants (HTFIs), aiming to evaluate their flow-diverting efficacy. Highly resolved computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed on two representative patient-specific aneurysm models. Two HTFI design variants were tested at various configurations (two rolling angles and three deployment positions). A total of 28 unsteady hemodynamic simulations were performed, comparing six hemodynamically relevant parameters against the pre-interventional state and a conventional braided flow diverter. The HTFIs induced significant changes in intra-aneurysmal flow. Both designs performed similarly overall, with the shorter configurations (smaller rolling angle) demonstrating superior efficacy. These achieved average hemodynamic reductions of 52.2% and 58.4%, outperforming the benchmark braided flow diverter device (47.4%). Sensitivity to positioning was modest, with the best configuration showing an average variation of only 5.3%, suggesting good robustness despite the helical design's heterogeneous porosity. These findings indicate that HTFIs offer promising flow-diverting capabilities. With further refinement in design and hemodynamic optimization, these implants hold potential as a next-generation alternative for the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms, especially in applications requiring compatibility with smaller delivery systems.</description>

      <title>MC BTS: simultaneously resolving magnetization transfer effect and relaxation for multiple components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a signal acquisition and modeling framework for multi-component tissue quantification that encompasses transmit field inhomogeneity, multi-component relaxation and magnetization transfer (MT) effects. By applying off-resonance irradiation between excitation and acquisition within an RF-spoiled gradient-echo scheme, in combination with multiple echo-time acquisitions, both Bloch-Siegert shift and magnetization transfer effects are simultaneously induced while relaxation and spin exchange processes occur concurrently. Simulation results showed excellent agreement with the derived analytical signal equation across a wide range of flip angles and echo times. Monte Carlo analyses further validated that the three-pool parameter estimation pipeline performed robustly over various signal-to-noise ratio conditions. Multi-parameter fitting results from in vivo brain and knee studies yielded values consistent with previously reported literature. Collectively, these findings confirm that the proposed method can reliably characterize multi-component tissue parameters in macromolecule-rich environments while effectively compensating for $B_1^+$ inhomogeneity.</description>

      <title>Analytic timing calculations and timing limits with prompt photons, high-aspect-ratio crystals, and complex TOF-kernels in TOF-PET</title>

Abstract: Modeling the timing performance of light-based radiation detectors accurately is essential for optimizing time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET). We present an analytic framework that combines existing models to predict the timing behavior of high-aspect ratio crystals, including contributions from prompt photons such as Cherenkov radiation. This framework is built on a closed-form solution for optical light transport, convolved with the photodetector response and photon production characteristics. Using conditional and joint probability distributions, we compute the first-photon arrival time distribution for hybrid detectors with scintillation and Cherenkov light. The detection time distribution is then self-convolved to derive the time delay spectra and three timing metrics are used to characterize complex TOF kernels. Additionally, we perform Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound calculations with and without depth-of-interaction bias to evaluate the theoretical timing limits. Our analytic predictions align well with Monte Carlo simulations for BGO detectors under varying crystal thicknesses and single photon time resolution considering a digital photodetector. We show that the TOF shape is significantly affected by prompt photon statistics, crystal thickness, scintillation yield, and photodetector properties resulting in distinct metric-dependent timing performance. The proposed model enables rapid timing predictions for polished crystals, with the calculation time of a detector configuration in under a second, allowing for comprehensive parametric studies. This makes it a powerful tool for guiding detector development in fast-timing applications.</description>

      <title>Assessing (im)balance in signed brain networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many complex systems - be they financial, natural or social - are composed by units - such as stocks, neurons or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationships between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at tackling such an issue within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing: briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series share a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not - and, in case, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, the structure of the negative subgraph being more prone to inter-subject variability than the complementary, positive subgraph. At the mesoscopic level, instead, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.</description>
