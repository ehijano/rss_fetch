      <title>The X-ray luminosity function of stars observed with SRG/eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background diffuse X-ray emission is contributed in large part by the emission of point sources not individually resolved. While this is established since decades for the contribution of quasars to the diffuse emission above 1 keV energies, the possible contribution of undetected stars in the Milky Way to the softer band (0.5-1 keV) background emission is still poorly constrained. The overall unresolved X-ray flux from the stars is the product between the stellar spatial distribution in the Milky Way and the underlying X-ray luminosity function (XLF). In this work, we build the XLF of the stars and study its structure with respect to a set of main-sequence spectral types (F, G, K, M) and evolutionary stages (giants and white dwarfs). We build the XLF in volume-limited subsamples of increasing maximum distance and corresponding minimum X-ray luminosity using the HamStar catalog of X-ray emitting stars detected in the Western Galactic hemisphere with the extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) space observatory. We build an extinction-corrected Gaia color-magnitude diagram and decompose the XLF into the relative contribution of different groups of stars. We provide an empirical polynomial description of the XLF for the total sample and for the different stellar subgroups that can be used to estimate the unresolved contribution from the stars to the soft X-ray background of the Milky Way in a flux-limited survey.</description>

      <title>A Refined Orbital Ephemeris for the Intermediate Polar FO Aquarii and Evidence for a Period Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine more than 40 years of eclipse timings of the intermediate polar FO Aqr and derive new orbital ephemerides. The eclipse times are best fit with a second order polynomial, implying an $8\sigma$ detection of a period derivative. The results show that the orbital period of FO Aqr is currently increasing, with a derivative of $\dot{P}=6.65\pm0.81\times10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Investigating non-LTE abundances of Neodymium (Nd) in metal-poor FGK stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominant site(s) of the $r$-process are a subject of current debate. Ejecta from $r$-process enrichment events like kilonovae are difficult to directly measure, so we must instead probe abundances in metal-poor stars to constrain $r$-process models. This requires state-of-the-art Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) modeling, as LTE is a poor approximation for the low-opacity atmospheres of metal-poor giants. Neodymium (Nd) is a prominent $r$-process element detected in both near-infrared kilonovae spectra and spectra of metal-poor stars, so precise Nd stellar abundances are particularly needed to model kilonovae and constrain $r$-process sites. We thus constructed a Nd I / Nd II model atom to compute NLTE abundances in FGK metal-poor stars. We obtain $\mathrm{A(Nd)}_\odot = 1.44\pm0.05$, in agreement with the meteoritic value, when calibrating the model atom with a Drawin hydrogen collision factor of $S_H=0.1$. For a sample of metal-poor $r$-process enhanced stars with observed optical and near-infrared Nd II lines, we find NLTE Nd corrections in the range $-0.3$ to $0.3$ dex. Optical and UV lines have positive NLTE corrections, whereas H band lines have negative corrections. Additionally, we compute a large grid of NLTE corrections for 122 Nd II spectral lines ranging from the UV to the H band, for stellar parameters of typical metal-poor FGK dwarfs and giants with $-3.00\le\mbox{[Fe/H]}\le-1.00$ and $-2.0\le\mathrm{A(Nd)}\le2.0$. Within this grid, we find NLTE corrections ranging from $-0.3$ to $+0.5$ dex. Deviations from LTE are found to be strongest for blue lines with low excitation potentials in the most metal-poor giants.</description>

      <title>Tonalli: a 3D Magnetohydrodynamic Model, simplified Multi-species using Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium Approximation for the Solar Chromosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the development of the Tonalli code: a simplified multi-species (HI, HII, H-, and e) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model in Non-local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) focused on solar chromospheric conditions. This new model integrates two well established models, Newtonian CAFE (MHD) and PakalMPI (NLTE), through a self-convergence system that links the state equations used by both codes to calculate density, pressure and temperature, with the mean molecular weight ($\mu$) serving as a proxy. Newtonian CAFE computes the plasma variables using the ideal MHD while PakalMPI calculates the species densities of neutral Hydrogen (HI), protons (HII), negative Hydrogen (H-), and electrons (ne) under the NLTE approximation. We used Tonalli to test the stability of the hydrostatic C7 model, covering 3000 km of the solar chromosphere with a vertical constant field of 30 Gauss and a vertical constant gravity field of 274.0 ms-2. As a result, Tonalli generates 3D cubes of densities, temperature, pressure, mean molecular weight, and the departure coefficient of Hydrogen in its first energy level b1, providing a detailed representation of the ionization states of the plasma at chromosphere altitudes. Despite the fact that MHD conditions can lead to numerical diffusion of the plasma, we demonstrate robustness and consistency, and self-convergence of the model with the relative error of electron density reaching values of $3.7x10^{-7}$.</description>

      <title>Luminous Blue Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) are a class of massive blue supergiants exhibiting irregular and eruptive instability, sometimes accompanied by extreme mass loss. While they have often been considered to be a brief but very important transitional phase in the evolution of massive single stars, mounting evidence suggests that LBVs are actually a phenomenon associated with binary star evolution by way of mass gainers and mergers. If true, this would leave single massive stars without a way to shed their H envelopes and become Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, requiring a revision of our most basic paradigm of massive star evolution. Understanding their properties and role in evolution is therefore extremely important. The eruptive mass loss of LBVs is also invoked to account for some of the most extraordinary supernovae (SNe) with dense circumstellar material (CSM), which again contradicts the standard single star scenario where LBVs are massive stars in transition to the WR phase. This chapter reviews many aspects of LBVs including terminology and classification, the physical properties of the stars, their mass loss, and their variability, as well as their observed companion stars, implications of their surrounding stellar populations, and their circumstellar nebulae. These are put into context with proposed evolutionary scenarios and possible mechanisms that drive their eruptive variability.</description>

      <title>KIC 9272276: An Extreme Low Mass Ratio Red Nova Progenitor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric analysis of KIC 9272276 (K9272), a low-mass contact binary system, is
  presented. We find it to be an example of an extreme low mass ratio system that satisfies the current
  theoretical criteria for a potential red-nova progenitor. V band photometry of the system was modelled
  using the Wilson-Devenney code and we find the system to be in marginal contact with a mass ratio of
  0.081. The estimated mass of the primary component is one solar mass and the theoretical instability
  mass ratio range, accounting for both metallicity and age, is well above the modelled mass ratio at
  0.09- 0.101. We find no evidence of a potential third light contamination and discuss other findings
  confirming our analysis.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Fullerenes in the Shell of Candidate Luminous Blue Variable WRAY 16-232</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of fullerene in the circumstellar environment of WRAY~16-232, a strong candidate luminous blue variable. Multiple pointings of archival \textit{Spitzer} IRS spectra reveal, for the first time, the presence of prominent vibrational bands of C$_{60}$ at 17.4 and 18.9~$\mu$m in an LBV envelope, along with the strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon features. These observations suggest that, despite the harsh radiative conditions, large carbonaceous molecules can form, process and survive in the ejecta of massive stars. Complementary optical spectroscopy with SALT HRS shows multiple P\,Cygni profiles in H$\alpha$, He\,\textsc{i}, and Fe\,\textsc{ii} lines, which are indicative of a dense, expanding wind and substantial mass loss. Furthermore, analysis of decade long photometric data shows short-term brightness variations of $\sim$ 0.5~mag. These results not only reinforce the classification of WRAY~16-232 as a strong LBV candidate but also provide new insights into the mechanisms of dust formation and the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium by massive stars. We discuss various scenarios for fullerene formation in such environments, and find that shock processing due to wind-wind interactions could be playing a vital role.The shell of WRAY~16-232 has an ideal UV field strength and the time scales appears to match with shock processing timescales. The results highlight the need for further high spatial/spectral resolution and temporal observations to confirm the formation and survival scenario of C$_{60}$ in its shell.</description>

      <title>V717 Andromedae: An Active Low Mass Ratio Contact Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-band photometric analysis of the contact binary V717 Andromedae (V717 And) is presented.
  The system is found to be an extreme low mass ratio system (q = 0.197) with high inclination
  (i = 84.5 deg), moderate degree of contact (27%) and near equal temperatures of the components.
  Period analysis of survey photometry spanning over 6300 days reveals no significant change. Although
  the system does not demonstrate a significant O'Connell effect there are a number of other markers
  strongly suggesting the system is chromospherically active. Orbital analysis indicates that the system
  is stable and not a merger candidate.</description>

      <title>Witnessing Magnetic Reconnection in Tangled Superpenumbral Fibrils Around a Sunspot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional magnetic reconnection is a fundamental plasma process crucial for heating the solar corona and generating the solar wind, but resolving and characterizing it on the Sun remains challenging. Using high-quality data from the Chinese New Vacuum Solar Telescope, the Solar Dynamics Observatory, and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, this work presents highly suggestive direct imaging evidence of magnetic reconnection during the untangling of braided magnetic structures above a sunspot. These magnetic structures, visible as bright superpenumbral threads in extreme ultraviolet passbands, initially bridge opposite-polarity magnetic fluxes and then gradually tangle in their middle section. Magnetic extrapolation reveals the fibrils to form a small flux rope that is twisted and braided, possibly created by persistent and complex photospheric motions. During untangling, repetitive reconnection events occur inside the flux rope, accompanied by transient plasma heating, bidirectional outflowing blobs, and signatures of nanojets. Emission analysis reveals that the outflowing blobs are multi-thermal structures with temperatures well below 1 MK, undergoing rapid cooling and leaving emission imprints in H{\alpha} images. The measured reconnection angles indicate that 16%-22% of the magnetic field along each thread is anti-parallel, with the remaining field acting as a guide field. The estimated energy released during these reconnection events is comparable to nanoflares, which can be powered by up to 6% of the magnetic energy stored in the anti-parallel field. This work presents a textbook example of magnetic flux rope reconnection in the solar atmosphere, providing new insights into fine-scale energy release processes within sunspot superpenumbral fibrils.</description>

      <title>Improved reconstruction of the century-long solar magnetic field by incorporating morphological asymmetry in sunspots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the solar magnetic field is important for understanding long-term solar activity and space weather, but it is challenging due to limited observations, especially near the poles. The Surface Flux Transport (SFT) model simulates how magnetic flux moves across the solar surface and contributes to the polar field, but it parametrizes emerged sunspots as simple symmetric bipolar regions and needs improvement by including more realistic sunspot features. In this study, we reconstruct the century-long evolution of the solar magnetic field, including the polar regions, using an improved SFT model. We incorporate cycle-dependent morphological asymmetry between leading and following sunspots, along with observationally derived tilt angles and sunspot area data for a century (1913-2016), to better represent magnetic flux transport and investigate the impact of asymmetry on polar field development. To study morphological asymmetry, we consider two cases: first, a long-term asymmetry factor calculated from the ratio of leading and following sunspot areas spanning over a century; second, the temporal asymmetry factor observed during solar cycle 23 applied to every solar cycle. Our simulated magnetic flux transport with inclusion of morphological asymmetry for both cases gets improved compared to the no asymmetry case in terms of enhanced low and mid-latitude magnetic flux and matches closely with observations. The simulated polar fields with asymmetry also show a better agreement with polar field observations for most cycles, particularly in capturing the timing of the polar field reversals and the peak amplitude during solar minima, which has severe consequences in solar cycle prediction</description>

      <title>Probing the large-scale magnetic field inside the Sun from three decades of observed surface magnetograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-weather and disturbances in the heliosphere are manifestations of the solar magnetic field, which is solely driven by the interior dynamo, and constraining the solar interior magnetic field and its oscillatory behavior is one of the major challenges in solar physics. Observationally, none of the techniques, including helioseismology, are able to provide an estimation of the interior magnetic field. We reconstruct, for the first time, the dynamics of the interior large-scale magnetic fields by assimilating observed line-of-sight photospheric magnetogram data from MDI/SOHO &amp; HMI/SDO along with helioseismic differential rotation data for three decades (1996-2025) into a 3D dynamo model. Our data-driven model successfully reproduces key observational features such as the surface butterfly diagram, polar field evolution, and axial dipole moment. The reconstructed interior field dominated by toroidal component exhibits an equatorward migration and reproduces the realistic amplitude and modulation of cycles 23-25. The non-axisymmetric behaviour of the interior toroidal field becomes less prominent as we move deep towards the tachocline. A strong correlation between the simulated toroidal field and sunspot number/area establishes our 3D magnetogram-driven model as a robust predictive model of the solar cycle.</description>

      <title>Constraining the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ from nearby field stars using Gaia DR3 photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of accurately determining the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio, $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$, from Gaia DR3 photometry for nearby low-mass main sequence field stars. We selected a sample of 2770 nearby MS stars from the Gaia DR3 catalogue, covering a Gaia $M_G$ absolute magnitude range of 6.0 to 6.8 mag. We computed a dense grid of isochrones, with $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ varying from 0.4 to 3.2. These models were then used to fit the observations using the SCEPtER pipeline. The fitted values indicated that $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ values of $1.5 \pm 0.5$ were dequate for most stars. However, several clues suggested caution ought to be taken in interpreting this result. Chief among these concerns is the trend of decreasing $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ with increasing $M_G$ magnitude, as well as the discrepancy between the red and blue parts of the observations. This result is further supported by our additional analysis of mock data, which were sampled and fitted from the same isochrone grid. In the mock data, no such trend emerged, while the uncertainty remained as large as 0.7. The robustness of our conclusions was confirmed by repeating the estimation using isochrones with Gaia magnitudes derived from different atmospheric models and by adopting a different stellar evolution code for stellar model computation. In both cases, the results changed drastically, clustering at $\Delta Y/\Delta Z \approx 0.4$, which is at the lower end of the allowed values. Considering the current uncertainties affecting stellar model computations, it appears that adopting field stars for calibration is not a viable approach, even when adopting precise Gaia photometry.</description>

      <title>FAST search for circumstellar atomic hydrogen. IV. bubbles associated with planetary nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the bubbles generated by the interaction between asymptotic giant branch stellar outflows and the interstellar medium (ISM) is pivotal for elucidating the mechanism by which evolved low- to intermediate-mass stars enrich the ISM with heavy elements. Using archival datasets from the Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot survey and the Galactic Arecibo L-Band Array \ion{H}{1} survey, we have identified 14 bubbles within interstellar atomic hydrogen (\ion{H}{1}) maps, each showing evidence of potential association with planetary nebulae (PNe).We pursue two primary objectives centered on the identified ISM bubbles and their association with PNe. First, leveraging the calibrated distance measurements of PNe from Gaia Data Release 3, we utilize these ISM bubbles as observational tracers to investigate and constrain the Galactic rotation curve. Second, we note that distance determinations for some PNe remain unreliable, partly because their central stars are obscured by extended nebular envelopes or are misidentified. Therefore, we develop a novel methodological framework to derive kinematic distances for PNe by leveraging the velocities of their associated ISM bubbles and constraints from the Galactic rotation curve.</description>

      <title>M3DIS -- A grid of 3D radiation-hydrodynamics stellar atmosphere models for stellar surveys. II. Carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the origin and evolution of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars is key to tracing the Galaxy's early chemical enrichment. We investigate how realistic 3D radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) model atmospheres affect carbon abundances in CEMP stars and implications for their classification and Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We focus on biases from traditional 1D hydrostatic models. We use the M3DIS code to compute 3D RHD model atmospheres for main-sequence and sub-giant stars over a wide range of metallicities and carbon enhancements. Synthetic spectra of the CH G-band are calculated with 3D radiative transfer and compared to spectra from classical 1D MARCS models. We derive abundance corrections and apply them to a large SAGA database sample to quantify effects on the carbon abundance distribution and CEMP classification. Our new 3D CEMP models predict cooler upper atmospheric layers than in 1D models, resulting in stronger CH absorption and lower inferred carbon abundances by up to -0.9 dex at the lowest metallicities. Carbon enhancement in the atmosphere itself increases molecular opacities and leads to radiative re-heating, partly offsetting adiabatic cooling in 3D models and reducing 3D-1D abundance corrections. Applying these corrections lowers the CEMP fraction by up to 20% below [Fe/H]=-3 and alters the relative contribution of CEMP sub-classes. The fraction of CEMP-no stars increases while the number of CEMP-r/s stars decreases, due to the downward revision of absolute carbon abundances. These changes bring the Galactic carbon distribution into better agreement with GCE models assuming a 20% contribution from faint supernovae. Realistic model atmospheres are essential to reliably reconstruct the Galaxy's early chemical enrichment history.</description>

      <title>Models of Collisionless Quasineutral Solar Wind Current Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In situ measurements of kinetic scale current sheets in the solar wind show that they are often approximately force-free although the plasma beta is of order one. They frequently display systematic asymmetric and anti-correlated spatial variations of their particle density and temperature across the current sheet, leaving the plasma pressure essentially uniform. These observations of asymmetries have previously been modelled theoretically by adding additional terms to both the ion and electron distribution functions of self-consistent force-free collisionless current sheet models with constant density and temperature profiles. In this paper we present the results of a modification of these models in which only the electron distribution function has a term added to it, whereas the ion distribution function is kept as a thermal (Maxwellian) distribution function. In this case the nonlinear quasineutrality condition no longer has a simple analytical solution and therefore has to be solved alongside Amp\`ere's law. We find that while the magnetic field remains approximately force-free, the non-zero quasineutral electric field gives rise to an additional spatial substructure of the plasma density inside the current sheet. We briefly discuss the potential relation between our theoretical findings and current sheet observations.</description>

      <title>The Outbursting YSOs Catalogue (OYCAT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: YSOs can display unpredictable and high-amplitude rises in brightness that can last from a few months to possibly over 100 years. These types of outbursts are explained by large changes in the mass accretion rate from the disk onto the central star. The outbursts support to a model of star formation (episodic accretion) where stars would spend most of their lifetimes accreting at low rates, and gain most of their mass through these short-lived accretion outbursts. The universality of episodic accretion, as well as its potential impact on stellar and planetary formation are still under debate. Improvement on the statistics of the members of the eruptive class is needed to better understand the episodic accretion phenomenon and its universality across different mass regimes and environments. In this paper we collect published information on the spectroscopic and photometric characteristics of 174 YSOs confirmed to belong to the eruptive variable class. We classify these objects into five different sub-classes (we find 49 FUor, 20 FUor-like, 16 EX Lupi-type, 81 Peculiar/V1647 Ori-like/MNors and 8 Periodic YSOs). The classification follows what has been done previously in the literature, and it is not an attempt to redefine these classes. In addition, we present a list of 18 embedded, and 6 massive YSOs, as additional categories of eruptive variable YSOs. Due to the complexity and/or faintness of these systems, it is hard to place them into the original classification scheme of this class of variable YSOs. Finally, we present a separate list of 355 candidate eruptive variable YSOs, which either lack spectroscopic information or the available spectroscopic data is not sufficient for an unambiguous classification. The online catalogue of confirmed and candidate eruptive YSOs will be maintained and updated in the future to serve as an important reference for the star formation community.</description>

      <title>Avalanches in Magnetohydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scale invariance is a hallmark of many natural systems, including solar flares, where energy release spans a vast range of scales. Recent computational advances, at the level of both algorithmics and hardware, have enabled high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations to span multiple scales, offering new insights into magnetic energy dissipation processes. Here, we study scale invariance of magnetic energy dissipation in two distinct MHD simulations. Current sheets are identified and analyzed over time. Results demonstrate that dissipative events exhibit scale invariance, with power-law distributions characterizing their energy dissipation and lifetimes. Remarkably, these distributions are consistent across the two simulations, despite differing numerical and physical setups, suggesting universality in the process of magnetic energy dissipation. Comparisons between the evolution of dissipation regions reveals distinct growth behaviors in high plasma-beta regions (convective zone) and low plasma-beta regions (atmosphere). The latter display spatiotemporal dynamics similar to those of avalanche models, suggesting self-organized criticality and a common universality class.</description>

      <title>The Stellar Content of NGC~3603 Revisited: Is the IMF Top Heavy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of the resolved stellar populations of young massive clusters have shown that the slope of the initial mass function appears to be the same everywhere, with no dependence on stellar density or metallicity. At the same time, studies of integrated properties of galaxies usually conclude that the IMF does vary, and must be top-heavy in starburst regions. In order to investigate this, we have carried out a long-term project to characterize the massive star content of NGC 3603, the nearest giant HII region, known to have a rich population of massive stars. We used both ground-based and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging to obtain photometry, and employed Gaia to establish membership. We obtained spectra of 128 stars using the Magellan 6.5~m telescope and HST, and combine these data to produce a reddening map. After analyzing the data in the same way as we have for 25 other star-forming regions in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, we find that the IMF slope of NGC 3603 is quite normal compared to other clusters, with Gamma=-0.9+/-0.1. If anything, there are fewer very high mass (&gt;65Mo) stars than one would expect by extrapolation from lower masses. This slope is also indistinguishable from what several studies have shown for R136 in the LMC, an even richer region. We speculate that the depreciation of the highest mass bins in NGC 3603, but not in R136, may indicate that it is harder to form extremely massive stars at the higher metallicity of the Milky Way compared to that of the LMC.</description>

      <title>Hidden massive eclipsing binaries in red supergiant systems: The hierarchical triple system KQ Puppis and other candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25168v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of massive stars are part of binary systems that may interact during their evolution. This has important consequences for systems in which one star develops into a Red supergiant (RSG); however, not many RSGs are known binaries. We aim to better constrain the properties of some of the known RSGs in binaries.
  We first focus on the VV Cephei type RSG KQ Pup (RSG+B-type companion, orbital period of 26 yr), where we have enough data to constrain the system's properties. We use archival photometry and UV spectroscopy, along with newly taken optical spectra and interferometric data. For KQ Pup, as well as for all other Galactic RSGs, we also analyzed the available TESS data.
  Using TESS photometry, we discovered eclipses with a period of $17.2596 \: \rm d$, associated with the hot B companion, making it a Ba+Bb pair. Meanwhile, the detection of the hydrogen Br$\gamma$ line with VLTI-GRAVITY enabled us to track the orbital motion of the KQ Pup Ba+Bb pair and thus to determine the astrometric orbit. The dynamical masses agree with independent estimates from asteroseismology and evolutionary models. The results give a mass of $ \sim 9 \: \rm M_{\odot} $ for the RSG and $ \sim 14 \: \rm M_{\odot} $ for the sum of the hot components Ba+Bb. The observed properties of the system are compatible with a coeval hierarchical triple-star, where we constrain the minimum mass of KQ Pup Bb as $ \gtrsim 1.2 \: \rm M_{\odot} $.
  The variability of Balmer lines and the detection of Br$\gamma$ represent a strong signature of Wind Roche Lobe Overflow, with enhanced signatures of disk-accretion to the Ba+Bb pair during the periastron. Meanwhile, TESS light curves show that about $\sim 10 \%$ of known Galactic binary RSGs may be eclipsing hierarchical triple systems, which suggests that a large fraction of other binary RSGs could also be triples.</description>

      <title>Ross 458c: Gas Giant or Brown Dwarf?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ross 458c is a widely separated planetary mass companion at a distance of 1100 AU from its host binary, Ross 458AB. It is a member of a class of very low-mass companions at distances of hundreds to thousands of AU from their host stars. We aim to constrain Ross 458c's formation history by fitting its near-IR spectrum to models to constrain its composition. If its composition is similar to its host star, we infer that it likely formed through turbulent fragmentation of the same molecular cloud that formed the host. If its composition is enhanced in heavy elements relative to the host, this lends evidence to formation in the disk and subsequent migration to its current separation. Here, we present high-resolution (R$\sim$2700) emission spectra of Ross 458c with JWST NIRSpec Fixed Slit in the F070LP, F100LP, and F170LP filters from 0.8 to 3.1 $\mu$m. We fit these spectra using both grids of forward models (Sonora Bobcat, Sonora Elf Owl, and ExoREM) and atmospheric retrievals (POSEIDON). We also constrain the composition of Ross 458AB by fitting an archival SpeX spectrum with PHOENIX forward models. The forward model grids prefer an enhanced atmospheric metallicity for Ross 458c relative to the host, but our retrievals return a metallicity consistent with the host within 1$\sigma$. Our results offer new insights into the formation history of Ross 458c, as well as the efficacy of fitting forward model grids versus retrievals to derive atmospheric properties of directly imaged companions.</description>

      <title>Induced-Flare Candidates from the TESS Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The empirical underabundance of close-in planets with radii 1.5-2.0 times that of the Earth, referred to as the radius irradiation valley, may be linked to the inability of gas dwarfs under certain conditions to retain their volatile envelopes due to photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. In either case, the extent to which a planet can preserve its atmosphere critically depends on poorly understood planetary magnetism. An effective probe of planetary magnetic fields is the interaction between a star and its close-in planet, where the planet magnetically interacts with its host, inducing flares as it moves near its periastron within the Alfv\'en surface of its host star. We construct a pipeline, \textsc{ardor}, to detect and characterize potentially planet-induced flares in time-series photometric data using a physically motivated forward model of star-planet interactions, with a focus on recovering flares located near the noise floor. We perform extensive injection-recovery simulations to determine our sensitivity to flares correlating with the planetary phase over a range of stellar types and orbital architectures. We identify one close-in, eccentric ($e=0.18$) system, TOI-1062\,b, which exhibits flaring during periastron consistent with being induced with $p_{KS}=2.2\times10^{-5}$ and a $5.1\sigma$ detection through unbinned likelihood analysis and goodness-of-fit tests. We also identify an additional eccentric ($e=0.363$) candidate, Gliese 49b, which exhibits moderately significant ($2.5\sigma$) flare clustering at periastron, requiring additional photometric observations to confirm its significance. TOI-1062b and Gliese 49b are promising candidates for induced flares, underscoring the need for radio and UV follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Masses for 23 Pre-Main Sequence Stars in Upper Scorpius: A Critical Test of Stellar Evolutionary Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present dynamical masses for 23 pre-main sequence K- and M-type stars in the Upper Scorpius star-forming region. These masses were derived from the Keplerian rotation of CO disk gas using the MCMC radiative-transfer package pdspy and a flared-disk model with 15 free parameters. We compare our dynamical masses to those derived from five pre-main sequence evolutionary models, and find that most models consistently underestimate stellar mass by $\gtrsim$25%. Models with updated treatment of stellar magnetic fields are a notable exception $-$ they consistently return stellar masses in good agreement with the dynamical results. We find that the magnetic models' performance is valid even at low masses, in contrast with some literature results suggesting they may overestimate stellar mass for M$_{\star}$ $\lesssim$ 0.6 M$_{\odot}$. Our results are consistent with dynamical versus isochronal evaluations for younger samples (e.g. Taurus, 1-3 Myr), and extend the systematic evaluation of stellar evolutionary models up to stars $\sim$11 Myr in age. Finally, we derive disk dust masses to evaluate whether using dynamical masses versus isochronal masses changes the slope of the log(M$_{dust}$)$-$log(M$_{\star}$) relation. We derive a slightly shallower relation using dynamical masses versus isochronal masses, but the slopes of these relations agree within uncertainties. In all cases, we derive a steeper-than-linear relation for log(M$_{dust}$)$-$log(M$_{\star}$), consistent with previous literature results for Upper Sco.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption of a magnetized star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes in galactic centers (TDEs) are now being actively studied both theoretically and observationally. They are observed throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to gamma-rays. It is still unclear how the emission is produced and, in particular, what is the role of the magnetic field of the disrupted star. There are many ways how magnetic fields might affect the dynamics of a TDE. They are likely responsible for the angular momentum transfer in the accretion disk formed at later stages and thus affect the radiation associated with the disk. Magnetic fields are also an important requirement for the formation of relativistic jets, that are seen in some TDEs. The goal of our study is to connect the field within the star to the fields that develop during the fallback and disk accretion. Using the fluid-dynamic code Athena++, we perform a large-scale three-dimensional adaptive-mesh magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a tidal disruption of a magnetized star. The fallback stream returning to the black-hole vicinity after the disruption contains smooth magnetic fields aligned with the stream lines. Formation of a nozzle shock near the pericenter of the initial orbit leads to a turbulent eccentric disk-like structure where the field is amplified and entangled on the local dynamic time scales up to approximate equipartition. The resulting field is mildly anisotropic and has a typical length several times smaller than the pericenter distance. The properties of the field are consistent with the early stages of turbulent dynamo.</description>

      <title>The Orbital Eccentricities of Planets in the Kinematic Thin and Thick Galactic Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbital eccentricity distribution of exoplanets is shaped by a combination of dynamical processes, reflecting both formation conditions and long-term evolution. Probing the orbital dynamics of planets in the kinematic thin and thick Galactic disks provides insight into the degree to which stellar and Galactic environmental factors affect planet formation and evolution pathways. The classification of host stars in Galactic kinematic terms constitutes a potentially useful axis for the interpretation of orbital eccentricity, when included together with stellar metallicity and age. Leveraging the photoeccentric effect, we constrain orbital eccentricities for the sample of Kepler planets and candidates orbiting F, G, K and M dwarf stars. With Gaia astrometry, inferred Galactic phase space information, and kinematic disk criteria calibrated on stellar chemical abundances, we probabilistically associate each planet host with the kinematic thin or thick Galactic disks. We then fit the underlying eccentricity distributions for the single- and multi-transit populations. We find that for single-transiting planets, kinematic thick disk planets exhibit higher eccentricities than thin disk planets, yet we find no such difference among multis. We determine that the difference in eccentricity is unlikely to be caused solely by the effects of host stellar metallicity or giant planet occurrence. We situate these findings in the context of known eccentricity relations, including its relationships with planet multiplicity, radius and metallicity. We suggest comprehensive analyses to disentangle these results from the effects of poorly understood star-planet relationships, such as that between stellar age and planetary orbital dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The Gaia mission's third data release recorded low-resolution spectra for about 100 000 white dwarf candidates. A small subset of these spectra show evidence of characteristic broad Ca II absorption features, implying the accretion of rocky material by so-called polluted white dwarfs -- important probes of the composition of exoplanetary material. Several supervised and unsupervised data-intensive methods have recently been applied to identify polluted white dwarfs from the Gaia spectra. We present a comparison of these methods, along with the first application of $t$-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding ($t$SNE) to this dataset. We find that $t$SNE outperforms the similar technique Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), isolating over 50% more high-confidence polluted candidates, including 39 new candidates which are not selected by any other method investigated and which have not been observed at higher resolution. Supervised methods benefit greatly from data labels provided by earlier works, selecting many known polluted white dwarfs which are missed by unsupervised methods. Our work provides a useful case study in the selection of members of rare classes from a large, sporadically labelled dataset, with applications across astronomy.</description>

      <title>Polarization at millimeter wavelengths caused by drifting grains in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the evolution of protoplanetary disks, dust grains start to grow, form larger particles, settle to the midplane, and rearrange the disk, mainly by the inward radial drift. Because of this, dust pebbles with an irregular shape usually align mechanically and thus cause polarization signatures in their thermal radiation due to dichroic emission or absorption. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the potential to trace the impact of mechanical grain alignment in protoplanetary disks on the observed degree and orientation of linear polarization at millimeter wavelengths. We combined 3D radiation hydrodynamical simulations to determine the density distribution and the velocity field of gas and dust particles, Monte Carlo dust-gas interaction simulations to calculate the mechanical alignment of dust in a gas flow, and, finally, 3D Monte Carlo polarized radiative transfer simulations to obtain synthetic polarimetric observations. We find that large grains, which contribute the most to the net polarization, are potentially mechanically aligned in the protoplanetary disk under the effect of the vertical shear instability (VSI). Thereby, the drift velocity is parallel to the rotational disk axis. Assuming oblate dust grains that are aligned with their short axis parallel to the direction of the drift velocity, the resulting polarization is usually along the major axis of the disk. This is in contrast to typical drift models that propose either a radial or azimuthal drift velocity component. If hydrodynamical instabilities, such as the VSI, dominate the kinematics in protoplanetary disks, the mechanical alignment of dust is a promising mechanism for grain alignment in these systems. In that case, the resulting millimeter polarization allows us to trace the orientation of aligned millimeter-sized grains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the cross section for radiative capture $^3$He$(\alpha,\gamma)^7$Be at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). At this order of perturbation, momentum dependent two-body currents make their first appearance. We provide a model-independent construction of these currents from gauge and Galilean invariance, where the general framework for constructing higher-order two-body currents in low-energy effective field theories becomes evident. The $^3$He$(\alpha,\gamma)^7$Be astrophysical S-factor $S_{34}(0)= 0.564^{+0.17}_{-0.015}$ keV b is obtained from a Bayesian analysis at NNLO, with an additional nominal theoretical uncertainty $\pm0.017$ keV b of 3%.</description>

      <title>Stellar flare detection in XMM-Newton with gradient boosted trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The EXTraS project, based on data collected with the XMM-Newton observatory, provided us with a vast amount of light curves for X-ray sources. For each light curve, EXTraS also provided us with a set of features (https://extras.inaf.it). We extract from the EXTraS database a tabular dataset of 31,832 variable sources by 108 features. Of these, 13,851 sources were manually labeled as stellar flares or non-flares based on direct visual inspection. We employ a supervised learning approach to produce a catalog of stellar flares based on our dataset, releasing it to the community. We leverage explainable AI tools and interpretable features to better understand our classifier. We train a gradient boosting classifier on 80\% of the data for which labels are available. We compute permutation feature importance scores, visualize feature space using UMAP, and analyze some false positive and false negative data points with the help of Shapley additive explanations -- an AI explainability technique used to measure the importance of each feature in determining the classifier's prediction for each instance. On the test set made up of the remainder 20\% of our labeled data, we obtain an accuracy of 97.1\%, with a precision of 82.4\% and a recall of 73.3\%. Our classifier outperforms a simple criterion based on fitting the light curve with a flare template and significantly surpasses a gradient-boosted classifier trained only on model-independent features. False positives appear related to flaring light curves that are not associated with a stellar counterpart, while false negatives often correspond to multiple flares or otherwise peculiar or noisy curves. We apply our trained classifier to currently unlabeled sources, releasing the largest catalog of X-ray stellar flares to date. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Interstellar Dust-Catalyzed Molecular Hydrogen Formation Enabled by Nuclear Quantum Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) is one of the key chemical species that controls and shapes a wide spectrum of astrophysical processes ranging from galaxy evolution to planet formation. Although the catalyzation on dust grain surfaces is considered as the dominant formation channel of H$_2$ in the interstellar medium (ISM), which could nonetheless suffer from the Boltzmann factor suppression at low temperatures. Here we demonstrate that quantum tunneling can dominate the H$_2$ formation process, effectively resolving the long-standing efficiency problem across a wide range of temperatures. By employing the path integral method in hybrid Monte Carlo simulations to account for nuclear quantum effects (NQEs), we quantitatively identify that the tunneling of hydrogen atoms maintains relatively stable efficiencies even at temperatures below 50 K on both graphitic and silicate grain surfaces. The potential barriers associated with chemisorption/desorption and two-H association, rather than diffusion and hopping, are the dominant factors governing the actual reaction efficiency at low temperatures. These findings provide a solid physical foundation for molecule formation, which historically relied on ad-hoc formation rate multipliers to explain observed rates. The quantitative rates also offer new methodologies for observational constraints on H$_2$ formation and destruction, thereby enabling more accurate astrophysical models and interpretations on interstellar molecular materials.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Follow-Up of Candidate Runaway Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Runaway stars are characterized by higher space velocities than typical field stars. They are presumed to have been ejected from their birth places by one or more energetic mechanisms, including supernova explosions. Accurate radial velocities are essential for investigating their origin, by tracing back their Galactic orbits to look for close encounters in space and in time with neutron stars and young associations. While most studies of runaways have focused on OB stars, later-type stars have also been considered on occasion. Here we report the results of a long-term high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring program with the goal of providing accurate radial velocities for 188 runaway candidates of spectral type A and later, proposed by Tetzlaff et al. (2011). We obtained multiple measurements over a period of about 13 yr to guard against the possibility that some may be members of binary or multiple systems, adding archival observations going back another 25 yr in some cases. We report new spectroscopic orbital solutions for more than three dozen systems. Many more are also found to be binaries based on available astrometric information. A small-scale study carried out here to trace back the paths of our targets together with those of four well-studied, optically-visible neutron stars among the so-called Magnificent Seven, resulted in no credible encounters.</description>

      <title>Energy Cascade and Damping in Fast-Mode Compressible Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compressible turbulence governs energy transfer across scales in space and astrophysical systems. Capturing both the turbulence cascade and damping is therefore crucial for models of energy conversion, plasma heating, and particle transport in diverse plasma environments, but remains challenging. Progress is constrained by two unresolved fundamental questions: the persistence of the turbulence cascade in the presence of shocks and discontinuities, and the validity of classical wave theories under strong nonlinearity. In particular, it remains unclear whether meaningful cascade dynamics can be defined in compressible turbulence with phase steepening, and whether frameworks developed for monochromatic waves remain applicable to complex, broadband fluctuations. Using large-scale, high-resolution kinetic simulations, we analyze turbulence-particle interactions, which are beyond the capability of standard magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We show that compressible turbulence damping at MHD scales in quantitative agreement with transit-time damping theory, even in fully developed nonlinear states. Moreover, the cascade persists despite the generation of shocks and discontinuities due to phase steepening, revealing a surprising robustness of cross-scale energy transfer under extreme conditions. We further provide the spectral expression of compressible turbulence. These results close a long-standing gap in the physics of compressible turbulence and establish a robust foundation for turbulence modeling from the heliosphere to galaxies.</description>

      <title>A Catalog of M&amp;M Eclipsing Binaries with TESS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 1292 low-mass (M&amp;M) short-period eclipsing binaries observed by the TESS mission. Eclipsing binaries are useful for many aspects of stellar astrophysics, including calibrating stellar models, and catalogs of eclipsing binary properties provide context for population-level inferences. In this work, we present our selection criteria for our catalog, along with steps taken to characterize the orbital and physical properties of our EBs. We further detail crucial steps in vetting our catalog to ensure that the systems in our catalog have a high likelihood of being true M&amp;Ms. Our sample consists primarily of binaries with short-period, circular orbits and often manifest as high-mass ratio "twin" M&amp;Ms. We find that our sample of M&amp;Ms does not exhibit the same excess of contact binaries that similar samples of solar-type binaries do. Using a novel statistical approach, we find a tidal circularization period of approximately 2.0 days for these binaries, which is significantly shorter than the value typically given in the literature of 7 days. Finally, we explore the prospects for additional companions to our M&amp;Ms. Future avenues include spectroscopic follow-up of bright M&amp;Ms to better-characterize low-mass stellar properties and a deeper assessment of the presence of tertiary companions.</description>

      <title>Solar Observation with MeerKAT: Demonstration of Technical Readiness and Initial Science Highlight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar radio emissions offer unique diagnostic insights into the solar corona. However, their dynamic and multiscale nature, along with several orders of magnitude variations in intensity, pose significant observational challenges. To date, at gigahertz frequencies, MeerKAT stands out globally with high potential of producing high-fidelity, spectroscopic snapshot images of the Sun, enabled by its dense core, high sensitivity, and broad frequency coverage. Yet, as a telescope originally designed for observing faint galactic and extragalactic sources, observing the Sun at the boresight of the telescope requires customized observing strategies and calibration methods. This work demonstrates the technical readiness of MeerKAT for solar observations at the boresight of the telescope in the UHF (580-1015 MHz) and L-band (900-1670 MHz) frequency ranges, including optimized modes, a dedicated calibration scheme, and a tailored, entirely automated calibration and imaging pipeline. The quality of solar images is validated through morphological comparisons with the solar images at other wavelengths. Several unique early science results showcase the potential of this new capability of MeerKAT. Once fully commissioned and operational, this will unlock novel solar studies, significantly expand the scientific portfolio of MeerKAT, and lay the groundwork for solar observations with the mid-frequency telescope of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory, for which MeerKAT serves as a precursor.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved protoplanetary disk physics in DQ Tau with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accretion variability is ubiquitous in YSOs. While large outbursts may strongly affect the disk, the effects of moderate bursts are less understood. We aim to study the physical response of the disk around the eccentric binary system DQ Tau to its periodic accretion changes. We organized a multi-wavelength campaign centered on four JWST/MIRI spectra. We targeted three periastrons (high accretion state) and one apastron (quiescence). We used optical and near-infrared spectroscopy and photometry to measure how the accretion luminosity varies. We decomposed the multi-epoch SEDs into stellar, accretion, and rim components. We fitted the solid-state features using various opacity curves and the molecular features using slab models. We find the inner disk of DQ Tau to be highly dynamic. The temperature, luminosity, and location of the inner dust rim vary in response to the movement of stars and the L_acc variations. This causes variable shadowing of the outer disk, leading to an anti-correlation between the rim temperature and the strength of the silicate feature. The dust mineralogy remains constant, dominated by large amorphous olivine and pyroxene grains, with smaller fractions of crystalline forsterite. The excitation of CO (1550-2260 K), HCN (880-980 K), and hot H2O (740-860 K) molecules as well as the luminosity of the [NeII] line correlate with the accretion rate, while the warm (650 K) and cold (170-200 K) H2O components are mostly constant. CO emission, originating from a hot (&gt;1500 K) region likely within the dust sublimation radius, is most sensitive to L_acc changes. In comparison with other T Tauri disks, DQ Tau is highly C-poor and displays moderately inefficient pebble drift. We conclude that even moderate accretion rate changes affect the thermal structure in the planet-forming disk regions on short timescales, providing a crucial benchmark for understanding disk evolution.</description>

      <title>Validating DIRECD: Statistical Evaluation of Coronal Mass Ejections Direction Estimates from Coronal Dimmings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are among the most energetic phenomena in our solar system, with significant implications for space weather. Understanding their early dynamics remains challenging due to observational limitations in the low corona. We present a statistical evaluation of the DIRECD (Dimming InfeRred Estimation of CME Direction) method, which provides a novel approach to determining initial CME propagation directions using coronal dimmings. We analyze 33 coronal dimming events well observed by SDO/AIA and validate our DIRECD results with 3D reconstructions from the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model. We find generally good agreement between the DIRECD-derived inclinations and the GCS model. In the meridional plane (north--south direction), the mean difference in inclinations is $0.3^\circ \pm 7.8^\circ$. In the equatorial plane (east--west direction), the mean difference is $-2.9^\circ \pm 18.9^\circ$. In 3D, the inclinations show a mean difference of $1.2^\circ \pm 10.4^\circ$. We further visually compare our method by projecting the DIRECD cones onto LASCO/C2 observations, and verify the model's ability to capture both the primary CME structure and associated secondary dimming regions. This work establishes DIRECD as a powerful, observationally grounded technique for determining the initial CME direction, offering new insights that complement existing reconstruction methods. The technique's unique capability to determine early CME direction in the low corona using coronal dimmings observed in EUV images makes it particularly valuable for improving space weather forecasting models.</description>

      <title>PENELLOPE VII: Revisiting empirical relations to measure accretion luminosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accretion luminosity (Lacc) in young, low-mass stars is crucial for understanding stellar formation, but direct measurements are often hindered by limited spectral coverage and challenges in UV-excess modeling. Empirical relations linking Lacc to various accretion tracers are widely used to overcome these limitations. This work revisits these empirical relations using the PENELLOPE dataset, evaluating their applicability across different star-forming regions and to accreting young objects other than Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs). We analyzed the PENELLOPE VLT/X-Shooter dataset of 64 CTTSs, measuring fluxes of several accretion tracers and adopting the stellar and accretion parameters derived from PENELLOPE works. We supplemented our analysis with the ODYSSEUS HST data set, which covers a wider spectral range in NUV bands. We compared the Lacc values obtained in the PENELLOPE and ODYSSEUS surveys finding statistically consistent results. Our analysis confirms that existing empirical relations, previously derived for the Lupus sample, provide reliable Lacc estimates for CTTSs in several other star-forming regions. We revisit empirical relations for accretion tracers in our dataset, based on HST-fit, with coefficients which are consistent within 1sigma with XS-fit results for most lines. We also propose a method to estimate extinction using these relations and investigate the empirical relations for Brackett lines (Br8 to Br21). The Lacc vs Lline empirical relations can be successfully used for statistical studies of accretion on young forming objects in different star-forming regions. These relations also offer a promising approach to independently estimate extinction in CTTSs. We confirm that near-infrared lines (PaB and BrG) reliably trace Lacc in high accretors, making them valuable tools for probing accretion properties of high accreting young stars not accessible in the UVB.</description>

      <title>Sporadic radio pulses from a white dwarf binary at the orbital period</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed rare, previously unknown flashes of cosmic radio waves lasting from milliseconds to minutes, and with periodicity of minutes to an hour. These transient radio signals must originate from sources in the Milky Way, and from coherent emission processes in astrophysical plasma. They are theorized to be produced in the extreme and highly magnetised environments around white dwarfs or neutron stars. However, the astrophysical origin of these signals remains contested, and multiple progenitor models may be needed to explain their diverse properties. Here we present the discovery of a transient radio source, ILT J1101+5521, whose roughly minute-long pulses arrive with a periodicity of 125.5 minutes. We find that ILT J1101+5521 is an M dwarf -- white dwarf binary system with an orbital period that matches the period of the radio pulses, which are observed when the two stars are in conjunction. The binary nature of ILT J1101+5521 establishes that some long-period radio transients originate from orbital motion modulating the observed emission, as opposed to an isolated rotating star. We conclude that ILT J1101+5521 is likely a polar system where magnetic interaction has synchronised the rotational and orbital periods of the white dwarf. Magnetic interaction and plasma exchange between two stars has been theorized to generate sporadic radio emission, making ILT J1101+5521 a potential low-mass analogue to such mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Multi-MeV electron occurrence and lifetimes in the outer radiation belt and slot region during the maximum of solar cycle 22</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) observed the response of the Van Allen radiation belts to peak solar activity within solar cycle 22. This study analyses relativistic and ultra-relativistic electron occurrence and loss timescales within the CRRES High Energy Electron Fluxometer (HEEF) dataset, including during several strong and severe geomagnetic storms that all, remarkably, flooded the slot region with multi-MeV electrons. These allow the first definitive multi-MeV electron lifetimes to be calculated in this region and indicate an elevated risk to satellites in slot region orbits during periods of heightened solar activity. The HEEF outer belt loss timescales are broadly in agreement with those from later solar cycles, but differences include longer-lasting sub-MeV electrons near the inner region of the outer belt and faster-decaying multi-MeV electrons near geosynchronous orbit. These differences are associated with higher levels of geomagnetic activity, a phenomenon that enables the spread in the results to be parameterised accordingly. The timescales generally appear well-bounded by Kp-dependent theoretical predictions, but the variability within the spread is not always well-ordered by geomagnetic activity. This suggests the limitations of using pitch-angle diffusion to account for the decay of elevated electrons following geomagnetic storms, and the need for more sophisticated space weather indices for radiation belt forecasting.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional half-moment multigroup radiative transfer. Improving moment-based thermal models of circumstellar disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Common moment-based radiative transfer methods, such as flux-limited diffusion (FLD) and the M1 closure, suffer from artificial interactions between crossing beams. In protoplanetary disks, this leads to an overestimation of the midplane temperature due to the merging of inward and outward vertical fluxes. Methods that avoid these artifacts typically require angular discretization, which can be computationally expensive. In the spirit of the two-stream approximation, we introduced a half-moment (HM) closure that integrates the radiative intensity over hemispheres, thereby suppressing beam interactions along a fixed spatial direction. We derived a multidimensional HM closure via entropy maximization and replaced this closure with an approximate expression that closely matches it, coinciding with it in the diffusion and free-streaming regimes while remaining expressible through simple operations. We implemented HM and M1 closures via implicit-explicit schemes, including multiple frequency groups. We tested these methods in numerical benchmarks such as computing the temperature in an irradiated disk around a T Tauri star, comparing our results with Monte Carlo (MC) radiative transfer simulations. The HM closure correctly reproduces the diffusion limit and prevents crossing flux interactions in a chosen spatial direction. In disk simulations, our multigroup HM method closely matches midplane temperature distributions obtained with classical MC methods. While the M1 closure produces midplane temperatures 44% higher than MC with one frequency group and 21% higher with 22 groups, HM reduces this discrepancy to 6% with 22 groups. Even with just three groups, HM significantly outperforms M1, with maximum departures of 8% compared to M1's 23%. Our results show that combining HM with a multigroup treatment yields more realistic disk temperatures than M1, particularly in optically thick regions.</description>

      <title>The late Miocene $^{10}$Be anomaly and the possibility of a supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of cosmogenic $^{10}$Be in deep-ocean ferromanganese crusts from the Central and Northern Pacific have revealed an anomalous concentration between 11.5 and 9.0 Myr ago, peaking at 10.1 Myr. One possible explanation is a nearby supernova (SN) event. Motivated by this and by the proximity of the Solar System to the Orion star-forming region during that period, we estimate the probability that at least one SN occurred between the onset and peak of the anomaly. Using an open cluster catalog based on Gaia DR3, we trace back the orbits of 2725 clusters and the Sun over the past 20 Myr and compute the expected number of SN events. We find 19 clusters with a probability greater than 1% each of producing at least one SN within 100 pc of the Sun in the time interval 11.5-10.1 Myr ago. The total cumulative probability exceeds zero at 35 pc from the Sun and increases rapidly with distance, reaching 68% near 100 pc. Two young clusters dominate the SN probability: ASCC 20 contributes most within 70 pc, while OCSN 61 becomes more significant beyond that distance. Our results support the plausibility of a SN origin for the $^{10}$Be anomaly and highlight the importance of additional $^{10}$Be records from independent terrestrial archives to determine whether the anomaly is of astrophysical or terrestrial origin.</description>

      <title>Electron Inertia and Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The finite electron mass can cause magnetic reconnection even in the absence of any other non-ideal effect. It will be shown that when electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect in the evolution of a magnetic field $\vec{B}$, there is a related field that evolves ideally. This field is $\vec{\mathcal{B}} \equiv \vec{B} + \vec{\nabla}\times \left( (c/\omega_{pe})^2\mu_0\vec{j} \right)$ with $\omega_{pe}$ the plasma frequency and $\vec{j}$ the current density. In three dimensional space, the practical importance of the ideal evolution of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ on its reconnection appears limited. When the evolution velocity of modified field is chaotic, $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ will reconnect on a timescale that depends only logarithmically on any non-ideal effect that is diffusive, such as resistivity, with a current density enhancement that is also proportional to the logarithm. In near ideal magnetic fields, this logarithm is typically of order ten, and it is difficult to conceive of a physically realistic situation in which it larger than a hundred.</description>
