      <title>Camelidae on BOAT: observation of a second spectral component in GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observing and understanding the origin of the very-high-energy (VHE) spectral component in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been challenging because of the lack of sensitivity in MeV-GeV observations, so far. The majestic GRB 221009A, known as the brightest of all times (BOAT), offers a unique opportunity to identify spectral components during the prompt and early afterglow phases and probe their origin. Analyzing simultaneous observations spanning from keV to TeV energies, we identified two distinct spectral components during the initial 20 minutes of the burst. The second spectral component peaks between $10-300$ GeV, and the bolometric fluence (10 MeV-10 TeV) is estimated to be greater than 2$\times10^{-3}$ erg/ cm$^{2}$. Performing broad-band spectral modeling, we provide constraints on the magnetic field and the energies of electrons accelerated in the external relativistic shock. We interpret the VHE component as an afterglow emission that is affected by luminous prompt MeV radiation at early times.</description>

      <title>AT2020ohl: its nature and probable implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ASASSN-20hx, a.k.a AT2020ohl, is an ambiguous nuclear transient (ANT), which was discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC6297 by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). We have investigated the evolution of AT2020ohl using a multi-wavelength dataset to explain the geometry of the system and the energy radiated by it between X-ray and radio wavelengths. Our X-ray, UV/optical, and radio observations of the object jointly clarify the association of AT2020ohl with the nuclear activity of NGC6297. We detected radio counterpart of AT2020ohl 111 days and 313 days after the discovery in Jansky Very Large Array X-band with flux densities 47$\pm$14 $\mu$Jy and 34$\pm$3 $\mu$Jy, respectively. Using multi-wavelength data analysis, we nullify the possibility of associating any stellar disruption process with this event. We found some evidence showing that the host galaxy is a merger remnant, so the possibility of a binary SMBH system can not be ruled out. The central SMBH has a mass of $\sim1.2\times10^7$ M$_\odot$. We propose the accretion disk activity as the origin of AT2020ohl $-$ it is either due to disk accretion event onto the central SMBH or due to the sudden accretion activity in a preexisting accretion disk of the system during the interaction of two SMBHs which became gravitationally bound during a merger process. However, we also admit that with the existing dataset, it is impossible to say definitively, among these two probabilities, which one is the origin of this nuclear transient.</description>

      <title>Low angular momentum general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic accretion flow around rotating black holes with shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the global structure of general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) accretion flows around Kerr black holes containing shock waves, where the disk is threaded by radial and toroidal magnetic fields. We self-consistently solve the GRMHD equations that govern the flow motion inside the disk and for the first time to our knowledge, we obtain the shock-induced global GRMHD accretion solutions around weakly as well as rapidly rotating black holes for a set of fundamental flow parameters, such as energy ($E$), angular momentum ($L$), radial magnetic flux ($\Phi$), and iso-rotation parameter ($F$). We show that shock properties, namely shock radius ($r_{\rm sh}$), compression ratio ($R$) and shock strength ($\Psi$) strongly depends on $E$, $L$, $\Phi$, and $F$. We observe that shock in GRMHD flow continues to exist for wide range of the flow parameters, which allows us to identify the effective domain of parameter space in $L-E$ plane where shock solutions are feasible. Moreover, we examine the modification of the shock parameter space and find that it shifts towards the lower angular momentum values with increasing $\Phi$ and black hole spin ($a_{\rm k}$). Finally, we compute the critical radial magnetic flux ($\Phi^{\rm cri}$) that admits shocks in GRMHD flow and ascertain that $\Phi^{\rm cri}$ is higher (lower) for black hole of spin $a_{\rm k} = 0.99$ ($0.0$) and vice versa.</description>

      <title>HESS J1745$-$290 spectrum explained by a transition in the diffusion regime of PeV cosmic rays in the Sgr A* accretion flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The diffuse TeV gamma-ray emission detected in the inner $\sim$ 100 pc of the Galactic Center suggests the existence of a central cosmic-ray accelerator reaching $\sim$ PeV energies. It is interesting to associate this so-called PeVatron with the point source HESS J1745$-$290, whose position is consistent with that of the central supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. However, the point source shows a spectral break at a few TeV, which is not shown by the diffuse emission, challenging this association. Aims. We seek to build an emission model for the point source consistent with both emissions being produced by the same population of relativistic protons, continuously injected with a power-law spectrum up to $\sim$ PeV energies, near Sgr A*. Methods. In our model, we assume that the point source is produced by hadronic collisions between the cosmic rays and the gas in the accretion flow of Sgr A*. The cosmic-ray density is calculated taking into consideration cosmic-ray transport due to diffusion and advection, while the properties of the gas are obtained from previous numerical simulations of the accretion flow. Results. Our model succeeds in explaining both the point source and the diffuse emission with the same cosmic rays injected in the vicinity of Sgr A*, as long as the coherence length of the magnetic turbulence in the accretion flow is $l_c\sim(1-3)\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{cm}$. The spectral break of the point source appears naturally due to an energy-dependent transition in the way the cosmic rays diffuse within the inner $\sim 0.1$ pc of the accretion flow (where most of the emission is produced) Conclusions. Our model supports the idea that Sgr A* can be a PeVatron, whose accelerated cosmic rays give rise to both the point source and the diffuse emission. Future TeV telescopes, like CTAO, will be able to test this model.</description>

      <title>Varaha: A promising sampler for obtaining gravitational wave posteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nested sampling has been the workhorse for estimating parameters of compact binaries from the gravitational wave signals. It operates using a set of live points and accepts/rejects points drawn from prior such that the live point with the lowest likelihood is replaced by a point with a higher likelihood value. Each such iteration shrinks the volume enclosed by the live point of lowest likelihood by a known factor. The estimated sampling density along with the likelihood values of the new and old live points quantifies the probability mass enclosed by them. Although robust, nested sampling often discards a majority of the sampled points~($\sim 99.9\%$) at which likelihood was calculated. However, for small dimensional problems, which happens to be the case for compact binaries, the sampling density of all the sampled points can be explicitly calculated thereby removing the need to discard samples. The points' sampling density and likelihood values constitute the posterior distribution. Avoiding the wastage implies significant improvement in the sampling efficiency. In a previous method, we presented a recipe to reconstruct the live volume; the volume that encloses most of the posterior probability mass. We build on this method and present a methodology that explicitly records the sampling density of all the points. For small dimensions, the presented sampler is significantly more efficient than the canonical nested samplers and is embarrassingly parallel.</description>

      <title>Constraining the physical properties of large-scale jets from black hole X-ray binaries and their impact on the local environment with blast-wave dynamical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic discrete ejecta launched by black hole X-ray binaries (BH XRBs) can be observed to propagate up to parsec-scales from the central object. Observing the final deceleration phase of these jets is crucial to estimate their physical parameters and to reconstruct their full trajectory, with implications for the jet powering mechanism, composition and formation. In this paper we present the results of the modelling of the motion of the ejecta from three BH XRBs: MAXI J1820+070, MAXI J1535$-$571 and XTE J1752$-$223, for which high-resolution radio and X-ray observations of jets propagating up to $\sim$15 arcsec ($\sim$0.6 pc at 3 kpc) from the core have been published in the recent years. For each jet, we modeled its entire motion with a dynamical blast-wave model, inferring robust values for the jet Lorentz factor, inclination angle and ejection time. Under several assumptions associated to the ejection duration, the jet opening angle and the available accretion power, we are able to derive stringent constraints on the maximum jet kinetic energy for each source (between $10^{43}$ and $10^{44}$ erg, including also H1743$-$322), as well as placing interesting upper limits on the density of the ISM through which the jets are propagating (from $n_{\rm ISM} \lesssim 0.4$ cm$^{-3}$ down to $n_{\rm ISM} \lesssim 10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$). Overall, our results highlight the potential of applying models derived from gamma-ray bursts to the physics of jets from BH XRBs and support the emerging picture of these sources as preferentially embedded in low-density environments.</description>

      <title>Discovery and follow-up of a quasiperiodically nulling and sub-pulse drifting pulsar with the Murchison Widefield Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of pulsar nulling, where pulsars temporarily and stochastically cease their radio emission, is thought to be indicative of a `dying' pulsar, where radio emission ceases entirely. Here we report the discovery of a long-period pulsar, PSR J0452-3418, from the ongoing Southern-sky MWA Rapid Two-meter (SMART) pulsar survey. The pulsar has a rotation period of ${\sim}$1.67\,s and a dispersion measure of 19.8\,\dmu, and it exhibits both quasi-periodic nulling and sub-pulse drifting. Periodic nulling is uncommon, only reported in $&lt;1$\% of the pulsar population, with even a smaller fraction showing periodic nulling and sub-pulse drifting. We describe the discovery and follow-up of the pulsar, including a positional determination using high-resolution imaging with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), initial timing analysis using the combination of MWA and uGMRT data, and detailed characterisation of the nulling and drifting properties in the MWA's frequency band (140-170\,MHz). Our analysis suggests a nulling fraction of 34$\pm6$\% and a nulling periodicity of 42$^{+1.5}_{-1.3}$ pulses. We measure the phase ($P_2$) and time modulation ($P_3$) caused by the sub-pulse drifting, with an average $P_2$ of 7.1$^{+26.3}_{-3.1}$ degrees and a $P_3$ of 4.8$^{+1.5}_{-0.9}$ pulses. We compare and contrast the observed properties with those of other pulsars that exhibit sub-pulse drifting and quasi-periodic nulling phenomena, and find that the majority of these objects tend to be in the `death valley' in the period-period derivative ($P$-$\dot{P}$) diagram. We also discuss some broader implications for pulsar emission physics and the detectability of similar objects using next-generation pulsar surveys.</description>

      <title>Standardizing the Gamma-ray burst as a standard candle and applying to the cosmological probes: constraints on the two-component dark energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the most energetic and brightest events, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been used as a standard candle for cosmological probe. Based on the relevant features of GRBs light curves, a plateau phase followed a decay phase, we obtain X-ray samples of 31 GRBs and optical samples of 50 GRBs, which are thought to be caused by the same physical mechanism. We standardize GRBs using the two-dimension fundamental plane relation of the rest-frame luminosity of the plateau emission ($L_{b,z}$) and the end time of plateau ($T_{b,z}$) $L_{b,z}-T_{b,z}$, as well as the three-dimension fundamental plane correlation including the peak energy ($E_{p,i}$) $L_{b,z}-T_{b,z}-E_{p,i}$. For the cosmological probes, we consider the $\omega$CDM model in which the dark energy consists of one component, and mainly focus on the $X_1X_2$CDM model in which the dark energy is made up of two independent components. We obtain the constraints on the related parameters of the cosmological models using the type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data and selected X-ray and optical samples. For the $X_1X_2$CDM model, we find that the values of the equations of state parameters of two dark energies, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, are very close. We also conduct the comparison between the models using the Bayesian information criterion, and find that the $\omega$CDM model is favoured.</description>

      <title>Closing the net on transient sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) observed above $4\times10^{19}\,$eV provide evidence of localized excesses that are key to identifying their sources. We leverage the 3D matter distribution from optical and infrared surveys as a density model of UHECR sources, which are considered to be transient. Agreement of the sky model with UHECR data imposes constraints on both the emission rate per unit matter and the time spread induced by encountered turbulent magnetic fields. Based on radio measurements of cosmic magnetism, we identify the Local Sheet as the magnetized structure responsible for the kiloyear duration of UHECR bursts for an observer on Earth and find that the turbulence amplitude must be within $0.5-20\,$nG for a coherence length of $10\,$kpc. At the same time, the burst-rate density must be above $50\,$Gpc$^{-3}\,$yr$^{-1}$ for Local-Sheet galaxies to reproduce the UHECR excesses and below $5\,000\,$Gpc$^{-3}\,$yr$^{-1}$ ($30\,000\,$Gpc$^{-3}\,$yr$^{-1}$) for the Milky Way (Local-Group galaxies) not to outshine other galaxies. For the transient emissions of protons and nuclei to match the energy spectra of UHECRs, the kinetic energy of the outflows responsible for UHECR acceleration must be below $4\times10^{54}\,$erg and above $5\times10^{50}\,$erg ($2\times10^{49}\,$erg) if we consider the Milky Way (or not). The only stellar-sized transients that satisfy both Hillas' and our criteria are long gamma-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Entropic Behavior Observed in Quasar 3C 273</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the flux intensities spanning from radio waves to $\gamma$-rays across 36 light curves of Quasar 3C 273, utilizing publicly available data collected by the Integral Science Data Centre (ISDC) database. Our analysis reveals a consistent adherence of all light curves from this quasar to $q$-Gaussian distribution. This compelling finding strongly suggests a nonextensive behavior exhibited by Quasar 3C 273. Moreover, we derive the $q$ entropic indices for these light curves, providing insights into the degree of nonextensivity, where cases with $q&gt;1$ were primarily observed. Utilizing this index, we estimate the nonextensive entropy ($S_{q}$) and explore its correlation with the energy (in eV) and the $q$ index. Notably, we observe a tendency for the $q$ value to increase as the Tsallis entropy decreases. Remarkably, our most significant observation pertains to the relationship between the entropy $S_{q}$ and the energy of the source. We identify an anomalous behavior in entropy, particularly evident in the infrared and $\gamma$-ray wavebands.</description>

      <title>Exploring hidden priors when interpreting gravitational wave and electromagnetic probes of the nuclear equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wide range of sub- and super-nuclear densities achieved in neutron stars makes them ideal probes of dense nuclear behavior in the form of the nuclear equation of state (EoS). Studying neutron stars both in isolation and in highly dynamic events, many recent observations, most famously the gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals associated with the BNS merger GW170817/AT2017gfo, have provided suggestive insight into these highest nuclear densities. Measurements of galactic neutron star masses and radii from NICER and other radio and X-ray measurements provide critical complementary perspectives, bounding other features of the EoS. Though nominally congruent, in this paper we highlight many underappreciated "hidden" priors embedded in joint analysis of these many messengers, and their systematic impact on joint EoS inference. In this work, we perform a careful step-by-step Bayesian inference using a simple low-dimensional parametric EoS model, incrementally adding information from galactic pulsars, gravitational wave sources, and more speculative constraints involving kilonovae and the neutron star maximum mass. At each stage, we carefully discuss the marginal likelihood, explaining how hidden priors impact conclusions. Conversely, we also quantify how much information these measurements have, arguing that many if not most have minimal impact relative to the explicit and hidden prior assumptions. Specifically, we find two features dominate our inference: on the one hand, the choice of EoS parameterization and particularly hyperprior, and on the other the astrophysical priors associated with interpreting events, particularly the multimessenger source GW170817. In an appendix, we outline a simple semianalytic projection suitable for assessing the measurability of the EoS with ensembles of present and future detections.</description>

      <title>Supernova Remnants in Gamma Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1960s, the remnants of supernova explosions (SNRs) were indicated as a possible source of galactic cosmic rays through the Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA) mechanism. Since then, the observation of gamma-ray emission from relativistic ions in these objects has been one of the main goals of high-energy astrophysics. A few dozen SNRs have been detected at GeV and TeV photon energies in the last two decades. However, these observations have shown a complex phenomenology that is not easy to reduce to the standard paradigm based on DSA acceleration. Although the understanding of these objects has greatly increased, and their nature as efficient electron and proton accelerators has been observed, it remains to be clarified whether these objects are the main contributors to galactic cosmic rays. Here, we review the observations of {\gamma}-ray emission from SNRs and the perspectives for the future.</description>

      <title>Revisiting flares in Sagittarius A* based on general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of black hole accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution observations with GRAVITY-VLTI instrument have provided abundant information about the flares in Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole in our Galactic center, including the time-dependent location of the centroid (a "hot spot"), the light curve, and polarization. Yuan et al. (2009) proposed a "coronal mass ejection" model to explain the flares and their association with the plasma ejection. The key idea is that magnetic reconnection in the accretion flow produces the flares and results in the formation and ejection of flux ropes. The dynamical process proposed in the model has been confirmed by three-dimensional GRMHD simulations in a later work. Based on this scenario, in our previous works the radiation of the flux rope has been calculated analytically and compared to the observations. In the present paper, we develop the model by directly using numerical simulation data to interpret observations. We first identify flux ropes formed due to reconnection from the data. By assuming that electrons are accelerated in the reconnection current sheet and flow into the flux rope and emit their radiation there, we have calculated the time-dependent energy distribution of electrons after phenomenologically considering their injection due to reconnection acceleration, radiative and adiabatic cooling. The radiation of these electrons is calculated using the ray-tracing approach. The trajectory of the hot spot, the radiation light curve during the flare, and the polarization are calculated. These results are compared with the GRAVITY observations and good consistencies are found.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the propagation of ultraheavy (UH) nuclei as ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We show that their energy loss lengths at $\lesssim300$~EeV are significantly longer than those of protons and intermediate nuclei, and that the highest-energy cosmic rays with energies beyond $\sim100$~EeV, including the Amaterasu particle, may originate from such UH-UHECRs. We derive constraints on the contribution of UH-UHECR sources, and find that they are consistent with energy generation rate densities of UHECRs from collapsars and neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Investigating Turbulence Effects on Magnetic Reconnection Rates Through High-Resolution Three-Dimensional Resistive Magnetohydrodynamical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of turbulence on magnetic reconnection through high-resolution 3D MHD simulations, covering Lundquist numbers from $S=10^3$ to $10^6$. Our simulations introduce small-scale perturbations injected into the system until $t=0.1\, t_A$. Even after the initial perturbation ceases, turbulence grows and persists, leading to sustained high reconnection rates of $V_\text{rec}/V_A \sim 0.03-0.08$, which surpass those generated solely by resistive tearing modes (plasmoids) observed in 2D and 3D PIC/MHD simulations by factors of 5 to 6. Our findings reveal that the achieved reconnection rates align with observations in solar phenomena and those reported in 3D MHD global simulations of accretion flows and relativistic jets. Notably, our simulations exhibit a steady-state reconnection rate coinciding with the full development of turbulence, showcasing the robustness and persistence of the reconnection in a turbulent environment. We establish the independence of the reconnection rate from the Lundquist number, consistent with the theory of turbulent reconnection proposed by Lazarian and Vishniac. Our results demonstrate a mild dependence of $V_\text{rec}$ on the plasma-$\beta$ parameter, the ratio between the thermal and magnetic pressure, illustrating a decrease from $0.036$ to $0.028$ as $\beta$ increases from $2$ to $64$ for simulations with $S=10^5$. Finally, we explore the influence of the magnetic Prandtl number ($\text{Pr}_m=\nu/\eta$) on the reconnection rate and find this influence to be negligible during the turbulent regime across the range tested, from $\text{Pr}_m=1$ to $60$. These findings carry significant implications for research into reconnection and particle acceleration within realistic magnetized space and astrophysical environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proposed space gravitational wave (GW) detector LISA has potential to detect stellar-mass black hole binaries (BBHs). The majority of the detected BBHs are expected to emit nearly monochromatic GWs, whose frequency evolution will be efficiently described by Taylor expansions. We study the measurability of the associated time derivative coefficients of the frequencies, by extending a recent work based on a simplified Fisher matrix analysis. Additionally, we provide qualitative discussions on how to extract astrophysical information, such as orbital eccentricity and tertiary perturbation, from the observed derivative coefficients.</description>

      <title>A Study of Cosmological Models Based on Long Gamma-ray Bursts Duration Histogram</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The duration of more than one thousand gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been measured by Swift satellite. Besides the redshift distribution of GRBs, the burst duration could be another significant property of GRBs that can be analyzed. In this project, First, we find the detection rate of Swift/BAT for a cosmological model with the $ \omega CDM$ model, then by performing a Monte-Carlo simulation, we find the "long" GRB duration histogram to compare the cosmological model with the $ \omega CDM$ model and the $\Lambda CDM$ model. The $\chi^2$ minimization method is employed to determine the optimal value of $\alpha$ in the dark energy equation of state, $P= c \omega(z) \rho$, with $\omega(z)=1+\alpha z$ as $\alpha=0.08 ^{+ 0.04}_{-0.02}$. We showed that the $\omega CDM$ model is statistically favored over the $\Lambda CDM$ model. Other studies by measuring the expansion rate of the Universe directly from the SNIa data by Pantheon and DES-SN3YR samples and the combinations of SNIa, CMB, and BAO data confirmed that the value of $\alpha$ in the dark energy equation of state is not zero \citep{Dark_energy_Abbott, 2011Beutler, 2014Anderson, 2015Ross, 2016PlanckCollaboration, Alam2017, Mazumdar2021}.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity without gauge fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the polarization modes of gravitational waves in $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity without gauge fixing. The main result of this study is that no further scalar mode appears more than the two standard plus and cross transverse polarizations of massless tensor gravitational radiation, typical of General Relativity. This is because the first-order perturbation of connection does not modify the linearized field equations in vacuum which remain gauge invariant. Then, the world line equations of free point particles, as well as the equations of their deviations, are obtained using only the symmetric teleparallel connection. In $f(Q)$ gravity, test masses follow timelike geodesics and not autoparallel curves. In the proper reference frame, thanks to the geodesic deviation equation of the structure-less bodies in free fall, we prove that, in any gauge, only the metric perturbations $h_{\mu\nu}$, related to tensor modes, survive by exploiting the gauge invariance. Besides, scalar modes disappear. This allows us to conclude that only two degrees of freedom of linearized $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity propagate as in General Relativity and in $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity. The situation is different with respect to $f(R)$ gravity (with $f(R)\neq R$) where a further scalar mode is found.</description>

      <title>An X-Ray High-Frequency QPO in NGC 1365</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the detection of a high-frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1365, based on observational data obtained by the XMM-Newton in January 2004. Utilizing the Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) and Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) methods, a QPO signal was identified at a frequency of 2.19 * 10^-4 Hz (4566 s), with a confidence level of 3.6 sigma. The signal was notably absent in the lower 0.2-1.0 keV energy band, with the primary contribution emerging from the 2.0-10.0 keV band, where the confidence level reached 3.9 sigma. Spectral analysis shows that there are multiple absorption and emission lines in the high-energy band (&gt; 6 keV). The correlation between the QPO frequency (f_QPO) and the mass of NGC 1365 central black hole (M_BH) aligns with the established logarithmic trend observed across black holes, indicating the QPO is of high frequency. This discovery provides new clues for studying the generation mechanism of QPO in Seyfert galaxies, which helps us understand the accretion process around supermassive black holes and the characteristics of strong gravitational fields in active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the fundamental theory describing the strong nuclear force and the interactions among quarks and gluons. Topological stars, characterized by extreme density conditions, offer a unique environment where QCD phenomena play a crucial role due to the confinement of fundamental particles. Understanding these phenomena is essential for unraveling the behavior and properties of these celestial bodies.
  In this study, we explore the implications of QCD within extreme density regimes, focusing on its contribution to the energy-momentum tensor ($T^{\mu\nu}_{\text{QCD}}$) within the framework of Quantum Chromodynamics. Our analysis sheds light on how these QCD effects influence the fabric of spacetime in the vicinity of topological stars, providing valuable insights into their underlying physics.</description>

      <title>High Redshift Merger Model for Low Frequency Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2023, the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) Collaborations announced the discovery of a gravitational wave background (GWB), predominantly attributed to supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) mergers. However, the detected GWB is several times stronger than the default value expected from galactic observations at low and moderate redshifts. Recent findings by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have unveiled a substantial number of massive, high-redshift galaxies, suggesting more massive SMBHB mergers at these early epochs. Motivated by these findings, we propose an "early merger" model that complements the standard merger statistics by incorporating these early, massive galaxies. We compare the early and standard "late merger" models, which assume peak merger rates in the local universe, and match both merger models to the current detected GWB. Our analysis shows that the early merger model has a significantly lower detection probability for single binaries and predicts a $\sim 30 \%$ likelihood that the first detectable single source will be highly redshifted and remarkably massive with rapid frequency evolution. In contrast, the late merger model predicts a nearly monochromatic first source at low redshift. The future confirmation of an enhanced population of massive high-redshift galaxies and the detection of fast-evolving binaries would strongly support the early merger model, offering significant insights into galaxy and SMBH redshift evolution.</description>

      <title>From Seed to Supermassive Black Holes: Capture, Growth, Migration, and Pairing in Dense Proto-Bulge Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origins and mergers of supermassive black holes (BHs) remain a mystery. We describe a scenario from a novel multi-physics simulation featuring rapid ($\lesssim 1\,$Myr) hyper-Eddington gas capture by a $\sim 1000\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ ``seed'' BH up to supermassive ($\gtrsim 10^{6}\,M_{\odot}$) masses, in a massive, dense molecular cloud complex typical of high-redshift starbursts. Due to the high cloud density, stellar feedback is inefficient and most of the gas turns into stars in star clusters which rapidly merge hierarchically, creating deep potential wells. Relatively low-mass BH seeds at random positions can be ``captured'' by merging sub-clusters and migrate to the center in $\sim1$ free-fall time (vastly faster than dynamical friction). This also efficiently produces a paired BH binary with $\sim 0.1$\,pc separation. The centrally-concentrated stellar density profile (akin to a ``proto-bulge'') allows the cluster as a whole to capture and retain gas and build up a large (pc-scale) circum-binary accretion disk with gas coherently funnelled to the central BH (even when the BH radius of influence is small). The disk is ``hyper-magnetized'' and ``flux-frozen'': dominated by a toroidal magnetic field with plasma $\beta \sim 10^{-3}$, with the fields amplified by flux-freezing. This drives hyper-Eddington inflow rates $\gtrsim 1\,\rm M_\odot yr^{-1}$, which also drive the two BHs to nearly-equal masses. The late-stage system appears remarkably similar to recently-observed high-redshift ``little red dots.'' This scenario can provide an explanation for rapid SMBH formation, growth and mergers in high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>A new search pipeline for gravitational waves with higher-order modes using mode-by-mode filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearly all template-based gravitational wave (GW) searches only include the quasi-circular quadrupolar modes of the signals in their templates. Including additional degrees of freedom in the GW templates corresponding to higher-order harmonics, orbital precession, or eccentricity is challenging because: ($i$) the size of template banks and the matched-filtering cost increases significantly with the number of degrees of freedom, $(ii)$ if these additional degrees are not included properly, the search can lose sensitivity overall (due to an increase in the rate of background triggers). Here, we focus on including aligned-spin higher harmonics in GW search templates. We use a new mode-by-mode filtering approach, where we separately filter GW strain data with three harmonics [namely $(\ell, |m|)=(2,2)$, $(3,3)$ and $(4,4)$]. This results in an increase in the matched-filtering cost by only a factor of $3$ compared to that of a $(2,2)$-only search. We develop computationally cheap trigger-ranking statistics to optimally combine the different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) timeseries from different harmonics, which ensure only physically-allowed combinations of the different harmonics are triggered on. We use an empirical template-dependent background model in our ranking statistic to account for non-Gaussian transients. In addition, we develop a tool called band eraser which specifically excises narrow time-varying noisy bands in time-frequency space (without having to excise entire time chunks in the data). New GW candidate events that we detect using our search pipeline and the details of our template banks are discussed in accompanying papers: Wadekar et al. [1] and [2] respectively. Apart from higher harmonics, we expect our methodology to also be useful for cheap and optimal searches including orbital precession and eccentricity in GW waveforms.</description>

      <title>GRBs from Collapse of Thorne-\.Zytkow-like Objects as the Aftermath of WD-NS Coalescence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.06041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Type II gamma-ray burst (GRB) 200826A challenges collapsar models by questioning how they can generate a genuinely short-duration event. The other Type I GRB 211211A confused us with a kilonova signature observed in the afterglow of a \textit{long} burst. Here, we propose a comprehensive model in which both bursts are the results of the collapse of Thorne-\.Zytkow-like Objects (TZlOs). The TZlO consists of a central neutron star (NS), with a dense white dwarf (WD) material envelope, which is formed as the aftermath of a WD-NS coalescence. We find that the characteristics of the resultant GRBs depend on whether the TZlO collapses immediately following the WD-NS merger or not. Additionally, the observational properties of the consequent GRBs manifest variations contingent upon whether the collapse of the TZlO results in a magnetar or a black hole. We also show that our model is consistent with the observations of GRB 211211A and GRB 200826A. Specifically, the optical excess in GRB 211211A can be attributed to an engine-fed kilonova, while the \textit{supernova bump} in GRB 200826A is likely due to the collision between the ejecta and the disk wind shell.</description>

      <title>Probing the Soft X-ray Properties and Multi-Wavelength Variability of SN2023ixf and its Progenitor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of nearly two decades of optical/UV and X-ray data to study the multi-wavelength pre-explosion properties and post-explosion X-ray properties of nearby SN2023ixf located in M101. We find no evidence of precursor activity in the optical to UV down to a luminosity of $\lesssim 7\times10^{4}\, \rm L_{\odot}$, while X-ray observations covering nearly 18 years prior to explosion show no evidence of luminous precursor X-ray emission down to an absorbed 0.3 - 10.0 keV X-ray luminosity of $\sim6\times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Extensive Swift observations taken post-explosion did not detect soft X-ray emission from SN2023ixf within the first $\sim$3.3 days after first light, which suggests a mass-loss rate for the progenitor of $\lesssim5\times10^{-4}\,\rm M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ or a radius of $\lesssim4\times10^{15}$ cm for the circumstellar material. Our analysis also suggests that if the progenitor underwent a mass-loss episode, this had to occur $&gt;$ 0.5 - 1.5 years prior to explosion, consistent with previous estimates. Swift detected soft X-rays from SN2023ixf $\sim4.25$ days after first light, and it rose to a peak luminosity of $\sim10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ after 10 days and has maintained this luminosity for nearly 50 days post first light. This peak luminosity is lower than expected, given the evidence that SN2023ixf is interacting with dense material. However, this might be a natural consequence of an asymmetric circumstellar medium. X-ray spectra derived from merging all Swift observations over the first 50 days are best described by a two-component bremsstrahlung model consisting of a heavily absorbed and hotter component similar to that found using NuSTAR, and a less-absorbed, cooler component. We suggest that this soft component arises from cooling of the forward shock similar to that found in Type IIn SN2010jl.</description>

      <title>Electrical conductivity of warm neutron star crust in magnetic fields: Neutron-drip regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the anisotropic electrical conductivity tensor of the inner crust of a compact star at non-zero temperature by extending a previous work on the conductivity of the outer crust. The physical scenarios, where such crust is formed, involve proto-neutron stars born in supernova explosions, binary neutron star mergers and accreting neutron stars. The temperature-density range studied covers the transition from a non-degenerate to a highly degenerate electron gas and assumes that the nuclei form a liquid, i.e., the temperature is above the melting temperature of the lattice of nuclei. The electronic transition probabilities include (a) the dynamical screening of electron-ion interaction in the hard-thermal-loop approximation for the QED plasma, (b) the correlations of the ionic component in a one-component plasma, and (c) finite nuclear size effects. The conductivity tensor is obtained from the Boltzmann kinetic equation in relaxation time approximation accounting for the anisotropies introduced by a magnetic field. The sensitivity of the results towards the matter composition of the inner crust is explored by using several compositions of the inner crust which were obtained using different nuclear interactions and methods of solving the many-body problem. The standard deviation of relaxation time and components of the conductivity tensor from the average are below $\le 10\%$ except close to crust-core transition, where non-spherical nuclear structures are expected. Our results can be used in dissipative magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of warm compact stars.</description>

      <title>Ensemble X-ray variability of optically selected QSOs: dependence on black hole mass and Eddington ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although flux variability is one of the defining properties of accretion flows onto supermassive black holes, its dependence on physical parameters such as the mass of the compact object and the Eddington ratio remain under discussion. In this paper we address this issue using the structure function statistic to measure the variability at X-ray wavelengths of a sample of optically selected QSOs with available black hole masses and Eddington ratios. We present a new Bayesian methodology for estimating the structure function tailored to the Poisson nature of the X-ray data. This is applied to 15,548 SDSS DRQ16 QSOs with repeat observations in the XMM-Newton archive and/or the SRG/eROSITA All Sky Survey. The X-ray structure function monotonically increases to time intervals of about 10-15 years, suggesting a preference for scenarios in which instabilities of the accretion disk contribute to the X-ray variability on long timescales. Additionally, there is evidence that the amplitude of the stochastic X-ray flux variations rises with decreasing black hole mass and Eddington ratio. This finding imposes stringent constraints on empirical models of Active Galactic Nuclei variability derived from local samples, emphasizing the significance of high-redshift population studies for comprehending the stochastic flux variations in active black holes.</description>

      <title>The orbital evolution of the tidally stripped star and disk-driven stable mass transfer for QPEs in GSN 069</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07177v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) is possibly mass loss at the periastron of a body moving around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a high eccentric orbit. Such a tidally stripped star is expected to radiate gravitational wave thereby leading to shrinkage of the periastron distance, and thus will eventually be disrupted by the SMBH in the previous studies. This scenario predicts a gradually increasing mass transfer, contradicting the long term evolution of the observed intensity of the QPEs in GSN 069.In this paper, we first revisited the orbital evolution of the stripped star. Then we suggested a model of a tidal stripped WD moving inside an accretion disk for QPEs in GSN 069.We found the effect of the mass transfer finally dominates the orbital evolution, resulting in the stripped star finally escaping the SMBH rather than being disrupted by it. The drag force by the disk can effectively reduce mass transfer and thus explain the observed long term evolution in the intensity of the QPEs in GSN 069. The disk is likely a fallback disk of the tidal disruption event in GSN 069. Considering the evolution of its accretion rate, the increase in the intensity of the latest eruption can also be explained.</description>

      <title>First detection of X-ray polarization in Galactic ULX pulsar Swift J0243.6$+$6124 with {\it IXPE}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the results of first ever spectro-polarimetric analyses of the Galactic ultra-luminous X-ray pulsar Swift J0243.6$+6124$ during the 2023 outburst using quasi-simultaneous {\it IXPE}, {\it NICER} and {\it NuSTAR} observations. A pulsation of period $\sim 9.79$ s is detected in {\it IXPE} and {\it NuSTAR} observations with pulse fractions (PFs) $\sim 18\%$ ($2-8$ keV) and $\sim 28\%$ ($3-78$ keV), respectively. Energy dependent study of the pulse profiles with {\it NuSTAR} indicates an increase in PF from $\sim 27\%$ ($3-10$ keV) to $\sim 50\%$ ($40-78$ keV). Further, epoch-dependent polarimetric measurements during the decay phase of the outburst confirm the detection of significant polarization, with the polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) varying between $\sim 2 -3.1\%$ and $\sim8.6^{\circ}-10.8^{\circ}$, respectively, in the $2-8$ keV energy range. We also observe that the PD increases up to $\sim 4.8\%$ at higher energies ($\gtrsim 5$ keV) with dominating \texttt{bbodyrad} flux contribution ($1.5 \lesssim F_{\rm BB}/F_{\rm PL} \lesssim 3.4$) in the {\it IXPE} spectra. The phase-resolved polarimetric study yields PD as $\sim 1.7-3.1\%$ suggesting a marginal correlation with the pulse profiles. Moreover, the broad-band ($0.6-70$ keV) energy spectrum of combined {\it NICER} and {\it NuSTAR} observations is well described by the combination of \texttt{bbodyrad} and \texttt{cutoffpl} components with seed photon temperature ($kT_{\rm bb}$) $\sim 0.86 \pm 0.03$ keV and photon index ($\Gamma$) $\sim 0.98 \pm 0.01$. With the above findings, we infer that the observed `low' PD in Swift J0243.6$+6124$ is attributed possibly due to `vacuum resonance' effect between the overheated and relatively cooler regions of the neutron star boundary layer.</description>

      <title>Hotspots and Photon Rings in Spherically-Symmetric Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future black hole (BH) imaging observations are expected to resolve finer features corresponding to higher-order images of hotspots and of the horizon-scale accretion flow. In spherical spacetimes, the image order is determined by the number of half-loops executed by the photons that form it. Consecutive-order images arrive approximately after a delay time of $\approx\pi$ times the BH shadow radius. The fractional diameters, widths, and flux-densities of consecutive-order images are exponentially demagnified by the lensing Lyapunov exponent, a characteristic of the spacetime. The appearance of a simple point-sized hotspot when located at fixed spatial locations or in motion on circular orbits is investigated. The exact time delay between the appearance of its zeroth and first-order images agrees with our analytic estimate, which accounts for the observer inclination, with $\lesssim 20\%$ error for hotspots located about $\lesssim 5M$ from a Schwarzschild BH of mass $M$. Since M87$^\star$ and Sgr A$^\star$ host geometrically-thick accretion flows, we also explore the variation in the diameters and widths of their first-order images with disk scale-height. Using a simple conical torus model, for realistic morphologies, we estimate the first-order image diameter to deviate from that of the shadow by $\lesssim 30\%$ and its width to be $\lesssim 1.3M$. Finally, the error in recovering the Schwarzschild lensing exponent ($\pi$), when using the diameters or the widths of the first and second-order images is estimated to be $\lesssim 20\%$. It will soon become possible to robustly learn more about the spacetime geometry of astrophysical BHs from such measurements.</description>

      <title>Recovery of the X-ray polarisation of Swift J1727.8$-$1613 after the soft-to-hard spectral transition</title>

Abstract: We report on the detection of X-ray polarisation in the black-hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 during its dim hard spectral state by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). This is the first detection of X-ray polarisation at the transition from the soft to the hard state in an X-ray binary. We find an averaged 2$-$8 keV polarisation degree of (3.3 ${\pm}$ 0.4) % and a corresponding polarisation angle of 3{\deg} ${\pm}$ 4{\deg}, which matches the polarisation detected during the rising stage of the outburst, in September$-$October 2023, within 1${\sigma}$ uncertainty. The observational campaign complements previous studies of this source and enables comparison of the X-ray polarisation properties of a single transient across the X-ray hardness-intensity diagram. The complete recovery of the X-ray polarisation properties, including the energy dependence, came after a dramatic drop in the X-ray polarisation during the soft state. The new IXPE observations in the dim hard state at the reverse transition indicate that the accretion properties, including the geometry of the corona, appear to be strikingly similar to the bright hard state during the outburst rise despite the X-ray luminosities differing by two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers used to be the most promising candidate for gravitational waves for ground-based gravitational wave detectors, such as advanced LIGO and advanced VIRGO. This was proved by the detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star merger in 2017. Numerical modeling is pivotal in predicting and interpreting binary neutron star mergers. This chapter reviews the progress of fully general relativistic magnetized binary neutron star merger simulations. From 2008 to 2024, about forty numerical relativity simulations of magnetized binary neutron star mergers were conducted with a different level of sophistication. This chapter aims to comprehensively view the magnetohydrodynamics effect in binary neutron star mergers by reviewing all the related works.</description>

Abstract: MAGIC is a system of two 17-m diameter Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, located at an altitude of 2200 m in Roque de los Muchachos on the Canary island of La Palma, exploring the gamma-ray sky above a few tens of GeV and up to tens of TeV. This system provides a low energy threshold and a fast automated response to transient phenomena. In this contribution, some selected results of MAGIC, which has been collecting data for more than 20 years, are reviewed. Special attention is given to multiwavelength and multimessenger astronomy, such as GRB 201216C, the farthest ground-based detection of a very-high-energy gamma-ray bursts, as well as the RS Ophiuchi nova. The scientific program also includes measuring the cosmic-ray electron positron spectrum, estimating the size of stars using intensity interferometry, studying gravitational lensing and searching for dark matter in spheroidal galaxies. Finally, a glimpse into the future is given by presenting the performance of the joint observations with the first Large-Sized Telescope from the Cherenkov Telescope Array and MAGIC.</description>

      <title>Implication of Jet Physics from MeV Line Emission of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-relativistic jets are believed to play important role in producing prompt emission and afterglow of gamma-ray burst (GRB), but the nature of the jet is poorly known owing to the lacking of decisive features observed in the prompt emission. A series of bright, narrow and regularly-evolving MeV emission line detected in the brightest-of-all-time GRB 221009A provide unprecedented opportunity to probe GRB jet physics. The time evolution of the central energy of the line with power-law index $-1$ is naturally explained by high-latitude curvature effect. Under the assumption that the line emission is generated in the prompt emission by $e^\pm$ pair production, cooling and annihilation in the jet, we can strictly constrain jet physics with observed line emission properties. We find the radius of the emission region is $r\sim10^{16}$cm. The narrow line width of $10\%$ implies that pairs cool fast down to non-relativistic state within a time of tenth of the dynamical time. This requires a magnetic-field energy density much larger than the prompt gamma-ray energy density in the jet, implying a magnetic field dominated jet. The temporal behavior of line flux suggests some angle dependence of line emission. We also discuss the difficulties of other scenarios to interpret the observed emission line.</description>

      <title>A dynamical model for IRAS 00500+6713: the remnant of a type Iax supernova SN 1181 hosting a double degenerate merger product WD J005311</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: IRAS 00500+6713 is a hypothesized remnant of a type Iax supernova SN 1181. Multi-wavelength observations have revealed its complicated morphology; a dusty infrared ring is sandwiched by the inner and outer X-ray nebulae. We analyze the archival X-ray data taken by XMM-Newton and Chandra to constrain the {angular radius}, mass, and metal abundance of the X-ray nebulae, and construct a theoretical model describing the dynamical evolution of IRAS 00500+6713, including the effects of the interaction between the SN ejecta and the intense wind enriched with carbon burning ashes from the central white dwarf (WD) J005311. We show that the inner X-ray nebula corresponds to the wind termination shock while the outer X-ray nebula to the shocked interface between the SN ejecta and the interstellar matter. The observed X-ray properties can be explained by our model with an {ejecta kinetic} energy of $E_\mathrm{ej} = (0.77 \mbox{--} 1.1)\times 10^{48}$~erg, an ejecta mass of $M_\mathrm{ej} = 0.18\mbox{--}0.53~M_\odot$, if the currently observed wind from WD J005311 started to blow $t_\mathrm{w} \gtrsim 810$ yr after the explosion, i.e., approximately after A.D. 1990. The inferred SN properties are compatible with those of Type Iax SNe and the timing of the wind launch may correspond to the Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction of the oxygen-neon core of WD J005311 that triggered a surface carbon burning. Our analysis supports that IRAS 00500+6713 is the remnant of SN Iax 1181 produced by a double degenerate merger of oxygen-neon and carbon-oxygen WDs, and WD J005311 is the surviving merger product.</description>

      <title>The Coherent Magnetic Field of the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12120v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a suite of models of the coherent magnetic field of the Galaxy (GMF) based on new divergence-free parametric functions describing the global structure of the field. The model parameters are fit to the latest full-sky Faraday rotation measures of extragalactic sources (RMs) and polarized synchrotron intensity (PI) maps from WMAP and Planck. We employ multiple models for the density of thermal and cosmic-ray electrons in the Galaxy, needed to predict the skymaps of RMs and PI for a given GMF model. The robustness of the inferred properties of the GMF is gauged by studying many combinations of parametric field models and electron density models. We determine the pitch angle of the local magnetic field (11+/-1 deg.), explore the evidence for a grand-design spiral coherent magnetic field (inconclusive), determine the strength of the toroidal and poloidal magnetic halo fields below and above the disk (magnitudes the same for both hemispheres within 10%), set constraints on the half-height of the cosmic-ray diffusion volume (&gt;2.9 kpc), investigate the compatibility of RM- and PI-derived magnetic field strengths (compatible under certain assumptions) and check if the toroidal halo field could be created by the shear of the poloidal halo field due to the differential rotation of the Galaxy (possibly). A set of eight models is identified to help quantify the present uncertainties in the coherent GMF -- spanning different functional forms, data products and auxiliary input, and maximizing the differences in their predictions. We present the corresponding skymaps of rates for axion-photon conversion in the Galaxy, and deflections of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Dark matter bound-state formation in the Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sun may capture asymmetric dark matter (DM), which can subsequently form bound-states through the radiative emission of a sub-GeV scalar. This process enables generation of scalars without requiring DM annihilation. In addition to DM capture on nucleons, the DM-scalar coupling responsible for bound-state formation also induces capture from self-scatterings of ambient DM particles with DM particles already captured, as well as with DM bound-states formed in-situ within the Sun. This scenario is studied in detail by solving Boltzmann equations numerically and analytically. In particular, we take into consideration that the DM self-capture rates require a treatment beyond the conventional Born approximation. We show that, thanks to DM scatterings on bound-states, the number of DM particles captured increases exponentially, leading to enhanced emission of relativistic scalars through bound-state formation, whose final decay products could be observable. We explore phenomenological signatures with the example that the scalar mediator decays to neutrinos. We find that the neutrino flux emitted can be comparable to atmospheric neutrino fluxes within the range of energies below one hundred MeV. Future facilities like Hyper-K, and direct DM detection experiments can further test such scenario.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Progenitor Stars of Observed IIP Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) are thought to originate from the explosion of massive stars &gt; 10 Msun. Their luminosity is primarily powered by the explosion energy and the radioactive decay energy of 56Co, with the photosphere location regulated by hydrogen recombination. However, the physical connections between SNe IIP and their progenitor stars remain unclear. This paper presents a comprehensive study of SNe IIP and their progenitor stars by using the one-dimensional stellar evolution code, MESA. Our model grids consider the effects of stellar metallicity, mass, and rotation in the evolution of massive stars, as well as explosion energy and 56Ni production in modeling supernovae. To elucidate the observed SNe IIP and their origins, we compare their light curves (LCs) with our models. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of stellar parameters on LCs by considering stellar mass metallicity, rotation, explosion energy, and 56Ni production. We find that more massive stars exhibit longer plateaus due to increased photon diffusion time caused by massive ejecta. Higher metallicity leads to increased opacity and mass loss of progenitor stars. Rapid rotation affects internal stellar structures, enhancing convective mixing and mass loss, potentially affecting the plateau's brightness and duration. Higher explosion energy results in brighter but shorter plateaus due to faster-moving ejecta. 56Ni mass affects late-time luminosity and plateau duration, with larger masses leading to slower declines.</description>

      <title>The Population of Massive Stars in Active Galactic Nuclei Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational instability in the outskirts of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks lead to disk fragmentation and formation of super-massive (several 10^2Msun) stars with potentially long lifetimes. Alternatively, stars can be captured ex-situ and grow from gas accretion in the AGN disk. However, the number density distribution throughout the disk is limited by thermal feedback as their luminosities provide the dominant heating source. We derive equilibrium stellar surface density profiles under two limiting contexts: in the case where the stellar lifetimes are prolonged due to recycling of hydrogen rich disk gas, only the fraction of gas converted into heat is removed from the disk accretion flow. Alternatively, if stellar composition recycling is inefficient and stars can evolve off the main sequence, the disk accretion rate is quenched towards smaller radii resembling a classical star-burst disk, albeit the effective removal rate depends not only on the stellar lifetime, but also the mass of stellar remnants. For AGNs with central Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) masses of \sim 10^6 to 10^8Msun accreting at \sim 0.1 Eddington efficiency, we estimate a total number of 10^3 to 10^5 coexisting massive stars and the rate of stellar mergers to be 10^-3 to 1 per year. We motivate the detailed study of interaction between a swarm of massive stars through hydro and N body simulations to provide better prescriptions of dynamical processes in AGN disks, and to constrain more accurate estimates of the stellar population.</description>

      <title>Exploring Large-Volume GAGG Scintillators for use in MeV Gamma-Ray Astrophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray astrophysics in the MeV band is an exciting field in astronomy due to its potential for multi-messenger astrophysics. It has, however, remained under-explored when compared to other wavelengths. One reason for this observational gap is the difficulties with measuring these high-energy photons and the requirement of large amounts of detection material. In this work, we investigate the usage of large-volume GAGG scintillators for use as a calorimeter in future MeV telescopes. We developed a $5\times5$ array calorimeter utilizing $1\times1\times6 \ \mathrm{cm}^3$ GAGG crystals with C-series SiPM readout. The calorimeter was tested at the High Intensity Gamma-ray Facility (HIGS) with monoenergetic beams ranging from $2-25 \ \mathrm{MeV}$. Finally, we also investigated larger $1\times1\times8 \ \mathrm{cm}^3$ crystals and characterized their response across their depth when their surface treatment is either polished or frosted.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we discuss the effect of light, non-gauge, bosonic degrees of freedom on the exterior spacetime of an exotic compact object. We show that such fields generically introduce large deviations from black hole spacetimes of General Relativity near and outside the surfaces of ultra-compact exotic objects unless one assumes they totally decouple from the standard model or new heavy fields. Hence, using black hole spacetimes of General Relativity to model ultra-compact exotic objects and their perturbations relies implicitly on this assumption or on the absence of such fields.</description>
