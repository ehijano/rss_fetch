      <title>Trade among moral agents with information asymmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20551v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two agents trade an item in a simultaneous offer setting, where the exchange takes place if and only if the buyer's bid price weakly exceeds the seller's ask price. Each agent is randomly assigned the buyer or seller role. Both agents are characterized by a certain degree of Kantian morality, whereby they pick their bidding strategy behind a Veil of Ignorance, taking into account how the outcome would be affected if their trading partner adopted their strategy. I consider two variants with asymmetric information, respectively allowing buyers to have private information about their valuation or sellers to be privately informed about the item's quality. I show that when all trades are socially desirable, even the slightest degree of morality guarantees that the outcome is fully efficient. In turn, when quality is uncertain and some exchanges are socially undesirable, full efficiency is only achieved with sufficiently high moral standards. Moral concerns also ensure equal ex-ante treatment of the two agents in equilibrium. Finally, I show that if agents are altruistic rather than moral, inefficiencies persist even with a substantial degree of altruism.</description>

      <title>A Model of Ride Dispatch in Informal Market under Rival Entry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I develop a continuous-time model in which an incumbent batch-service provider faces stochastic passenger arrivals and must decide when to dispatch under the threat of customer defection to a faster entrant. The incumbent's problem is formalized as a trade-off between departure frequency and load maximization, with the option to accept mid-route pickups. I characterize the equilibrium dispatch strategy and show that increased competitive pressure strictly reduces the feasible departure threshold, leading to more frequent departures with smaller passenger loads. Longer travel times tend to raise the unconstrained optimal threshold, but realized dispatch behavior also depends on passenger tolerance for delay. Endogenizing demand by letting the arrival rate fall with expected waiting time yields an interior optimum, rationalizing why incumbents now (i) depart partially full and (ii) accept mid-route riders. Comparative statics show that the optimal threshold tends to increase with travel time under a mild regularity condition and decreases with competitive intensity.</description>

      <title>Berk-Nash Rationalizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Berk--Nash rationalizability, a new solution concept for misspecified learning environments. It parallels rationalizability in games and captures all actions that are optimal given beliefs formed using the model that best fits the data in the agent's misspecified model class. Our main result shows that, with probability one, every \emph{limit action} -- any action played or approached infinitely often -- is Berk--Nash rationalizable. This holds regardless of whether behavior converges. We apply the concept to known examples and identify classes of environments where it is easily characterized. The framework provides a general tool for bounding long-run behavior without assuming convergence to a Berk--Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Repeated Auctions with Speculators: Arbitrage Incentives and Forks in DAOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the vulnerability of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to speculative exploitation via their redemption mechanisms. Studying a game-theoretic model of repeated auctions for governance shares with speculators, we characterize the conditions under which -- in equilibrium -- an exploitative exit is guaranteed to occur, occurs in expectation, or never occurs. We evaluate four redemption mechanisms and extend our model to include atomic exits, time delays, and DAO spending strategies. Our results highlight an inherent tension in DAO design: mechanisms intended to protect members from majority attacks can inadvertently create opportunities for costly speculative exploitation. We highlight governance mechanisms that can be used to prevent speculation.</description>

      <title>Geopolitical Tensions and Financial Networks: Strategic Shifts Toward Alternatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global financial systems are undergoing strategic shifts as geopolitical tensions reshape international trade and payments. The United States (US)-China trade war, sanctions regimes, and rising concerns over the weaponization of financial infrastructures like SWIFT have led countries to seek alternative networks, including China's CIPS and emerging cross-border CBDCs. This letter presents a dynamic theoretical framework where sanction risks, investment choices, and network effects drive payment system migration. Empirical evidence from Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, and Argentina supports the model. Policy implications point toward increasing financial fragmentation, with critical roles for international institutions to mitigate systemic risks. The future of finance may be less global and more regionally fragmented, influenced heavily by political considerations.</description>

      <title>Union Shapley Value: Quantifying Group Impact via Collective Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of extensions of the Shapley value to groups. We propose a new, natural extension called the Union Shapley Value, which assesses a group's contribution by examining the impact of its removal from the game. This intuition is formalized through two axiomatic characterizations, closely related to existing axiomatizations of the Shapley value. Furthermore, we characterize the class of group semivalues and identify a dual approach that measures synergy instead of the value of a coalition. Our analysis reveals a novel connection between several group values previously proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>On the existence of pure epsilon-equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, as the number of agents gets large, the share of games that admit a pure $\epsilon$-equilibrium converges to 1. Our result holds even for pure $\epsilon$-equilibrium in which all agents, except for at most one, play a best response. In contrast, it is known that the share of games that admit a pure Nash equilibrium, that is, for $\epsilon=0$, is asymptotically $1-1/e\approx 0.63$. This suggests that very small deviations from perfect rationality, captured by positive values of $\epsilon$, suffice to ensure the general existence of stable outcomes. We also study the existence of pure $\epsilon$-equilibrium when the number of actions gets large. Our proofs rely on the probabilistic method and on the Chen-Stein method.</description>

      <title>MAD Chairs: A new tool to evaluate AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20986v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper contributes a new way to evaluate AI. Much as one might evaluate a machine in terms of its performance at chess, this approach involves evaluating a machine in terms of its performance at a game called "MAD Chairs". At the time of writing, evaluation with this game exposed opportunities to improve Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Qwen and DeepSeek. Furthermore, this paper sets a stage for future innovation in game theory and AI safety by providing an example of success with non-standard approaches to each: studying a game beyond the scope of previous game theoretic tools and mitigating a serious AI safety risk in a way that requires neither determination of values nor their enforcement.</description>
