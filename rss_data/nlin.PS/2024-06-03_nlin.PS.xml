      <title>Modulation theory of soliton-mean flow in KdV equation with box type initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the KdV equation with box type initial data, the interaction between a trial soliton and large-scale dispersive mean flow is studied theoretically and numerically. The pure box initial value can cause rarefaction wave and dispersive shock wave, and can create an area of soliton train. The key to the interaction of soliton and mean flow is that the dynamic evolutions of the mean flow and the local soliton can be described by the same modulation system. The soliton modulation system is derived from the degenerations of the two-genus Whitham modulation system. Considering the influence of rarefaction wave, dispersive shock wave and soliton train on the trial soliton, in the framework of Whitham modulation theory, the equation describing the soliton trajectory and the changes in amplitude and phase shift are given explicitly. The predicted results are compared with the numerical simulations, which verifies the corrections of the theoretical analysis. The exotic interaction phenomena between soliton and mean flow found in this work have broad applications to shallow water soliton propagations and real soliton experiments in fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional solitons in second-harmonic-generating media with fractional diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a system of propagation equations for the fundamental-frequency (FF) and second-harmonic (SH) waves in the bulk waveguide with the effective fractional diffraction and quadratic (chi ^(2)) nonlinearity. The numerical solution produces families of ground-state (zero-vorticity) two-dimensional solitons in the free space, which are stable in exact agreement with the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion, while vortex solitons are completely unstable in that case. Mobility of the stable solitons and inelastic collisions between them are briefly considered too. In the presence of a harmonic-oscillator (HO) trapping potential, families of partially stable single- and two-color solitons (SH-only or FF-SH ones, respectively) are obtained, with zero and nonzero vorticities. The single-and two-color solitons are linked by a bifurcation which takes place withthe increase of the soliton's power.</description>

      <title>Metal Assisted Chemical Etching patterns at a Ge/Cr/Au interface modulated by the Euler instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a solid state system which spontaneously generates remarkable engraving patterns on the surface of Ge. The layered construction, with a metal film on the Ge surface, results in coupling of the metal catalyzed etching reaction with the long range stress field at the Ge - metal interface. The etching patterns generated have similarities with Turing patterns, hydrodynamic patterns, crack propagation, and biological form. We describe spirals, radial patterns, and more disordered structures. Euler buckling of the metal layer generates a characteristic wavelength for some patterns.</description>

      <title>Incommensurable matter-wave jets in quasi-1D geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matter-wave jets are ejected from a Bose-Einstein condensate subjected to a modulation of the interaction strength. For sufficiently strong modulation additional higher harmonic matter-wave jets emerge. Here we report the first experimental observation of incommensurable "golden" $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ matter-wave jets in a Bose-Einstein condensate exposed to a single frequency interaction modulation. We study the formation of higher-order jets and the corresponding incommensurable density waves in quasi-one-dimensional geometry with numerical one dimensional (1D) Gross-Pitaevskii equation simulation. We explore the process of jet formation experimentally and theoretically for a wide range of modulation amplitudes and frequencies and establish a phase diagram delineating different regimes of jet formation.</description>
