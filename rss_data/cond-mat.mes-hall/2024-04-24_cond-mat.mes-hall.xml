      <title>Shapiro Steps and Stability of Skyrmions Interacting with Alternating Anisotropy Under the Influence of ac and dc Drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use atomistic simulations to examine the sliding dynamics of a skyrmion in a two-dimensional system containing a periodic one-dimensional stripe pattern of variations between low and high values of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The skyrmion changes in size as it crosses the interface between two anisotropy regions. Upon applying combined dc and ac driving in either parallel or perpendicular directions, we observe a wide variety of Shapiro steps, Shapiro spikes, and phase-locking phenomena. The phase-locked orbits have two-dimensional dynamics due to the gyrotropic or Magnus dynamics of the skyrmions, and are distinct from the phase-locked orbits found for strictly overdamped systems. Along a given Shapiro step when the ac drive is perpendicular to the dc drive, the velocity parallel to the ac drive is locked while the velocity in the perpendicular direction increases with increasing drive to form Shapiro spikes. At the transition between adjacent Shapiro steps, the parallel velocity jumps up to the next step value, and the perpendicular velocity drops. The skyrmion Hall angle shows a series of spikes as a function of increasing dc drive, where the jumps correspond to the transition between different phase-locked steps. At high drives, the Shapiro steps and Shapiro spikes are lost. When both the ac and dc drives are parallel to the stripe periodicity direction, Shapiro steps appear, while if the dc drive is parallel to the stripe periodicity direction and the ac drive is perpendicular to the stripe periodicity, there are only two locked phases, and the skyrmion motion consists of a combination of sliding along the interfaces between the two anisotropy values and jumping across the interfaces.</description>

      <title>Probing the Spin-Momentum Locking in Rashba Surfaces via Spin Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the intriguing spin-momentum locking phenomenon within the Rashba states of antimony (Sb) films. By combining spin pumping with the flow of an external charge current, we reveal the topological properties of surface states in Sb films. Taking advantage of the well-defined spin polarization of both spin-momentum-locked charge currents and spin-pumped currents, we demonstrate precise manipulation over the direction and magnitude of the resulting charging current, generated through the inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect. This fascinating phenomenon is attributed to the dynamic interaction between the accumulation of out-of-equilibrium pumped spins and the flowing spins, intrinsically locked perpendicular to the direction of the charge current. The results show that Sb as a promising material for basic and applied investigation of spintronics phenomena. We believe that the nanostructures investigated here open the way for the development of low-power logic gates operating in the range of a few tens of microamperes.</description>

      <title>Creation and Manipulation of Higher-Order Topological States by Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to implement tunable higher-order topological states in a heterojunction consisting of a two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator and the recently discovered altermagnets, whose unique spin-polarization in both real and reciprocal space and null magnetization are in contrast to conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Based on symmetry analysis and effective edge theory, we show that the special spin splitting in altermagnets with different symmetries, such as $d$-wave, can introduce Dirac mass terms with opposite signs on the adjacent boundaries of the topological insulator, resulting in the higher-order topological state with mass-domain bound corner states. Moreover, by adjusting the direction of the N\'{e}el vector, we can manipulate such topological corner states by moving their positions. By first-principles calculations, taking a 2D topological insulator bismuthene with a square lattice on an altermagnet MnF$_2$ as an example, we demonstrate the feasibility of creating and manipulating the higher-order topological states through altermagnets. Finally, we discuss the experimental implementation and detection of the tunable topological corner states, as well as the potential non-Abelian braiding of the Dirac corner fermions.</description>

      <title>Competing anisotropies in the chiral cubic magnet Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$ unveiled by resonant x-ray magnetic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cubic $\beta$-Mn-type alloy Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$ is a chiral helimagnet that exhibits a peculiar temperature-dependent behavior in the spiral pitch, which decreases from 130 nm at room temperature to 70 nm below 20 K. Notably, this shortening is also accompanied by a structural transition of the metastable skyrmion texture, transforming from a hexagonal lattice to a square lattice of elongated skyrmions. The underlying mechanism of these transformations remain unknown, with interactions potentially involved including temperature-dependent Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and exchange anisotropy. Here, x-ray resonant magnetic small-angle scattering in vectorial magnetic fields was employed to investigate the temperature dependence of the anisotropic properties of the helical phase in Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$. Our results reveal quantitatively that the magnitude of the anisotropic exchange interaction increases by a factor of 4 on cooling from room temperature to 20 K, leading to a 5% variation in the helical pitch within the (001) plane at 20 K. While anisotropic exchange interaction contributes to the shortening of the spiral pitch, its magnitude is insufficient to explain the variation in the spiral periodicity from room to low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that magnetocrystalline and exchange anisotropies compete, favoring different orientations of the helical vector in the ground state.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of electron irradiation for creating spin ensembles in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boron vacancy centre ($V_{\rm B}^-$) ensembles in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have attracted recent interest for their potential as two-dimensional solid-state quantum sensors. Irradiation is necessary for $V_{\rm B}^-$ creation, however, to date only limited attention has been given to optimising the defect production process, especially in the case of bulk irradiation with high-energy particles, which offers scalability through the potential for creating ensembles in large volumes of material. Here we systematically investigate the effect of electron irradiation by varying the dose delivered to a range of hBN samples, which differ in their purity, and search for an optimum in measurement sensitivity. We find that moderate electron irradiation doses ($\approx 5\times 10^{18}$~cm$^{-2}$) appear to offer the best sensitivity, and also observe a dependence on the initial crystal purity. These results pave the way for the scalable and cost-effective production of hBN quantum sensors, and provide insight into the mechanisms limiting $V_{\rm B}^-$ spin properties.</description>

      <title>Entanglement measures of Majorana bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana bound states emerge in topological superconductors as zero-energy edge states exhibiting spatial nonlocality. Despite the enormous advances, the detection of Majorana bound states is still challenging mainly because topologically trivial Andreev bound states produce similar signatures. In this work we consider a topological superconductor with Majorana bound states coupled to quantum dots and investigate the dynamics of their quantum correlations with the aim to explore their entanglement properties. In particular, we characterize entanglement by using concurrence and discord, which are also complemented by the entanglement dynamics and return probability. We find that Majorana bound states at truly zero energy can transform an initially entangled system into its classical state, while they can create maximally entangled states at a finite energy overlap. Interestingly, we show that the system can generate a maximally entangled state between MBSs and a quantum dot by simply controlling the Majorana nonlocality. We demonstrate that these results hold in the scenarios when the initial state is either maximally entangled or separable, albeit in the latter maximally entangled states are achieved in the long time dynamics. Furthermore, we contrast our findings with those produced by a regular fermion and obtain very distinct entanglement signatures. Our work offers an alternative approach to characterize Majorana bound states, which can be also useful towards their utilization for quantum information tasks.</description>

      <title>Reconstructed Electronic Structure in 2D vdW 1T-Ta$S_2$ for Quantum Sensing and Information Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a class of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials that exhibit a diverse range of electronic structures, including charge density waves (CDWs) that can lead to insulating, semiconducting, metallic, and even superconducting phases. While the formation of CDWs in these systems has been recognized in early research [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 156401 (2022); Nat. Phys. 11, 328 (2015)], the underlying mechanisms driving the commensurate CDW (CCDW) phase remain largely unexplored. CCDWs typically originate from factors such as perfect Fermi surface nesting and/or electron-phonon coupling, causing the divergence of the chiral electronic structure. However, in the case of layered 2D TMD materials with CCDW phases, the significance of reconstructed electronic structures resulting from periodic lattice distortions (PLD) and photoemission matrix element effects in the CCDW instability needs to be visualized. This study focuses on computationally accessible CCDW phases in 1T-Ta$S_2$, a prototypical TMD with a rich CDW phase diagram, aiming to understand the origins of CCDW phases. The insights gained from this investigation have the potential to advance the application of 2D materials in next-generation electronics, quantum sensing and information science.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale single-electron box with a floating lead for quantum sensing: modelling and device characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of a single-electron box (SEB) biased through a floating node technique that is common in charge-coupled devices (CCDs). The device is analyzed and characterized in the context of single-electron charge-sensing techniques for integrated silicon quantum dots (QD). The unique aspect of our SEB design is the incorporation of a metallic floating node, strategically employed for sensing and precise injection of electrons into an electrostatically formed QD. To analyse the SEB, we propose an extended multi-orbital Anderson impurity model (MOAIM), adapted to our nanoscale SEB system, that is used to predict theoretically the behaviour of the SEB in the context of a charge-sensing application. The validation of the model and the sensing technique has been carried out on a QD fabricated in a fully depleted silicon on insulator (FDSOI) process on a 22-nm technological node. We demonstrate the MOAIM's efficacy in predicting the observed electronic behavior and elucidating the complex electron dynamics and correlations in the SEB. The results of our study reinforce the versatility and precision of the model in the realm of nanoelectronics and highlight the practical utility of the metallic floating node as a mechanism for charge injection and detection in integrated QDs. Finally, we identify the limitations of our model in capturing higher-order effects observed in our measurements and propose future outlooks to reconcile some of these discrepancies.</description>

      <title>Shaping non-reciprocal caustic spin-wave beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Successive Phase Transition in Higher-order Topological Anderson Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder, traditionally believed to hinder the propagation of waves. has recently been shown to prompt the occurrence of topological phase transitions. For example, when disorder strength continuously increases and surpasses certain critical value, a phase transition from topologically trivial to nontrivial insulating phases occurs. However, in the parameter domain of the nontrivial phase, whether there exists a finer phase diagram that can be further classified by different disorder strengths is still unclear. Here we present a successive topological phase transition driven by the disorder strength in a higher-order topological insulator with long-range couplings. As the strength of the disorder gradually increases, the real-space topological invariant of the system undergoes a consecutive change from 0 to 4, accompanied by the stepped increase in the number of boundary-localized corner states. Our work opens an avenue for utilizing disorder to induce phase transitions among different higher-order topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Motion of 2D exciton in momentum space leads to pseudospin distribution narrowing on the Bloch Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motional narrowing implies narrowing induced by motion, for example, in nuclear resonance, the thermally induced random motion of the nuclei in an inhomogeneous environment leads to counter-intuitive narrowing of the resonance line. Similarly, the excitons in monolayer semiconductors experience magnetic inhomogeneity: the electron-hole spin-exchange interaction manifests as an in-plane pseudo-magnetic field with a periodically varying orientation inside the exciton band. The excitons undergo random momentum scattering and pseudospin precession repeatedly in this inhomogeneous magnetic environment - typically resulting in fast exciton depolarization. On the contrary, we show that such magnetic inhomogeneity averages out at high scattering rate due to motional narrowing. Physically, a faster exciton scattering leads to a narrower pseudospin distribution on the Bloch sphere, implying a nontrivial improvement in exciton polarization. The in-plane nature of the pseudo-magnetic field enforces a contrasting scattering dependence between the circularly and linearly polarized excitons - providing a spectroscopic way to gauge the sample quality.</description>

      <title>Spin-mechanical coupling in 2D antiferromagnet CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-mechanical coupling is vital in diverse fields including spintronics, sensing and quantum transduction. Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials provide a unique platform for investigating spin-mechanical coupling, attributed to their mechanical flexibility and novel spin orderings. However, studying spin-mechanical coupling in 2D magnets presents challenges in probing mechanical deformation and thermodynamic properties change at nanoscale. Here we use nano opto-electro-mechanical interferometry to mechanically detect the phase transition and magnetostriction effect in multilayer CrSBr, an air-stable antiferromagnets with large magnon-exciton coupling. The transitions among antiferromagnetism, spin-canted ferromagnetism and paramagnetism are visualized by optomechanical frequency anomalies. Nontrivial magnetostriction coefficient 2.3x10^(-5) and magnetoelastic coupling strength on the order of 10^6 J/m^3 have been found. Moreover, we demonstrate the substantial tunability of the magnetoelastic constant by nearly 50% via gate-induced strain. Our findings demonstrate the strong spin-mechanical coupling in CrSBr and paves the way for developing sensitive magnetic sensing and efficient quantum transduction at atomically thin limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a polymer-based nano-device consisting of a single trans-polyacetylene (tPA) molecule capacitively coupled to external voltage gates. We model the integrated device using a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)-like Hamiltonian, and we demonstrate the emergence of localized domain walls (DWs) with quantized charges (i.e., soliton excitations) localized at the gates. Interestingly, by increasing the applied voltage, multiple discrete charges can be accumulated, which may be useful for potential technological applications. Exploiting the topological character of the solitonic excitations of tPA, this device can be considered as an organic-based quantum dot with a very large and robust quantized charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect -- the dependence of critical current on its direction -- can arise from the simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetry in a superconductor and has gained interest for its potential applications in superconducting electronics. In this letter, we study the effect in a two-dimensional topological insulator (2D TI) in both a uniform geometry as well as in a long Josephson junction. We show that in the presence of Zeeman fields, a circulating edge current enables a large non-reciprocity of the critical current. We find a maximum diode efficiency 1 for the uniform 2D TI and $(\sqrt{2} - 1)^2 \approx 0.17$ for the long Josephson junction.</description>

Abstract: Initializing the ground state of a quantum bit (qubit) based on Majorana zero modes is one of the most pressing issues for future topological quantum computers. We explore a parity-to-magnetism protocol for initializing such topological qubits based on magnet-superconductor hybrid networks by coupling magnetic chains to a single molecule magnet. The coupling can be activated by switching the spin state of the molecule, allowing the ground state parity of the chain to be controlled. We demonstrate that initialization with either parity for a Majorana qubit can be achieved. We then introduce the dressed Majorana qubit, which includes the state of the molecule in the definition of the logical qubit. Using this definition we can initialize a qubit without high-precision timing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By implementing a charge pumping scheme for one-dimensional aperiodic chains, we confirm the existence of topological phases in these systems whenever their finite-size realizations admit inversion symmetry. These phases are usually characterized by an anomalous edge response as a result of the bulk-boundary correspondence. We show that these signatures are all present in various chains, each representing a different class of structural aperiodicity: the Fibonacci quasicrystal, the Tribonacci quasicrystal, and the Thue-Morse chain. More specifically, we calculate three quantities: the Berry phase of the crystalline approximation of the finite-size systems, the polarization response to an inifintesimal static and constant electric field in systems with open boundary conditions, and the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum. We find that all of them provide signatures of a topologically nontrivial phase.</description>

      <title>Finite-time dynamics of an entanglement engine: current, fluctuations and kinetic uncertainty relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement engines are autonomous quantum thermal machines designed to generate entanglement from the presence of a particle current flowing through the device. In this work, we investigate the functioning of a two-qubit entanglement engine beyond the steady-state regime. Within a master equation approach, we derive the time-dependent state, the particle current, as well as the associated current correlation functions. Our findings establish a direct connection between coherence and internal current, elucidating the existence of a critical current that serves as an indicator for entanglement in the steady state. We then apply our results to investigate kinetic uncertainty relations (KURs) at finite times. We demonstrate that there are more than one possible definitions for KURs at finite times. While the two definitions agree in the steady-state regime, they lead to different parameter's ranges for violating KUR at finite times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral engineering of TeraHertz (THz) light fields and the use of the handedness of light in THz light-matter interactions promise many novel opportunities for advanced sensing and control of matter in this frequency range. Unlike previously explored methods, this is achieved here by leveraging the chiral properties of highly confined THz surface plasmon modes. More specifically, we design ultrasmall surface plasmonic-based THz cavities and THz metasurfaces that display significant and adjustable chiral behavior under modest magnetic fields. For such a prototypical example of non-hermitian and dispersive photonic system, we demonstrate the capacity to magnetic field-tune both the poles and zeros of cavity resonances, the two fundamental parameters governing their resonance properties. Alongside the observed handedness-dependent cavity frequencies, this highlights the remarkable ability to engineer chiral and tunable radiative couplings for THz resonators and metasurfaces. The extensive tunability offered by the surface plasmonic approach paves the way for the development of agile and multifunctional THz metasurfaces as well as the realization of ultrastrong chiral light-matter interactions at low energy in matter with potential far-reaching applications for the design of material properties.</description>

      <title>Observation of Negative Surface and Interface Energies of Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface energy is a fundamental property of materials and is particularly important in describing nanomaterials where atoms or molecules at the surface constitute a large fraction of the material. Traditionally, surface energy is considered to be a positive quantity, where atoms or molecules at the surface are less thermodynamically stable than their counterparts in the interior of the material because they have fewer bonds or interactions at the surface. Using calorimetric methods, we show that the surface energy is negative in some prototypical colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, or quantum dots with organic ligand coatings. This implies that the surface atoms are more thermodynamically stable than those on the interior due to the strong bonds between these atoms and surfactant molecules, or ligands, that coat their surface. In addition, we extend this work to core/shell indium phosphide/zinc sulfide nanocrystals and show that the interfacial energy between these materials is highly thermodynamically favorable in spite of their large lattice mismatch. This work challenges many of the assumptions that have guided thinking about colloidal nanomaterial thermodynamics, investigates the fundamental stability of many technologically relevant colloidal nanomaterials, and paves the way for future experimental and theoretical work on nanocrystal thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: Strong interaction among electrons in two-dimensional systems in the presence of high magnetic fields gives rise to fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states that host quasi-particles with fractional charge and statistics. We perform high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy of FQH states in ultra-clean Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) devices. Spectroscopy of FQH states shows sharp excitations in tunneling experiments that have been predicted for electron fractionalizing into bound states of quasi-particles. From our measurements and their comparison to theoretical calculations, we find energy gaps for candidate non-abelian FQH states that are larger by a factor of 5 than other related systems, making BLG an ideal setting for the manipulation of these novel quasi-particles and for the creation of a topological quantum bit. Our STM experiment also reveals previously undiscovered states in such ultra-clean samples.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the spin ordering in magic-angle graphene via edge state equilibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the symmetry breaking order of correlated quantum phases is essential for understanding the microscopic interactions in their host systems. The flat bands in magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) provide an especially rich arena to investigate such interaction-driven ground states, and while progress has been made in identifying the correlated insulators and their excitations at commensurate moire filling factors, the spin-valley polarizations of the topological states that emerge at high magnetic field remain unknown. Here we introduce a new technique based on twist-decoupled van der Waals layers that enables measurements of their electronic band structure and, by studying the backscattering between counter-propagating edge states, determination of relative spin polarization of the their edge modes. Applying this method to twist-decoupled MATBG and monolayer graphene, we find that the broken-symmetry quantum Hall states that extend from the charge neutrality point in MATBG are spin-unpolarized at even integer filling factors. The measurements also indicate that the correlated Chern insulator emerging from half filling of the flat valence band is spin-unpolarized, but suggest that its conduction band counterpart may be spin-polarized. Our results constrain models of spin-valley ordering in MATBG and establish a versatile approach to study the electronic properties of van der Waals systems.</description>

Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect has recently attracted significant interest due to its potential as a promising spectral tool and device applications. A theory of the nonlinear Hall effect on a disordered lattice is a crucial step towards explorations in realistic devices, but has not been addressed. We study the nonlinear Hall response on a lattice, which allows us to introduce strong disorder numerically. We reveal a disorder-induced fluctuation of the Berry curvature that was not discovered in the previous perturbation theories. The fluctuating Berry curvature induces a fluctuation of the nonlinear Hall conductivity, which anomalously increases as the Fermi energy moves from the band edges to higher energies. More importantly, the fluctuation may explain those observations in the recent experiments. We also discover an "Anderson localization" of the nonlinear Hall effect. This work shows a territory of the nonlinear Hall effect yet to be explored.</description>

      <title>Predicted Multiple Walker Breakdowns for Current-Driven Domain-Wall Motion in Antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically discover possible emergence of reentrant Walker breakdowns for current-driven domain walls in layered antiferromagnets in striking contrast to the unique Walker breakdown in ferromagnets. We reveal that the Lorentz contraction of domain-wall width in antiferromagnets gives rise to nonlinear current-dependence of the wall velocity and the predicted multiple Walker breakdowns. The dominant efficiency of the current-induced staggered spin-orbit torque over the spin-transfer torque to drive the domain-wall motion is also demonstrated. These findings are expected to be observed in synthetic antiferromagnets experimentally and provide an important contribution to the growing research field of antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Evidence for $\pi$-shifted Cooper quartets and few-mode transport in PbTe nanowire three-terminal Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Josephson junctions are typically characterized by a single phase difference across two superconductors. This conventional two-terminal Josephson junction can be generalized to a multi-terminal device where the Josephson energy contains terms with contributions from multiple independent phase variables. Such multi-terminal Josephson junctions (MTJJs) are being considered as platforms for engineering effective Hamiltonians with non-trivial topologies, such as Weyl crossings and higher-order Chern numbers. This approach offers unique possibilities that are complementary to phenomena attainable in bulk crystals, including topological states in more than three dimensions and real-time gate-tunability of the Hamiltonians. However, these prospects rely on the ability to create MTJJs with non-classical multi-terminal couplings in which only a handful of quantum modes are populated. Here, we demonstrate these requirements by using a three-terminal Josephson junction fabricated on selective-area-grown (SAG) PbTe nanowires. We observe signatures of a $\pi$-shifted Josephson effect, consistent with inter-terminal couplings mediated by four-particle quantum states called Cooper quartets. We further observe supercurrent co-existent with a non-monotonic evolution of the conductance with gate voltage, indicating transport mediated by a few quantum modes in both two- and three-terminal devices. These results establish a platform for investigations of topological Hamiltonians based on Andreev bound states.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the magnetization dynamics in nanomagnet vertices often found in artificial spin ices. Our analysis involves creating a simplified model that depicts edge magnetization using magnetic charges. We utilize the model to explore the energy landscape, its associated curvatures, and the fundamental modes. Our study uncovers specific magnonic regimes and transitions between magnetization states, marked by zero-modes, which can be understood within the framework of Landau theory. To verify our model, we compare it with micromagnetic simulations, demonstrating a noteworthy agreement.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically explore the possibility of realizing the symmetry-protected topological Haldane phase of spin-1 chains in a tunable hybrid platform of superconducting islands (SIs) and quantum dots (QDs). Inspired by recent findings suggesting that an appropriately tuned QD-SI-QD block may behave as a robust spin-1 unit, we study the behavior of many such units tunnel-coupled into linear chains. Our efficient and fully microscopic modeling of long chains with several tens of units is enabled by the use of the surrogate model solver [Phys. Rev. B 108, L220506 (2023); arXiv:2402.18357]. Our numerical findings indicate that the QD-SI-QD chains exhibit emblematic features of the Haldane phase, such as fractional spin-1/2 edge states and non-vanishing string order parameters, and that these persist over a sizeable region of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Approximation and Aharonov-Casher Bands in Twisted Homobilayer TMDs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological flat moir\'e bands with nearly ideal quantum geometry have been identified in AA homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e superlattices, and are thought to be crucial for understanding the fractional Chern insulating states recently observed therein. Previous work proposed viewing the system using an adiabatic approximation that replaces the position-dependence of the layer spinor by a nonuniform periodic effective magnetic field. When the local zero-point kinetic energy of this magnetic field cancels identically against that of an effective Zeeman energy, a Bloch-band version of Aharonov-Casher zero-energy modes, which we refer to as Aharonov-Casher band, emerges leading to ideal quantum geometry. Here, we critically examine the validity of the adiabatic approximation and identify the parameter regimes under which Aharonov-Casher bands emerge. We show that the adiabatic approximation is accurate for a wide range of parameters including those realized in experiments. Furthermore, we show that while the cancellation leading to the emergence of Aharonov-Casher bands is generally not possible beyond the leading Fourier harmonic, the leading harmonic is the dominant term in the Fourier expansions of the zero-point kinetic energy and Zeeman energy. As a result, the leading harmonic expansion accurately captures the trend of the bandwidth and quantum geometry, though it may fail to quantitatively reproduce more detailed information about the bands such as the Berry curvature distribution.</description>

      <title>Raman response and shear viscosity in the non-Fermi liquid phase of Luttinger semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.04045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Luttinger semimetals represent materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, harbouring doubly-degenerate quadratic band touchings at the Brillouin zone center. In the presence of Coulomb interactions, such a system exhibits a non-Fermi liquid phase [dubbed as the Luttinger-Abrikosov-Beneslavskii (LAB) phase], at low temperatures and zero doping. However, a clear experimental evidence of this emergent state remains elusive to this date. Hence, we focus on extracting the Raman response as a complementary experimental signature. At frequencies much larger than the temperature, the Raman response exhibits a power-law behavior, which can be verified experimentally. On the other hand, at lower frequencies, the Raman response displays a quasi-elastic peak. We also compute the ratio of the shear viscosity and the entropy density, and the value obtained is a consequence of the hyperscaling violation that emerges in the LAB phase.</description>

      <title>Photomolecular Effect: Visible Light Absorption at Water-Vapor Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.10646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evaporation of water is ubiquitous in nature and industrial technologies. The known mechanism for evaporation is "thermal evaporation" which highlights the energy input for evaporation is via heat. Due to the weak absorption of water to visible light, the first step to using solar energy to evaporate water is usually by converting it into thermal energy through photothermal processes via additional absorbing materials. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, we report here strong absorption of photons in the visible spectrum at the water-vapor interface by direct cleavage of water clusters via a process we call photomolecular effect. We show that this process happens at the water-vapor interface by measuring the dependence of the photomolecular evaporation rate on the wavelength, the angle of incidence, and the polarization of the incident light. The spectra signatures in the vapor phase further support the photomolecular effect. Despite the long propagation lengths of visible light in bulk water, we demonstrate that they can heat a thin layer of fog easily, suggesting that this process is ubiquitous. The photomolecular effect will have significant implications for the earth's water cycle, global warming, plant transpiration, as well as different technologies involving the evaporation of liquids from drying to power generation</description>
