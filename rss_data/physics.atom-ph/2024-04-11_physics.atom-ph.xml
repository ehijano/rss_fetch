      <title>Collisions of Spin-polarized YO Molecules for Single Partial Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient sub-Doppler laser cooling and optical trapping of YO molecules offer new opportunities to study collisional dynamics in the quantum regime. Confined in a crossed optical dipole trap, we achieve the highest phase-space density of $2.5 \times 10^{-5}$ for a bulk laser-cooled molecular sample. This sets the stage to study YO-YO collisions in the microkelvin temperature regime, and reveal state-dependent, single-partial-wave two-body collisional loss rates. We determine the partial-wave contributions to specific rotational states (first excited $N=1$ and ground $N=0$) following two strategies. First, we measure the change of the collision rate in a spin mixture of $N=1$ by tuning the kinetic energy with respect to the p- and d-wave centrifugal barriers. Second, we compare loss rates between a spin mixture and a spin-polarized state in $N=0$. Using quantum defect theory with a partially absorbing boundary condition at short range, we show that the dependence on temperature for $N=1$ can be reproduced in the presence of a d-wave or f-wave resonance, and the dependence on a spin mixture for $N=0$ with a p-wave resonance.</description>

      <title>Lifetimes of excited states in P-, As- and Sb-</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative lifetimes of three elements of the nitrogen group have been experimentally investigated at the Double ElectroStatic Ion Ring Experiment (DESIREE) facility at Stockholm University. The experiments were performed through selective laser photodetachment of excited states of P$^-$, As$^-$ and Sb$^-$ ions stored in a cryogenic storage ring. The experimental results were compared with theoretically predicted lifetimes, yielding a mixture of very good agreements in some cases and large discrepancies in others. These results are part of our efforts to map out the lifetimes of all excited states in negative ions. This data can be used to benchmark atomic theories, in particularly with respect to the degree of electron correlation that is incorporated in various theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced Rydberg atom microwave receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing microwave electric field sensing based on Rydberg atom has received significant attention due to its unique advantages. However, achieving effective coupling between Rydberg atom and the microwave electric field in the sensing process is a challenging problem that greatly impacts the sensitivity. To address this, we propose the use of a microwave resonant cavity to enhance the effective coupling between the Rydberg atoms and the microwave electric field. In our experiment, we use a three-photon excitation scheme to prepare Rydberg atoms, make measurements of electric fields without and with a microwave cavity in which the vapor cell is put inside. Through experimental testing, we achieve an 18 dB enhancement of power sensitivity. The experiment shows an effective enhancement in electric field pulse signal detection. This result provides a promising direction for enhancing the sensitivity of Rydberg atomic electric field sensors and paves the way for their application in precision electric field measurements.</description>

      <title>On the reduction of gas permeation through the glass windows of micromachined vapor cells using Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability and precision of atomic devices are closely tied to the quality and stability of the internal atmosphere of the atomic vapor cells on which they rely. Such atmosphere can be stabilized by building the cell with low permeation materials such as sapphire, or aluminosilicate glass in microfabricated devices. Recently, we showed that permeation barriers made of Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ thin-film coatings deposited on standard borosilicate glass could be an alternative for buffer gas pressure stabilization. In this study, we hence investigate how helium permeation is influenced by the thickness, ranging from 5 to 40 nm, of such Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ thin-films coated by atomic layer deposition. Permeation rates are derived from long-term measurements of the pressure-shifted transition frequency of a coherent population trapping (CPT) atomic clock. From thicknesses of 20 nm onward, a significant enhancement of the cell hermeticity is experienced, corresponding to two orders of magnitude lower helium permeation rate. In addition, we test cesium vapor cells filled with neon as a buffer gas and whose windows are coated with 20 nm of Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$. As for helium, the permeation rate of neon is significantly reduced thanks to alumina coatings, leading to a fractional frequency stability of 4x10$^{-12}$ at 1 day when the cell is used in a CPT clock. These features outperform the typical performances of uncoated Cs-Ne borosilicate cells and highlight the significance of Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ coatings for buffer gas pressure stabilization.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics of Open Systems in Non-Inertial Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of quantum mechanics in non-inertial reference frames, particularly in the context of open systems, introduces several intriguing phenomena and challenges. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for analyzing the quantum mechanics of open systems undergoing noninertial motion. Our methodology leverages the concept of dissipatons, statistical quasi-particles that capture collective dissipative effects from the environment. We demonstrate that our approach offers a natural understanding of the intricate dynamics among non-inertial effects, decoherence, dissipation, and system-bath entanglement. Specifically, we conduct demonstrations focusing on the Lamb shift phenomenon within a rotating ring cavity. Through theoretical exposition and practical applications, our framework elucidates the profound interplay between open quantum dynamics and non-inertial motion, paving the way for advancements in quantum information processing and sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Probing pair correlations in Fermi gases with Ramsey-Bragg interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an interferometric method to probe pair correlations in a gas of spin-1/2 fermions. The method consists of a Ramsey sequence where both spin states of the Fermi gas are set in a superposition of a state at rest and a state with a large recoil velocity. The two-body density matrix is extracted via the fluctuations of the transferred fraction to the recoiled state. In the pair-condensed phase, the off-diagonal long-range order is directly reflected in the asymptotic behavior of the interferometric signal for long interrogation times. The method also allows to probe the spatial structure of the condensed pairs: the interferometric signal is an oscillating function of the interrogation time in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime; it becomes an overdamped function in the molecular Bose-Einstein condensate regime.</description>
