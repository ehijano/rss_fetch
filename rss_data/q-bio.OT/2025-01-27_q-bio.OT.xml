      <description>arXiv:2501.14044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study contributes to ongoing research that aims to overcome challenges in predicting the bioapplicability of nanoformulations. It incorporates machine learning and $^{13}$C NMR spectroscopy data. In order to demonstrate the approach, from the PubChem world's largest publicly available chemical database, a bioassay on human dopamine D1 receptor antagonists was downloaded. From the mentioned bioassay the SMILES of compounds were extracted and converted into spectroscopy data by designed for this purpose software. The resulting data was then used for data preprocessing and machine learning, employing scikit-learn algorithms. The ML models were trained by 27,756 samples and tested by 5,466. From the estimators K-Nearest neighbour, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, XGBoosting Classifier and Support Vector Classifier, the last performed the best, achieving 71.5 % accuracy, 77.4 % precision, 60.6% recall, 68 % F1, 71.5 % ROC and 0.749 cross-validation score with 0.005 standard deviation. The methodology was designed to be versatile and capable of predicting any functionality of any compound, with or without added nanoformulations, when the appropriate data is available. In addition to the study presented in the article, the time- and cost-efficient CID-SID ML model was developed, giving an opportunity for researchers who have developed a compound and have obtained its PubChem CID and SID to check whether this compound is also a human dopamine D1 receptor antagonist. The metrics of CID_SID ML model were 80.2% accuracy, 86.3% precision, 70.4% recall, 77.6% F1, 79.9% ROC, five-fold cross-validation score 0.8071 with 0.0047 Standard deviation.</description>
