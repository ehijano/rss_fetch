      <title>The Effect of Foreign Direct Investment on Economic Growth in South Asian Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) on economic growth in South Asian countries, utilizing annual panel data from five SAARC member states (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) over the period 1980-2017. Data sourced from the World Development Indicators and Penn World Table were analyzed using static panel models, including Ordinary Least Squares, Fixed Effects, Random Effects, and Generalized Least Squares regressions. The empirical findings reveal that FDI exhibits a consistently positive but statistically insignificant correlation with economic growth across all model specifications. In contrast, domestic investment and human capital development emerge as significant and robust positive determinants of growth. Control variables such as government consumption and inflation show expected negative, though generally insignificant, associations with growth. The results imply that for the sampled South Asian economies, enhancing domestic investment and fostering human capital are more critical for driving economic expansion than relying on FDI inflows. Consequently, policymakers should prioritize strategies that strengthen local investment climates and improve educational and skill-building institutions to boost productivity. While FDI's role remains complementary, its insignificant immediate impact suggests the need for further research into the conditional factors such as institutional quality, financial market development, and trade policies that might mediate its effectiveness in fostering long-term growth within the region.</description>

      <title>Immigrant Residential Segregation in Europe: A Comparative Study of Spatial Segregation Patterns in Urban Areas across 30 Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immigrant residential segregation can profoundly shape access to opportunities, immigrant integration, and inter-group relations. Yet we lack systematic evidence on how segregation varies across Europe, and what structural factors are associated with these patterns. This study addresses the gap by focusing on two questions: (i) how does immigrant-native segregation vary across urban areas in Europe, and (ii) which urban area- and country-level characteristics are consistently linked to segregation? Using harmonised 1x1 km grid-level data from the 2021/22 census, we calculate spatially weighted Dissimilarity Indices for all 717 Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) across 30 European countries. We combine these measures with rich data on demographics, the economy, housing, immigrant populations, and policy. To identify robust correlates of segregation, we apply a Specification Curve Analysis across 16,164 regression models. Segregation is higher in Western and Northern Europe compared to most of Eastern and Southern Europe. Moreover, we show that segregation is heavily driven by macro-spatial dynamics between diverse urban cores and relatively homogeneous suburban areas. At the urban area level, segregation is systematically linked to the demographic composition and spatial distribution of the local population, economic conditions, housing market characteristics, as well as the composition of the immigrant population. At the national level, established immigrant destinations are more segregated, while migration and integration policies are not consistently linked to segregation. These findings offer the most comprehensive comparative assessment of immigrant segregation across Europe to date, revealing how structural conditions relate to spatial integration.</description>

      <title>The Trust-Building Game: A Model for Sustainable Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trust serves as a fundamental pillar of human interactions, playing a crucial role in economic, social, and political relationships. While traditional models of trust primarily focus on the decision making of the first player, this paper introduces an innovative approach that shifts the emphasis to the decision making processes of the second player. The proposed model employs a repetitive structure through which the first player effectively cultivates the second player's trust through consistent and strategic actions. This framework is applicable across various fields, including public policy, marketing, and international relations. It significantly deepens our understanding of the trust-building process and aids in fostering sustainable cooperation in real world scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Initial Low-barrier Employment Availability on Refugee Labor Market Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I examine whether the early but temporary availability of low-barrier employment opportunities in the hospitality sector affects the labor market integration of refugees. My identification strategy combines the quasi-exogenous allocation of refugees to Austrian regions with high seasonality in Austria's hospitality sector, where 25% of refugees find initial employment. Exploiting within region, within year variation, I find that receiving labor market access during high seasonal demand increases employment probability initially, with significant employment effects of up to 3 percentage points, or 9% of the mean, in the first months. Employment advantages diminish after the first year, indicating that such early employment opportunities do not serve as a stepping stone. Still, treated refugees have in total earned more in the first three years, with no significant differences in medium-term wages and job quality. One disadvantage of early employment in hospitality is the increased labor market segregation, as treated refugees are more likely to work in industries more typical for refugees and in firms with higher non-Austrian coworker shares.</description>

      <title>Most certainly certain? The Impact of Contract for Difference Design on Renewables' Strike Prices and Electricity Market Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weather, technological and regulatory uncertainties expose actors in highly renewable electricity markets to substantial price and volume risks. Two-way Contracts for Difference (CfDs) can mitigate these risks. They stipulate payments between the government and generators of renewable electricity based on the difference of a strike and a reference price, whose definition and unit of payment differ between CfD designs. We study the effect of three different CfD designs on wind power profit and consumer price volatility under the consideration of uncertain market outcomes in a highly renewable, sector-coupled electricity market. First, we analytically derive optimal strike prices under uncertainty. Second, we numerically determine optimal strike prices based on market expectations retrieved from optimising a set of 36 market scenarios in an energy system model. Third, we study the distribution of ex post market revenues, CfD payments and consumer prices across all 36 scenarios. Compared to purely market-based consumer prices and investor profits, we find all CfDs to significantly reduce volatility. For consumer prices, results show no substantial differences between CfD designs. For investor profits, we identify the highest volatility reduction under a capacity-based CfD with a reference price similar to power plants' individual market revenues. Since such a CfD design is known to diminish the effect of price signals on investment decisions, our results reveal a trade-off between incentivising system-friendliness and reducing investor risk.</description>

      <title>Who Connects Global Aid? The Hidden Geometry of 10 Million Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global aid system functions as a complex and evolving ecosystem; yet widespread understanding of its structure remains largely limited to aggregate volume flows. Here we map the network topology of global aid using a dataset of unprecedented scale: over 10 million transaction records connecting 2,456 publishing organisations across 230 countries between 1967 and 2025. We apply bipartite projection and dimensionality reduction to reveal the geometry of the system and unveil hidden patterns. This exposes distinct functional clusters that are otherwise sparsely connected. We find that while governments and multilateral agencies provide the primary resources, a small set of knowledge brokers provide the critical connectivity. Universities and research foundations specifically act as essential bridges between disparate islands of implementers and funders. We identify a core solar system of 25 central actors who drive this connectivity including unanticipated brokers like J-PAL and the Hewlett Foundation. These findings demonstrate that influence in the aid ecosystem flows through structural connectivity as much as financial volume. Our results provide a new framework for donors to identify strategic partners that accelerate coordination and evidence diffusion across the global network.</description>

      <title>Assessing Long-Term Electricity Market Design for Ambitious Decarbonization Targets using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electricity systems are key to transforming today's society into a carbon-free economy. Long-term electricity market mechanisms, including auctions, support schemes, and other policy instruments, are critical in shaping the electricity generation mix. In light of the need for more advanced tools to support policymakers and other stakeholders in designing, testing, and evaluating long-term markets, this work presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning model capable of capturing the key features of decarbonizing energy systems. Profit-maximizing generation companies make investment decisions in the wholesale electricity market, responding to system needs, competitive dynamics, and policy signals. The model employs independent proximal policy optimization, which was selected for suitability to the decentralized and competitive environment. Nevertheless, given the inherent challenges of independent learning in multi-agent settings, an extensive hyperparameter search ensures that decentralized training yields market outcomes consistent with competitive behavior. The model is applied to a stylized version of the Italian electricity system and tested under varying levels of competition, market designs, and policy scenarios. Results highlight the critical role of market design for decarbonizing the electricity sector and avoiding price volatility. The proposed framework allows assessing long-term electricity markets in which multiple policy and market mechanisms interact simultaneously, with market participants responding and adapting to decarbonization pathways.</description>

      <title>Towards Developing an Understanding of Consumers' Perceived Privacy Violations in Online Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03612v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) represent a critical operational challenge for the online advertising industry, requiring substantial infrastructure investment while promising improved consumer privacy protection. Even when PETs may improve privacy protection from an operational or technical viewpoint, understanding whether PETs actually reduce consumers' perceived privacy violations (PPV) is essential for evaluating their viability. In this research, we characterize advertising practices along the dimensions of tracking and targeting, and understand consumers' PPVs for current practices and proposed PETs through online experiments with U.S. and European consumers. As expected, the industry status quo of behavioral targeting, with high degrees of tracking and targeting, results in high PPV. While new technologies that keep data on users' devices reduce PPV compared to behavioral targeting, the reduction is minimal, including for group-level targeting. Contextual targeting, which involves no tracking, significantly lowers PPV. Not surprisingly, PPV is lowest when tracking is absent, but notably, consumers show similar preferences for untargeted ads and no ads. Importantly, consumer perceptions of privacy violations may not align with technical definitions, suggesting that operational investments in privacy technologies may fail without consumer validation. Therefore, it is essential for managers, industry practitioners, and policymakers to follow a consumer-centric approach to understanding privacy concerns and evaluating the operational viability of privacy-enhancing solutions.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of OECD Countries Based on Energy Trilemma Index: A Clustering Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyzes OECD countries in the context of the energy trilemma index and clusters countries with similar characteristics. In the study, the k-means clustering technique is used. The optimum number of clusters was determined using the Elbow method in combination with the Silhouette Index. Moreover, all results are visualized to enhance comprehensibility. The results show that countries such as Austria, Canada, Finland, and Denmark are in the high energy trilemma group with index scores of 82.2, 82.3, 82.7, and 83.3, respectively. Countries in the high group have achieved a high level of balance between energy security, energy equity, and environmental sustainability. In addition, countries such as Belgium, Hungary, Australia, the Czech Republic, and Estonia are in the medium energy trilemma group with index scores of 76.4, 76.6, 77.1, 77.6, and 78.7, respectively. Countries in the medium group have made progress in balancing the dimensions of the energy trilemma but have not yet reached excellence. However, countries such as Mexico, T\"urkiye, Colombia, and Costa Rica are in the low energy trilemma group with index scores of 63.1, 64.1, 64.8, and 69.3, respectively. These low energy trilemma group countries face significant challenges in balancing energy security, energy equity, and environmental sustainability and need to make improvements in these areas.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impacts of Economic Growth on Ecosystem and Its Subcomponents in Turkiye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyzes the impacts of economic growth on ecosystem in Turkiye. The study uses annual data for the period 1995-2021 and the ARDL method. The study utilizes the Ecosystem Vitality Index, a sub-dimension of the Environmental Performance Index. In addition, seven models were constructed to assess in detail the impact of economic growth on different dimensions of the ecosystem. The results show that economic growth has a significant impact in all models analyzed. However, the direction of this impact differs across ecosystem components. Economic growth is found to have a positive impact on agriculture and water resources. In these models, a 1% increase in GDP increases the agriculture and water resources indices by 0.074-0.672%. In contrast, economic growth has a negative impact on biodiversity and habitat, ecosystem services, fisheries, acid rain and total ecosystem vitality. In these models, a 1% increase in GDP reduces the indices of biodiversity and habitat, ecosystem services, fisheries, acid rain and total ecosystem vitality by 0.101-2.144%. The results suggest that the environmental costs of economic growth processes need to be considered. Environmentally friendly policies should be combined with sustainable development strategies to reduce the negative impacts of economic growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regional disparities in the economic and social structures of countries have a great impact on their development levels. In geographically, culturally and economically diverse countries like Turkiye, determining the socioeconomic status of the provinces and regional differences is an important step for planning and implementing effective policies. Therefore, this study aims to determine the socioeconomic disparities of the provinces in Turkiye. For this purpose, a socioeconomic development index covering the economic and social dimensions of 81 provinces was constructed. For the index, 16 different indicators representing economic and social factors were used. These indicators were converted into indices using the Min-Max normalization method and Principal Component Analysis. Afterwards, using these indices, the provinces were divided into groups using the K-Means clustering algorithm and the Elbow method. In the last part of the study, the results are presented in a visual format using Scatter Plots, clustering maps and QGIS mapping tools. The results of the study show that 2 of the 81 provinces in Turkiye have very high, 30 high, 25 medium and 24 low socioeconomic indices. Istanbul and Ankara have very high socioeconomic status. In general, the provinces in western Turkiye have a high socioeconomic index, while the provinces in eastern and southeastern Anatolia face serious challenges in terms of socioeconomic indicators.</description>

      <title>Is Jobless Growth Valid in Turkiye? A Sectoral Analysis of the Relationship between Unemployment and Economic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyzes the validity of jobless growth in Turkiye on sectoral basis. It analyzes the impacts of agriculture, industry, construction and services sectors on unemployment using annual data for the period 2000-2022. ARDL method is applied within the scope of the analysis. The findings are tested with FMOLS and CCR methods. The results show that growth in all sectors reduces the unemployment. A one-unit increase in the share of agriculture sector in GDP decreases the unemployment rate by 0.471 points, 0.680 points in the industrial sector, 0.899 points in the construction sector and 1.383 points in the services sector in the short-run. The long-run coefficients reveal that the impacts of sectoral growth on unemployment are stronger in the long-run than in the short-run. A one unit increase in the share of the agricultural sector in GDP decreases the unemployment rate by 2.380 points, 4.057 points in the industrial sector, 1.761 points in the construction sector and 3.664 points in the services sector in the long-run. These findings show that jobless growth is not valid in Turkiye in general. On the contrary, economic growth plays an important role in reducing unemployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyzes the impact of globalization on sustainable development in Turkiye. We used the ARDL method with annual data for the period 2000-2021. Results reveal that economic globalization promotes positively to sustainable development in the short run with a coefficient of 0.144 and in the long run with a 0.153 coefficient. Although social globalization has a negative impact with a coefficient of -0.150 in the short run, this effect turns positive with a coefficient of 0.080 in the long run. Political globalization strongly supports sustainable development with a coefficient of 0.254 in the short run and 2.634 in the long run. Finally, total globalization has a positive impact on sustainable development in the short and long run with coefficients of 0.339 and 0.196, respectively.</description>

      <title>Does Military Expenditure Impede Sustainable Development? Empirical Evidence from NATO Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyzes the impact of military expenditures on sustainable development in NATO countries. The analysis utilizes annual data for the period between 1995 and 2019. In this study, the Durbin-Hausman panel cointegration test is used to analyze the cointegration relationship between the variables and the Panel AMG estimator is used to estimate the long-run coefficients. The results of the AMG estimator show that military expenditures and industrial production index have a negative effect on sustainable development in NATO countries, while foreign direct investments have a positive effect. The impact of primary energy consumption is negative and less significant than the other negative impacts. The study also analyzes how the impact of military expenditures on sustainable development varies across countries. This analysis reveals the significant differences in the direction, significance, and coefficient size of the relationship among different countries. These findings suggest that the impact of military expenditures on sustainable development varies across countries. Therefore, countries should develop policies to ensure sustainable development by considering their specific dynamics.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Provincial Export Performance in Turkiye: A Spectral Clustering Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyzes and clusters Turkiye's 81 provinces based on their export performance. The study uses import, export and net export data for 2023. In addition, exchange rate-adjusted versions of the data were also included to eliminate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. Spectral clustering method is used to group the export performance of cities. The optimum number of clusters was determined by the Eigen-Gap method. The Silhouette coefficient method was used to evaluate the clustering performance. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that the data set was optimally separated into 3 clusters. Spectral-clustering analysis based on export performance showed that 42% of the provinces are in the "Low", 33% in the "Medium" and 25% in the "High" export performance category. In terms of import performance, 44%, 33%, 33%, and 22% of the provinces are in the "Medium", "High", and "Low" categories, respectively. In terms of net exports, 38, 35% and 27% of the provinces are in the "Low", "Medium" and "High" net export performance categories, respectively. Izmir has the highest net export performance, while Istanbul has the lowest.</description>

      <title>Can Renewable Energy Sources Alleviate the Pressure of Military Expenditures on the Environment? Empirical Evidence from Turkiye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyzes the potential of renewable energy sources to reduce the environmental impact of military expenditures in Turkiye. ARDL method is preferred in the analysis using annual data for the period 1990-2021. In addition, an interaction term is added to the model to determine the effectiveness of renewable energy sources. The results show that military expenditures have a positive impact on CO2 emissions in the short and long run with coefficients of 0.260 and 0.196, respectively. Moreover, renewable energy use has a statistically significant negative impact on CO2 emissions in the short and long run with coefficients of -0.119 and -0.120, respectively. GDP has a positive impact on CO2 emissions in the short and long run with coefficients of 0.162 and 0.193, respectively. Although population growth does not have a statistically significant impact in the short run, it is found to increase CO2 emissions in the long run with a coefficient of 0.095. Moreover, the interaction term shows that renewable energy use reduces the environmental impact of military expenditures in Turkiye in the short and long run with coefficients of -0.130 and -0.140, respectively. The results indicate that renewable energy use can play an important role in mitigating the environmental impacts of military expenditures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to prioritize renewable energy sources to achieve sustainable development in Turkiye by using fuzzy AHP method. In our study, we used 30 criteria that affect the investment in renewable energy sources. We also calculated the weights of these criteria in investment decisions. In addition, we analyzed the advantageous renewable energy sources according to each criterion. Thus, it was determined which renewable energy source is advantageous according to which criteria. The results show that the most important main criteria for renewable energy investments in Turkiye are economic, political, technical, environmental and social criteria, respectively. The most appropriate renewable energy sources according to economic, political, technical and social criteria are solar, wind, hydroelectric,</description>

      <title>The Impact of Natural Disasters on Food Security in Turkiye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Food security refers to people's access to enough safe nutritious food in order to be able to lead a healthy active life. It also involves elements such as food availability and affordability, as well as people being able to access food that can be consumed healthily. Natural disasters, however, can seriously threaten food security. Disasters' effects on food security are especially more evident in countries such as Turkiye that are frequently exposed to natural disasters due to their geologic and geographical structure. For this reason, the study investigates the effects of natural disasters on food security in Turkiye. The research first creates the Food Security Index in order to estimate the effects of natural disasters on food security. The next phase follows the process of econometric analysis, which consists of three steps. Step one of the econometric analysis uses unit root tests to check the stationarity levels of the series. The second step uses the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test to examine the long-term relationship between natural disasters and food security. The third and final step estimates the effects of natural disasters on food security. According to the obtained results, the study shows earthquakes, storms, and floods to have a significant short- as well as long-term negative effect on food security. The overall impact of natural disasters on food security has also been determined to be negative.</description>

      <title>The gradual transformation of inland areas -- human plowing, horse plowing and equity incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many modern areas have not learned their lessons and often hope for the wisdom of later generations, resulting in them only possessing modern technology and difficult to iterate ancient civilizations. At present, there is no way to tell how we should learn from history and promote the gradual upgrading of civilization. Therefore, we must tell the history of civilization's progress and the means of governance, learn from experience to improve the comprehensive strength and survival ability of civilization, and achieve an optimal solution for the tempering brought by conflicts and the reduction of internal conflicts. Firstly, we must follow the footsteps of history and explore the reasons for the long-term stability of each country in conflict, including providing economic benefits to the people and means of suppressing them; then, use mathematical methods to demonstrate how we can achieve the optimal solution at the current stage. After analysis, we can conclude that the civilization transformed from human plowing to horse plowing can easily suppress the resistance of the people and provide them with the ability to resist; The selection of rulers should consider multiple institutional aspects, such as exams, elections, and drawing lots; Economic development follows a lognormal distribution and can be adjusted by population mean and standard deviation. Using a lognormal distribution with the maximum value to divide equity can adjust the wealth gap.</description>
