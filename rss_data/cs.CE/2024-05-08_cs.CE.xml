      <title>Research on financial fraud algorithm based on federal learning and big data technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the deepening of the digitization degree of financial business, financial fraud presents more complex and hidden characteristics, which poses a severe challenge to the risk prevention and control ability of financial institutions. At the same time, the vigorous development of big data technology provides massive potential information resources, and federated learning, as an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm, can realize multi-party data collaborative modeling under the premise of protecting data privacy. This paper firstly elaborates the basic principle, advantages and unique value of federated learning in solving data silos and protecting user privacy. Aiming at the needs of financial fraud detection, this paper discusses the design of federal learning architecture suitable for this scenario, including selecting suitable model type (such as neural network), setting reasonable data partitioning and updating rules. The central theme of the dissertation revolves around the exploration and execution of an algorithm for detecting financial fraud, which is grounded in federated learning methodologies. With a federated learning framework, each participant trains the model locally and exchanges only model parameters rather than raw data, enabling iterative optimization of the global model while protecting data privacy. To ascertain the efficacy and superiority of the suggested algorithm, a meticulous experimental investigation is both devised and executed. A real-world financial fraud dataset is selected to compare the fraud detection performance using traditional centralized learning and federated learning. The findings from the experiments reveal that the federated learning-based financial fraud algorithm achieves a substantial reduction in the likelihood of data privacy breaches without compromising on high detection accuracies.</description>

      <title>Predicting Transonic Flowfields in Non-Homogeneous Unstructured Grids Using Autoencoder Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on addressing challenges posed by non-homogeneous unstructured grids, commonly used in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Their prevalence in CFD scenarios has motivated the exploration of innovative approaches for generating reduced-order models. The core of our approach centers on geometric deep learning, specifically the utilization of graph convolutional network (GCN). The novel Autoencoder GCN architecture enhances prediction accuracy by propagating information to distant nodes and emphasizing influential points. This architecture, with GCN layers and encoding/decoding modules, reduces dimensionality based on pressure-gradient values. The autoencoder structure improves the network capability to identify key features, contributing to a more robust and accurate predictive model. To validate the proposed methodology, we analyzed two different test cases: wing-only model and wing--body configuration. Precise reconstruction of steady-state distributed quantities within a two-dimensional parametric space underscores the reliability and versatility of the implemented approach.</description>

      <title>Preserving Nonlinear Constraints in Variational Flow Filtering Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation aims to estimate the states of a dynamical system by optimally combining sparse and noisy observations of the physical system with uncertain forecasts produced by a computational model. The states of many dynamical systems of interest obey nonlinear physical constraints, and the corresponding dynamics is confined to a certain sub-manifold of the state space. Standard data assimilation techniques applied to such systems yield posterior states lying outside the manifold, violating the physical constraints. This work focuses on particle flow filters which use stochastic differential equations to evolve state samples from a prior distribution to samples from an observation-informed posterior distribution. The variational Fokker-Planck (VFP) -- a generic particle flow filtering framework -- is extended to incorporate non-linear, equality state constraints in the analysis. To this end, two algorithmic approaches that modify the VFP stochastic differential equation are discussed: (i) VFPSTAB, to inexactly preserve constraints with the addition of a stabilizing drift term, and (ii) VFPDAE, to exactly preserve constraints by treating the VFP dynamics as a stochastic differential-algebraic equation (SDAE). Additionally, an implicit-explicit time integrator is developed to evolve the VFPDAE dynamics. The strength of the proposed approach for constraint preservation in data assimilation is demonstrated on three test problems: the double pendulum, Korteweg-de-Vries, and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>PINNsFormer: A Transformer-Based Framework For Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising deep learning framework for approximating numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). However, conventional PINNs, relying on multilayer perceptrons (MLP), neglect the crucial temporal dependencies inherent in practical physics systems and thus fail to propagate the initial condition constraints globally and accurately capture the true solutions under various scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel Transformer-based framework, termed PINNsFormer, designed to address this limitation. PINNsFormer can accurately approximate PDE solutions by utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies. PINNsFormer transforms point-wise inputs into pseudo sequences and replaces point-wise PINNs loss with a sequential loss. Additionally, it incorporates a novel activation function, Wavelet, which anticipates Fourier decomposition through deep neural networks. Empirical results demonstrate that PINNsFormer achieves superior generalization ability and accuracy across various scenarios, including PINNs failure modes and high-dimensional PDEs. Moreover, PINNsFormer offers flexibility in integrating existing learning schemes for PINNs, further enhancing its performance.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Intelligent Recommender system as a first step resilience measure -- A data-driven supply chain disruption response framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interests in the value of digital technologies for its potential uses to increase supply chain resilience (SCRes) are increasing in light to the industry 4.0 and the global pandemic. Utilization of Recommender systems (RS) as a supply chain (SC) resilience measure is neglected although RS is a capable tool to enhance SC resilience from a reactive aspect. To address this problem, this research proposed a novel data-driven supply chain disruption response framework based on the intelligent recommender system techniques and validated the conceptual model through a practical use case. Results show that our framework can be implemented as an effective SC disruption mitigation measure in the very first response phrase and help SC participants get better reaction performance after the SC disruption.</description>

      <title>Introducing a microstructure-embedded autoencoder approach for reconstructing high-resolution solution field data from a reduced parametric space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a novel multi-fidelity deep learning approach that transforms low-fidelity solution maps into high-fidelity ones by incorporating parametric space information into a standard autoencoder architecture. This method's integration of parametric space information significantly reduces the need for training data to effectively predict high-fidelity solutions from low-fidelity ones. In this study, we examine a two-dimensional steady-state heat transfer analysis within a highly heterogeneous materials microstructure. The heat conductivity coefficients for two different materials are condensed from a 101 x 101 grid to smaller grids. We then solve the boundary value problem on the coarsest grid using a pre-trained physics-informed neural operator network known as Finite Operator Learning (FOL). The resulting low-fidelity solution is subsequently upscaled back to a 101 x 101 grid using a newly designed enhanced autoencoder. The novelty of the developed enhanced autoencoder lies in the concatenation of heat conductivity maps of different resolutions to the decoder segment in distinct steps. Hence the developed algorithm is named microstructure-embedded autoencoder (MEA). We compare the MEA outcomes with those from finite element methods, the standard U-Net, and various other upscaling techniques, including interpolation functions and feedforward neural networks (FFNN). Our analysis shows that MEA outperforms these methods in terms of computational efficiency and error on test cases. As a result, the MEA serves as a potential supplement to neural operator networks, effectively upscaling low-fidelity solutions to high fidelity while preserving critical details often lost in traditional upscaling methods, particularly at sharp interfaces like those seen with interpolation.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Modelling Protein Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AlphaFold can be used for both single-chain and multi-chain protein structure prediction, while the latter becomes extremely challenging as the number of chains increases. In this work, by taking each chain as a node and assembly actions as edges, we show that an acyclic undirected connected graph can be used to predict the structure of multi-chain protein complexes (a.k.a., protein complex modelling, PCM). However, there are still two challenges: 1) The huge combinatorial optimization space of $N^{N-2}$ ($N$ is the number of chains) for the PCM problem can easily lead to high computational cost. 2) The scales of protein complexes exhibit distribution shift due to variance in chain numbers, which calls for the generalization in modelling complexes of various scales. To address these challenges, we propose GAPN, a Generative Adversarial Policy Network powered by domain-specific rewards and adversarial loss through policy gradient for automatic PCM prediction. Specifically, GAPN learns to efficiently search through the immense assembly space and optimize the direct docking reward through policy gradient. Importantly, we design an adversarial reward function to enhance the receptive field of our model. In this way, GAPN will simultaneously focus on a specific batch of complexes and the global assembly rules learned from complexes with varied chain numbers. Empirically, we have achieved both significant accuracy (measured by RMSD and TM-Score) and efficiency improvements compared to leading PCM softwares.</description>

      <title>Data-Copilot: Bridging Billions of Data and Humans with Autonomous Workflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07209v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various industries such as finance, meteorology, and energy produce vast amounts of heterogeneous data every day. There is a natural demand for humans to manage, process, and display data efficiently. However, it necessitates labor-intensive efforts and a high level of expertise for these data-related tasks. Considering large language models (LLMs) showcase promising capabilities in semantic understanding and reasoning, we advocate that the deployment of LLMs could autonomously manage and process massive amounts of data while interacting and displaying in a human-friendly manner. Based on this, we propose Data-Copilot, an LLM-based system that connects numerous data sources on one end and caters to diverse human demands on the other end. Acting as an experienced expert, Data-Copilot autonomously transforms raw data into multi-form output that best matches the user's intent. Specifically, it first designs multiple universal interfaces to satisfy diverse data-related requests, like querying, analysis, prediction, and visualization. In real-time response, it automatically deploys a concise workflow by invoking corresponding interfaces. The whole process is fully controlled by Data-Copilot, without human assistance. We release Data-Copilot-1.0 using massive Chinese financial data, e.g., stocks, funds, and news. Experiments indicate it achieves reliable performance with lower token consumption, showing promising application prospects.</description>

      <title>Limit Order Book Dynamics and Order Size Modelling Using Compound Hawkes Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08927v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hawkes Process has been used to model Limit Order Book (LOB) dynamics in several ways in the literature however the focus has been limited to capturing the inter-event times while the order size is usually assumed to be constant. We propose a novel methodology of using Compound Hawkes Process for the LOB where each event has an order size sampled from a calibrated distribution. The process is formulated in a novel way such that the spread of the process always remains positive. Further, we condition the model parameters on time of day to support empirical observations. We make use of an enhanced non-parametric method to calibrate the Hawkes kernels and allow for inhibitory cross-excitation kernels. We showcase the results and quality of fits for an equity stock's LOB in the NASDAQ exchange and compare them against several baselines. Finally, we conduct a market impact study of the simulator and show the empirical observation of a concave market impact function is indeed replicated.</description>

      <title>ChemReasoner: Heuristic Search over a Large Language Model's Knowledge Space using Quantum-Chemical Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of new catalysts is essential for the design of new and more efficient chemical processes in order to transition to a sustainable future. We introduce an AI-guided computational screening framework unifying linguistic reasoning with quantum-chemistry based feedback from 3D atomistic representations. Our approach formulates catalyst discovery as an uncertain environment where an agent actively searches for highly effective catalysts via the iterative combination of large language model (LLM)-derived hypotheses and atomistic graph neural network (GNN)-derived feedback. Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability. Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and barriers steer the exploration in the LLM's knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts. We introduce planning methods that automatically guide the exploration without human input, providing competitive performance against expert-enumerated chemical descriptor-based implementations. By integrating language-guided reasoning with computational chemistry feedback, our work pioneers AI-accelerated, trustworthy catalyst discovery.</description>

      <title>A dataset of over one thousand computed tomography scans of battery cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02527v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Battery technology is increasingly important for global electrification efforts. However, batteries are highly sensitive to small manufacturing variations that can induce reliability or safety issues. An important technology for battery quality control is computed tomography (CT) scanning, which is widely used for non-destructive 3D inspection across a variety of clinical and industrial applications. Historically, however, the utility of CT scanning for high-volume manufacturing has been limited by its low throughput as well as the difficulty of handling its large file sizes. In this work, we present a dataset of over one thousand CT scans of as-produced commercially available batteries. The dataset spans various chemistries (lithium-ion and sodium-ion) as well as various battery form factors (cylindrical, pouch, and prismatic). We evaluate seven different battery types in total. The manufacturing variability and the presence of battery defects can be observed via this dataset. This dataset may be of interest to scientists and engineers working on battery technology, computer vision, or both.</description>
