      <title>Reconfiguration of a Magnetic Tunnel Junction as a Way to Turn It into a Field-Free Vortex Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are key elements in practical spintronics, enabling not only conventional tasks such as data storage, transmission, and processing but also the implementation of compute-in-memory processing elements, facilitating the development of efficient hardware for neuromorphic computing. The functionality of an MTJ is determined by the properties of its free layer (FL) and reference layer (RL) with fixed magnetization, separated by an MgO tunnel barrier. This paper presents a mechanism for reconfiguring the RL, which is the upper layer of a pinned synthetic antiferromagnet, enabling a reversible transition from a single-domain state to a vortex magnetic state with different core positions. When the RL is in the vortex state, it generates a spin current with a vortex-like polarization distribution, enabling stable vortex oscillations in the FL even in the absence of external magnetic fields. This effect has been confirmed in MTJs with diameters ranging from 400 to 1000 nm. It is demonstrated, using experimental data with comparative micromagnetic simulation, that the pinning antiferromagnet retains a long term memory of previous reannealing states resulting in a deformation of the vortex polarised spin current, which in turn introduces a strong dynamical vortex core polarity symmetry breaking. The analogue reprogrammable nature of both the static and dynamic properties of the MTJ demonstrate different possible routes for the introduction of non-volatility into radiofrequency spintronic neuromorphic paradigms.</description>

      <title>Exchange-driven self-diffusion of nanoscale crystalline parahydrogen clusters on graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer simulations yield evidence of superfluid behavior of nanoscale size clusters of parahydrogen adsorbed on a graphite substrate at low temperature ($T\lesssim 0.25 \text{ K}$). Clusters with a number of molecules between 7 and 12 display concurrent superfluidity and crystalline order, reflecting the corrugation of the substrate. Remarkably, it is found that specific clusters with a number of molecules ranging between 7 and 12 self-diffuse on the surface like free particles, despite the strong pinning effect of the substrate. This effect is underlain by coordinated quantum-mechanical exchanges of groups of identical molecules, i.e., it has no classical counterpart.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit simulation with a local time-dependent variational principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical simulations of quantum circuits are vital for assessing potential quantum advantage and benchmarking devices, yet they require sophisticated methods to avoid the exponential growth of resources. Tensor network approaches, in particular matrix product states (MPS) combined with the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, currently dominate large-scale circuit simulations. These methods scale efficiently when entanglement is limited but suffer rapid bond dimension growth with increasing entanglement and handle long-range gates via costly SWAP insertions. Motivated by the success of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) in many-body physics, we reinterpret quantum circuits as a series of discrete time evolutions, using gate generators to construct an MPS-based circuit simulation via a local TDVP formulation. This addresses TEBD's key limitations by (1) naturally accommodating long-range gates and (2) optimally representing states on the MPS manifold. By diffusing entanglement more globally, the method suppresses local bond growth and reduces memory and runtime costs. We benchmark the approach on five 49-qubit circuits: three Hamiltonian circuits (1D open and periodic Heisenberg, 2D 7x7 Ising) and two algorithmic ones (quantum approximate optimization, hardware-efficient ansatz). Across all cases, our method yields substantial resource reductions over standard tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art for circuit simulation and enabling advances across quantum computing, condensed matter, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Unraveling energy flow mechanisms in semiconductors by ultrafast spectroscopy: Germanium as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor materials are the foundation of modern electronics, and their functionality is dictated by the interactions between fundamental excitations occurring on (sub-)picosecond timescales. Using time-resolved Raman spectroscopy and transient reflectivity measurements, we shed light on the ultrafast dynamics in germanium. We observe an increase in the optical phonon temperature in the first few picoseconds, driven by the energy transfer from photoexcited holes, and the subsequent decay into acoustic phonons through anharmonic coupling. Moreover, the temperature, Raman frequency, and linewidth of this phonon mode show strikingly different decay dynamics. This difference was ascribed to the local thermal strain generated by the ultrafast excitation. We also observe Brillouin oscillations, given by a strain pulse traveling through germanium, whose damping is correlated to the optical phonon mode. These findings, supported by density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations, provide a better understanding of the energy dissipation mechanisms in semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Phonon anomalies, Anharmonicity, and thermal expansion coefficient in few layered PtX2 (X= S, Se): A temperature dependent Raman study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional group-10 noble transition metal dichalcogenides have garnered growing attention due to their rich physical properties and promising applications across nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and spintronics. Among them, PtX2 (X = S, Se) exhibits pronounced interlayer coupling driven by hybridization of the out-of-plane Pz orbitals of the chalcogen atoms. In this work, we present a detailed temperature and polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopic study of few-layer PtS2 and PtSe2 over the temperature range of ~ 5 to 300 K. Our study encompasses phonon-phonon interactions, symmetry analysis of phonon modes, low-frequency interlayer vibrations, and extraction of thermal expansion coefficients. Notable phonon anomalies in peak position, linewidth, and intensity emerge around ~ 80 K and 150 K for PtS2, and ~ 70 K and 240 K for PtSe2, indicating intricate coupling between thermal and vibrational dynamics. These results offer valuable insights for the development of devices based on PtS2, PtSe2, and related 2D materials, where interlayer interactions, anharmonic effects, and thermal expansion behaviour play crucial roles.</description>

      <title>Periodic transitions of topological charge in skyrmions confined within FeGe and Co/Pt nanodisks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic control of skyrmion properties such as polarity, vorticity, and topological charge is crucial for their implementation in spintronic applications. In this work, we investigate the periodic inversion of the topological charge in two distinct systems: FeGe, a bulk chiral magnet, and Co/Pt, an interfacial system with strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. By applying an oscillating magnetic field perpendicular to the film plane, we induce cyclic transitions in the spin texture. In FeGe, the skyrmion evolves through a $Q=1 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow -1$ sequence via an intermediate skyrmionium state. In Co/Pt, the process involves skyrmion annihilation and re-nucleation, resulting in alternating topological charges. These results reveal distinct dynamic mechanisms for topological charge modulation, offering potential pathways for the energy-efficient control of skyrmion-based devices.</description>

      <title>Crystalline electric field excitations in Weyl semimetal \textit{R}AlSi (\textit{R} = Ce, Pr and Nd)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rare earth intermetallic system \textit{R}Al\textit{X} (\textit{R} = rare earth elements, \textit{X} = Si and Ge) is known to be a promising candidate of magnetic Weyl semimetal. Due to the complex interactions between the rare earth elements and surrounding atoms, as well as hybridization with itinerant electrons, this family likely possesses highly intriguing and novel magnetic structures and thus exhibits dynamic behaviors. We systematically probe polycrystalline samples of \textit{R}AlSi (\textit{R} = La, Ce, Pr and Nd) combining inelastic neutron scattering (INS), heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The INS measurements identify well-resolved crystalline electric field (CEF) excitations at 19.2 and 24.9 meV in CeAlSi, at 5.4 meV in PrAlSi, and at 2.5 and 4.2 meV in NdAlSi. We analyzed the INS data using the corresponding CEF models and determined the CEF parameters and ground state wave functions of \textit{R}AlSi (\textit{R} = Ce, Pr and Nd). Our results suggest strong single-ion anisotropy in their ground states: $|\pm3/2\rangle$ (94.5\%) in CeAlSi, $|\pm3\rangle$ (99.2\%) in PrAlSi, and $|\pm9/2\rangle$ (76.2\%) in NdAlSi. Notably, the weaker anisotropy and strong exchange interactions in NdAlSi promote competing magnetic orders and CEF splitting at low temperature, contrasting with the robust CEF levels in magnetic states of CeAlSi and PrAlSi.</description>

      <title>Notes from the Physics Teaching Lab: NMR Experiments at 21 Gauss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a series of laboratory experiments that can be performed with the Quantum Control apparatus sold by TeachSpin, which uses pulsed NMR techniques to observe the precession of protons in a liquid water sample. With a uniform background magnetic field of 21 Gauss, the protons precess at about 90 kHz, yielding numerous relatively simple observations and measurements that are well suited to undergraduate physics teaching labs. Our goal in this paper is to document some of these experiments in detail, thereby making it easier for instructors to choose material that is best suited for their curricula.</description>

      <title>Time-Independent Parameters in Quantum Systems: Revisiting Berry Phase, Curvature and Gauge Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a reformulation of quantum adiabatic theory in terms of an emergent electromagnetic framework, emphasizing the physical consequences of geometric structures in parameter space. Contrary to conventional approaches, we demonstrate that a Berry electric field naturally arises in systems with dynamic Hamiltonian, when the full time-dependent wavefunction is used to define the gauge potentials. This surprising result bridges the gap between static and dynamical formulations and leads to a deeper understanding of how gauge structures manifest in quantum systems. Building on this, we construct Berry Maxwell equations by analogy with classical electrodynamics, defining Berry electric and magnetic fields as derivatives of scalar and vector potentials obtained from the full quantum state. We verify these equations explicitly and derive field-theoretic identities such as generalized continuity and vorticity relations. This field-based formulation reveals the topological charges, monopole structures, and gauge currents that underlie parameter space, and clarifies how Berry curvature corrections enter dynamical quantities like expectation values and particle velocities. Our results establish a new regime of emergent electromagnetism in parameter space, unifying time-independent and time-dependent geometric phases within a covariant formalism. The implications extend to quantum transport, polarization, and topological classification of phases, providing a robust and generalizable framework for quantum systems driven by adiabatic or nonadiabatic evolution.</description>
