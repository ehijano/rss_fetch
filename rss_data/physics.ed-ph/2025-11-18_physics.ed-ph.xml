      <title>Categorization of Roles in the Quantum Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continued growth of the quantum information science and engineering (QISE) industry has resulted in stakeholders spanning education, industry, and government seeking to better understand the workforce needs. This report presents a framework for the categorization of roles in the QISE industry based on 42 interviews of QISE professionals across 23 companies, as well as a description of the method used in the creation of this framework. The data included information on over 80 positions, which we have grouped into 29 roles spanning four primary categories. For each primary category we provide an overview of what unites the roles within a category, a description of relevant subcategories, and definitions of the individual roles. These roles serve as the basis upon which we generate profiles of these roles, which include information about role critical tasks, necessary knowledge and skills, and educational requirements. Our next report will present such profiles for each of the roles presented herein.</description>

      <title>Fractional Contribution of Dynamical and Geometric Phases in Quantum Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental division of the total quantum evolution phase into geometric and dynamical components is a central problem in quantum physics. Here, we prove a remarkably simple and universal law demonstrating that this partitioning is governed, at every instant, solely by a single geometric quantity: the Bargmann angle (Bures angle). This result provides a universally applicable and rigorous way to define the exact fraction of the total phase that is geometric versus dynamical in origin, thereby establishing a new quantitative link between the dynamics of quantum evolution and the geometry of the state space. This finding has immediate practical consequences, furnishing a real-time measure of the geometricity of an evolution for designing high-fidelity geometric quantum gates with optimized robustness, and opening new avenues for quantum speed limit and coherent control.</description>

      <title>Effective Note-taking and its Impact on Learning Undergraduate Introductory Physics Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Taking notes during lectures is one of the required skills, among many others, that students need (i) to master the topic covered in the lecture, (ii) to actively engage in the learning process with minimal to no distractions, (iii) to retain learned knowledge and skills for a longer time, and (iv) in securing higher letter grades. To learn the role of notetaking in learning undergraduate-level introductory physics courses, we present a comparative study of students' achievement in a mid-terminal exam at a historically black Fayetteville State University (FSU) (i) when students were taught effective notetaking strategies, motivated them to prepare notes and let them use their self-prepared notes in a terminal exam versus (ii) no notetaking scheme was implemented, keeping all other conditions the same. The no-notetaking scheme was used in 4 different sections over a few semesters, and the notetaking scheme was used at the same level of an introductory physics course in 3 different sections in other semesters. Students' scores in one of the mid-term exams are taken as measurement tools. Grade analysis indicates that effective notetaking enhances students' letter grades and lowers failure rates.</description>
