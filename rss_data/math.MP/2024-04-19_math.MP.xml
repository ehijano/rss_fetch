      <title>Graviton topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past three decades, it has been shown that discrete and continuous media can support topologically nontrivial modes. Recently, it was shown that the same is true of the vacuum, namely, right (R) and left (L) circularly polarized photons are topologically nontrivial. Here, we study the topology of another class of massless particles, namely the gravitons. Working in the transverse-traceless gauge and the limit of weak gravity, we show that the collection of all gravitons forms a rank-two vector bundle over the lightcone. We prove the graviton bundle is topologically trivial, allowing us to discover a globally smooth basis for gravitons. It has often been assumed that there exists such a global basis consisting of linear polarized gravitons. We prove that this stronger assumption is false--the graviton bundle has no linearly polarized subbundles. While the total graviton bundle can be decomposed into trivial line bundles, it also breaks apart into two nontrivial $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ invariant subbundles, consisting of the R and L gravitons. Unlike the bundles in the trivial decomposition, the R and L gravitons are in fact irreducible bundle representations of the Poincar\'{e} group, and are thus elementary particles. The nontrivial topologies of the R and L gravitons are fully characterized by the Chern numbers $\mp 4$. These topologies differ from those of the R and L photons, which are characterized by the Chern numbers $\mp 2$. This nontrivial topology obstructs the splitting of graviton angular momentum into spin and orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear, Conservative, Entropic Fokker-Planck Model for Multi-Species Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multi-species Fokker-Planck model for simulating particle collisions in a plasma is presented. The model includes various parameters that must be tuned. Under reasonable assumptions on these parameters, the model satisfies appropriate conservation laws, dissipates an entropy, and satisfies an $\mathcal{H}$-Theorem. In addition, the model parameters provide the additional flexibility that is used to match simultaneously momentum and temperature relaxation formulas derived from the Boltzmann collision operator for a binary mixture with Coulomb potentials. A numerical method for solving the resulting space-homogeneous kinetic equation is presented and two examples are provided to demonstrate the relaxation of species bulk velocities and temperatures to their equilibrium values.</description>

      <title>On SVD and Polar Decomposition in Real and Complexified Clifford Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a natural implementation of singular value decomposition (SVD) and polar decomposition of an arbitrary multivector in nondegenerate real and complexified Clifford geometric algebras of arbitrary dimension and signature. The new theorems involve only operations in geometric algebras and do not involve matrix operations. We naturally define these and other related structures such as Hermitian conjugation, Euclidean space, and Lie groups in geometric algebras. The results can be used in various applications of geometric algebras in computer science, engineering, and physics.</description>

      <title>The port-Hamiltonian structure of continuum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to the geometric formulation of solid and fluid mechanics within the port-Hamiltonian framework, which extends the standard Hamiltonian formulation to non-conservative and open dynamical systems. Leveraging Dirac structures, instead of symplectic or Poisson structures, this formalism allows the incorporation of energy exchange within the spatial domain or through its boundary, which allows for a more comprehensive description of continuum mechanics. Building upon our recent work in describing nonlinear elasticity using exterior calculus and bundle-valued differential forms, this paper focuses on the systematic derivation of port-Hamiltonian models for solid and fluid mechanics in the material, spatial, and convective representations using Hamiltonian reduction theory. This paper also discusses constitutive relations for stress within this framework including hyper-elasticity, for both finite- and infinite-strains, as well as viscous fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Conjugate Operators of 1D-harmonic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conjugate operator $T$ of 1D-harmonic oscillator $N=1/2 (p^2+q^2-1)$ is defined by an operator satisfying canonical commutation relation $[N,T]=-i$ on some domain but not necessarily dense. The angle operator $T_A=1/2 (\arctan q^{-1} p+\arctan pq^{-1} )$ and Galapon operator $T_G=i \sum_{n=0}^\infty(\sum_{m\neq n}\frac{(v_m,\cdot) }{n-m}v_n)$ are examples of conjugate operators, where ${v_n}$ denotes the set of normalized eigenvectors of $N$. Let $T$ be a subset of conjugate operators of $N$. A classification of $T$ are given as $T=T_{\{0\}}\cup T_{D\setminus \{0\}}\cup T_{\partial D}$, and $T_A\in T_{\{0\}}$ and $T_G\in T_{\partial D}$ are shown. Here the classification is specified by a pair of parameters $(\omega,m)\in C\times N$. Finally the time evolution $T_{\omega,m}(t)=e^{itN} T_{\omega,m}e^{-itN}$ for $T_{\omega,m}\in T$ is investigated, and show that $T_{\omega,m}(t)$ is periodic.</description>

      <title>The Sine-Gordon QFT in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the massless Sine-Gordon model in de Sitter spacetime, in the regime $\beta^2 &lt; 4 \pi$ and using the framework of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory. We show that a Fock space representation exists for the free massless field, but that the natural one-parameter family of vacuum-like states breaks the de Sitter boost symmetries. We prove convergence of the perturbative series for the S matrix in this representation, and construct the interacting Haag-Kastler net of local algebras from the relative S matrices. We show that the net fulfills isotony, locality and de Sitter covariance (in the algebraic adiabatic limit), even though the states that we consider are not invariant. We furthermore prove convergence of the perturbative series for the interacting field and the vertex operators, and verify that the interacting equation of motion holds.</description>

      <title>On the spin interface distribution for non-integrable variants of the two-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a martingale observable related to the spin interface for a class of non-integrable variants of the two-dimensional Ising model and express it in terms of Grassmann integrals. Under a conjecture about the scaling limit of this object, which is similar to some results recently obtained using constructive renormalization group methods, this would imply that the distribution of the interface has the same scaling limit as in the integrable model, that is, the Schramm Loewner evolution curve SLE(3).</description>

      <title>On the electromagnetic interaction and the anomalous term in the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of vectorial mesons embedded in an electromagnetic field via Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) formalism is reinvestigated. Considering the electromagnetic interaction as a minimal coupling, an incorrect value $(g=1)$ is identified for the gyromagnetic factor ($g$-factor). Furthermore, it is shown that is cumbersome to find analytical solutions due to the presence of the so-called anomalous term for the spin-1 sector of the DKP theory. Suspecting that the anomalous term results from an incomplete version of the DKP equation to describe the electromagnetic interaction, we consider the addition of a non-minimal coupling. This leads to the correct $g$-factor $(g=2)$, and as a consequence, the anomalous term becomes proportional to an external four current. As an application, the DKP equation with a static uniform magnetic field is considered, yielding the corresponding Landau levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Polynomial Affine Gravity is an alternative gravitational model, where the interactions are mediated solely by the affine connection, instead of the metric tensor. In this paper, we explore the space of solutions to the field equations when the torsion fields are turned on, in a homogeneous and isotropic (cosmological) scenario. We explore various metric structures that emerge in the space of solutions.</description>

Abstract: A closed formula for the spectral determinant for the wave equation on a bounded interval, subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions and an $\alpha$-multiple of the Dirac $\delta$-type damping, is derived. Depending on the choice of the branch cut of the logarithm used in its definition, the spectral determinant diverges either for $\alpha =2$ or $\alpha=-2$.</description>

      <title>Van Hove singularities in the density of states of a chaotic dynamical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistics of a chaotic recursion relation can be predicted by constructing an associated sequence of periodic elliptic operators. For such operators, the density of states is well understood, can be computed straightforwardly and explicit formulas can often be derived. The example studied here is a non-linear recursion relation which can be related to a sequence of periodic operators generated by a Fibonacci tiling rule. This link is used to derive an explicit formula for the limiting distribution of orbits of the non-linear recursion relation. This distribution contains characteristic features of the associated operators' densities of states, such as Van Hove singularities near to critical values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Euler-Lagrange and Hamilton's equations for a system whose configuration space is a unified product Lie group $G=M\bowtie_{\gamma} H$, for some $\gamma:M\times M \to H$. By reduction, then, we obtain the Euler-Lagrange type and Hamilton's type equations of the same form for the quotient space $M\cong G/H$, although it is not necessarily a Lie group. We observe, through further reduction, that it is possible to formulate the Euler-Poincar\'{e} type and Lie-Poisson type equations on the corresponding quotient $\mathfrak{m}\cong \mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h}$ of Lie algebras, which is not a priori a Lie algebra. Moreover, we realize the $n$th order iterated tangent group $T^{(n)}G$ of a Lie group $G$ as an extension of the $n$th order tangent group $T^nG$ of the same type. More precisely, $\mathfrak{g}$ being the Lie algebra of $G$, $T^{(n)}G \cong \mathfrak{g}^{\times \,2^n-1-n} \bowtie_\gamma T^nG$ for some $\gamma:\mathfrak{g}^{\times \,2^n-1-n} \times \mathfrak{g}^{\times \,2^n-1-n} \to T^nG$. We thus obtain the $n$th order Euler-Lagrange (and then the $n$th order Euler-Poincar\'e) equations over $T^nG$ by reduction from those on $T(T^{n-1}G)$. Finally, we illustrate our results in the realm of the Kepler problem, and the non-linear tokamak plasma dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum field theory (QFT) in its functional formulation. In this approach quantum correlation functions can be expressed as classical expectation values over (complex) stochastic processes. We obtain a stochastic representation of the Schr\"odinger time evolution on Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) states by means of the Wiener integral. We discuss QFT in a flat expanding metric and in de Sitter space-time. We calculate the evolution kernel in an expanding flat metric in the real time formulation. We discuss a field interaction in pseudoRiemannian and Riemannian metrics showing that an inversion of the signature leads to some substantial simplifications of the singularity problems in QFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In $n$-dimensional classical field theory one studies maps from $n$-dimensional manifolds in such a way that classical mechanics is recovered for $n=1$. In previous papers we have shown that the standard polysymplectic framework in which field theory is described, is not suitable for variational techniques. In this paper, we introduce for $n=2$ a Lagrange-Hamilton formalism that allows us to define a generalization of Hamiltonian Floer theory. As an application, we prove a cuplength estimate for our Hamiltonian equations that yields a lower bound on the number of solutions to Laplace equations with nonlinearity. We also discuss the relation with holomorphic Floer theory.</description>

      <title>Area laws from classical entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The area law-like scaling of local quantum entropies is the central characteristic of the entanglement inherent in quantum fields, many-body systems, and spacetime. Whilst the area law is primarily associated with the entanglement structure of the underlying quantum state, we here show that it equally manifests in classical entropies over measurement distributions when vacuum contributions dictated by the uncertainty principle are subtracted. Using the examples of the Gaussian ground and thermal states, but also the non-Gaussian particle state of a relativistic scalar field, we present analytical and numerical area laws for the entropies of various distributions and unveil how quantities of widespread interest such as the central charge and the (local) temperature are encoded in classical observables. With our approach, quantum entropies are no longer necessary to probe quantum phenomena, thereby rendering area laws and other quantum features directly accessible to theoretical models of high complexity as well as state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously prove, for the first time, that the non-hydrodynamic sector is gapless in any relativistic kinetic theory whose scattering cross-section decays to zero at large energies. In fact, if particles with very high energy (compared to the temperature) are free streaming, we can use them to build hot non-hydrodynamic waves, which live longer than any hydrodynamic wave. Since many standard cross-sections in quantum field theory vanish at high energies, the existence of these non-thermal long-lived waves is a rather general feature of relativistic systems.</description>

Abstract: Extending the method proposed in [arXiv:1109.5524], we derive QQ-relations (functional relations among Baxter Q-functions) and T-functions (eigenvalues of transfer matrices) for fusion vertex models associated with the twisted quantum affine superalgebras $U_{q}(gl(2r+1|2s)^{(2)})$, $U_{q}(gl(2r|2s+1)^{(2)})$, $U_{q}(gl(2r|2s)^{(2)})$, $U_{q}(osp(2r|2s)^{(2)})$ and the non-twisted quantum affine orthosymplectic superalgebras $U_{q}(osp(2r+1|2s)^{(1)})$ and $U_{q}(osp(2r|2s)^{(1)})$ (and their Yangian counterparts, $Y(osp(2r+1|2s))$ and $Y(osp(2r|2s))$) as reductions (a kind of folding) of those for associated with $U_{q}(gl(M|N)^{(1)})$. In particular, we reproduce previously proposed generating functions (difference operators) of the T-functions for the symmetric or anti-symmetric representations, and tableau sum expressions for more general representations for orthosymplectic superalgebras [arXiv:0911.5393,arXiv:0911.5390], and obtain Wronskian-type expressions (analogues of Weyl-type character formulas) for them. T-functions for spinorial representations are related to reductions of those for asymptotic limits of typical representations of $U_{q}(gl(M|N)^{(1)})$.</description>

      <title>Extended symmetry analysis of (1+2)-dimensional fine Kolmogorov backward equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the class of (1+2)-dimensional ultraparabolic linear equations, we distinguish a fine Kolmogorov backward equation with a quadratic diffusivity. Modulo the point equivalence, it is a unique equation within the class whose essential Lie invariance algebra is five-dimensional and nonsolvable. Using the direct method, we compute the point symmetry pseudogroup of this equation and analyze its structure. In particular, we single out its essential subgroup and classify its discrete elements. We exhaustively classify all subalgebras of the corresponding essential Lie invariance algebra up to inner automorphisms and up to the action of the essential point-symmetry group. This allowed us to classify Lie reductions and Lie invariant solutions of the equation under consideration. We also discuss the generation of its solutions using point and linear generalized symmetries and carry out its peculiar generalized reductions. As a result, we construct wide families of its solutions parameterized by an arbitrary finite number of arbitrary solutions of the (1+1)-dimensional linear heat equation or one or two arbitrary solutions of (1+1)-dimensional linear heat equations with inverse square potentials.</description>

      <title>Invariant Gibbs measures and global strong solutions for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations in dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.08492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb{T}^2$ with Wick ordered power nonlinearity, and prove almost sure global well-posedness with respect to the associated Gibbs measure. The heart of the matter is the uniqueness of the solution as limit of solutions to canonically truncated systems. The invariance of the Gibbs measure under the global dynamics follows as a consequence. The proof relies on the novel idea of random averaging operators.</description>

      <title>Geometric relative entropies and barycentric R\'enyi divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14282v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give systematic ways of defining monotone quantum relative entropies and (multi-variate) quantum R\'enyi divergences starting from a set of monotone quantum relative entropies.
  Despite its central importance in information theory, only two additive and monotone quantum extensions of the classical relative entropy have been known so far, the Umegaki and the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropies. Here we give a general procedure to construct monotone and additive quantum relative entropies from a given one with the same properties; in particular, when starting from the Umegaki relative entropy, this gives a new one-parameter family of monotone and additive quantum relative entropies interpolating between the Umegaki and the Belavkin-Staszewski ones on full-rank states.
  In a different direction, we use a generalization of a classical variational formula to define multi-variate quantum R\'enyi quantities corresponding to any finite set of quantum relative entropies $(D^{q_x})_{x\in X}$ and signed probability measure $P$, as $$ Q_P^{\mathrm{b},\mathbf{q}}((\rho_x)_{x\in X}):=\sup_{\tau\ge 0}\left\{\text{Tr}\,\tau-\sum_xP(x)D^{q_x}(\tau\|\rho_x)\right\}. $$ We show that monotone quantum relative entropies define monotone R\'enyi quantities whenever $P$ is a probability measure. With the proper normalization, the negative logarithm of the above quantity gives a quantum extension of the classical R\'enyi $\alpha$-divergence in the 2-variable case ($X=\{0,1\}$, $P(0)=\alpha$). We show that if both $D^{q_0}$ and $D^{q_1}$ are monotone and additive quantum relative entropies, and at least one of them is strictly larger than the Umegaki relative entropy then the resulting barycentric R\'enyi divergences are strictly between the log-Euclidean and the maximal R\'enyi divergences, and hence they are different from any previously studied quantum R\'enyi divergence.</description>

      <title>Remote detectability from entanglement bootstrap I: Kirby's torus trick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote detectability is often taken as a physical assumption in the study of topologically ordered systems, and it is a central axiom of mathematical frameworks of topological quantum field theories. We show under the entanglement bootstrap approach that remote detectability is a necessary property; that is, we derive it as a theorem. Starting from a single wave function on a topologically-trivial region satisfying the entanglement bootstrap axioms, we can construct states on closed manifolds. The crucial technique is to immerse the punctured manifold into the topologically trivial region and then heal the puncture. This is analogous to Kirby's torus trick. We then analyze a special class of such manifolds, which we call pairing manifolds. For each pairing manifold, which pairs two classes of excitations, we identify an analog of the topological $S$-matrix. This pairing matrix is unitary, which implies remote detectability between two classes of excitations. These matrices are in general not associated with the mapping class group of the manifold. As a by-product, we can count excitation types (e.g., graph excitations in 3+1d). The pairing phenomenon occurs in many physical contexts, including systems in different dimensions, with or without gapped boundaries. We provide a variety of examples to illustrate its scope.</description>

      <title>The semiclassical limit from the Pauli-Poisswell to the Euler-Poisswell system by WKB methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06660v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The self-consistent Pauli-Poisswell equation for 2-spinors is the first order in $1/c$ semi-relativistic approximation of the Dirac-Maxwell equation for 4-spinors coupled to the self-consistent electromagnetic fields generated by the density and current density of a fast moving electric charge. It consists of a vector-valued magnetic Schr\"odinger equation with an extra term coupling spin and magnetic field via the Pauli matrices coupled to 1+3 Poisson type equations as the magnetostatic approximation of Maxwell's equations. The Pauli-Poisswell equation is a consistent $O(1/c)$ model that keeps both relativistic effects magnetism and spin which are both absent in the non-relativistic Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation and inconsistent in the magnetic Schr\"odinger-Maxwell equation.
  We present the mathematically rigorous semiclassical limit $\hbar \rightarrow 0$ of the Pauli-Poisswell equation towards the magnetic Euler-Poisswell equation. We use WKB analysis which is valid locally in time only. A key step is to obtain an a priori energy estimate for which we have to take into account the Poisson equations for the magnetic potential with the current as source term. Additionally we obtain the weak convergence of the monokinetic Wigner transform and strong convergence of the density and the current density. We also prove local wellposedness of the Euler-Poisswell equation which is global unless a finite time blow-up occurs.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantum complexity of bosonic oscillator systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the pioneering work of Nielsen and collaborators, the length of the minimal geodesic in a geometric realization of a suitable operator space provides a measure of the quantum complexity of an operation. Compared with the original concept of complexity based on the minimal number of gates required to construct the desired operation as a product, this geometrical approach amounts to a more concrete and computable definition, but its evaluation is nontrivial in systems with a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The geometrical formulation can more easily be evaluated by considering the geometry associated with a suitable finite-dimensional group generated by a small number of relevant operators of the system. In this way, the method has been applied in particular to the harmonic oscillator, which is also of interest in the present paper. However, subtle and previously unrecognized issues of group theory can lead to unforeseen complications, motivating a new formulation that remains on the level of the underlying Lie algebras for most of the required steps. Novel insights about complexity can thereby be found in a low-dimensional setting, with the potential of systematic extensions to higher dimensions as well as interactions. Specific examples include the quantum complexity of various target unitary operators associated with a harmonic oscillator, inverted harmonic oscillator, and coupled harmonic oscillators. The generality of this approach is demonstrated by an application to an anharmonic oscillator with a cubic term.</description>

      <title>From port-based teleportation to Frobenius reciprocity theorem: partially reduced irreducible representations and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the connection of two concepts as induced representation and partially reduced irreducible representations (PRIR) appear in the context of port-based teleportation protocols. Namely, for a given finite group $G$ with arbitrary subgroup $H$, we consider a particular case of matrix irreducible representations, whose restriction to the subgroup $H$, as a matrix representation of $H$, is completely reduced to diagonal block form with an irreducible representation of $H$ in the blocks. The basic properties of such representations are given. Then as an application of this concept, we show that the spectrum of the port-based teleportation operator acting on $n$ systems is connected in a very simple way with the spectrum of the corresponding Jucys-Murphy operator for the symmetric group $S(n-1)\subset S(n)$. This shows on the technical level relation between teleporation and one of the basic objects from the point of view of the representation theory of the symmetric group. This shows a deep connection between the central object describing properties of deterministic PBT schemes and objects appearing naturally in the abstract representation theory of the symmetric group. In particular, we present a new expression for the eigenvalues of the Jucys-Murphy operators based on the irreducible characters of the symmetric group. As an additional but not trivial result, we give also purely matrix proof of the Frobenius reciprocity theorem for characters with explicit construction of the unitary matrix that realizes the reduction of the natural basis of induced representation to the reduced one.</description>

      <title>Full range spectral correlations and their spectral form factors in chaotic and integrable models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlations between the eigenenergies of a system's spectrum can be a defining feature of quantum chaos. We characterize correlations between energies for all spectral distances by studying the distributions of $k$-th neighbor level spacings ($k$nLS) and compute their associated $k$-th neighbor spectral form factor ($k$nSFF). Specifically, we find analytical expressions for these signatures in paradigmatic models of quantum chaos, namely the three Gaussian ensembles of random matrix theory, and in integrable models, taken as systems with completely uncorrelated spectra (the Poissonian ensemble). The spectral distance decomposition of the SFF allows us to probe the contribution of each individual $k$nLS to the ramp. The latter is a characteristic feature of quantum chaos, and we show how each spectral distance participates in building it -- the linear ramp cannot be formed by short-range energy correlations only. We illustrate our findings in the XXZ spin chain with disorder, which interpolates between chaotic and integrable behavior.</description>

      <title>Closed 4-braids and the Jones unknot conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jones problem is a question whether there is a non-trivial knot with the trivial Jones polynomial in one variable $q$. The answer to this fundamental question is still unknown despite numerous attempts to explore it. In braid presentation the case of 4-strand braids is already open. S. Bigelow showed in 2000 that if the Burau representation for four-strand braids is unfaithful, then there is an infinite number of non-trivial knots with the trivial two-variable HOMFLY-PT polynomial and hence, with the trivial Jones polynomial, since it is obtained from the HOMFLY-PT polynomial by the specialisation of one of the variables $A=q^2$.
  In this paper, we study four-strand braids and ask whether there are non-trivial knots with the trivial Jones polynomial but a non-trivial HOMFLY-PT polynomial. We have discovered that there is a whole 1-parameter family, parameterised by the writhe number, of 2-variable polynomials that can be HOMFLY-PT polynomials of some knots. We explore various properties of the obtained hypothetical HOMFLY-PT polynomials and suggest several checks to test these formulas. A generalisation is also proposed for the case of a large number of strands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applications of quantum mechanics rely on the accuracy of reading and writing data. This requires accurate measurements and preparations of the quantum states. I show that accurate measurements and preparations are impossible if the total Hamiltonian is bounded from below (as thought to be in our universe). This result invites a reevaluation of the limitations of quantum control, quantum computing, and other quantum technologies dependent on the accuracy of quantum preparations and measurements, and maybe of the assumption that the Hamiltonian is bounded from below.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a recipe for B-model computation of genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau and Fano Projective Hypersurfaces. Our formalism can be applied equally to both Calabi-Yau and Fano cases. In Calabi-Yau case, drastic cancellation of terms used in our formalism occurs and it results in another representation of BCOV-Zinger formula for projective Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces.</description>
