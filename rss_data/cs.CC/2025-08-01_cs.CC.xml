      <title>Exponential Lower Bounds on the Size of ResLin Proofs of Nearly Quadratic Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Itsykson and Sokolov identified resolution over parities, denoted by $\text{Res}(\oplus)$, as a natural and simple fragment of $\text{AC}^0[2]$-Frege for which no super-polynomial lower bounds on size of proofs are known. Building on a recent line of work, Efremenko and Itsykson proved lower bounds of the form $\text{exp}(N^{\Omega(1)})$, on the size of $\text{Res}(\oplus)$ proofs whose depth is upper bounded by $O(N\log N)$, where $N$ is the number of variables of the unsatisfiable CNF formula. The hard formula they used was Tseitin on an appropriately expanding graph, lifted by a $2$-stifling gadget. They posed the natural problem of proving super-polynomial lower bounds on the size of proofs that are $\Omega(N^{1+\epsilon})$ deep, for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$.
  We provide a significant improvement by proving a lower bound on size of the form $\text{exp}(\tilde{\Omega}(N^{\epsilon}))$, as long as the depth of the $\text{Res}(\oplus)$ proofs are $O(N^{2-\epsilon})$, for every $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Our hard formula is again Tseitin on an expander graph, albeit lifted with a different type of gadget. Our gadget needs to have small correlation with all parities.
  An important ingredient in our work is to show that arbitrary distributions \emph{lifted} with such gadgets fool \emph{safe} affine spaces, an idea which originates in the earlier work of Bhattacharya, Chattopadhyay and Dvorak.</description>

      <title>On a better complexity upper bound of Ward-Szabo theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ward and Szab\'o [WS94] have shown that a complete graph with $N^2$ nodes whose edges are colored by $N$ colors and that has at least two colors contains a bichromatic triangle. This fact leads us to a total search problem: Given an edge-coloring on a complete graph with N2 nodes using at least two colors and at most N colors, find a bichromatic triangle. Bourneuf, Folwarczn\'y, Hub\'acek, Rosen, and Schwartzbach [Bou+23] have proven that such a total search problem, called Ward-Szab\'o, is PWPP-hard and belongs to the class TFNP, a class for total search problems in which the correctness of every candidate solution is efficiently verifiable. However, it is open which TFNP subclass contains Ward-Szab\'o. This paper will improve the complexity upper bound of Ward-Szab\'o. We prove that Ward-Szab\'o is in belongs to the complexity class PPP, a TFNP subclass of problems in which the pigeonhole principle guarantees the existence of solutions.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Logarithmic Space Bounded Counting Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this monograph, we study complexity classes that are defined using $O(\log n)$-space bounded non-deterministic Turing machines. We prove salient results of Computational Complexity in this topic such as the Immerman-Szelepcs$\rm\acute{e}$nyi Theorem, the Isolating Lemma, theorems of Mahajan-Vinay on the determinant and many consequences of these very important results. The manuscript is intended to be a comprehensive textbook on the topic of The Complexity of Logarithmic Space Bounded Counting Classes.</description>

      <title>Amplitude amplification and estimation require inverses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the generic quantum speedups for brute-force search and counting only hold when the process we apply them to can be efficiently inverted. The algorithms speeding up these problems, amplitude amplification and amplitude estimation, assume the ability to apply a state preparation unitary $U$ and its inverse $U^\dagger$; we give problem instances based on trace estimation where no algorithm which uses only $U$ beats the naive, quadratically slower approach. Our proof of this is simple and goes through the compressed oracle method introduced by Zhandry. Since these two subroutines are responsible for the ubiquity of the quadratic "Grover" speedup in quantum algorithms, our result explains why such speedups are far harder to come by in the settings of quantum learning, metrology, and sensing. In these settings, $U$ models the evolution of an experimental system, so implementing $U^\dagger$ can be much harder -- tantamount to reversing time within the system. Our result suggests a dichotomy: without inverse access, quantum speedups are scarce; with it, quantum speedups abound.</description>

      <title>On the power of adaption and randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present bounds on the maximal gain of adaptive and randomized algorithms over non-adaptive, deterministic ones for approximating linear operators on convex sets. If the sets are additionally symmetric, then our results are optimal. For non-symmetric sets, we unify some notions of $n$-widths and s-numbers, and show their connection to minimal errors. We also discuss extensions to non-linear widths and approximation based on function values, and conclude with a list of open problems.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Quantifiers Needed to Define Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of quantifiers needed to express first-order (FO) properties is captured by two-player combinatorial games called multi-structural games. We analyze these games on binary strings with an ordering relation, using a technique we call parallel play, which significantly reduces the number of quantifiers needed in many cases. Ordered structures such as strings have historically been notoriously difficult to analyze in the context of these and similar games. Nevertheless, in this paper, we provide essentially tight upper bounds on the number of quantifiers needed to characterize different-sized subsets of strings. The results immediately give bounds on the number of quantifiers necessary to define several different classes of Boolean functions. One of our results is analogous to Lupanov's upper bounds on circuit size and formula size in propositional logic: we show that every Boolean function on $n$-bit inputs can be defined by a FO sentence having $(1 + \varepsilon)n\log(n) + O(1)$ quantifiers, and that this is essentially tight. We reduce this number to $(1 + \varepsilon)\log(n) + O(1)$ when the Boolean function in question is sparse.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-induced provable and robust quantum learning advantages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds unparalleled potentials to enhance machine learning. However, a demonstration of quantum learning advantage has not been achieved so far. We make a step forward by rigorously establishing a noise-robust, unconditional quantum learning advantage in expressivity, inference speed, and training efficiency, compared to commonly-used classical models. Our proof is information-theoretic and pinpoints the origin of this advantage: entanglement can be used to reduce the communication required by non-local tasks. In particular, we design a task that can be solved with certainty by quantum models with a constant number of parameters using entanglement, whereas commonly-used classical models must scale linearly to achieve a larger-than-exponentially-small accuracy. We show that the quantum model is trainable with constant resources and robust against constant noise. Through numerical and trapped-ion experiments on IonQ Aria, we demonstrate the desired advantage. Our results provide valuable guidance for demonstrating quantum learning advantages with current noisy intermediate-scale devices.</description>
