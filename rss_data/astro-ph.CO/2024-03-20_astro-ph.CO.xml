      <title>Mono- and oligochromatic extreme-mass ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational capture of a stellar-mass object by a supermassive black hole represents a unique probe of warped spacetime. The small object, typically a stellar-mass black hole, describes a very large number of cycles before crossing the event horizon. Because of the mass difference, we call these captures extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Their merger event rate at the Galactic Centre is negligible, but the amount of time spent in the early inspiral is not. Early EMRIs (E-EMRIs) spend hundreds of thousands of years in band during this phase. At very early stages, the peak of the frequency will not change during an observational time. At later stages, it will change a bit and finally the EMRI explores a wide range of them when it is close to merger. We distinguish between ``monocromatic'' E-EMRIs, which do not change their (peak) frequency, oligochromatic E-EMRIs, which explore a short range and polychromatic ones, the EMRIs which have been discussed so far in the literature. We derive the number of E-EMRIs at the Galactic Centre, and their signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and perform a study of parameter extraction. We show that parameters such as the spin and the mass can be extracted with an error which can be as small as $10^{-11}$ and $10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}$. There are between hundreds and thousands of E-EMRIs in their monochromatic stage at the GC, and tens in their oligochromatic phase. The SNR ranges from a minimum of $10$ (larger likelihood) to a maximum of $10^6$ (smaller likelihood). Moreover, we derive the contribution signal corresponding to the incoherent sum of continuous with two representatives masses; $10\,M_{\odot}$ and $40\,M_{\odot}$ and show that their curves will cover a significant part of LISA's sensitivity curve. Depending on their level of circularisation, they might be detected as individual sources or form a foreground population.</description>

      <title>Assessing the dark degeneracy through the gas mass fraction data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that Einstein's equations constrain only the total energy-momentum tensor of the cosmic substratum, without specifying the characteristics of its individual constituents. Consequently, cosmological models featuring distinct decompositions within the dark sector, while sharing identical values for the sum of dark components' energy-momentum tensor, remain indistinguishable when assessed through observables based on distance measurements. Notably, it has been already demonstrated that cosmological models with dynamical descriptions of dark energy, characterized by a time-dependent equation of state (EoS), can always be mapped into a model featuring a decaying vacuum ($w=-1$) coupled with dark matter. We explore the possibility of breaking this degeneracy by using measurements of the gas mass fraction observed in massive and relaxed galaxy clusters. This data is particularly interesting for this purpose because it isolates the matter contribution, possibly allowing the degeneracy breaking. We study the particular case of the $w$CDM model with its interactive counterpart. We compare the results obtained from both descriptions with a non-parametric analysis obtained through Gaussian Process. Even though the degeneracy may be broken from the theoretical point of view, we find that current gas mass fraction data seems to be insufficient for a final conclusion about which approach is favored, even when combined with SNIa, BAO and CMB.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction and evolution of black holes in cosmological simulations: a new implementation in OpenGadget3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a sub-resolution prescription for the unresolved dynamical friction onto black holes (BHs) in the OpenGadget3 code. We carry out cosmological simulations of a volume of 16 cMpc3 and zoom-ins of a galaxy group and of a galaxy cluster. The advantages of our new technique are assessed in comparison to commonly adopted methods to hamper spurious BH displacements, i.e. repositioning onto a local minimum of the gravitational potential and ad-hoc boosting of the BH particle dynamical mass. The newly-introduced dynamical friction correction provides centering of BHs on host halos which is at least comparable with the other techniques. It predicts half as many merger events with respect to the repositioning prescription, with the advantage of being less prone to leave sub-structures without any central BH. Simulations featuring our dynamical friction prescription produce a smaller (by up to 50% with respect to repositioning) population of wandering BHs and final BH masses in good agreement with observations. As for individual BH-BH interactions, our dynamical friction model captures the gradual inspiraling of orbits before the merger occurs. By contrast, the repositioning scheme, in its most classical renditions considered, describes extremely fast mergers, while the dynamical mass misrepresents the BHs' dynamics, introducing numerical scattering between the orbiting BHs. Given its performances in describing the centering of BHs within host galaxies and the orbiting of BH pair before their merging, our dynamical friction correction opens interesting applications for an accurate description of the evolution of BH demography within cosmological simulations of galaxy formation at different cosmic epochs and within different environments.</description>

      <title>The Inflationary Butterfly Effect: Non-Perturbative Dynamics From Small-Scale Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, we investigate the non-perturbative dynamics of single field inflation with a departure from slow-roll. Using simulations, we find that oscillatory features in the potential can drastically alter the course of inflation, with major phenomenological implications. In certain cases, the entire Universe gets trapped in a forever inflating de Sitter state. In others, only some regions get stuck in a false vacuum, offering an alternative channel for primordial black hole formation. Analogous to the flap of a butterfly, these results show that small-scale phenomena can have profound consequences on the evolution of the entire Universe. This demonstrates the necessity of a non-perturbative approach in the exploration of the small-scale physics of inflation, particularly in the regime relevant for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>The FLAMINGO project: the coupling between baryonic feedback and cosmology in light of the $S_8$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale structure surveys have reported measurements of the density of matter, $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$, and the amplitude of clustering, $\sigma_8$, that are in tension with the values inferred from observations of the cosmic microwave background. While this may be a sign of new physics that slows the growth of structure at late times, strong astrophysical feedback processes could also be responsible. In this work, we argue that astrophysical processes are not independent of cosmology and that their coupling naturally leads to stronger baryonic feedback in cosmological models with suppressed structure formation or when combined with a mechanism that removes dark matter from halos. We illustrate this with two well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model known to suppress structure formation: massive neutrinos and decaying dark matter. Our results, based on the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, show that the combined effect of baryonic and non-baryonic suppression mechanisms is greater than the sum of its parts, particularly for decaying dark matter. We also show that the dependence of baryonic feedback on cosmology can be modelled as a function of the ratio $f_\mathrm{b}/c^2_\mathrm{v}\sim f_\mathrm{b}/(\Omega_\mathrm{m}\sigma_8)^{1/4}$ of the universal baryon fraction, $f_\mathrm{b}$, to a velocity-based definition of halo concentration, $c^2_\mathrm{v}$, giving an accurate fitting formula for the baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum. Although the combination of baryonic and non-baryonic suppression mechanisms can resolve the tension, the models with neutrinos and decaying dark matter are challenged by constraints on the expansion history.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Universality of the Penrose Limit of Black Hole Photon Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the physics of photon rings in a wide range of axisymmetric black holes admitting a separable Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the geodesics. Utilizing the Killing-Yano tensor, we derive the Penrose limit of the black holes, which describes the physics near the photon ring. The obtained plane wave geometry is directly linked to the frequency matrix of the massless wave equation, as well as the instabilities and Lyapunov exponents of the null geodesics. Consequently, the Lyapunov exponents and frequencies of the photon geodesics, along with the quasinormal modes, can be all extracted from a Hamiltonian in the Penrose limit plane wave metric. Additionally, we explore potential bounds on the Lyapunov exponent, the orbital and precession frequencies, in connection with the corresponding inverted harmonic oscillators and we discuss the possibility of photon rings serving as holographic horizons in a holographic duality framework for astrophysical black holes. Our formalism is applicable to spacetimes encompassing various types of black holes, including stationary ones like Kerr, Kerr-Newman, as well as static black holes such as Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om, among others.</description>

      <title>A deep learning model for the density profiles of subhaloes in IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine-learning-based model for the total density profiles of subhaloes with masses $M \gtrsim 7\times 10^8\,h^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$ in the IllustrisTNG100 simulation. The model is based on an interpretable variational encoder (IVE) which returns the independent factors of variation in the density profiles within a low-dimensional representation, as well as the predictions for the density profiles themselves. The IVE returns accurate and unbiased predictions on all radial ranges, including the outer region profile where the subhaloes experience tidal stripping; here its fit accuracy exceeds that of the commonly used Einasto profile. The IVE discovers three independent degrees of freedom in the profiles, which can be interpreted in terms of the formation history of the subhaloes. In addition to the two parameters controlling the normalization and inner shape of the profile, the IVE discovers a third parameter that accounts for the impact of tidal stripping onto the subhalo outer profile; this parameter is sensitive to the mass loss experienced by the subhalo after its infall onto its parent halo. Baryonic physics in the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model does not impact the number of degrees of freedom identified in the profile compared to the pure dark matter expectations, nor their physical interpretation. Our newly proposed profile fit can be used in strong lensing analyses or other observational studies which aim to constrain cosmology from small-scale structures.</description>

      <title>The haloes that reionized the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the reionization of the Universe due to haloes that host galaxies undergoing bursts of star formation. By comparing the recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE at $z\ge 6$, we find that bursty galaxies have specific star formation rate, sSFR $&gt;10^{-2}$ Myr$^{-1}$, and magnitude, $M_{\rm UV}\leq -17$. Most of them reside in haloes of mass $\sim 10^9$ M$_\odot$ and some in more massive haloes. We then construct the models of escape fraction and find that a skewed Gaussian function with a flat tail towards the high mass end best describes the mean dependence of escape fraction on halo mass, considering the haloes hosting bursty galaxies as the primary drivers of reionization. We implement the models of escape fraction in the code 21cmFAST to study the progress of reionization and derive the evolution of the mean ionized fraction that agrees well with observations. We also calculate the brightness temperature, spin temperature, and kinetic temperature and further study the spatial fluctuations in these quantities to gain insights into the progress of reionization. We compute the 21 cm power spectrum and predict a peak in power at $180$ MHz corresponding to redshift, $z\approx6.8$, that is testable by the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Our findings suggest that the Universe was reionized by the haloes of $\sim 10^{9}$ M$_\odot$, with haloes more massive than that also provided an essential contribution.</description>

      <title>A unified model for the clustering of quasars and galaxies at $z\approx6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the EIGER JWST program have measured for the first time the quasar-galaxy cross-correlation function at $z\approx6$. The auto-correlation function of faint $z\approx6$ quasars was also recently estimated. These measurements provide key insights into the properties of quasars and galaxies at high redshift and their relation with the host dark matter halos. In this work, we interpret these data building upon an empirical quasar population model that has been applied successfully to quasar clustering and demographic measurements at $z\approx2-4$. We make use of a new, large-volume N-body simulation with more than a trillion particles, FLAMINGO-10k, to model quasars and galaxies simultaneously. We successfully reproduce observations of $z\approx6$ quasars and galaxies (i.e., their clustering properties and luminosity functions), and infer key quantities such as their luminosity-halo mass relation, the mass function of their host halos, and their duty cycle/occupation fraction. Our key findings are: (i) quasars reside on average in $\approx10^{12.4}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ halos (corresponding to $\approx5\sigma$ fluctuations in the initial conditions of the linear density field), but the distribution of host halo masses is quite broad; (ii) the duty cycle of (UV-bright) quasar activity is relatively low ($\lesssim1\%$); (iii) galaxies (that are bright in [OIII]) live in much smaller halos ($\approx10^{10.9}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) and have a larger duty cycle (occupation fraction) of $\approx20\%$. Finally, we focus on the inferred properties of quasars and present a homogeneous analysis of their evolution with redshift. The picture that emerges reveals a strong evolution of the host halo mass and duty cycle of quasars at $z\approx2-6$, and calls for new investigations of the role of quasar activity across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Purity Lost: Perturbative and Resummed Late-Time Inflationary Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the rate with which unobserved fields decohere other fields to which they couple, both in flat space and in de Sitter space, for scalar fields prepared in their standard adiabatic vacuum. The process is very efficient in de Sitter space once the modes in question pass outside the Hubble scale, displaying the tell-tale phenomenon of secular growth that indicates the breakdown of perturbative methods on a time scale parameterically long compared with the Hubble time. We show how to match the perturbative evolution valid at early times onto a late-time Lindblad evolution whose domain of validity extends to much later times, thereby allowing a reliable resummation of the perturbative result beyond the perturbative regime. Super-Hubble modes turn out to be dominantly decohered by unobserved modes that are themselves also super-Hubble. When applied to curvature perturbations during inflation this observation closes a potential loophole in recent calculations of the late-time purity of the observable primordial fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Attention-Based Neural Network Emulators for Multi-Probe Data Vectors Part II: Assessing Tension Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of cosmological surveys is expected to generate unprecedented high-quality data, consequently increasing the already substantial computational costs of Bayesian statistical methods. This will pose a significant challenge to analyzing theoretical models of cosmology. Additionally, new mitigation techniques of baryonic effects, intrinsic alignment, and other systematic effects will inevitably introduce more parameters, slowing down the convergence of Bayesian analyses. In this scenario, machine-learning-based accelerators are a promising solution, capable of reducing the computational costs and execution time of such tools by order of thousands. Yet, they have not been able to provide accurate predictions over the wide prior ranges in parameter space adopted by Stage III/IV collaborations in studies employing real-space two-point correlation functions. This paper offers a leap in this direction by carefully investigating the modern transformer-based neural network (NN) architectures in realistic simulated Rubin Observatory year one cosmic shear $\Lambda$CDM inferences. Building on the framework introduced in Part I, we generalize the transformer block and incorporate additional layer types to develop a more versatile architecture. We present a scalable method to efficiently generate an extensive training dataset that significantly exceeds the scope of prior volumes considered in Part I, while still meeting strict accuracy standards. Through our meticulous architecture comparison and comprehensive hyperparameter optimization, we establish that the attention-based architecture performs an order of magnitude better in accuracy than widely adopted NN designs. Finally, we test and apply our emulators to calibrate tension metrics.</description>

Abstract: A critical discussion on the $H_0$ Hubble constant tension is presented by considering both early and late-type observations. From recent precise measurements, discrepancies emerge when comparing results for some cosmological quantities obtained at different redshifts. We highlight the most relevant measurements of $H_0$ and propose potential ideas to solve its tension. These solutions concern the exploration of new physics beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model or the evaluation of $H_0$ by other methods. In particular, we focus on the role of the look-back time.</description>

      <title>Comments Concerning a Hypothetical Mesoscopic Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by string-theoretic swampland conjectures, the existence of a dark fifth dimension, whose size is roughly 1 -- 10 microns, has been proposed. A great deal of supporting evidence has been presented, and definitive experimental tests are likely to be carried out. The basic idea is that the four-dimensional spacetime that we observe lives on a brane that is localized in the dark dimension. This short note points out that there are two distinct ways to realize such a scenario in string theory/M-theory. In the one considered previously the dark dimension is topologically a circle and our observable 4d spacetime is confined to a brane that is localized in a GUT-scale region of the circle. An alternative possibility is that the dark dimension is a line interval with branes attached at each end. This option would imply the existence of a parallel 4d spacetime microns away from us!</description>

Abstract: We discuss implications of the latest BICEP/Keck data release for inflationary models, with particular emphasis on scalar fields with non-canonical Lagrangians of the type ${\cal L} = X^\alpha - V(\phi)$. The observational upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r \leq 0.036$, implies that the whole family of monomial power law potentials $V(\phi) \sim \phi^p$ are now ruled out in the canonical framework at $95\%$ confidence, which includes the simplest classic inflationary potentials such as $\frac{1}{2}m^2 \phi^2$ and $\lambda \phi^4$. Instead, current observations strongly favour asymptotically flat plateau potentials. However, working in the non-canonical framework, we demonstrate that monomial potentials, as well as the Higgs potential with its Standard Model self-coupling, can easily be accommodated by current CMB data. We find striking similarities between the $\lbrace n_{_S}, r\rbrace$ flow lines of monomial potentials in the non-canonical framework and the T-model $\alpha$-attractors in the canonical framework. Significantly, $V(\phi)$ can originate from Planck scale initial values $V(\phi) \simeq m_p^4$ in non-canonical models while in plateau-like canonical inflation the initial value of the potential is strongly suppressed $V_{\rm plat}(\phi) \leq 10^{-10} m_p^4$. This has bearing on the issue of initial conditions for inflation and allows for the equipartition of the kinetic and potential terms in non-canonical models.</description>

      <title>Dwarf Galaxies United by Dark Bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00181v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low mass galaxies in the Local Group are dominated by dark matter and comprise the well studied ``dwarf Spheroidal" (dSph) class, with typical masses of $10^{9-10}M_\odot$ and also the equally numerous ``ultra faint dwarfs" (UFD), discovered recently, that are distinctly smaller and denser with masses of only $10^{7-8}M_\odot$. This bimodality amongst low mass galaxies contrasts with the scale free continuity expected for galaxies formed under gravity, as in the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model for heavy particles. Within each dwarf class we find the core radius $R_c$ is inversely related to velocity dispersion $\sigma$, quite the opposite of standard expectations, but indicative of dark matter in a Bose-Einstein state, where the Uncertainty Principle requires $R_c \times \sigma$ is fixed by Planks constant, $h$. The corresponding boson mass, $m_b=h/R_c \sigma$, differs by one order of magnitude between the UDF and dSph classes, with $10^{-21.4}$eV and $10^{-20.3}$eV respectively. Two boson species is reinforced by parallel relations seen between the central density and radius of UDF and dSph dwarfs respectively, each matching the steep prediction, $\rho_c \propto R_c^{-4}$, for soliton cores in the ground state. Furthermore, soliton cores accurately fit the stellar profiles of UDF and dSph dwarfs where prominent, dense cores appear surrounded by low density halos, as predicted by our simulations. Multiple bosons may point to a String Theory interpretation for dark matter, where a discrete mass spectrum of axions is generically predicted to span many decades in mass, offering a unifying "Axiverse" interpretation for the observed "diversity" of dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Hubble tension on the $r$-$n_s$ contour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The injection of early dark energy (EDE) before the recombination, a possible resolution of the Hubble tension, will not only shift the scalar spectral index $n_s$ towards $n_s=1$, but also be likely to tighten the current upper limit on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. In this work, with the latest CMB datasets (Planck PR4, ACT, SPT and BICEP/Keck), as well as BAO and SN, we confirm this result, and discuss its implication on inflation. We also show that if we happen to live with EDE, how the different inflation models currently allowed would be distinguished by planned CMB observations, such as CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD.</description>

      <title>Minkowski Functionals of Large-Scale Structure as a Probe of Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the potential of utilizing the four Minkowski functionals, which can fully describe the morphological properties of the large-scale structures, as a robust tool for investigating the modified gravity, particularly on non-linear and quasi-linear scales. With the assistance of the N-body simulation, we employ the Minkowski functionals to probe the Hu-Sawicki f(R) gravity model. The focus is on understanding the morphorlogical properties extracted by the Minkowski functionals and their sensitivity to modified gravity. Our analysis involves a comprehensive examination of the cosmic variance arising from finite simulation volumes. By systematically varying smoothing scales and redshifts, we quantify the information encoded in the Minkowski functionals measured from the dark-matter density field. The goal is to assess the capacity of the Minkowksi functionals to constrain the model and explore potential improvements through their combination. Additionally, we investigate the impact of using biased tracers such as dark matter halos and the halo occupation distribution galaxies on the modified gravity signatures within the Minkowksi functionals of the LSS. Furthermore, we evaluate the influence of the redshift space distortion on the observed results. In summary, our study suggests that the Minkowski functionals of the large-scale structures hold promise as a stringent tool for constraining modified gravity and offer valuable insights into the morphological features of the cosmic web.</description>

      <title>Improving Photometric Redshift Estimation for Cosmology with LSST using Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results exploring the role that probabilistic deep learning models can play in cosmology from large-scale astronomical surveys through photometric redshift (photo-z) estimation. Photo-z uncertainty estimates are critical for the science goals of upcoming large-scale surveys such as LSST, however common machine learning methods typically provide only point estimates and lack uncertainties on predictions. We turn to Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) as a promising way to provide accurate predictions of redshift values with uncertainty estimates. We have compiled a galaxy data set from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey with grizy photometry, which is designed to be a smaller scale version of large surveys like LSST. We use this data set to investigate the performance of a neural network (NN) and a probabilistic BNN for photo-z estimation and evaluate their performance with respect to LSST photo-z science requirements. We also examine the utility of photo-z uncertainties as a means to reduce catastrophic outlier estimates. The BNN outputs the estimate in the form of a Gaussian probability distribution. We use the mean and standard deviation as the redshift estimate and uncertainty. We find that the BNN can produce accurate uncertainties. Using a coverage test, we find excellent agreement with expectation -- 67.2$\%$ of galaxies between $0 &lt; 2.5$ have 1-$\sigma$ uncertainties that cover the spectroscopic value. We also include a comparison to alternative machine learning models using the same data. We find the BNN meets two out of three of the LSST photo-z science requirements in the range $0 &lt; z &lt; 2.5$.</description>

      <title>Testing Parity Symmetry with the Polarized Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New physics in the early Universe could lead to parity-violation in the late Universe, sourcing statistics whose sign changes under point reflection. The best constraints on such phenomena have come from the Planck temperature fluctuations; however, this is already cosmic-variance-limited down to relatively small scales, thus only small improvements are expected in the future. Here, we search for signatures of parity-violation in the polarized CMB, using the Planck PR4 $T$- and $E$-mode data. We perform both a simulation-based blind test for any parity-violating signal at $\ell&lt;518$, and a targeted search for primordial $U(1)$ gauge fields (and the amplitudes of a generic collapsed model) at $\ell&lt;2000$. In all cases, we find no evidence for new physics, with the model-independent test finding consistency with the FFP10/NPIPE simulation suite at $(-)0.4\sigma$, and the gauge field test constraining the fractional amplitude of gauge fields during inflation to be below $6\times 10^{-19}$ at $95\%$ confidence level for a fiducial model. The addition of polarization data can significantly improve the constraints, depending on the particular model of primordial physics, and the bounds will tighten significantly with the inclusion of smaller-scale information.</description>

      <title>Parity-violating scalar trispectrum from a rolling axion during inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a mechanism of generating the trispectrum (4-point correlation) of curvature perturbation through the dynamics of a spectator axion field and U(1) gauge field during inflation. Owing to the Chern-Simons coupling, only one helicity mode of gauge field experiences a tachyonic instability and sources scalar perturbations. Sourced curvature perturbation exhibits parity-violating nature which can be tested through its trispectrum. We numerically compute parity-even and parity-odd component of the sourced trispectrum. It is found that the ratio of parity-odd to parity-even mode can reach O(10%) in an exact equilateral momentum configuration. We also investigate a quasi-equilateral shape where only one of the momenta is slightly longer than the other three, and find that the parity-odd mode can reach, and more interestingly, surpass the parity-even one. This may help us to interpret a large parity-odd trispectrum signal extracted from BOSS galaxy-clustering data.</description>

      <title>Quasi-2D Weak Lensing Cosmological Constraints Using the PDF-SYM method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic shear statistics, such as the two-point correlation function (2PCF), can be evaluated with the PDF-SYM method instead of the traditional weighted-sum approach. It makes use of the full PDF information of the shear estimators, and does not require weightings on the shear estimators, which can in principle introduce additional systematic biases. This work presents our constraints on $S_8$ and $\Omega_m$ from the shear-shear correlations using the PDF-SYM method. The data we use is from the z-band images of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), which covers about 10000 deg$^2$ with more than 100 million galaxies. The shear catalog is produced by the Fourier\_Quad method, and well tested on the real data itself with the field-distortion effect. Our main approach is called quasi-2D as we do use the photo-$z$ information of each individual galaxy, but without dividing the galaxies into redshift bins. We mainly use galaxy pairs within the redshift interval between 0.2 and 1.3, and the angular range from $4.7$ to $180$ arcmin. Our analysis yields $S_8=0.762 \pm 0.026$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.234 \pm 0.075$, with the baryon effects and the intrinsic alignments included. The results are robust against redshift uncertainties. We check the consistency of our results by deriving the cosmological constraints from auto-correlations of $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ separately, and find that they are consistent with each other, but the constraints from the $\gamma_1$ component is much weaker than that from $\gamma_2$. It implies a much worse data quality of $\gamma_1$, which is likely due to additional shear uncertainties caused by CCD electronics (according to the survey strategy of DECaLS). We also perform a pure 2D analysis, which gives $S_8=0.81^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.25^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$. Our findings demonstrate the potential of the PDF-SYM method for precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Foreground removal with ILC methods for AliCPT-1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main goals of most future CMB experiments is the precise measurement of CMB B-mode polarization, whose major obstacle is the Galactic foregrounds. In this paper, we evaluate the foreground cleaning performance of the variants of the ILC method on partial sky B-modes and analyze the main sources of biases on the BB power spectrum. Specially, we compare the NILC, the cILC (in three domains) and the cMILC methods for AliCPT-1 simulations. We find that the cILC methods implemented in harmonic space and needlet space are both competent to clean different models of foregrounds, which bias the tensor-to-scalar ratio about 0.008 at maximum, and constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio to r&lt;0.043 (95%CL) for the AliCPT-1 configuration. We also note that the deviation of the estimated noise bias from the actual one for ILC, dubbed the noise bias error (NBE) in this paper, might make significant effects on the power spectrum for a small footprint and low signal-to-noise ratio CMB experiment. We finally obtain its relation with respect to the noise residual which fits well with the simulated results.</description>

      <title>Analytical Gaussian Process Cosmography: Unveiling Insights into Matter-Energy Density Parameter at Present</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel analytical Gaussian Process (GP) cosmography methodology, leveraging the differentiable properties of GPs to derive key cosmological quantities analytically. Our approach combines cosmic chronometer (CC) Hubble parameter data with growth rate (f) observations to constrain the $\Omega_{\rm m0}$ parameter, offering insights into the underlying dynamics of the Universe. By formulating a consistency relation independent of specific cosmological models, we analyze under a flat FLRW metric and first-order Newtonian perturbation theory framework. Our analytical approach simplifies the process of Gaussian Process regression (GPR), providing a more efficient means of handling large datasets while offering deeper interpretability of results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology by deriving precise constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m0}h^2$, revealing $\Omega_{\rm m0}h^2=0.139\pm0.017$. Moreover, leveraging $H_0$ observations, we further constrain $\Omega_{\rm m0}$, uncovering an inverse correlation between mean $H_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm m0}$. Our investigation offers a proof of concept for analytical GP cosmography, highlighting the advantages of analytical methods in cosmological parameter estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isocurvature fluctuations, where the relative number density of particle species spatially varies, can be generated from initially adiabatic, or curvature, fluctuations if the various species fall out of or were never in thermal equilibrium. The freezing of the thermal relic dark matter abundance is one such case, but for modes that are still outside the horizon the amplitude is highly suppressed and originates from the small change in the local expansion rate due to the local space curvature produced by the curvature fluctuation. We establish a simple separate-universe method for calculating this generation that applies to both freeze-in and freeze-out models, identify three critical epochs for this process, and give general scaling behaviors for the amplitude in each case: the freezing epoch, the kinetic decoupling epoch and matter-radiation equality. Freeze-out models are typically dominated by spatially modulated annihilation from the latter epochs and can generate much larger isocurvature fluctuations compared with typical freeze-in models, albeit still very small and observationally allowed by cosmic microwave background measurements. We illustrate these results with concrete models where the dark matter interactions are vector or scalar mediated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the dark matter of our Universe could be sterile neutrinos which reside within the twin sector of a mirror twin Higgs model. In our scenario, these particles are produced through a version of the Dodelson-Widrow mechanism that takes place entirely within the twin sector, yielding a dark matter candidate that is consistent with X-ray and gamma-ray line constraints. Furthermore, this scenario can naturally avoid the cosmological problems that are typically encountered in mirror twin Higgs models. In particular, if the sterile neutrinos in the Standard Model sector decay out of equilibrium, they can heat the Standard Model bath and reduce the contributions of the twin particles to $N_\mathrm{eff}$. Such decays also reduce the effective temperature of the dark matter, thereby relaxing constraints from large-scale structure. The sterile neutrinos included in this model are compatible with the seesaw mechanism for generating Standard Model neutrino masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a scenario where the scalaron of $f({\cal R})$ models is related to the volume modulus of string compactifications leaving only one scalar degree of freedom at low energy. The coefficient of the leading curvature squared contribution to the low energy effective action of gravity determines the mass of the scalaron. We impose that this mass is small enough to allow for the scalaron to drive Starobinski's inflation. After inflation, the renormalisation group evolution of the couplings of the $f({\cal R})$ theory, viewed as a scalar-tensor theory, provides the link with the Infra-Red regime. We consider a scenario where the corrections to the mass of the scalaron are large and reduce it below the electron mass in the Infra-Red, so that the scalaron plays a central role in the low energy dynamics of the Universe. In particular this leads to a connection between the scalaron mass and the measured vacuum energy provided its renormalisation group running at energies higher than the electron mass never drops below the present day value of the dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider gravitational production of singlet fermions such as sterile neutrinos during and after inflation. The production efficiency due to classical gravity is suppressed by the fermion mass. Quantum gravitational effects, on the other hand, are expected to break conformal invariance of the fermion sector by the Planck scale-suppressed operators irrespective of the mass. We find that such operators are very efficient in fermion production immediately after inflation, generating a significant background of stable or long-lived feebly interacting particles. This applies, in particular, to sterile neutrinos which can constitute cold non-thermal dark matter for a wide range of masses, including the keV scale.</description>

      <title>A Cosmological Bootstrap for Resonant Non-Gaussianity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress has revealed a number of constraints that cosmological correlators and the closely related field-theoretic wavefunction must obey as a consequence of unitarity, locality, causality and the choice of initial state. When combined with symmetries, namely homogeneity, isotropy and scale invariance, these constraints enable one to compute large classes of simple observables, an approach known as (boostless) cosmological bootstrap. Here we show that it is possible to relax the restriction of scale invariance, if one retains a discrete scaling subgroup. We find an infinite class of solutions to the weaker bootstrap constraints and show that they reproduce and extend resonant non-Gaussianity, which arises in well-motivated models such as axion monodromy inflation. We find no evidence of the new non-Gaussian shapes in the Planck data. Intriguingly, our results can be re-interpreted as a deformation of the scale-invariant case to include a complex order of the total energy pole, or more evocatively interactions with a complex number of derivatives. We also discuss for the first time IR-divergent resonant contributions and highlight an inconsequential inconsistency in the previous literature.</description>

Abstract: Massive fields can imprint unique oscillatory features on primordial correlation functions or inflationary correlators, which is dubbed the cosmological collider signal. In this work, we analytically investigate the effects of a time-dependent mass of a scalar field on inflationary correlators, extending previous numerical studies and implementing techniques developed in the cosmological bootstrap program. The time-dependent mass is in general induced by couplings to the slow-roll inflaton background, with particularly significant effects in the case of non-derivative couplings. By linearly approximating the time dependence, the mode function of the massive scalar is computed analytically, on which we derive analytic formulae for two-, three-, and four-point correlators with the tree-level exchange of the massive scalar. The obtained formulae are utilized to discuss the phenomenological impacts on the power spectrum and bispectrum, and it is found that the scaling behavior of the bispectrum in the squeezed configuration, i.e., the cosmological collider signal, is modified from a time-dependent Boltzmann suppression. By investigating the scaling behavior in detail, we are in principle able to determine the non-derivative couplings between the inflaton and the massive particle.</description>

      <title>Quantum loop corrections in the modified gravity model of Starobinsky inflation with primordial black hole production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A modified gravity model of Starobinsky inflation and primordial black hole production was proposed in good (within $1\sigma$) agreement with current measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The model is an extension of the singularity-free Appleby-Battye-Starobinsky model by the $R^4$-term with different values of the parameters whose fine-tuning leads to efficient production of primordial black holes on smaller scales with the asteroid-size masses between $10^{16}$ g and $10^{20}$ g. Those primordial black holes may be part (or the whole) of the current dark matter, while the proposed model can be confirmed or falsified by detection or absence of the induced gravitational waves with the frequencies about $10^{-2}$ Hz. The main purpose of this paper was to estimate the size of quantum (loop) corrections in the model. It was found their relative contribution to the power spectrum of scalar perturbations is about $10^{-3}$ or less, so that the model is not ruled out by the quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Can nonlocal gravity really explain dark energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In view to scrutinise the idea that nonlocal modifications of General Relativity could dynamically address the dark energy problem, we investigate the evolution of the Universe at infrared scales as an Infinite Derivative Gravity model of the Ricci scalar, without introducing the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ or any scalar field. The accelerated expansion of the late Universe is shown to be compatible with the emergence of nonlocal gravitational effects at sufficiently low energies. A technique for circumventing the mathematical complexity of the nonlocal cosmological equations is explained and, after drawing a connection with the Starobinsky gravity, verifiable predictions are considered, like a possible decreasing in the strength of the effective gravitational constant.</description>
