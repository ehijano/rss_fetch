      <title>Nonlinearly dispersive nature of Galerkin-regularization and longon turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With derivatives for physical insights and with mathematical analyses, technical variations and many applications though, the dynamical nature of Galerkin truncation in nonlinear systems is still not clear. Here, I show with such Galerkin-regularized Burgers-Hopf (GrBH) equation that the truncation corresponds to a nonlinear dispersion, supporting solitons and soliton-like structures (called "longons") and rhyming with recent expositions of dispersive objects. The formulation and scenarios resemble those of soliton turbulence, thus suggesting "longon turbulence" with large degree of freedoms (finite though). I also argue and numerically demonstrate that appropriate linearly dispersion models with an asymptotic large jump converge to the GrBH dynamics.</description>

      <title>Transitions near the onset of stationary rotating magnetoconvection: role of magnetic Prandtl number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the instabilities and associated bifurcation structure near the onset of rotating magnetoconvection of low Prandtl number fluids by performing three dimensional direct numerical simulations. Previous studies considered zero magnetic Prandtl number ($\mathrm{Pm}$) limit for the investigation of bifurcation structure near the onset of convection. Here we numerically investigate the effect of $\mathrm{Pm}$ on the bifurcation structure. The classical Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection setup in the presence of horizontal magnetic field and rotation about the vertical axis are considered for the study. The control parameters, including the Taylor number ($\mathrm{Ta}$), Chandrasekhar number ($\mathrm{Q}$), reduced Rayleigh number ($\mathrm{r}$), and magnetic Prandtl number ($\mathrm{Pm}$) are varied in the ranges $0 &lt; \mathrm{Ta}\leq 500$, $0 &lt; \mathrm{Q}\leq 1000$, $0.8\leq \mathrm{r} \leq 2$ and $0 &lt; \mathrm{Pm} &lt; 1$ by considering Prandtl numbers $\mathrm{Pr}= 0.025$ and $0.1$. The investigation reveals the presence of supercritical, subcritical and hybrid transitions to convection. These transitions leads to infinitesimal and finite amplitude fluid patterns at the onset of convection. The finite amplitude solutions can be both stationary and time dependent. The bifurcation structures associated with these flow patterns at the onset are studied in detail. For very small $\mathrm{Pm}$, the bifurcation structure is found to be qualitatively similar to the ones observed in the $\mathrm{Pm}\rightarrow 0$ limit. However, as $\mathrm{Pm}$ is increased, several new solutions appear at the onset and the resulting bifurcation structures are greatly modified.</description>

      <title>Scaling regimes of the one-dimensional phase turbulence in the deterministic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase turbulence of the one-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, in which the defect-free chaotic dynamics of the order parameter maps to a phase equation well approximated by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky model. In this regime, the behaviour of the large wavelength modes is captured by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, determining universal scaling and statistical properties. We present numerical evidence of the existence of an additional scale-invariant regime, with dynamical scaling exponent $z=1$, emerging at scales which are intermediate between the microscopic, intrinsic to the modulational instability, and the macroscopic ones. We argue that this new regime is a signature of the universality class corresponding to the inviscid limit of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.</description>
