      <title>The Impact of $\texttt{CLEAN}$ing on Strong Gravitational Lens Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparison of image and uv-plane galaxy-galaxy strong lensing modelling results for simulated ALMA observations with different antenna configurations and on-source integration times. Image-plane modelling is carried out via use of the $\texttt{CLEAN}$ algorithm, and we explore the effects of different visibility weighting schemes on the inferred lens model parameters. We find that direct modelling of the visibility data consistently outperforms image-plane modelling for both the naturally and Briggs-weighted images. We also find that the modelling of images created with Briggs weighting generally produces more accurate results than those obtained by modelling images constructed with natural weighting. We explain this by quantifying the suppression of information due to $\texttt{CLEAN}$ing on scales at which the modelling is sensitive, and how this differs between Briggs and natural weighting. At higher resolutions, the differences between the lens modelling techniques are much less pronounced and overall, modelling errors are significantly reduced. We also find that time-binning the visibilities by up to a factor of three makes no significant difference to the inferred lens parameters when directly modelling in the uv-plane. This work provides some guidance on navigating the many choices faced when modelling strong lens interferometric imaging data.</description>

      <title>The Local Group L-Band Survey: The First Measurements of Localized Cold Neutral Medium Properties in the Low-Metallicity Dwarf Galaxy NGC 6822</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the properties of the cold neutral medium (CNM) in low-metallicity galaxies provides insight into heating and cooling mechanisms in early Universe-like environments. We report detections of two localized atomic neutral hydrogen (HI) absorption features in NGC 6822, a low-metallicity (0.2 Z$_{\odot}$) dwarf galaxy in the Local Group. These are the first unambiguous CNM detections in a low-metallicity dwarf galaxy outside the Magellanic Clouds. The Local Group L-Band Survey (LGLBS) enabled these detections due to its high spatial (15 pc for HI emission) and spectral (0.4 \kms) resolution. We introduce LGLBS and describe a custom pipeline to search for HI absorption at high angular resolution and extract associated HI emission. A detailed Gaussian decomposition and radiative transfer analysis of the NGC 6822 detections reveals five CNM components, with key properties: a mean spin temperature of 32$\pm$6 K, a mean CNM column density of 3.1$\times$10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$, and CNM mass fractions of 0.33 and 0.12 for the two sightlines. Stacking non-detections does not reveal low-level signals below our median optical depth sensitivity of 0.05. One detection intercepts a star-forming region, with the HI absorption profile encompassing the CO (2$-$1) emission, indicating coincident molecular gas and a depression in high-resolution HI emission. We also analyze a nearby sightline with deep, narrow HI self-absorption dips, where the background warm neutral medium is attenuated by intervening CNM. The association of CNM, CO, and H$\alpha$ emissions suggests a close link between the colder, denser HI phase and star formation in NGC 6822.</description>

      <title>Chandra Survey in the AKARI North Ecliptic Pole Deep Field Optical/Infrared Identifications of X-ray Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of optical and infrared identifications (ID) of X-ray sources in the AKARI North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Deep field detected with Chandra covering $\sim 0.34\,{\rm deg^{2}}$ with 0.5-2 keV flux limits ranging $\sim 2 \mathrm{-} 20\times 10^{-16}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$. The optical/near-infrared counterparts of the X-ray sources are taken from our Hyper Suprime Cam (HSC)/Subaru and Wide-Field InfraRed Camera (WIRCam)/Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) data because these have much more accurate source positions due to their spatial resolution than that of {Chandra} and longer wavelength infrared data. We concentrate our identifications in the HSC $g$ band and WIRCam $K_{\rm s}$ band-based catalogs. To select the best counterpart, we utilize a novel extension of the likelihood-ratio (LR) analysis, where we use the X-ray flux as well as $g - K_{\rm s}$ colors to calculate the likelihood ratio. Spectroscopic and photometric redshifts of the counterparts are summarized. Also, simple X-ray spectroscopy is made on the sources with sufficient source counts.
  We present the resulting catalog in an electronic form. The main ID catalog contains 403 X-ray sources and includes X-ray fluxes, luminosities, $g$ and $K_{\rm s}$ band magnitudes, redshifts, and their sources, optical spectroscopic properties, as well as intrinsic absorption column densities and power-law indices from simple X-ray spectroscopy. The identified X-ray sources include 27 Milky-Way objects, 57 type I AGNs, 131 other AGNs, and 15 galaxies. The catalog serves as a basis for further investigations of the properties of the X-ray and near-infrared sources in this field. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Unveiling the purely young star formation history of the SMC's northeastern shell from colour-magnitude diagram fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a quantitative star formation history (SFH) of a shell-like structure ('shell') located in the northeastern part of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We use the Survey of the MAgellanic Stellar History (SMASH) to derive colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), reaching below the oldest main-sequence turnoff, from which we compute the SFHs with CMD fitting techniques. We present, for the first time, a novel technique that uses red clump (RC) stars from the CMDs to assess and account for the SMC's line-of-sight depth effect present during the SFH derivation. We find that accounting for this effect recovers a more accurate SFH. We quantify a 7 kpc line-of-sight depth present in the CMDs, in good agreement with depth estimates from RC stars in the northeastern SMC. By isolating the stellar content of the northeastern shell and incorporating the line-of-sight depth into our calculations, we obtain an unprecedentedly detailed SFH. We find that the northeastern shell is primarily composed of stars younger than 500 Myrs, with significant star formation enhancements around 250 Myr and 450 Myr. These young stars are the main contributors to the shell's structure. We show synchronicity between the northeastern shell's SFH with the Large Magellanic Cloud's (LMC) northern arm, which we attribute to the interaction history of the SMC with the LMC and the Milky Way (MW) over the past 500 Myr. Our results highlight the complex interplay of ram pressure stripping and the influence of the MW's circumgalactic medium in shaping the SMC's northeastern shell.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Massive Black Hole Merger Host Galaxies from Cosmological Simulations II: Unique Stellar Kinematics in Integral Field Unit Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure methods for identifying the host galaxies of individual massive black hole (MBH) binaries and mergers detected by gravitational wave experiments such as LISA and Pulsar Timing Arrays are currently lacking, but will be critical to a variety of science goals. Recently in Bardati et al. (2024, Paper I), we used the Romulus25 cosmological simulation to show that MBH merger host galaxies have unique morphologies in imaging, due to their stronger bulges. Here, we use the same sample of simulated MBH merger host galaxies to investigate their stellar kinematics, as probed by optical integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy. We perform stellar population synthesis and dust radiative transfer to generate synthetic 3D optical spectral datacubes of each simulated galaxy, and produce mock stellar kinematic maps. Based on a linear discriminant analysis of a combination of kinematic parameters derived from these maps, we show that this approach can identify MBH binary and merger host galaxies with accuracies that increase with chirp mass and mass ratio. For mergers with high chirp masses (&gt;10^8.2 Msun) and high mass ratios (&gt;0.5), the accuracies reach &gt;85%, and their host galaxies are uniquely characterized by slower rotation and stronger stellar kinematic misalignments. These kinematic properties are commonly associated with massive early-type galaxies that have experienced major mergers, and naturally act as signposts for MBH binaries and mergers with high chirp masses and mass ratios. These results suggest that IFU spectroscopy should also play a role in telescope follow-up of future MBH binaries and mergers detected in gravitational waves</description>

      <title>The stable "Unstable Natural Media" due to the presence of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The term "unstable neutral media" (UNM) has traditionally been used to describe the transient phase formed between the warm and cold neutral hydrogen (HI) phases and has not been the focus of HI studies. However, recent observations suggest that the UNM phase not only has a significantly longer-than-expected lifetime but also occupies at least 20\% to 40\% of both the volume and mass fraction of HI. In this paper, we argue that the existence and dominance of the UNM can be explained by the presence of strong turbulence using an energy balance argument. The mass fraction of UNM is directly proportional to the turbulent velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$: mass fraction of UNM $\propto \sigma_v^{\frac{2n}{1+n}}$, where $n$ is the absolute value of the adiabatic index in the unstable phase. We discuss the implications of long-lived unstable thermal phases on ISM physics, including cold dense filament formation, cosmic ray acceleration, and measurement of galactic foreground statistics.</description>

      <title>The interstellar medium conditions of a strong Lya emitter at z = 8.279 revealed by JWST: a robust LyC leaker candidate at the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making use of JWST NIRSpec and NIRCam data, we conduct a detailed analysis of the spectroscopic and photometric properties of GN-z8-LAE, a strong Lya emitter at z=8.279. Our goal is to investigate the interstellar medium (ISM) physical conditions that enable the Lya detection in this source at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and scrutinize GN-z8-LAE as an early reionizer. In broad agreement with previous results, we find that GN-z8-LAE is a young galaxy (age ~ 10 Myr) with a low stellar mass (M* ~ 10^7.66 Msun), significantly lower than those of most Lya emitters known at similarly high redshifts. The derived stellar mass and star formation rate surface densities are 355 Msun/pc^2 and 88 Msun/yr/kpc^2, respectively. Our spectral analysis indicates that: the Lya line peak has a small velocity offset 133+-72 km/s with respect to the galaxy systemic redshift; CIV] / CIII] ~ 3.3; the ISM is characterized by a hard ionization field, although no signature of AGN is present. Moreover, we report the presence of NIII]1750 emission with super-solar N abundance, which makes GN-z8-LAE one of the first known cases of a simultaneous strong Lya and nitrogen emitter at the EoR. Based on all these properties, we apply a wide range of methods to constrain the absolute Lyman continuum escape fraction of GN-z8-LAE, and find that it is &gt;14% in all cases. Therefore, we conclude that GN-z8-LAE is a robust candidate for a Lyman continuum (LyC) leaker at the EoR which is being caught at the moment of efficiently reionizing its surrounding medium.</description>

      <title>Towards a universal analytical model for Population III star formation: interplay between feedback and fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has brought us new insights into Cosmic Dawn with tentative detection of the unique signatures of metal-free Population III (Pop III) stars, such as strong HeII emission, extremely blue UV spectrum, and enhanced nitrogen abundance. Self-consistent theoretical predictions of the formation rates, sites, and masses of Pop III stars are crucial for interpreting the observations, but are challenging due to complex physical processes operating over the large range of length scales involved. One solution is to combine analytical models for the small-scale star formation process with cosmological simulations that capture the large-scale physics such as structure formation, radiation backgrounds, and baryon-dark matter streaming motion that regulate the conditions of Pop III star formation. We build an analytical model to predict the final masses of Pop III stars/clusters from the properties of star-forming clouds, based on the key results of small-scale star formation simulations and stellar evolution models. Our model for the first time considers the interplay between feedback and fragmentation and covers different modes of Pop III star formation ranging from ordinary small ($\sim 10-2000\ \rm M_\odot$) clusters in molecular-cooling clouds to massive ($\gtrsim 10^{4}\ \rm M_\odot$) clusters containing supermassive ($\sim 10^{4}-3\times 10^{5}\ \rm M_\odot$) stars under violent collapse of atomic-cooling clouds. As an example, the model is applied to the Pop III star-forming clouds in the progenitors of typical haloes hosting high-$z$ luminous quasars, which shows that formation of Pop III massive clusters is common ($\sim 20-70\%$) in such biased ($\sim4\sigma$) regions, and the resulting heavy black hole seeds from supermassive stars can account for a significant fraction of observed luminous ($\gtrsim 10^{46}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$) quasars at $z\sim 6$.</description>

      <title>Star Formation in Extreme Environments: A 200 pc High Velocity Gas Stream in the Galactic Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expanding molecular ring (EMR) manifests itself as a parallelogram in the position-velocity diagram of spectral line emission from the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) surrounding the Galacic centre (GC). Using multiwavelength data, we investigate the gas kinematics, star formation activity, and the presence of shocked gas in a 200 pc long high velocity gas stream (V~ +150 km/s) with a double helix morphology named the helix stream, that is located 15-55 pc above the CMZ and is kinematically associated with the EMR/parallelogram. We carried out molecular line observations using the IRAM 30m, Yebes 40m, and APEX 12m telescopes. The detection of four rotational transitions of the SiO molecule indicate the presence of shocks. We derived the SiO column densities and abundances in different regions of the helix stream. The presence of protostellar clumps and a candidate HII region signify the ongoing star formation activity within the helix stream. The cloud is massive (2.5x10^6 M_sun) and highly turbulent. We find evidence of cloud-cloud collisions towards the eastern edge (l~1.3{\deg}), suggesting a dynamic interaction with the CMZ. An expanding shell is detected within the cloud with radius of 6.7 pc and an expansion velocity of 35 km/s. The shell might be powered by several supernovae or a single hypernova. The SiO abundance within the helix stream implies extensive shock processes occurring on large scales. The helical or cork-screw velocity structure of the helix stream indicates twisting and turning motions within the cloud. We propose that the helix stream is the continuation of the near side bar lane, that is overshooting after brushing the CMZ. Our findings carry profound implications for understanding star formation in extreme conditions and elucidate the intricate properties of gas and dust associated with nuclear inflows in barred spiral galaxies.</description>

      <title>The FAST HI 21-cm absorption blind survey. II -- statistic exploration for associated and intervening systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extragalactic HI 21-cm absorption lines catalog from a blind search at z $\leq$ 0.35, using drift-scan data collected in 1616.9 hours by the ongoing Commensal Radio Astronomy FasT Survey (CRAFTS) and FAST All Sky HI Survey (FASHI), which spans a sky area of 7456.8 deg$^{2}$ and covers 84,533 radio sources with a flux density greater than 12 mJy. 14 previously identified HI absorbers and 20 newly discovered HI absorbers were detected, comprising 14 associated systems, 11 intervening systems, and 9 systems with undetermined classifications. We fit HI profiles with multi-component Gaussian functions and calculate the redshift, width, flux density, optical depth, and HI column densities for each source. Through spectral stacking, the mean peak optical path, mean velocity-integrated optical path $\langle \tau\rangle$, mean FWHM and mean HI column density $\langle$ N$_{HI}\rangle$ are measured to be 0.46 and 0.34; 25.85 km/s and 4.62 km/s; 39.80 km/s and 8.95 km/s; 0.470 and 0.085 T$_{s} \times$ 10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$, for the associated and intervening samples, respectively. Statistical analysis also reveals that associated systems tend to be hosted by red (g$-$r$&gt;$0.7) galaxies at lower redshifts, whereas galaxies hosting intervening HI absorption are typically found at higher redshifts and are of a bluer (g$-$r$\leq$0.7) type. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that associated HI 21-cm absorptions connected to compact radio sources display higher N$_{HI}$ values compared to those linked with extended radio sources.</description>

      <title>Hyenas: X-ray Bubbles and Cavities in the Intra-Group Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the Simba feedback model on the structure of the Intra-Group Medium (IGrM) in the new Hyenas suite of cutting-edge cosmological zoom-in simulations. Using 34 high-resolution zooms of halos spanning from $10^{13}-10^{14}$ $M_\odot$ at $z=0.286$, we follow halos for 700 Myr, over several major active galactic nuclei (AGN) jet feedback events. We use the MOXHA package to generate mock Chandra X-ray observations, as well as predictive mocks for the upcoming LEM mission, identifying many feedback-generated features such as cavities, shock-fronts, and hot-spots, closely mimicking real observations. Our sample comprises $105$ snapshots with identified cavities, $50$ with single bubbles and $55$ with two, and spans three orders of magnitude in observed cavity enthalpies, from $10^{41}-10^{44}$ erg/s. Comparing semi-major axis length, midpoint radius, and eccentricity to a matched sample of observations, we find good agreement in cavity dimensions with real catalogues. We estimate cavity power from our mock maps following observational procedures, showing that this is typically more than enough to offset halo cooling, particularly in low-mass halos, where we match the observed excess in energy relative to cooling. Bubble enthalpy as measured with the usual midpoint pressure typically exceeds the energy released by the most recent jet event, hinting that the mechanical work is done predominantly at a lower pressure against the IGrM. We demonstrate for the first time that X-ray cavities are observable in a modern large-scale simulation suite and discuss the use of realistic cavity mock observations as new halo-scale constraints on feedback models in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>The $K_s$-band luminosity function of the rich cluster VC04 in the Vela supercluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To learn more about the properties of the Vela Supercluster (VSCL) located behind the Milky Way at $cz\sim 18000$~km~s$^{-1}$, we determined the $K_s$-band Luminosity Function (LF) of VC04, the richest known galaxy cluster in the VSCL, and two other VSCL clusters (VC02 and VC08). The galaxy sample is based on NIR observations which are complete to an extinction-corrected absolute magnitude of $M_{Ks}^o&lt;-21.5$ mag ($\sim 2.5$ mag below $M_K^*$), within the clustercentric radius of $r_c&lt;1.5~$Mpc ($\sim 70 \%$ of the Abell radius). For VC04 we obtained 90 new spectroscopic redshifts of galaxies observed with the 11-m Southern African Large Telescope. We found the Schechter parameters of the VC04 LF to be $M^*=-24.41\pm 0.44$ mag, $\alpha=-1.10\pm 0.20$ and $\phi^*=8.84\pm 0.20$. Both the redshift data and the LF confirm VC04 to be a rich, not yet fully relaxed cluster. We independently determined the LF of VC04 on membership defined by the Red-Sequence method and demonstrated that this method can be used in the absence of high spectroscopic coverage over a cluster. This allowed us to determine the LFs of VC02 and VC08. We also derived the LFs of the Coma, Norma and Virgo clusters to similar depth and extent as the VSCL clusters. We found that the Schechter parameters of VC04 are within $1\sigma$ uncertainties of these local clusters, as well as VC02 and VC08. We do not find significant differences between the LFs in the different cluster environments probed in this work down to $M_K^*+2.5$ mag.</description>

      <title>Low [O/Fe] Ratio in a Luminous Galaxy at the Early Cosmic Epoch ($z&gt;10$): Signature of Short Delay Time or Bright Hypernovae/Pair-Instability Supernovae?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an [O/Fe] ratio of a luminous galaxy GN-z11 at $z=10.60$ derived with the deep public JWST/NIRSpec data. We fit the medium-resolution grating data with the model spectra consisting of BPASS-stellar and CLOUDY-nebular spectra in the rest-frame UV wavelength ranges with Fe absorption lines, carefully masking out the other emission and absorption lines in the same manner as previous studies conducted for lower redshift ($z\sim 2-6$) galaxies with oxygen abundance measurements. We obtain an Fe-rich abundance ratio $\mathrm{[O/Fe]}=-0.39^{+0.59}_{-0.36}$ that is confirmed with the independent deep prism data as well as by the classic 1978 index method. This [O/Fe] measurement is lower than that at $z\sim 2-3$ and comparable with those at $z\sim 6$. Because $z=10.60$ is an early epoch after the Big Bang ($\sim 430$ Myr) and the first star formation (likely $\sim 200$ Myr), there is a difficulty in efficiently producing Fe by Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) requiring sufficient delay time for white-dwarf formation and gas accretion. The Fe-rich abundance ratio in GN-z11 suggests that the delay time is short, or that the major Fe enrichment is not accomplished by SNeIa but bright hypernovae (BrHNe) and/or pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), where the yield models of BrHNe and PISNe explain Fe, Ne, and O abundance ratios of GN-z11. The [O/Fe] measurement is not too low to rule out the connection between GN-z11 and globular clusters (GCs) previously suggested by the nitrogen abundance, but rather confirms the connection with a GC population at high [N/O] if a metal dilution process exists.</description>

      <title>Stellar substructures in the Galactic disc and halo: Properties, origins and evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial, kinematic and orbital properties, along with ages and chemical compositions of the thin disc, thick disc and various stellar substructures present in the halo, are studied based on data from the LAMOST and Gaia surveys. The star formation in the Galactic thin and thick disc, with peak metallicities of $-0.20$ and $-0.45$ dex, is found to have peaked about 5.5 and 12.5 Gyr ago, respectively. The thin disc is also found to have experienced an initial star formation burst about 12.5 Gyr ago. The pro-grade population Splash and hot-disc (HD), with peak metallicity of about $-0.60$ and $-0.43$, are found to be about 13.03 and 12.21 Gyr old, respectively, with peak eccentricity of 0.70 and 0.35, are understood to be of in situ origin. The Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage (GE/S), Thamnos and Sequoia, with peak metallicity of about $-1.31$, $-1.36$ and $-1.56$, are found to be about 11.66, 12.89 and 12.18 Gyr, respectively, and are understood to be remnants of dwarf galaxies merged with the Milky Way. The HD, Splash, and Thamnos are found to have experienced chemical evolution similar to the thick disc while GE/S, Sequoia, and Helmi stream are found to have experienced distinct chemical enrichment of iron and $\alpha$-elements.</description>

      <title>Turbulence, Thermal Pressure, and Their Dynamical Effects on Cosmic Baryonic Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the IllustrisTNG simulation data to investigate the turbulent and thermal motions of the cosmic baryonic fluid. With continuous wavelet transform techniques, we define the pressure spectra, or density-weighted velocity power spectra, as well as the spectral ratios, for both turbulent and thermal motions. We find that the magnitude of the turbulent pressure spectrum grows slightly from $z=4$ to $2$ and increases significantly from $z=2$ to $1$ at large scales, suggesting progressive turbulence injection into the cosmic fluid, whereas from $z=1$ to $0$, the spectrum remains nearly constant, indicating that turbulence may be balanced by energy transfer and dissipation. The magnitude of the turbulent pressure spectra also increases with environmental density, with the highest density regions showing a turbulent pressure up to six times that of thermal pressure. We also explore the dynamical effects of turbulence and thermal motions, discovering that while thermal pressure provides support against structure collapse, turbulent pressure almost counteracts this support, challenging the common belief that turbulent pressure supports gas against overcooling.</description>

      <title>A mm and near-IR study of YSOs: from outbursting protostars to satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are in a golden era observing Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), protoplanetary disks, and substellar objects, crucial for understanding their formation and evolution. This Ph.D. thesis explores two binary systems.
  Firstly, we study an eruptive YSO, HBC 494, using ALMA band 6 (1.3 mm) observations. It's a FUor system in Orion Molecular Cloud with a resolved binary system: HBC 494 N (primary) and HBC 494 S (secondary) separated by 75 au. The disks show hints of aligned formation scenarios, with HBC 494 N being brighter and larger. Molecular line observations reveal bipolar outflows and rotating envelopes. Cavity features within the continuum disks' area suggest continuum over-subtraction or slow-moving jets and chemical destruction along the line-of-sight.
  Secondly, we examine the young binary system $\eta$ Tel using VLT/SPHERE H band imaging. It consists of an A-type star and a brown dwarf companion $\eta$ Tel B, separated by 208 au. Astrometric measurements over 19 years yield a low eccentric orbit with an inclination of 81.9 degrees. The mass of $\eta$ Tel B is determined to be 48 M$_{Jup}$, consistent with previous literature. No significant residual indicative of a satellite or disk surrounding the companion is detected, with limits ruling out massive objects around $\eta$ Tel B at separations down to 33 au with masses as low as 1.6M$_{Jup}$.
  These studies employ sub-mm to near-IR observations, highlighting the complexity of (sub)stellar formation/evolution. This thesis contributes diverse analyses, providing insights into these intriguing processes.</description>

      <title>Evolution of stars with 60 and 200 Msun: predictions for WNh stars in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the evolution of two massive stars at solar metallicity (Z=0.014) taken from Romagnolo et al. (2024, Paper I); by running evolution models for initial masses 60 and 200 Msun, using MESA and GENEC. For the mass loss, we adopt the self-consistent m-CAK prescription for the optically thin winds of OB-stars, a semi-empirical formula for H-rich thick wind of WNh stars, and a hydrodynamically consistent formula for the H-poor thick wind of classical Wolf-Rayet stars. We set initial rotation as 40% of the critical angular velocity, overshooting =0.5, Tayler-Spruit for the angular momentum transport, and Ledoux criterion for the convective layers. Both codes predict different tracks across the HRD. For the 60 Msun case, Genec models predict a more efficient rotational mixing and more chemically homogeneous evolution, whereas MESA model predicts a large radial expansion post-MS reaching the LBV phase. For the 200 Msun case, differences are less relevant because their evolution is dominated by wind mass loss with a weaker dependence on internal mixing, and only the treatment for superadiabacity creates an impact during the He-burning stage. The switch of the mass loss based on the proximity to the Eddington factor instead of the removal of outer layers, implies the existence of WNh stars with a large mass fraction of hydrogen at the surface formed from initial masses $\gtrsim60$ Msun. These stars are constrained in a Teff range of the HR diagram which corresponds to the MS band, in agreement with the observations of Galactic WNh stars. While our models employ a fixed $\Gamma_e$ threshold for the switch to thick winds, rather than a continuous thin-to-thick wind model, the good reproduction of observations supports the robustness of the wind model upgrades introduced in Paper I, allowing its application to studies of late-stage stellar evolution before core collapse.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive stars at low metallicity VII. Stellar and wind properties of B supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. B supergiants (BSGs) represent an important connection between the main sequence and more extreme evolutionary stages of massive stars. Additionally, lying toward the cool end of the hot star regime, determining their wind properties is crucial to constrain the evolution and feedback of massive stars as, for instance, they might manifest the bi-stability jump phenomenon. Aims. We undertake a detailed analysis of a representative sample of 18 Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) BSGs within the ULLYSES and XShootU datasets. Our UV and optical analysis spans BSGs from B0 to B8 - covering the bi-stability jump region. We aim to evaluate their evolutionary status and verify what their wind properties say about the bi-stability jump in a low-metallicity environment. Methods. We used the CMFGEN to model the spectra and photometry (from UV to infrared) of our sample. We compare our results with different evolutionary models, with previous determinations in the literature of OB stars, and with diverging mass-loss recipes at the bi-stability jump. Additionally, we provide the first BSG models in the SMC including X-rays. Results. (i) Within a single-stellar evolution framework, the evolutionary status of early BSGs seem less clear than that of late BSGs, which agree with H-shell burning models. (ii) UV analysis shows evidence that BSGs contain X-rays in their atmospheres, for which we provide constraints. In general, we find higher X-ray luminosity (close to the standard log(L_X/L) ~ -7) for early BSGs. For cooler BSGs, lower values are preferred, log(L_X/L) ~ -8.5. (iii) The obtained mass-loss rates suggest neither a jump nor a monotonic decrease with temperature. Instead, a rather constant trend is observed, which is at odds with the increase found for Galactic BSGs. (iv) The wind velocity behavior with temperature shows a sharp drop at ~19 kK, similar to what is observed for Galactic BSGs.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution, we aim to summarise the efforts of the Italian SKA scientific community in conducting surveys of star-forming regions within our Galaxy, in the development of astrochemical research on protostellar envelopes and disks, and in studying the planet formation process itself. The objective is dual: Firstly, to investigate the accumulation and development of dust throughout the formation of planets, and secondly, to chemically examine protoplanetary disks and protostellar envelopes by studying heavy molecules, such as chains and rings containing over seven carbon atoms, which exhibit significantly reduced strength at millimeter wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Outflow Driven by a Protoplanet Embedded in the TW Hya Disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gas giant planets are formed by gas accretion onto planetary cores in protoplanetary disks. However, direct evidence of this process is still lacking, limiting our understanding of planetary formation processes. During mass accretion, planet-driven outflows may be launched, which could be observable by shock tracers such as sulfur monoxide (SO). We report the detection of SO gas in the protoplanetary disk around TW Hya in archival Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. The $\rm SO\ J=8_7 - 7_6\ $ emission line is detected at a $6\sigma$ significance and localized to the southeast region of the disk with an arc-like morphology. The line center is red-shifted with respect to the systemic velocity by $\sim5\ \rm km\ s^{-1}$. The starting point of the SO emission is located at a planet-carved dust gap at $42$ au. We attribute this to an outflow driven by an embedded protoplanet. Indeed, the observed morphology is well reproduced by a ballistic outflow model. The outflow velocity suggests that the outflow launching source has a mass of $\sim 4 M_\oplus\ (0.012 M_{\rm Jup})$ and the mass-loss rate is $3\times10^{-8} - 1\times10^{-6}\ M_{\rm Jup}\ {\rm yr^{-1}}$. With the relation of mass-loss and mass-accretion rates established for protostars, we estimated the mass-accretion rate onto the protoplanet to be $3\times10^{-7} - 1\times10^{-5}\ M_{\rm Jup}\ {\rm yr^{-1}}$, which matches theoretical predictions for a $\sim 4 M_\oplus$ planet at this separation. The detection of planet-driven outflow provides us a unique opportunity to directly probe the earliest phase of gas giant planet formation.</description>

      <title>PAC.V. The Roles of Mass and Environment in the Quenching of Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The roles that mass and environment play in the galaxy quenching are still under debate. Leveraging the Photometric objects Around Cosmic webs (PAC) method, we analyze the excess surface distribution $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}(r_{\rm{p}})$ of photometric galaxies in different color (rest-frame $u-r$) within the stellar mass range of $10^{9.0}M_{\odot}\sim10^{11.0}M_{\odot}$ around spectroscopic massive central galaxies ($10^{10.9}\sim10^{11.7}M_{\odot}$) at the redshift interval $0&lt;z_s&lt;0.7$, utilizing data from the Hyper SuprimeCam Subaru Strategic Program and the spectroscopic samples of Slogan Digital Sky Survey (i.e. Main, LOWZ and CMASS samples). We find that both mass and environment quenching contribute to the evolution of companion galaxies. To isolate the environment effect, we quantify the quenched fraction excess (QFE) of companion galaxies encircling massive central galaxies within $0.01h^{-1}{\rm{Mpc}}&lt;r_{\rm{p}}&lt;20h^{-1}\rm{Mpc}$, representing the surplus quenched fraction relative to the average. We find that the high density halo environment affects the star formation quenching up to about three times of the virial radius, and this effect becomes stronger at lower redshift. We also find that even after being scaled by the virial radius, the environment quenching efficiency is higher for more massive halos or for companion galaxies of higher stellar mass, though the trends are quite weak. We present a fitting formula that comprehensively captures the QFE across central and companion stellar mass bins, halo-centric distance bins, and redshift bins, offering a valuable tool for constraining galaxy formation models. Furthermore, we have made a quantitative comparison with Illustris-TNG that underscores some important differences, particularly in the excessive quenching of low-mass companion galaxies ($&lt;10^{9.5}M_{\odot}$) by TNG.</description>

Abstract: We involve the galactic halo observational data to test the weak field General Relativity involving the cosmological constant. Using the data for 15 hydrogen (Hi) VLA super spirals and the Tully-Fisher relation we obtain constraints for each galaxy. The results are consistent with previous results for spiral galaxies, as well as with the scaling relations for the halos, thus confirming the efficiency of the use of dark halo data and Tully-Fisher relation, including the baryonic Tully{Fisher index (BTFR), for testing modified gravity models.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen Abundance Distribution in the inner Milky Way</title>

Abstract: We combine a new Galactic plane survey of Hydrogen Radio Recombination Lines (RRLs) with far-infrared (FIR) surveys of ionized Nitrogen, N+, to determine Nitrogen abundance across Galactic radius. RRLs were observed with NASA DSS-43 70m antenna and the Green Bank Telescope in 108 lines-of-sight spanning -135 degrees &lt; l &lt; 60 degrees, at b=0 degrees. These positions were also observed in [N II] 122 um and 205 um lines with the Herschel Space Observatory. Combining RRL and [N II] 122 um and 205 um observations in 41 of 108 samples with high signal-to-noise ratio, we studied ionized Nitrogen abundance distribution across Galactocentric distances of 0-8 kpc. Combined with existing Solar neighborhood and Outer galaxy N/H abundance determinations, we studied this quantity's distribution within the Milky Way's inner 17 kpc for the first time. We found a Nitrogen abundance gradient extending from Galactocentric radii of 4-17 kpc in the Galactic plane, while within 0-4 kpc, the N/H distribution remained flat. The gradient observed at large Galactocentric distances supports inside-out galaxy growth with the additional steepening resulting from variable star formation efficiency and/or radial flows in the Galactic disk, while the inner 4 kpc flattening, coinciding with the Galactic bar's onset, may be linked to radial flows induced by the bar potential. Using SOFIA/FIFI-LS and Herschel/PACS, we observed the [N III] 57 um line to trace doubly ionized gas contribution in a sub-sample of sightlines. We found negligible N++ contributions along these sightlines, suggesting mostly singly ionized Nitrogen originating from low ionization H II region outskirts.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on the MRI driven dynamo in a stratified shearing box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) driven dynamo in a geometrically thin disc ($H/R\ll 1$) using stratified zero net flux (ZNF) shearing box simulations. We find that mean fields and EMFs oscillate with a primary frequency $f_{\rm dyn} = 0.017$ ($\approx 9$ orbital period), but also have higher harmonics at $3f_{\rm dyn}$. Correspondingly, the current helicity, has two frequencies $2f_{\rm dyn}$ and $4f_{\rm dyn}$ respectively, which appear to be the beat frequencies of mean fields and EMFs as expected from the magnetic helicity density evolution equation. Further, we adopt a novel inversion algorithm called the `Iterative Removal Of Sources' (IROS), to extract the turbulent dynamo coefficients in the mean-field closure using the mean magnetic fields and EMFs obtained from the shearing box simulation. We show that an $\alpha-$effect ($\alpha_{yy}$) is predominantly responsible for the creation of the poloidal field from the toroidal field, while shear generates back a toroidal field from the poloidal field; indicating that an $\alpha-\Omega$-type dynamo is operative in MRI-driven accretion discs. We also find that both strong outflow ($\bar{v}_z$) and turbulent pumping ($\gamma_z$ ) transport mean fields away from the mid-plane. Instead of turbulent diffusivity, they are the principal sink terms in the mean magnetic energy evolution equation. We find encouraging evidence that a generative helicity flux is responsible for the effective $\alpha$-effect. Finally, we point out potential limitations of horizontal ($x-y$) averaging in defining the `mean' on the extraction of dynamo coefficients and their physical interpretations.</description>

Abstract: The 21-cm spectral line widths, $w_{50}$, of galaxies are an approximate tracer of their dynamical masses, such that the dark matter halo mass function is imprinted in the number density of galaxies as a function of $w_{50}$. Correcting observed number counts for survey incompleteness at the level of accuracy needed to place competitive constraints on warm dark matter (WDM) cosmological models is very challenging, but forward-modelling the results of cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations into observational data space is more straightforward. We take this approach to make predictions for an ALFALFA-like survey from simulations using the EAGLE galaxy formation model in both cold (CDM) and WDM cosmogonies. We find that for WDM cosmogonies more galaxies are detected at the low-$w_{50}$ end of the 21-cm velocity width function than in the CDM cosmogony, contrary to what might na\"ively be expected from the suppression of power on small scales in such models. This is because low-mass galaxies form later and retain more gas in WDM cosmogonies (with EAGLE). While some shortcomings in the treatment of cold gas in the EAGLE model preclude placing definitive constraints on WDM scenarios, our analysis illustrates that near-future simulations with more accurate modelling of cold gas will likely make strong constraints possible, especially in conjunction with new 21-cm surveys such as WALLABY.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Multi-line Intensity Mapping</title>

Abstract: Line intensity mapping (LIM) has emerged as a promising tool for probing the 3D large-scale structure through the aggregate emission of spectral lines. The presence of interloper lines poses a crucial challenge in extracting the signal from the target line in LIM. In this work, we introduce a novel method for LIM analysis that simultaneously extracts line signals from multiple spectral lines, utilizing the covariance of native LIM data elements defined in the spectral--angular space. We leverage correlated information from different lines to perform joint inference on all lines simultaneously, employing a Bayesian analysis framework. We present the formalism, demonstrate our technique with a mock survey setup resembling the SPHEREx deep field observation, and consider four spectral lines within the SPHEREx spectral coverage in the near infrared: H$\alpha$, $[$\ion{O}{3}$]$, H$\beta$, and $[$\ion{O}{2}$]$. We demonstrate that our method can extract the power spectrum of all four lines at the $\gtrsim 10\sigma$ level at $z&lt;2$. For the brightest line, H$\alpha$, the $10\sigma$ sensitivity can be achieved out to $z\sim3$. Our technique offers a flexible framework for LIM analysis, enabling simultaneous inference of signals from multiple line emissions while accommodating diverse modeling constraints and parameterizations.</description>

      <title>Ticking away: the long-term X-ray timing and spectral evolution of eRO-QPE2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17020</link>

Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are repeated X-ray flares from galactic nuclei. Despite some diversity in the recurrence and amplitude of eruptions, their striking regularity has motivated theorists to associate QPEs with orbital systems. Among the known QPE sources, eRO-QPE2 has shown the most regular flare timing and luminosity since its discovery. We report here on its long-term evolution over $\sim3.3\,$yr from discovery and find that: i) the average QPE recurrence time per epoch has decreased over time, albeit not at a uniform rate; ii) the distinct alternation between consecutive long and short recurrence times found at discovery has not been significant since; iii) the spectral properties, namely flux and temperature of both eruptions and quiescence components, have remained remarkably consistent within uncertainties. We attempted to interpret these results as orbital period and eccentricity decay coupled with orbital and disk precession. However, since gaps between observations are too long, we are not able to distinguish between an evolution dominated by just a decreasing trend, or by large modulations (e.g. due to the precession frequencies at play). In the former case, the observed period decrease is roughly consistent with that of a star losing orbital energy due to hydrodynamic gas drag from disk collisions, although the related eccentricity decay is too fast and additional modulations have to contribute too. In the latter case, no conclusive remarks are possible on the orbital evolution and the nature of the orbiter due to the many effects at play. However, these two cases come with distinctive predictions for future X-ray data: in the former, we expect all future observations to show a shorter recurrence time than the latest epoch, while in the latter we expect some future observations to be found with a larger recurrence, hence an apparent temporary period increase.</description>
