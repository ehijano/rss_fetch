      <title>Bridging Superconductors with UN Development Goals: Perspectives and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductors exhibit remarkable properties such as zero resistivity and diamagnetism at the boiling temperature of liquid hydrogen (20 K) and even aboven the boiling temperature of liquid nitrogen (77 K), making them promising candidates for various applications including electrical engines, energy generation, storage, and high-tech devices like single photon detectors. In this overview, we explore the correlation between ceramic superconductors and the United Nations (UN) Development Goals, emphasizing their potential impact on sustainable development. Through bibliometric analysis, we underscore the significance of ceramic superconductors in addressing global challenges outlined by the UN. Additionally, we discuss the application of supermagnets and second-generation tapes in healthcare systems, particularly in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices for diagnostic imaging. Electric superconducting motors offer a clean alternative to highly polluting diesel engines in maritime transportation and superconducting wires/cables enable effective transport of energy on large scale as well as in industrial structures. Magnetic levitation technology holds promise for developing zero-emission public transportation systems, and magnetic separation with strong magnets will contribute to solve the microplastic pollution. The combination of superconductivity with the planned hydrogen economy further offers new possibilities to bring superconductivity to common applications. At the nanoscale, superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) enable real-time monitoring of environmental health, exemplified by applications in plant physiology, and superconducting qubits provide the best-engineered structures for quantum computers. However it is still crordwork to works with superconductors UN develepoment goals.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and modeling the influence of geometry on the performance of superconducting nanowire cryotrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling of superconducting nanowire-based devices to larger arrays is often limited by the cabling required to interface with each device. Cryogenic integrated circuits constructed from nanowire cryotrons, or nanocryotrons, can address this limitation by performing signal processing on chip. In this study, we characterize key performance metrics of the nanocryotron to elucidate its potential as a logical element in cryogenic integrated circuits and develop an electro-thermal model to connect material parameters with device performance. We find that the performance of the nanocryotron depends significantly on the device geometry, and trade-offs are associated with optimizing the gain, jitter, and energy dissipation. We demonstrate that nanocryotrons fabricated on niobium nitride can achieve a grey zone less than 210 nA wide for a 5 ns long input pulse corresponding to a maximum achievable gain of 48 dB, an energy dissipation of less than 20 aJ per operation, and a jitter of less than 60 ps.</description>

      <title>Gate-controlled superconducting switch in GaSe/NbSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for low-power devices is on the rise as semiconductor engineering approaches the quantum limit and quantum computing continues to advance. Two-dimensional (2D) superconductors, thanks to their rich physical properties, hold significant promise for both fundamental physics and potential applications in superconducting integrated circuits and quantum computation. Here, we report a gate-controlled superconducting switch in GaSe/NbSe$_2$ van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure. By injecting high-energy electrons into NbSe$_2$ under an electric field, a non-equilibrium state is induced, resulting in significant modulation of the superconducting properties. Owing to the intrinsic polarization of ferroelectric GaSe, a much steeper subthreshold slope and asymmetric modulation are achieved, which is beneficial to the device performance. Based on these results, a superconducting switch is realized that can reversibly and controllably switch between the superconducting and normal state under an electric field. Our findings highlight a significant high-energy injection effect from band engineering in 2D vdW heterostructures combining superconductors and ferroelectric semiconductors, and demonstrate the potential applications for superconducting integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Evolution of dissipative regimes in atomically thin $\text{Bi}_{2}\text{Sr}_{2}\text{CaCu}_{2}\text{O}_{8+x}$ superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric transport has been widely used to study Abrikosov vortex dynamics in unconventional superconductors. However, only a few thermoelectric studies have been conducted near the dimensional crossover that occurs when the vortex-vortex interaction length scale becomes comparable to the sample size. Here we report the effects of finite size on the dissipation mechanisms of the Nernst effect in the optimally doped $\text{Bi}_{2}\text{Sr}_{2}\text{CaCu}_{2}\text{O}_{8+x}$ high-temperature superconductor, down to the atomic length limit. To access this regime, we develop a new generation of thermoelectric chips based on silicon nitride microprinted circuit boards. These chips ensure optimized signals while preventing sample deterioration. Our results demonstrate that lateral confinement at the nanoscale can effectively reduce vortex dissipation. Investigating vortex dissipation at the micro- and nano-scale is essential for creating stable, miniaturized superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Nuclear Magnetism at Ultralow and Zero Field using SQUIDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetism underpins areas such as medicine in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hyperpolarization of nuclei enhances the quantity and quality of information that can be determined from these techniques by increasing their signal to noise ratios by orders of magnitude. However, some of these hyperpolarization techniques rely on the use of low to ultralow magnetic fields (ULF) (nTs-mTs), where empirical data on how nuclear magnetism behaves is lacking. The broadband character and ultrasensitive field sensitivity of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) allow for probing nuclear magnetism at these fields, where other magnetometers, such as Faraday coils and flux gates do not. To this end, we designed a hyperpolarization reactor to hyperpolarize [1-$^{13}$C]pyruvate with the technique, signal amplification by reversible exchange in shield enables alignment transfer to heteronuclei (SABRE-SHEATH). Afterwards, we were able to characterize the field sensitivity of our setup by simulating the filled reactor in relation to its placement in our ultralow noise, ULF MRI setup. Using the results of the simulations, we determined that our hyperpolarization setup results in a $^{13}$C polarization of 0.4%, a signal enhancement of ~100 000 000 versus the predicted thermal equilibrium signal at earth field (~50 $\mu$T). This results in a $^{13}$C signal of 7.44$\pm$0.91 pT, which with our ultralow noise setup, opens the possibility for the first direct detection of nuclear magnetism without system perturbation.</description>

      <title>Electric Control of Polarity in Spin-Orbit Josephson Diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect (JDE), characterized by a unidirectional supercurrent across a Josephson junction, arises from non-reciprocal critical currents typically controlled by magnetic fields. In this study, we demonstrate JDE controlled by local electric fields, achieving complete polarity reversal through gate voltages on epitaxial Al-InAs Josephson junctions. Our observations reveal intricate effects of in-plane magnetic fields and gate voltages on the JDE. We develop a theoretical model that considers the coherent interplay between finite Cooper-pair momentum (fCPM) and anisotropic spin-orbit coupling (SOC), identifying that fCPM dominates JDE at low in-plane magnetic fields, while SOC governs its polarity reversal at high fields. This model aligns well with experimental data, illustrating precise electric control of JDE polarity through anisotropic SOC. These findings introduce a novel approach to controlling superconducting circuits, paving a route toward advanced applications in superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Theory of Pressure Dependence of Superconductivity in Bilayer Nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent experiment shows the superconducting transition temperature in the Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ decreases monotonically with increasing pressure above 14 GPa. In order to unravel the underlying mechanism for this unusual dependence, we performed theoretical investigations by combining the density functional theory (DFT) and the unbiased functional renormalization group (FRG). Our DFT calculations show that the Fermi pockets are essentially unchanged with increasing pressure (above 14 GPa), but the bandwidth is enlarged, and particularly the interlayer hopping integral between the nickel $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals is enhanced. From the DFT band structure, we construct the bilayer tight-binding model in terms of the nickel $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. On this basis, we investigate the superconductivity induced by correlation effects by FRG calculations. We find consistently $s_\pm$-wave pairing triggered by spin fluctuations, but the latter are weakened by pressure and lead to a decreasing transition temperature versus pressure, in qualitatively agreement with the experiment. We emphasize that the itinerancy of the $d$-orbitals is important and captured naturally in our FRG calculations, and we argue that the unusual pressure dependence would be unnatural, if not impossible, in the otherwise local-moment picture of the nickel $d$-orbitals. This sheds lights on the pertinent microscopic description of, and more importantly the mechanism of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and charge-density-wave in the Holstein model on the Penrose Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exotic quantum states emerging in the quasicrystal (QC) have attracted extensive interest because of various properties absent in the crystal. In this paper, we systematically study the Holstein model at half filling on a prototypical structure of QC, namely rhombic Penrose lattice, aiming at investigating the superconductivity (SC) and other intertwined ordering arising from the interplay between quasiperiodicity and electron-phonon ({\it e}-ph) interaction. Through unbiased sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal the salient features of the ground-state phase diagram. Distinct from the results on bipartite periodic lattices at half filling, SC is dominant in a large parameter regime on the Penrose lattice. When {\it e}-ph coupling is sufficiently strong, charge-density-wave order appears and strongly suppresses the SC. The strongest SC emerges at intermediate {\it e}-ph coupling strength and pronounced pairing fluctuation exists above the SC transition temperature. The strong pairing originates from the cooperative effects of unique lattice structure and macroscopically degenerate confined states at Fermi energy which uniquely exist on the Penrose lattice. Moreover, we demonstrate the forbidden ladders substantially suppress the phase coherence of SC. Our unbiased numerical results suggest that Penrose lattice is a potential platform to realize strong SC pairing, providing a promising avenue to searching for relatively high-$T_c$ SC dominantly induced by {\it e}-ph coupling.</description>

      <title>Optical conductivity of the Majorana mode at the s- and d-wave topological superconductor edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Majorana fermion offers fascinating possibilities such as non-Abelian statistics and non-local robust qubits, and hunting it is one of the most important topics in current condensed matter physics. Most of the efforts have been focused on the Majorana bound state at zero energy in terms of scanning tunneling spectroscopy searching for the quantized conductance. On the other hand, a chiral Majorana edge channel appears at the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator when engineering an interface between proximity-induced superconductivity and ferromagnetism. Recent advances in microwave spectroscopy of topological edge states open a new avenue for observing signatures of such Majorana edge states through the local optical conductivity. As a guide to future experiments, we show how the local optical conductivity and density of states present distinct qualitative features depending on the symmetry of the superconductivity, that can be tuned via the magnetization and temperature. In particular, the presence of the Majorana edge state leads to a characteristic non-monotonic temperature dependence achieved by tuning the magnetization.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a multi-band BCS free energy functional and prove that for a multi-band superconductor the effect of inter-band coupling can only increase the critical temperature, irrespective of its attractive or repulsive nature and its strength. Further, for weak coupling and weaker inter-band coupling, we prove that the dependence of the increase in critical temperature on the inter-band coupling is (1) linear, if there are two or more equally strongly superconducting bands, or (2) quadratic, if there is only one dominating band.</description>

      <title>Spin-Dependent Signatures of Majorana Vortex Fusion within Planar Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic characteristics and tunnelling signatures of a planar Josephson junction with Rashba spin-orbit coupling during the fusion of two Majorana vortices. By employing the topological phase diagram and conducting tight-binding simulations of the proposed device, we demonstrate that this fusion process induces a parity-dependent magnetic moment aligned with the junction axis. We further propose a method to probe the spin properties of the fusing Majorana zero modes through spin-resolved Andreev conductance measurements at the junction endpoints. To support our findings, we derive a low-energy effective Hamiltonian that provides a detailed microscopic description of the numerically observed phenomena. Our analysis enables the detection of Majorana fusion outcome from accessible spin current measurements, thus paving the way for future experimental verification and potential applications in topological quantum computation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a mechanism to produce superconductivity by strong purely-repulsive interactions, say in multi-layer graphene. The resulting superconductors break both time-reversal and reflection symmetries in the orbital motion of electrons, and exhibit non-trivial topological order. Our findings suggest that this topological chiral superconductivity is more likely to emerge near or between fully spin-valley polarized metallic phase and Wigner crystal phase. Unlike conventional BCS superconductors in fully spin-valley polarized metals, these topological chiral superconductors are only partially spin-valley polarized, even though the neighboring normal state remains fully spin-valley polarized. The ratios of electron densities associated with different spin-valley quantum numbers are quantized as simple rational numbers. Furthermore, many of these topological chiral superconductors exhibit charge-4 or higher condensation. One of the topological chiral superconductors is in the same phase as the "spin"-triplet $p+ \textrm{i} p$ BCS superconductor, while others are in different phases than any BCS superconductors. The same mechanism is also used to produce anyon superconductivity between fractional anomalous quantum Hall states in the presence of a periodic potential.</description>

Abstract: Cooper pairs formed by two electrons with different effective masses are common in multiband superconductors, pair density wave states, and other superconducting systems with multiple degrees of freedom. In this paper, we show that there are paramagnetic contributions to the superfluid stiffness in superconductors with different-mass Cooper pairs. This paramagnetic response is owing to the relative motion between two electrons with different mass. Additionally, we identify a particle-hole dichotomy effect related to this mass difference. We investigate the paramagnetic contributions based on the linear-response theory in two-band superconductors with interband pairings and in pair density wave states, respectively. Our results offer a different perspective of the electromagnetic superfluid stiffness in unconventional superconductors beyond the traditional BCS response.</description>

      <title>Influence of capacitance and thermal fluctuations on the Josephson diode effect in asymmetric higher-harmonic SQUIDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymmetric two-junction SQUIDs with different current-phase relations in the two Josephson junctions, involving higher Josephson harmonics, demonstrate a flux-tunable Josephson diode effect (asymmetry between currents flowing in the opposite directions, which can be tuned by the magnetic flux through the interferometer loop). We theoretically investigate influence of junction capacitance and thermal fluctuations on performance of such Josephson diodes. Our main focus is on the "minimal model" with one junction in the SQUID loop possessing the sinusoidal current-phase relation and the other one featuring additional second harmonic. Capacitance generally weakens the diode effect in the resistive branch (R state) of the current-voltage characteristic (CVC) both in the absence and in the presence of external ac irradiation. At the same time, it leads to qualitatively new features of the Josephson diode effect such as asymmetry of the retrapping currents (which are a manifestation of hysteretic CVC). In particular, the limiting case of the single-sided hysteresis becomes accessible. In its turn, thermal fluctuations are known to lead to nonzero average voltages at any finite current, even below the critical value. We demonstrate that in the diode regime, the fluctuation-induced voltage can become strongly (exponentially) asymmetric. In addition, we find asymmetry of the switching currents arising both due to thermal activation and due to Josephson plasma resonances in the presence of ac irradiation.</description>

Abstract: The Josephson diode effect (JDE), characterized by asymmetric critical currents in a Josephson junction, has drawn considerable attention in the field of condensed matter physics. We investigate the conditions under which JDE can manifest in a one-dimensional Josephson junction composed of a spin-orbit-coupled quantum wire with an applied Zeeman field, connected between two superconductors. Our study reveals that while spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and a Zeeman field in the quantum wire are not sufficient to induce JDE when the superconductors are purely singlet, the introduction of triplet pairing in the superconductors leads to the emergence of JDE. This finding highlights the potential of JDE as a probe for triplet superconductivity. We further demonstrate that even in absence of SOC in the quantum wire, JDE can arise when the directions of the triplet pairing and the Zeeman field are non-collinear, provided the superconductors exhibit mixed singlet-triplet pairing. Additionally, we identify specific conditions under which JDE is absent, namely, when the pairing is purely triplet and the directions of the SOC and the triplet pairing are perpendicular. Our findings indicate that JDE is always accompanied by anomalous Josephson effect. The diode effect coefficient is found to oscillate with variations in the chemical potential of the quantum wire, driven by Fabry-P\'erot interference effects. Our results suggest that quantum wires connected across superconductors could serve as effective platforms for probing triplet superconductivity through the observation of JDE.</description>

      <title>Quest for nuclear quadrupole relaxation in HgCa$_{2}$Ba$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{\delta}$</title>

Abstract: We derived a simple reduced form from the exact solution of the mixed magnetic and quadrupolar nuclear spin-lattice relaxation function at the central transition line of a quadrupole-split NMR spectrum for nuclear spin $I$ = 3/2. From the application of the reduced form to the $^{63}$Cu nuclear spin-lattice relaxation curves in the high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductors of $^{63}$Cu-enriched triple-layer HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{\delta}$, we estimated the nuclear electric quadrupole spin-lattice relaxation rate $^{63}W_Q$ and the upper limit.</description>
