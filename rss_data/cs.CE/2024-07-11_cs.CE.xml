      <title>Bayesian uncertainty analysis for underwater 3D reconstruction with neural radiance fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are a deep learning technique that can generate novel views of 3D scenes using sparse 2D images from different viewing directions and camera poses. As an extension of conventional NeRFs in underwater environment, where light can get absorbed and scattered by water, SeaThru-NeRF was proposed to separate the clean appearance and geometric structure of underwater scene from the effects of the scattering medium. Since the quality of the appearance and structure of underwater scenes is crucial for downstream tasks such as underwater infrastructure inspection, the reliability of the 3D reconstruction model should be considered and evaluated. Nonetheless, owing to the lack of ability to quantify uncertainty in 3D reconstruction of underwater scenes under natural ambient illumination, the practical deployment of NeRFs in unmanned autonomous underwater navigation is limited. To address this issue, we introduce a spatial perturbation field D_omega based on Bayes' rays in SeaThru-NeRF and perform Laplace approximation to obtain a Gaussian distribution N(0,Sigma) of the parameters omega, where the diagonal elements of Sigma correspond to the uncertainty at each spatial location. We also employ a simple thresholding method to remove artifacts from the rendered results of underwater scenes. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.</description>

      <title>MBD-NODE: Physics-informed data-driven modeling and simulation of constrained multibody systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a framework that can integrate prior physical information, e.g., the presence of kinematic constraints, to support data-driven simulation in multi-body dynamics. Unlike other approaches, e.g., Fully-connected Neural Network (FCNN) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based methods that are used to model the system states directly, the proposed approach embraces a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) paradigm that models the derivatives of the system states. A central part of the proposed methodology is its capacity to learn the multibody system dynamics from prior physical knowledge and constraints combined with data inputs. This learning process is facilitated by a constrained optimization approach, which ensures that physical laws and system constraints are accounted for in the simulation process. The models, data, and code for this work are publicly available as open source at https://github.com/uwsbel/sbel-reproducibility/tree/master/2024/MNODE-code.</description>

      <title>FAR-Trans: An Investment Dataset for Financial Asset Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial asset recommendation (FAR) is a sub-domain of recommender systems which identifies useful financial securities for investors, with the expectation that they will invest capital on the recommended assets. FAR solutions analyse and learn from multiple data sources, including time series pricing data, customer profile information and expectations, as well as past investments. However, most models have been developed over proprietary datasets, making a comparison over a common benchmark impossible. In this paper, we aim to solve this problem by introducing FAR-Trans, the first public dataset for FAR, containing pricing information and retail investor transactions acquired from a large European financial institution. We also provide a bench-marking comparison between eleven FAR algorithms over the data for use as future baselines. The dataset can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.5525/gla.researchdata.1658 .</description>

      <title>DeepOKAN: Deep Operator Network Based on Kolmogorov Arnold Networks for Mechanics Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modern digital engineering design often requires costly repeated simulations for different scenarios. The prediction capability of neural networks (NNs) makes them suitable surrogates for providing design insights. However, only a few NNs can efficiently handle complex engineering scenario predictions. We introduce a new version of the neural operators called DeepOKAN, which utilizes Kolmogorov Arnold networks (KANs) rather than the conventional neural network architectures. Our DeepOKAN uses Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs) rather than the B-splines. RBFs offer good approximation properties and are typically computationally fast. The KAN architecture, combined with RBFs, allows DeepOKANs to represent better intricate relationships between input parameters and output fields, resulting in more accurate predictions across various mechanics problems. Specifically, we evaluate DeepOKAN's performance on several mechanics problems, including 1D sinusoidal waves, 2D orthotropic elasticity, and transient Poisson's problem, consistently achieving lower training losses and more accurate predictions compared to traditional DeepONets. This approach should pave the way for further improving the performance of neural operators.</description>

      <title>Not feeling the buzz: Correction study of mispricing and inefficiency in online sportsbooks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01740v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a replication and correction of a recent article (Ramirez, P., Reade, J.J., Singleton, C., Betting on a buzz: Mispricing and inefficiency in online sportsbooks, International Journal of Forecasting, 39:3, 2023, pp. 1413-1423, doi: 10.1016/j.ijforecast.2022.07.011). RRS measure profile page views on Wikipedia to generate a "buzz factor" metric for tennis players and show that it can be used to form a profitable gambling strategy by predicting bookmaker mispricing. Here, we use the same dataset as RRS to reproduce their results exactly, thus confirming the robustness of their mispricing claim. However, we discover that the published betting results are significantly affected by a single bet (the "Hercog" bet), which returns substantial outlier profits based on erroneously long odds. When this data quality issue is resolved, the majority of reported profits disappear and only one strategy, which bets on "competitive" matches, remains significantly profitable in the original out-of-sample period. While one profitable strategy offers weaker support than the original study, it still provides an indication that market inefficiencies may exist, as originally claimed by RRS. As an extension, we continue backtesting after 2020 on a cleaned dataset. Results show that (a) the "competitive" strategy generates no further profits, potentially suggesting markets have become more efficient, and (b) model coefficients estimated over this more recent period are no longer reliable predictors of bookmaker mispricing. We present this work as a case study demonstrating the importance of replication studies in sports forecasting, and the necessity to clean data. We open-source release comprehensive datasets and code.</description>

      <title>Using iterated local alignment to aggregate trajectory data into a traffic flow map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Desire line maps are widely deployed for traffic flow analysis by virtue of their ease of interpretation and computation. They can be considered to be simplified traffic flow maps, whereas the computational challenges in aggregating small scale traffic flows prevent the wider dissemination of high resolution flow maps. Vehicle trajectories are a promising data source to solve this challenging problem. The solution begins with the alignment (or map matching) of the trajectories to the road network. However even the state-of-the-art map matching implementations produce sub-optimal results with small misalignments. While these misalignments are negligible for large scale flow aggregation in desire line maps, they pose substantial obstacles for small scale flow aggregation in high resolution maps. To remove these remaining misalignments, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. With each local alignment iteration, the misalignments of the trajectories with each other and with the road network are reduced, and so converge closer to a minimal flow map. By analysing a set of empirical trajectories collected in Hannover, Germany, we confirm that our minimal flow map has high levels of spatial resolution, accuracy and coverage.</description>
