      <title>Utilizando o captador de guitarra como sensor: Construindo um kit para abordar a Lei de Faraday em sala de aula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approach to the concept of electromagnetic induction in physics education can present challenges, particularly regarding its distance from students' everyday experiences. The functioning of an electric guitar pickup can serve as an interesting example to contextualize the topic, allowing students to understand the correlation between the variation in magnetic field flux and the induced electromotive force. This study aims to present a low-cost project to explore Faraday's Law of Induction through an experimental kit composed mainly of an electric guitar pickup, an electric motor with a speed controller, a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensor, and permanent magnets.</description>

      <title>Pengaruh Model Pembelajaran Generatif Berbantuan Media Mind Mapping terhadap Kompetensi Fisika Siswa Kelas XI MIA SMAN 1 Painan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the generative teaching model assisted by mind mapping media in terms of the physics competencies of class XI Science students of Senior High School 1 Painan. This study is a quasi-experimental type. The population for the study was all class XI students of Senior High School 1 Painan. Purposive sampling technique was used for sampling. The research samples were Class A and Class B. The instrument used was an objective question sheet. The t-test was used to analyze the data, and the significance level was 0.05. The study showed a significant difference between classes that implemented the generative teaching model assisted by mind mapping media and classes that implemented the teaching model commonly used by teachers through the help of mind mapping media. The average student learning score for classes using the generative teaching model was 79.20, and the average student learning score for classes using the teaching model commonly used by educators was 76.15. The impact of the generative teaching model assisted by mind mapping media was seen in the results of the student learning process, which were analyzed and the hypothesis was tested. Based on the hypothesis test, the t table was 1.09 and the t count was 2.00. The condition for H0 to be rejected is if ttable lest than tcount. The t count value is in the rejection of H0. Because all variables are controlled, except for the learning process model, it can be achieved. The conclusion is that the application of the generative teaching model assisted by mind mapping media on the Dynamics of Motion material contributes a positive influence to student learning outcomes.</description>
