      <title>Quantum Circuits for SU(3) Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories in varying dimensions, lattice volumes, and truncations offer a rich family of targets for Hamiltonian simulation on quantum devices. In return, formulating quantum simulations can provide new ways of thinking about the quantum structure of gauge theories. In this work, we consider pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory in two and three spatial dimensions in a streamlined version of the electric basis. We use a formulation of the theory that balances locality of the Hamiltonian and size of the gauge-invariant state space, and we classically pre-compute dictionaries of plaquette operator matrix elements for use in circuit construction. We build circuits for simulating time evolution on arbitrary lattice volumes, spanning circuits suitable for NISQ era hardware to future fault-tolerant devices. Relative to spin models, time evolution in lattice gauge theories involves more complex local unitaries, and the Hilbert space of all quantum registers may have large unphysical subspaces. Based on these features, we develop general, volume-scalable tools for optimizing circuit depth, including pruning and fusion algorithms for collections of large multi-controlled unitaries. We describe scalings of quantum resources needed to simulate larger circuits and some directions for future algorithmic development.</description>

      <title>Can we determine the exact size of the nucleon?: A comprehensive study of different radii</title>

Abstract: The concept of nucleon radii plays a central role in our understanding of the internal structure of protons and neutrons, providing critical insights into the non-perturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). While the charge radius is often interpreted as the ``size" of the nucleon, this interpretation is an oversimplification that overlooks the multifaceted nature of nucleon structure. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the different nucleon radii, including the charge and magnetic radii, the axial radius, and the emerging concepts of mechanical and mass radii. We discuss the definitions as well as the experimental, theoretical and phenomenological determinations of these radii, highlighting their distinct physical origins and implications. By synthesizing recent experimental results and theoretical advancements, we emphasize that each radius reflects a specific aspect of the nucleon's internal structure, such as its electric charge distribution, magnetic properties, weak interactions, or internal mechanical stress. In particular, we address the common but misleading interpretation of the proton radius as a simple measure of its size, underscoring the nuanced and context-dependent nature of nucleon radii. Through this exploration, we aim to clarify the roles of these radii in characterizing nucleon structure and to identify open questions that remain to be addressed. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the nucleon and its significance in the broader context of particle and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Generative Samplers for Investigating Critical Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08918v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating critical phenomena or phase transitions is of high interest in physics and chemistry, for which Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, a crucial tool for numerically analyzing macroscopic properties of given systems, are often hindered by an emerging divergence of correlation length -- known as scale invariance at criticality (SIC) in the renormalization group theory. SIC causes the system to behave the same at any length scale, from which many existing sampling methods suffer: long-range correlations cause critical slowing down in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and require intractably large receptive fields for generative samplers. In this paper, we propose a Renormalization-informed Generative Critical Sampler (RiGCS) -- a novel sampler specialized for near-critical systems, where SIC is leveraged as an advantage rather than a nuisance. Specifically, RiGCS builds on MultiLevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) with Heat Bath (HB) algorithms, which perform ancestral sampling from low-resolution to high-resolution lattice configurations with site-wise-independent conditional HB sampling. Although MLMC-HB is highly efficient under exact SIC, it suffers from a low acceptance rate under slight SIC violation. Notably, SIC violation always occurs in finite-size systems, and may induce long-range and higher-order interactions in the renormalized distributions, which are not considered by independent HB samplers. RiGCS enhances MLMC-HB by replacing a part of the conditional HB sampler with generative models that capture those residual interactions and improve the sampling efficiency. Our experiments show that the effective sample size of RiGCS is a few orders of magnitude higher than state-of-the-art generative model baselines in sampling configurations for 128x128 two-dimensional Ising systems.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors and mechanical properties of the nucleon in a meson dominance approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the gravitational form factors and mechanical properties of the nucleon, focusing on both some general issues as well as on modeling with meson dominance. We show that the lattice QCD results for the nucleon gravitational form factors at $m_\pi=170$~MeV, available for space-like momentum transfer squared up to 2GeV, are explained in a natural way within the meson dominance approach. We carry out the proper Raman spin decomposition of the energy-momentum tensor and in each spin channel use a minimum number of resonances consistent with the perturbative QCD short-distance constraints. These constraints are related to the super-convergence sum rules, following from the asymptotic perturbative QCD fall-off of the form factors. The value of the nucleon $D$-term following from the fits is -3.0(4). Next, we obtain the two-dimensional transverse gravitational densities of the nucleon in the transverse coordinate $b$. With the super-convergence sum rules, we derive new sum rules for these densities at the origin and for their derivatives, involving logarithmic weighting in the corresponding spectral density integrals. From analysis of the threshold behavior in the time-like region and the properties of the $\pi\pi \to N\bar{N}$ reaction, we infer the behavior of the transverse densities at asymptotically large coordinates. We also carry out the meson dominance analysis of the two- and three-dimensional mechanical properties of the nucleon (the pressure and stress) and explore their connection to the spectral densities via dispersion relations.</description>

      <title>Triply charmed baryons mass decomposition from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first calculation of the connected scalar matrix element and the momentum fraction of charm quark within the$\frac{3}{2}^{+}$ and $\frac{3}{2}^{-}$triply charmed baryons on lattice QCD. The results are based on overlap valence fermions on two ensembles of $N_f=2+1$ domain wall fermion configurations with two lattice spacings. The corresponding sea quark pion masses are $300$ MeV and $278$ MeV. The separated contributions to the triply charmed baryon mass are derived through the decomposition of the QCD energy-momentum tensor. The contribution of the connected charm quark matrix element to the triply charmed baryon is about 3/2 times that of the charmonium. And it contributes almost 70% of the total mass. The mass splitting of $\frac{3}{2}^{+}$ and $\frac{3}{2}^{-}$triply charmed baryons is mainly from $\langle H_{E}\rangle$ of the QCD energy-momentum tensor. A mass decomposition from the quark model is also studied for comparison.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Potential of the Polyakov Loop in SU(3) Quenched Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using SU(3) lattice QCD, we study for the first time the effective potential of the Polyakov loop $\langle P \rangle$ at finite temperature, i.e., the thermodynamic potential, in the field-theoretical way. In the framework of the reweighting method in lattice QCD, we express the effective potential $V_{\rm eff}(\langle P \rangle)$ using the expectation value without a source term. In particular, we consider the most difficult and interesting case of vacuum coexistence at the critical temperature $T_c$. We adopt SU(3) quenched lattice QCD on $48^3 \times 6$ at $\beta$= 5.89379, which corresponds exactly to the critical temperature $T_c$ of the deconfinement phase transition, and use 200,000 Monte Carlo configurations. After categorizing the gauge configurations into one $Z_3$-symmetric and three $Z_3$-broken vacua each, we perform a vacuum-associated reweighting method, using the gauge configurations around each vacuum separately. Finally, we obtain the Polyakov-loop effective potential, which is well depicted around the $Z_3$-symmetric and $Z_3$-broken vacua.</description>

      <title>Finite Volume Hamiltonian method for two-particle systems containing long-range potential on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a systematic method to block-diagonalize the finite volume effective Hamiltonian for two-particle systems with arbitrary spin in both the rest and moving frame. The framework is convenient and efficient for addressing the left-hand cut issue arising from long-range potential, which are challenging in the framework of standard L\"uscher formula. Furthermore, the method provides a foundation for further extension to three-particle systems. We first benchmark our method by examining several toy models, demonstrating its consistency with standard L\"uscher formula in the absence of long-range potential. In the presence of long-range potential, we investigate and resolve the effects and issues of left-hand cut. As a realistic application, we calculate the finite volume spectra of isoscalar $D\bar{D}^*$ system, where the well-known exotic state $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ is observed. The results are qualitatively consistent with the lattice QCD calculation, highlighting the reliability and potential application of our framework to the study of other exotic states in hadron physics.</description>

      <title>Chiral transition and meson melting within improved holographic soft wall models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the chiral transition for the quark condensate and the melting of scalar and vector mesons in two-flavor holographic QCD. This is done by extending the improved holographic soft wall models proposed in [1] to finite temperature, by means of introducing an asymptotically AdS black brane. We find that the chiral transition is second order in the chiral limit and a crossover for physical quark masses, as expected in two-flavor QCD. We investigate the melting of vector and scalar mesons in the deconfined plasma through the calculation of hadronic spectral functions. Fixing the model parameters by the meson spectrum at zero temperature, we find that the mesons melt at temperatures between $90$ and $110$ MeV and the chiral transition occurs around $129$ MeV. We also provide a prediction for the hydrodynamic diffusion constant associated with a flavor current in the deconfined plasma.</description>

      <title>BBGKY hierarchy for quantum error mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mitigation of quantum errors is critical for current NISQ devices. In the current work, we address this task by treating the execution of quantum algorithms as the time evolution of an idealized physical system. We use knowledge of its physics to assist the mitigation of the quantum noise produced on the real device. In particular, the time evolution of the idealized system obeys a corresponding BBGKY hierarchy of equations. This is the basis for the novel error mitigation scheme that we propose. Specifically, we employ a subset of the BBGKY hierarchy as supplementary constraints in the ZNE method for error mitigation. We ensure that the computational cost of the scheme scales polynomially with the system size. We test our method on digital quantum simulations of the lattice Schwinger model under noise levels mimicking realistic quantum hardware. We demonstrate that our scheme systematically improves the error mitigation for the measurements of the particle number and the charge within this system. Relative to ZNE we obtain an average reduction of the error by 18.2% and 52.8% for the respective above observables. We propose further applications of the BBGKY hierarchy for quantum error mitigation.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Partial Transpose in the Overlap Matrix Framework for Entanglement Negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the overlap matrix approach has been developed to compute quantum entanglement in free-fermion systems, particularly to calculate entanglement entropy and entanglement negativity. This method involves the use of partial trace and partial transpose operations within the overlap matrix framework. However, previous studies have only considered the conventional partial transpose in fermionic systems, which does not account for fermionic anticommutation relations. Although the concept of a fermionic partial transpose was introduced in \cite{Shapourian2017prb}, it has not yet been systematically incorporated into the overlap matrix framework. In this paper, we introduce the fermionic partial transpose into the overlap matrix approach, provide a systematic analysis of the validity of partial trace and partial transpose operations, and derive an explicit formula for calculating entanglement negativity in bipartite systems. Additionally, we numerically compute the logarithmic negativity of two lattice models to verify the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law. For tripartite geometries, we uncover limitations of the overlap matrix method and demonstrate that the previously reported logarithmic negativity result for a homogeneous one-dimensional chain in a disjoint interval geometry exceeds its theoretical upper bound. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of partial trace and partial transpose operations in different representations.</description>
