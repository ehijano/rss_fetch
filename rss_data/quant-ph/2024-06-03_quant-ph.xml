      <title>Teaching ideal quantum measurement, from dynamics to interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a graduate course on ideal measurements, analyzed as dynamical processes of interaction between the tested system S and an apparatus A, described by quantum statistical mechanics. The apparatus A=M+B involves a macroscopic measuring device M and a bath B. The requirements for ideality of the measurement allow us to specify the Hamiltonian of the isolated compound system S+M+B. The resulting dynamical equations may be solved for simple models. Conservation laws are shown to entail two independent relaxation mechanisms: truncation and registration. Approximations, justified by the large size of M and of B, are needed. The final density matrix $\hat{\cal D}(t_f)$ of S+A has an equilibrium form. It describes globally the outcome of a large set of runs of the measurement. The measurement problem, i.e., extracting physical properties of individual runs from $\hat{\cal D}(t_f)$, then arises due to the ambiguity of its splitting into parts associated with subsets of runs. To deal with this ambiguity, we postulate that each run ends up with a distinct pointer value $A_i$ of the macroscopic M. This is compatible with the principles of quantum mechanics. Born's rule then arises from the conservation law for the tested observable; it expresses the frequency of occurrence of the final indications $A_i$ of M in terms of the initial state of S. Von Neumann's reduction amounts to updating of information due to selection of $A_i$. We advocate the terms $q$-probabilities and $q$-correlations when analyzing measurements of non-commuting observables. These ideas may be adapted to different types of courses.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Properties of the Spin-Boson Dicke Model: Chaos, Localization, and Scarring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review article describes major advances associated with the Dicke model, starting in the 1950s when it was introduced to explain the transition from a normal to a superradiant phase. Since then, this spin-boson interacting model has raised significant theoretical and experimental interest in various contexts. The present review focuses on the isolated version of the model and covers properties and phenomena that are better understood when seen from both the classical and quantum perspectives, in particular, the onset of chaos, localization, and scarring.</description>

      <title>Dipole-dipole interactions mediated by a photonic flat band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) are energy bands with zero group velocity, which in electronic systems were shown to favor strongly correlated phenomena. Indeed, a FB can be spanned with a basis of strictly localized states, the so called "compact localized states" (CLSs), which are yet generally non-orthogonal. Here, we study emergent dipole-dipole interactions between emitters dispersively coupled to the photonic analogue of a FB, a setup within reach in state-of the-art experimental platforms. We show that the strength of such photon-mediated interactions decays exponentially with distance with a characteristic localization length which, unlike typical behaviours with standard bands, saturates to a finite value as the emitter's energy approaches the FB. Remarkably, we find that the localization length grows with the overlap between CLSs according to an analytically-derived universal scaling law valid for a large class of FBs both in 1D and 2D. Using giant atoms (non-local atom-field coupling) allows to tailor interaction potentials having the same shape of a CLS or a superposition of a few of these.</description>

      <title>Quantum encoder for fixed Hamming-weight subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact $n$-qubit computational-basis amplitude encoder of real- or complex-valued data vectors of $d=\binom{n}{k}$ components into a subspace of fixed Hamming weight $k$. This represents a polynomial space compression. The circuit is optimal in that it expresses an arbitrary data vector using only $d-1$ (controlled) Reconfigurable Beam Splitter (RBS) gates and is constructed by an efficient classical algorithm that sequentially generates all bitstrings of weight $k$ and identifies all gate parameters. An explicit compilation into CNOTs and single-qubit gates is presented, with the total CNOT-gate count of $\mathcal{O}(k\, d)$ provided in analytical form. In addition, we show how to load data in the binary basis by sequentially stacking encoders of different Hamming weights using $\mathcal{O}(d\,\log(d))$ CNOT gates. Moreover, using generalized RBS gates that mix states of different Hamming weights, we extend the construction to efficiently encode arbitrary sparse vectors. Finally, we perform an experimental proof-of-principle demonstration of our scheme on a commercial trapped-ion quantum computer. We successfully upload a $q$-Gaussian probability distribution in the non-log-concave regime with $n = 6$ and $k = 2$. We also showcase how the effect of hardware noise can be alleviated by quantum error mitigation. Our results constitute a versatile framework for quantum data compression with various potential applications in fields such as quantum chemistry, quantum machine learning, and constrained combinatorial optimizations.</description>

      <title>Three-flavor Collective Neutrino Oscillations on D-Wave's {\tt Advantage} Quantum Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In extreme environments such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron-star mergers, and the early Universe, neutrinos are dense enough that their self-interactions significantly affect, if not dominate, their flavor dynamics. In order to develop techniques for characterizing the resulting quantum entanglement, I present the results of simulations of Dirac neutrino-neutrino interactions that include all three physical neutrino flavors and were performed on D-Wave Inc.'s {\tt Advantage} 5000+ qubit quantum annealer. These results are checked against those from exact classical simulations, which are also used to compare the Dirac neutrino-neutrino interactions to neutrino-antineutrino and Majorana neutrino-neutrino interactions. The D-Wave {\tt Advantage} annealer is shown to be able to reproduce time evolution with the precision of a classical machine for small number of neutrinos and to do so without Trotter errors. However, it suffers from poor scaling in qubit-count with the number of neutrinos. Two approaches to improving the qubit-scaling are discussed, but only one of the two shows promise.</description>

      <title>Time and distance constraints for mass and charge interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reanalyse and extend constraints on mass and charge interferometry identified by Mari et al. (2016). We show that their constraint on the time required for coherent interference can be extended by a factor of two. We extend their analysis to consider experiments in which one interferometer measures gravitational or electric fields generated by another. We note that these analyses imply a maximum separation between a mass or charge interferometer and a decohering gravitational or electric field measurement that can be carried out without backreaction.</description>

      <title>Statistical signatures of quantum contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality describes situations where the statistics observed in different measurement contexts cannot be explained by a measurement independent reality of the system. The most simple case is observed in a three-dimensional Hilbert space, with five different measurement contexts related to each other by shared measurement outcomes. The quantum formalism defines the relations between these contexts in terms of well-defined relations between operators, and these relations can be used to reconstruct an unknown quantum state from a finite set of measurement results. Here, I introduce a reconstruction method based on the relations between the five measurement contexts that can violate the bounds of non-contextual statistics. A complete description of an arbitrary quantum state requires only five of the eight elements of a Kirkwood-Dirac quasi probability, but only an overcomplete set of eleven elements provides an unbiased description of all five contexts. A set of five fundamental relations between the eleven elements reveals a deterministic structure that links the five contexts. As illustrated by a number of examples, these relations provide a consistent description of contextual realities for the measurement outcomes of all five contexts.</description>

      <title>Generation of subnatural-linewidth orbital angular momentum entangled biphotons using a single driving laser in hot atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) entangled photon pairs with narrow bandwidths play a crucial role in the interaction of light and quantum states of matter. In this article, we demonstrate an approach for generating OAM entangled photon pairs with a narrow bandwidth by using a single driving beam in a $^{85}$Rb atomic vapor cell. This single driving beam is able to simultaneously couple two atomic transitions and directly generate OAM entangled biphotons by leveraging the OAM conservation law through the spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) process. The photon pairs exhibit a maximum cross-correlation function value of 27.7 and a linewidth of 4 MHz. The OAM entanglement is confirmed through quantum state tomography, revealing a fidelity of 95.7\% and a concurrence of 0.926 when compared to the maximally entangled state. Our scheme is notably simpler than previously proposed schemes and represents the first demonstration of generating subnatural-linewidth entangled photon pairs in hot atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement witness and nonlocality in confidence of measurement from multipartite quantum state discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider multipartite quantum state discrimination and provide a specific relation between the properties of entanglement witness and quantum nonlocality inherent in the confidence of measurements. We first provide the definition of the confidence of measurements as well as its useful properties for various types of multipartite measurements. We show that globally maximum confidence that cannot be achieved by local operations and classical communication strongly depends on the existence of entanglement witness. We also provide conditions for an upper bound on maximum of locally-achievable confidences. Finally, we establish a method in terms of entanglement witness to construct quantum state ensemble with nonlocal maximum confidences.</description>

      <title>Directly Estimating Mixed-State Entanglement with Bell Measurement Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement plays a fundamental role in quantum physics and information processing. Here, we directly estimate mixed-state entanglement using random unitary evolution in a photonic system. As a supplement to traditional projective measurements, we incorporate Bell measurements on qubit-pairs, enriching the previous randomized measurement scheme, which is no-go in this task with only local unitary evolution. The scheme is scalable to n-qubits via Bell measurements on qubit-pairs. Moreover, by introducing the few-shot postprocessing, the efficiency of the data collecting and processing is significantly improved. The estimator can be derived directly from a few consecutive outcomes while exhibiting greater robustness to system errors and noise compared to schemes based on shadow estimation. Our protocol and demonstration advance the direct characterization of quantum states in practice.</description>

      <title>Simulation of open quantum systems on universal quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of quantum computers has enabled demonstrations of quantum advantages on various tasks. However, real quantum systems are always dissipative due to their inevitable interaction with the environment, and the resulting non-unitary dynamics make quantum simulation challenging with only unitary quantum gates. In this work, we present an innovative and scalable method to simulate open quantum systems using quantum computers. We define an adjoint density matrix as a counterpart of the true density matrix, which reduces to a mixed-unitary quantum channel and thus can be effectively sampled using quantum computers. This method has several benefits, including no need for auxiliary qubits and noteworthy scalability. Moreover, accurate long-time simulation can also be achieved as the adjoint density matrix and the true dissipated one converge to the same state. Finally, we present deployments of this theory in the dissipative quantum $XY$ model for the evolution of correlation and entropy with short-time dynamics and the disordered Heisenberg model for many-body localization with long-time dynamics. This work promotes the study of real-world many-body dynamics with quantum computers, highlighting the potential to demonstrate practical quantum advantages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computing is a novel and promising framework for the implementation and efficient and robust execution of quantum gates based on purely geometric principles. However, the parallel transport condition that is central to nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computing has shortcomings. In this paper, we address some of these shortcomings and show that a projectivization of the standard gauge theory of nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation eliminates them. In addition, we extend the isoholonomic inequality to projective gates and establish a minimum execution time-a quantum speed limit-for projective holonomic quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Unusual Diffusivity in Strongly Disordered Quantum Lattices: Random Dimer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in transport properties measurements of disordered materials and lattice simulations, using superconducting qubits, have rekindled interest in Anderson localization, motivating our study of highly disordered quantum lattices. Initially, our statistical analysis of localized eigenstates reveals a distinct transition between weak and strong disorder regimes, suggesting a random distribution of dimers in highly disordered systems. Subsequently, the random dimer model predicts an oscillating diffusivity that decays as $t^{-1/2}$, is inversely proportional to the disorder strength, and maintains a constant frequency with an initial phase shift of $\pi/4$. The first peak exhibits a universal scaling of $\sigma^{-1}$ both in peak time and amplitude. Finally, we find that stochastic noise suppresses these oscillations and induces hopping between localized eigenstates, resulting in constant diffusion over long times. Our predictions challenge the conventional understanding of incoherent hopping under strong disorder. This offers new insights to optimize disordered systems for optoelectrical and quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of a fault-tolerant qubit encoded on a hyperfine-coupled qudit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of effective quantum error correction protocols remains a central challenge in the development of scalable quantum computers. Protocols employing redundancy over multiple physical qubits to encode a single error-protected logical qubit are theoretically effective, but imply a large resource overhead. Alternative, more hardware-efficient, approaches seek to deploy higher-dimensional quantum systems known as qudits. Recently, proposals have emerged for exploiting high-spin magnetic nuclei coupled to condensed matter electron spin qubits to implement fault-tolerant memories.
  Here, we explore experimentally the simplest of these proposals, a logical qubit encoded on the four states of a I=3/2 nuclear spin hyperfine-coupled to a S=1/2 electron spin qubit; the encoding protects against the dominant decoherence mechanism in such systems, fluctuations of the quantizing magnetic field. We implement the encoding using electron-nuclear double resonance within a subspace of the spin levels in an ensemble of highly coherent manganese defects in zinc oxide. We explore the dynamics of the encoded state both under a controlled application of the fluctuation and under natural decoherence processes. Our results confirm the potential of these proposals for practical, implementable, fault tolerant quantum memories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing number of qubits of quantum information processing devices, the task of fully characterizing these processors becomes increasingly unfeasible. From a practical perspective, one wants to find possible errors in the functioning of the device as quickly as possible, or otherwise establish its correct functioning with high confidence. In response to these challenges, we propose a pattern-based approach inspired by classical memory testing algorithms to evaluate the functionality of a quantum memory, based on plausible failure mechanisms. We demonstrate the method's capability to extract pattern dependencies of important qubit characteristics, such as $T_1$ and $T_2$ times, and to identify and analyze interactions between adjacent qubits. Additionally, our approach enables the detection of different types of crosstalk effects and of signatures indicating non-Markovian dynamics in individual qubits.</description>

      <title>The Role of Bases in Quantum Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Optimal Control (QOC) supports the advance of quantum technologies by tackling its problems at the pulse level: Numerical approaches iteratively work towards a given target by parametrising the applied time-dependent fields with a finite set of variables. The effectiveness of the resulting optimisation depends on the complexity of the problem and the number of variables. We consider different parametrisations in terms of basis functions, asking whether the choice of the applied basis affects the quality of the optimisation. Furthermore, we consider strategies to choose the most suitable basis. For the comparison, we test three different randomisable bases - introducing the sinc and sigmoid bases as alternatives to the Fourier basis - on QOC problems of varying complexity. For each problem, the basis-specific convergence rates result in a unique ranking. Especially for expensive evaluations, e.g., in closed-loop, a potential speed-up by a factor of up to 10 may be crucial for the optimisation's feasibility. We conclude that a problem-dependent basis choice is an influential factor for QOC efficiency and provide advice for its approach.</description>

Abstract: Laser-cooled gases of atoms interacting with the field of an optical cavity are a powerful tool for quantum sensing and the simulation of open and closed quantum systems. They can display spontaneous self-organisation phase transitions, time crystals, new lasing mechanisms, squeezed states for quantum sensing, protection of quantum coherence, and dynamical phase transitions. However, all of these phenomena are explored in a discontinuous manner due to the need to stop and reload a new ensemble of atoms. Here we report the observation of hours-long continuous lasing from laser-cooled $^{88}$Sr atoms continuously loaded into a ring cavity. The required inversion to produce lasing arises from inversion in the atomic momentum degree of freedom, a mechanism related directly to self-organization phase transitions and collective atomic recoil lasing, both of which were previously only observed in a cyclic fashion compared to the truly continuous behavior here. Further, the sensitivity of the lasing frequency to cavity frequency changes is 120 fold suppressed due to an atomic loss mechanism, opening an interesting new path to compensate cavity frequency noise for realizing narrow frequency references. This work opens the way for continuous cavity QED quantum simulation experiments as well as continuous superradiant lasers.</description>

Abstract: Many problems intractable on classical devices could be solved by algorithms explicitly based on quantum mechanical laws, i.e. exploiting quantum information processing. As a result, increasing efforts from different fields are nowadays directed to the actual realization of quantum devices. Here we provide an introduction to Quantum Information Processing, focusing on a promising setup for its implementation, represented by molecular spin clusters known as Molecular Nanomagnets. We introduce the basic tools to understand and design quantum algorithms, always referring to their actual realization on a molecular spin architecture. We then examine the most important sources of noise in this class of systems and then one of their most peculiar features, i.e. the possibility to exploit many (more than two) available states to encode information and to self-correct it from errors via proper design of quantum error correction codes. Finally, we present some examples of quantum algorithms proposed and implemented on a molecular spin qudit hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eigenstates of observables such as the Hamiltonian play a central role in quantum mechanics. Inspired by the pure Nash equilibria that arise in classical game theory, we propose ''Nash states'' of multiple observables as a generalization of eigenstates of single observables. This generalization is mathematically natural for many-body quantum systems, which possess an intrinsic tensor product structure. Every set of observables gives rise to algebraic varieties of Nash state vectors that we call ''Nash varieties''. We present analytical and numerical results on the existence of Nash states and on the geometry of Nash varieties. We relate these ideas to earlier, pioneering work on the Nash equilibria of few-body quantum games and discuss connections to the variational minimization of local Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to efficiently prepare ground states of quantum Hamiltonians via adiabatic protocols is typically limited by the smallest energy gap encountered during the quantum evolution. This presents a key obstacle for quantum simulation and realizations of adiabatic quantum algorithms in large systems, particularly when the adiabatic gap vanishes exponentially with system size. Using QuEra's Aquila programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays, we experimentally demonstrate a method to circumvent such limitations. Specifically, we develop and test a "sweep-quench-sweep" quantum algorithm in which the incorporation of a quench step serves as a remedy to the diverging adiabatic timescale. These quenches introduce a macroscopic reconfiguration between states separated by an extensively large Hamming distance, akin to quantum many-body scars. Our experiments show that this approach significantly outperforms the adiabatic algorithm, illustrating that such quantum quench algorithms can provide a shortcut to adiabaticity for large-scale many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Table-top nanodiamond interferometer enabling quantum gravity tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unifying quantum theory and general relativity is the holy grail of contemporary physics. Nonetheless, the lack of experimental evidence driving this process led to a plethora of mathematical models with a substantial impossibility of discriminating among them or even establishing if gravity really needs to be quantized or if, vice versa, quantum mechanics must be "gravitized" at some scale. Recently, it has been proposed that the observation of the generation of entanglement by gravitational interaction, could represent a breakthrough demonstrating the quantum nature of gravity. A few experimental proposals have been advanced in this sense, but the extreme technological requirements (e.g., the need for free-falling gravitationally-interacting masses in a quantum superposition state) make their implementation still far ahead. Here we present a feasibility study for a table-top nanodiamond-based interferometer eventually enabling easier and less resource-demanding quantum gravity tests. With respect to the aforementioned proposals, by relying on quantum superpositions of steady massive (mesoscopic) objects our interferometer may allow exploiting just small-range electromagnetic fields (much easier to implement and control) and, at the same time, the re-utilization of the massive quantum probes exploited, inevitably lost in free-falling interferometric schemes.</description>

Abstract: The identification of physical subsystems in quantum mechanics as compared to classical mechanics poses significant conceptual challenges, especially in the context of quantum gravity. Traditional approaches associate quantum systems with classical ones localized in spacetime, using either Hilbert space factors for finite-dimensional systems or local operator algebras in algebraic quantum field theory. These methods ensure statistical independence for state preparations and measurements. However, canonical linearized quantum gravity disrupts this framework by preventing the formation of gauge-invariant local algebras, thereby undermining the statistical independence required in measurements. This presents a major obstacle for modeling early universe cosmology, gravity-induced-entanglement experiments, and poses a significant roadblock toward a comprehensive theory of quantum gravity. A pivotal shift is proposed: the identification of classical and quantum systems should be dynamically evolving rather than static, opening the possibility of a single-world unitary quantum mechanics. This perspective aligns with the broader aim of understanding how classical spatiotemporal existence emerges from quantum mechanics and connects the measurement problem with quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Interferometry of quantum correlation functions to access quasiprobability distribution of work</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution emerges from the quantum correlation function of two observables measured at distinct times and is therefore relevant for fundamental physics and quantum technologies. These quasiprobabilities follow all but one of Kolmogorov axioms for joint probability distributions: they can take non-positive values. Their experimental reconstruction becomes challenging when expectation values of incompatible observables are involved. Previous strategies aimed to reconstruct them using weak measurements or combining strong measurements. Here, we use a more direct approach, an interferometric scheme aided by an auxiliary system, to reconstruct the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution. We experimentally demonstrate the interferometric scheme in an electron-nuclear spin system associated with a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. By measuring the characteristic function, we reconstruct the quasiprobability distribution of the work and analyze the behavior of the first and second moments of work. Our results clarify the physical meaning of the work quasiprobability distribution in the context of quantum thermodynamics. Finally, having measured the real and imaginary parts of the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability of work, we are also able to study the uncertainty of measuring the Hamiltonian of the system at two times, via the Robertson-Schr{\"o}dinger uncertainty relation, for different initial states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generative pretained transformer (GPT) designed to learn the measurement outcomes of a neutral atom array quantum computer. Based on a vanilla transformer, our encoder-decoder architecture takes as input the interacting Hamiltonian, and outputs an autoregressive sequence of qubit measurement probabilities. Its performance is studied in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition in Rydberg atoms in a square lattice array. We explore the ability of the architecture to generalize, by producing groundstate measurements for Hamiltonian parameters not seen in the training set. We focus on examples of physical observables obtained from inference on three different models, trained in fixed compute time on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. These can act as benchmarks for the scaling of larger RydbergGPT models in the future. Finally, we provide RydbergGPT open source, to aid in the development of foundation models based off of a wide variety of quantum computer interactions and data sets in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental step of any quantum algorithm is the preparation of qubit registers in a suitable initial state. Often qubit registers represent a discretization of continuous variables and the initial state is defined by a multivariate function. We develop protocols for preparing quantum states whose amplitudes encode multivariate functions by linearly combining block-encodings of Fourier and Chebyshev basis functions. Without relying on arithmetic circuits, quantum Fourier transforms, or multivariate quantum signal processing, our algorithms are simpler and more effective than previous proposals. We analyze requirements both asymptotically and pragmatically in terms of near/medium-term resources. Numerically, we prepare bivariate Student's t-distributions, 2D Ricker wavelets and electron wavefunctions in a 3D Coulomb potential, which are initial states with potential applications in finance, physics and chemistry simulations. Finally, we prepare bivariate Gaussian distributions on the Quantinuum H2-1 trapped-ion quantum processor using 24 qubits and up to 237 two-qubit gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topological quantum number, the Witten index, characterizes supersymmetric models by probing for zero energy modes and the possibility of supersymmetry breaking. We propose an averaging method to infer the Witten index in quantum analogue simulators. Motivated by recent work on Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays, we consider a related supersymmetric XXZ spin model. We show how to infer the Witten index from open system averaging and numerically demonstrate its topological robustness in this model. Our work defines a route for quantum analogue simulators to directly identify many-body topological physics.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum evolution of 1D Bose gases immediately after several variants of high-energy quenches, both experimentally and theoretically. Using the advantages conveyed by the relative simplicity of these nearly integrable many-body systems, we are able to differentiate the behavior of two distinct but often temporally overlapping processes, hydrodynamization and local prethermalization. There is a universal character to our findings, which can be applied to the short-time behavior of any interacting many-body quantum system after a sudden high-energy quench. We specifically discuss its potential relevance to heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Fate of many-body localization in an Abelian lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the fate of many-body localization (MBL) of mid-spectrum eigenstates of a matter-free $U(1)$ quantum-link gauge theory Hamiltonian with random couplings on ladder geometries. We specifically consider an intensive estimator, $\mathcal{D} \in [0,1/4]$, that acts as a measure of elementary plaquettes on the lattice being active or inert in mid-spectrum eigenstates as well as the concentration of these eigenstates in Fock space, with $\mathcal{D}$ being equal to its maximum value of $1/4$ for Fock states in the electric flux basis. We calculate its distribution, $p(\mathcal{D})$, for $L_x \times L_y$ lattices, with $L_y=2$ and $4$, as a function of (a dimensionless) disorder strength $\alpha$ ($\alpha=0$ implies zero disorder) using exact diagonalization on many disorder realizations. Analyzing the skewness of $p(\mathcal{D})$ shows that the finite-size estimate of the critical disorder strength, beyond which MBL sets in for thin ladders with $L_y=2$, increases linearly with $L_x$ while the behavior of the full distribution with increasing $L_x$ at fixed $\alpha$ shows that $\alpha_c (L_y=2) &gt;40$, if at all finite, based on data for $L_x \leq 12$. $p(\mathcal{D})$ for wider ladders with $L_y=4$ show their lower tendency to localize, suggesting a lack of MBL in two dimensions. A remarkable observation is the resolution of the (monotonic) infinite temperature autocorrelation function of single plaquette diagonal operators in typical high-energy Fock states into a plethora of emergent timescales of increasing spatio-temporal heterogeneity as the disorder is increased even before MBL sets in. At intermediate and large $\alpha$, but below $\alpha_c (L_y)$, certain randomly selected initial Fock states display striking oscillatory temporal behavior of such plaquette operators dominated by only a few frequencies, reminiscent of oscillations induced by quantum many-body scars.</description>

      <title>Recurrent neural network wave functions for Rydberg atom arrays on kagome lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom array experiments have demonstrated the ability to act as powerful quantum simulators, preparing strongly-correlated phases of matter which are challenging to study for conventional computer simulations. A key direction has been the implementation of interactions on frustrated geometries, in an effort to prepare exotic many-body states such as spin liquids and glasses. In this paper, we apply two-dimensional recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions to study the ground states of Rydberg atom arrays on the kagome lattice. We implement an annealing scheme to find the RNN variational parameters in regions of the phase diagram where exotic phases may occur, corresponding to rough optimization landscapes. For Rydberg atom array Hamiltonians studied previously on the kagome lattice, our RNN ground states show no evidence of exotic spin liquid or emergent glassy behavior. In the latter case, we argue that the presence of a non-zero Edwards-Anderson order parameter is an artifact of the long autocorrelations times experienced with quantum Monte Carlo simulations. This result emphasizes the utility of autoregressive models, such as RNNs, to explore Rydberg atom array physics on frustrated lattices and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Divalent atoms provide excellent means for advancing control in Rydberg atom-based quantum simulation and computing, due to the second optically active valence electron available. Particularly promising in this context are circular Rydberg atoms, for which long-lived ionic core excitations can be exploited without suffering from detrimental autoionization. Here, we report measurements of the electric quadrupole coupling between the metastable 4D$_{3/2}$ level and a very high-$n$ ($n=79$) circular Rydberg qubit, realized in doubly excited $^{88}$Sr atoms. We measure the kHz-scale differential level shift on the circular Rydberg qubit via beat-node Ramsey interferometry comprising spin echo. Observing this coupling requires coherent interrogation of the Rydberg states for more than one hundred microseconds, which is assisted by tweezer trapping and circular state lifetime enhancement in a black-body radiation suppressing capacitor. Our results demonstrate access to weak electron-electron interactions in Rydberg atoms and expand the quantum simulation toolbox for optical control of highly excited circular state qubits via ionic core manipulation.</description>

      <title>Should we necessarily treat masses as localized when analysing tests of quantum gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently proposed ``table-top tests of quantum gravity'' involve creating, separating and recombining superpositions of masses at non-relativistic speeds. The general expectation is that these generate superpositions of gravitational fields via the Newtonian potential. Analyses suggest that negligible gravitational radiation is generated if the interference experiments involve sufficiently small accelerations. One way of thinking about this is that matter and the static gravitational field are temporarily entangled and then disentangled. Another is that the static gravitational field degrees of freedom are dependent on the matter and do not belong to a separate Hilbert space, and that there is always negligible entanglement between matter and dynamical gravitational degrees of freedom.
  In this last picture, localized masses effectively become infinitely extended objects, inseparable from their Newtonian potentials. While this picture seems hard to extend to a fully relativistic theory of non-quantum gravity, it has significant implications for analyses of how or whether BMV and other non-relativistic experiments might test the quantum nature of gravity. If the masses in a BMV experiment are regarded as occupying overlapping regions (or indeed all of space), explaining how they become entangled does not require that their gravitational interaction involves quantum information exchange. On this view, while the experiments test gravity in a regime where quantum theory describes all relevant matter degrees of freedom, they do not necessarily test its quantum nature. It might be argued that no plausible explanation other than quantum gravity could be consistent both with these experiments and with relativity. But this relies on further theoretical assumptions and is weaker than claiming direct evidence for quantum gravitational interactions from the experiments alone.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Quantum Phase Transitions in Driven Dissipative Spin Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open driven quantum systems have defined a powerful paradigm of non-equilibrium phases and phase transitions; however, quantum phase transitions are generically not expected in this setting due to the decohering effect of dissipation. In this work, we show that a driven-dissipative quantum spin chain exhibits a peculiar sensitivity to the ground-state quantum phase transition. Specifically, we consider a quantum Ising model subject to bulk dissipation (at rate $\Gamma$) and show that, although the correlation length remains finite (hence no phase transition), it develops a pronounced peak close to the ground-state quantum critical point. While standard techniques seem to fail in this regime, we develop a versatile analytical approach that becomes exact with vanishing dissipation ($\Gamma \to 0$ but finite $\Gamma t$). On a technical level, our approach builds on previous work where the state of the system is described by a slowly evolving generalized Gibbs ensemble that accounts for the integrability of the Hamiltonian (described by free fermions) while treating dissipation perturbatively which leads to nontrivial, nonlinear equations for fermionic correlators. Finally, we demonstrate a kind of universality in that integrability-breaking perturbations of the Hamiltonian lead to the same behavior.</description>

      <title>Comparing Quantum Annealing and Spiking Neuromorphic Computing for Sampling Binary Sparse Coding QUBO Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing a sparse binary representation of an image. To be precise, given an image and an overcomplete, non-orthonormal basis, we aim to find a sparse binary vector indicating the minimal set of basis vectors that when added together best reconstruct the given input. We formulate this problem with an $L_2$ loss on the reconstruction error, and an $L_0$ (or, equivalently, an $L_1$) loss on the binary vector enforcing sparsity. This yields a quadratic binary optimization problem (QUBO), whose optimal solution(s) in general is NP-hard to find. The method of unsupervised and unnormalized dictionary feature learning for a desired sparsity level to best match the data is presented. Next, we solve the sparse representation QUBO by implementing it both on a D-Wave quantum annealer with Pegasus chip connectivity via minor embedding, as well as on the Intel Loihi 2 spiking neuromorphic processor. On the quantum annealer, we sample from the sparse representation QUBO using parallel quantum annealing combined with quantum evolution Monte Carlo, also known as iterated reverse annealing. On Loihi 2, we use a stochastic winner take all network of neurons. The solutions are benchmarked against simulated annealing, a classical heuristic, and the optimal solutions are computed using CPLEX. Iterated reverse quantum annealing performs similarly to simulated annealing, although simulated annealing is always able to sample the optimal solution whereas quantum annealing was not always able to. The Loihi 2 solutions that are sampled are on average more sparse than the solutions from any of the other methods. Loihi 2 outperforms a D-Wave quantum annealer standard linear-schedule anneal, while iterated reverse quantum annealing performs much better than both unmodified linear-schedule quantum annealing and iterated warm starting on Loihi 2.</description>

      <title>Realization of a cold atom gyroscope in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High precision gyroscopes in space are important for sophisticated scientific experiments and deep space navigation. Microgravity in the space provides an ideal condition for operation of a cold atom gyroscope. To demonstrate this advantage, an atom interferometer (AI) was launched and installed in the China Space Station in 2022. Here reported is a realization of the cold atom gyroscope with this AI. By applying point source interferometry, spatial fringes are obtained and acceleration and rotation are extracted. The angles of the Raman lasers are precisely calibrated to avoid measurement error, and other systematic errors are also considered for the rotation measurement. The evaluated rotation measurement is (-115.64+/-1.71)*10^-5 rad/s in space, and an acceleration measurement resolution of 1.03*10^-6 m/s^2 is also obtained for a single image. This study conducts the first AI-based gyroscope in space and paves a way for future space-based AI experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum spin chains with a hidden free fermionic structure, distinct from the Jordan-Wigner transformation and its generalizations. We express selected local operators with the hidden fermions. This way we can exactly solve the real time dynamics in various physical scenarios, including the computation of selected dynamical two point functions and Loschmidt amplitudes, in continuous or discrete time. In the latter case we build quantum circuits that can be implemented on a quantum computer. With this we extend the family of classically simulable quantum many body processes.</description>

      <title>Fast characterization of multiplexed single-electron pumps with machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient machine learning based automated framework for the fast tuning of single-electron pump devices into current quantization regimes. It uses a sparse measurement approach based on an iterative active learning algorithm to take targeted measurements in the gate voltage parameter space. When compared to conventional parameter scans, our automated framework allows us to decrease the number of measurement points by about an order of magnitude. This corresponds to an eight-fold decrease in the time required to determine quantization errors, which are estimated via an exponential extrapolation of the first current plateau embedded into the algorithm. We show the robustness of the framework by characterizing 28 individual devices arranged in a GaAs/AlGaAs multiplexer array, which we use to identify a subset of devices suitable for parallel operation at communal gate voltages. The method opens up the possibility to efficiently scale the characterization of such multiplexed devices to a large number of pumps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a universal set of single- and two-qubit quantum gates acting on a hybrid qubit formed by coupling a quantum dot spin qubit to a $\mathbb{Z}_{2m}$ parafermion qubit with arbitrary integer $m$. The special case $m=1$ reproduces the results previously derived for Majorana qubits. Our formalism utilizes Fock parafermions, facilitating a transparent treatment of hybrid parafermion-spin systems. Furthermore, we highlight the previously overlooked importance of particle-hole symmetry in these systems. We give concrete examples how the hybrid qubit system could be realized experimentally for $\mathbb{Z}_4$ and $\mathbb{Z}_6$ parafermions. In addition, we discuss a simple readout scheme for the fractional parafermion charge via the measurement of the spin qubit resonant frequency.</description>

      <title>Tsang's resolution enhancement method for imaging with focused illumination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A widely tested approach to overcoming the diffraction limit in microscopy without disturbing the sample relies on substituting widefield sample illumination with a structured light beam. This gives rise to confocal, image-scanning and structured-illumination microscopy methods. On the other hand, as shown recently by Tsang and others, subdiffractional resolution at the detection end of the microscope can be achieved by replacing the intensity measurement in the image plane with spatial mode demultiplexing. In this work we study the combined action of Tsang's method with image scanning. We experimentally demonstrate superior lateral resolution and enhanced image quality compared to either method alone. This result paves the way for integrating spatial demultiplexing into existing microscopes, contributing to further pushing the boundaries of optical resolution.</description>

      <title>On the universality of $S_n$-equivariant $k$-body gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The importance of symmetries has recently been recognized in quantum machine learning from the simple motto: if a task exhibits a symmetry (given by a group $\mathfrak{G}$), the learning model should respect said symmetry. This can be instantiated via $\mathfrak{G}$-equivariant Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), i.e., parametrized quantum circuits whose gates are generated by operators commuting with a given representation of $\mathfrak{G}$. In practice, however, there might be additional restrictions to the types of gates one can use, such as being able to act on at most $k$ qubits. In this work we study how the interplay between symmetry and $k$-bodyness in the QNN generators affect its expressiveness for the special case of $\mathfrak{G}=S_n$, the symmetric group. Our results show that if the QNN is generated by one- and two-body $S_n$-equivariant gates, the QNN is semi-universal but not universal. That is, the QNN can generate any arbitrary special unitary matrix in the invariant subspaces, but has no control over the relative phases between them. Then, we show that in order to reach universality one needs to include $n$-body generators (if $n$ is even) or $(n-1)$-body generators (if $n$ is odd). As such, our results brings us a step closer to better understanding the capabilities and limitations of equivariant QNNs.</description>

Abstract: We present algorithms and a C code to reveal quantum contextuality and evaluate the contextuality degree (a way to quantify contextuality) for a variety of point-line geometries located in binary symplectic polar spaces of small rank. With this code we were not only able to recover, in a more efficient way, all the results of a recent paper by de Boutray et al [(2022). Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical 55 475301], but also arrived at a bunch of new noteworthy results. The paper first describes the algorithms and the C code. Then it illustrates its power on a number of subspaces of symplectic polar spaces whose rank ranges from 2 to 7. The most interesting new results include: (i) non-contextuality of configurations whose contexts are subspaces of dimension 2 and higher, (ii) non-existence of negative subspaces of dimension 3 and higher, (iii) considerably improved bounds for the contextuality degree of both elliptic and hyperbolic quadrics for rank 4, as well as for a particular subgeometry of the three-qubit space whose contexts are the lines of this space, (iv) proof for the non-contextuality of perpsets and, last but not least, (v) contextual nature of a distinguished subgeometry of a multi-qubit doily, called a two-spread, and computation of its contextuality degree. Finally, in the three-qubit polar space we correct and improve the contextuality degree of the full configuration and also describe finite geometric configurations formed by unsatisfiable/invalid constraints for both types of quadrics as well as for the geometry whose contexts are all 315 lines of the space.</description>

      <title>Biorthogonal Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

Abstract: By utilizing biorthogonal bases, we develop a comprehensive framework for studying biorthogonal dynamical quantum phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems. With the help of the previously overlooked associated state, we define the automatically normalized biorthogonal Loschmidt echo. This approach is capable of handling arbitrary non-Hermitian systems with complex eigenvalues and naturally eliminates the negative value of Loschmidt rate obtained without the biorthogonal bases. Taking the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model as a concrete example, a $1/2$ change of dynamical topological order parameter in biorthogonal bases is observed which is not shown in self-normal bases. Furthermore, we discover that the periodicity of biorthogonal dynamical quantum phase transitions depends on whether the two-level subsystem at the critical momentum oscillates or reaches a steady state.</description>

      <title>Quantum control of a cat-qubit with bit-flip times exceeding ten seconds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum bits (qubits) are prone to several types of errors due to uncontrolled interactions with their environment. Common strategies to correct these errors are based on architectures of qubits involving daunting hardware overheads. A hopeful path forward is to build qubits that are inherently protected against certain types of errors, so that the overhead required to correct remaining ones is significantly reduced. However, the foreseen benefit rests on a severe condition: quantum manipulations of the qubit must not break the protection that has been so carefully engineered. A recent qubit - the cat-qubit - is encoded in the manifold of metastable states of a quantum dynamical system, thereby acquiring continuous and autonomous protection against bit-flips. Here, in a superconducting circuit experiment, we implement a cat-qubit with bit-flip times exceeding 10 seconds. This is a four order of magnitude improvement over previous cat-qubit implementations. We prepare and image quantum superposition states, and measure phase-flip times above 490 nanoseconds. Most importantly, we control the phase of these quantum superpositions without breaking bit-flip protection. This experiment demonstrates the compatibility of quantum control and inherent bit-flip protection at an unprecedented level, showing the viability of these dynamical qubits for future quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09168v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noiseless measurement of a single quadrature in systems of parametrically coupled oscillators is theoretically possible by pumping at the sum and difference frequencies of the two oscillators, realizing a backaction-evading (BAE) scheme. Although this would hold true in the simplest scenario for a system with pure three-wave mixing, implementations of this scheme are hindered by unwanted higher-order parametric processes that destabilize the system and add noise. We show analytically that detuning the two pumps from the sum and difference frequencies can stabilize the system and fully recover the BAE performance, enabling operation at otherwise inaccessible cooperativities. We also show that the acceleration demonstrated in a weak signal detection experiment [PRX QUANTUM 4, 020302 (2023)] was only achievable because of this detuning technique.</description>

Abstract: Noise affects the performance of quantum technologies, hence the importance of elaborating operative figures of merit that can capture its impact in exact terms. In quantum metrology, the introduction of the Fisher information measurement noise susceptibility now allows to quantify the robustness of measurement for single-parameter estimation. Here we extend this notion to the multiparameter quantum estimation scenario. We provide its mathematical definition in the form of a semidefinite program. Although a closed formula could not be found, we further derive an upper and a lower bound to the susceptibility. We then apply these techniques to two paradigmatic examples of multiparameter estimation: the joint estimation of phase and phase-diffusion and the estimation of the different parameters describing the incoherent mixture of optical point sources. Our figure of merit provides clear indications on conditions allowing or hampering robustness of multiparameter measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resonance fluorescence (RF) of a two-level emitter displays persistently anti-bunching irrespective of the excitation intensity, but inherits the driving laser's linewidth under weak excitation. These properties are commonly explained disjoinedly as the emitter's single photon saturation or passively scattering light, until a recent theory attributes anti-bunching to the laser-like spectrum's interference with the incoherently scattered light. However, the theory implies higher-order scattering processes, and led to an experiment purporting to validate an atom's simultaneous scattering of two photons. If true, it could complicate RF's prospects in quantum information applications. Here, we propose a unified model that treats all RF photons as spontaneous emission, one at a time, and can explain simultaneously both the RF's spectral and correlation properties. We theoretically derive the excitation power dependencies, with the strongest effects measurable at the single-photon incidence level, of the first-order coherence of the whole RF and super-bunching of the spectrally filtered, followed by experimental confirmation on a semiconductor quantum dot micro-pillar device. Furthermore, our model explains peculiar coincidence bunching observed in phase-dependent two-photon interference experiments. Our work provides novel understandings of coherent light-matter interaction and may stimulate new applications.</description>

      <title>Bexcitonics: Quasi-particle approach to open quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a quasiparticle approach to capture the dynamics of open quantum systems coupled to bosonic thermal baths of arbitrary complexity based on the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM). This is done by generalizing the HEOM dynamics and mapping it into that of the system in interaction with a few bosonic fictitious quasiparticles that we call bexcitons. Bexcitons arise from a decomposition of the bath correlation function into discrete features. Specifically, bexciton creation and annihilation couple the auxiliary density matrices in the HEOM. The approach provides a systematic strategy to construct exact quantum master equations that include the system-bath coupling to all orders even for non-Markovian environments. Specifically, by introducing different metrics and representations for the bexcitons it is possible to straightforwardly generate different variants of the HEOM, demonstrating that all these variants share a common underlying quasiparticle picture. Bexcitonic properties, while unphysical, offer a coarse-grained view of the correlated system-bath dynamics and its numerical convergence. For instance, we use it to analyze the instability of the HEOM when the bath is composed of underdamped oscillators and show that it leads to the creation of highly excited bexcitons. The bexcitonic picture can also be used to develop more efficient approaches to propagate the HEOM. As an example, we use the particle-like nature of the bexcitons to introduce mode-combination of bexcitons that uses the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree to efficiently propagate the HEOM dynamics.</description>

      <title>Taming the Bloch-Redfield equation: Recovering an accurate Lindblad equation for general open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Master equations play a pivotal role in investigating open quantum systems. In particular, the Bloch-Redfield equation stands out due to its relation to a concrete physical environment. However, without further approximations it does not lead to a Lindblad master equation that guarantees that the density matrix stays completely positive, which has raised some concerns regarding its use. This study builds on previous efforts to transform the Bloch-Redfield framework into a mathematically robust Lindblad equation, while fully preserving the effects that are lost within the secular approximation that is commonly used to guarantee positivity. These previous approaches introduce two potential deficiencies: the environment-induced energy shift can be non-Hermitian and some decay rates can be negative, violating the assumptions of Lindblad's theorem. Here, we propose and evaluate straightforward solutions to both problems. Our approach offers an effective and general procedure for obtaining a Lindblad equation, derived from a concrete physical environment, while mitigating the unphysical dynamics present in the Bloch-Redfield equation.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the fundamental relationship between the geometry of entanglement and von Neumann entropy, shedding light on the intricate nature of quantum correlations. We provide a comprehensive overview of entanglement, highlighting its crucial role in quantum mechanics. Our focus centers on the connection between entanglement, von Neumann entropy, a measure of the information content within quantum systems and the geometry of composite Hilbert spaces. We discuss various methods for quantifying and characterizing entanglement through a geometric perspective and elucidate how this connection unveils the nature of quantum entanglement, offering valuable insights into the underlying structure of quantum systems. This study underscores the significance of geometry as a key tool for understanding the rich landscape of quantum correlations and their implications across various domains of physics and information theory. An example of entanglement as an indispensable resource for the task of state teleportation is presented at the end.</description>

      <title>Quantum linear algebra is all you need for Transformer architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative machine learning methods such as large-language models are revolutionizing the creation of text and images. While these models are powerful they also harness a large amount of computational resources. The transformer is a key component in large language models that aims to generate a suitable completion of a given partial sequence. In this work, we investigate transformer architectures under the lens of fault-tolerant quantum computing. The input model is one where trained weight matrices are given as block encodings and we construct the query, key, and value matrices for the transformer. We show how to prepare a block encoding of the self-attention matrix, with a new subroutine for the row-wise application of the softmax function. In addition, we combine quantum subroutines to construct important building blocks in the transformer, the residual connection and layer normalization, and the feed-forward neural network. Our subroutines prepare an amplitude encoding of the transformer output, which can be measured to obtain a prediction. Based on common open-source large-language models, we provide insights into the behavior of important parameters determining the run time of the quantum algorithm. We discuss the potential and challenges for obtaining a quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Robust Experimental Signatures of Phase Transitions in the Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is widely considered to be a promising candidate for a quantum-classical algorithm which could achieve near-term quantum advantage. However, current levels of hardware noise can require extensive application of error-mitigation techniques to achieve reliable computations. In this work, we use several IBM devices to explore a finite-size spin model with multiple `phase-like' regions characterized by distinct ground-state configurations. Using pre-optimized VQE solutions, we demonstrate that in contrast to calculating the energy, where zero-noise extrapolation is required in order to obtain qualitatively accurate yet still unreliable results, calculations of the energy derivative, two-site spin correlation functions, and the fidelity susceptibility yield accurate behavior across multiple regions, even with minimal or no application of error-mitigation approaches. Taken together, these sets of observables could be used to identify level crossings in VQE solutions in a simple and noise-robust manner, with potential near-term application to identifying quantum phase transitions, avoided crossings and non-adiabatic conical intersections in electronic structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Photonic simulation of Majorana-based Jones polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jones polynomials were introduced as a tool to distinguish between topologically different links. Recently, they emerged as the central building block of topological quantum computation: by braiding non-Abelian anyons it is possible to realise quantum algorithms through the computation of Jones polynomials. So far, it has been a formidable task to evaluate Jones polynomials through the control and manipulation of non-Abelian anyons. In this study, a photonic quantum system employing two-photon correlations and non-dissipative imaginary-time evolution is utilized to simulate two inequivalent braiding operations of Majorana zero modes. The resulting amplitudes are shown to be mathematically equivalent to Jones polynomials at a particular value of their parameter. The high-fidelity of our optical platform allows us to distinguish between a wide range of links, such as Hopf links, Solomon links, Trefoil knots, Figure Eight knots and Borromean rings, through determining their corresponding Jones polynomials. Our photonic quantum simulator represents a significant step towards executing fault-tolerant quantum algorithms based on topological quantum encoding and manipulation.</description>

      <title>A Search for Classical Subsystems in Quantum Worlds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoherence and einselection have been effective in explaining several features of an emergent classical world from an underlying quantum theory. However, the theory assumes a particular factorization of the global Hilbert space into constituent system and environment subsystems, as well as specially constructed Hamiltonians. In this work, we take a systematic approach to discover, given a fixed Hamiltonian, (potentially) several factorizations (or tensor product structures) of a global Hilbert space that admit a quasi-classical description of subsystems in the sense that certain states (the "pointer states") are robust to entanglement. We show that every Hamiltonian admits a pointer basis in the factorization where the energy eigenvectors are separable. Furthermore, we implement an algorithm that allows us to discover a multitude of factorizations that admit pointer states and use it to explore these quasi-classical "realms" for both random and structured Hamiltonians. We also derive several analytical forms that the Hamiltonian may take in such factorizations, each with its unique set of features. Our approach has several implications: it enables us to derive the division into quasi-classical subsystems, demonstrates that decohering subsystems do not necessarily align with our classical notion of locality, and challenges ideas expressed by some authors that the propensity of a system to exhibit classical dynamics relies on minimizing the interaction between subsystems. From a quantum foundations perspective, these results lead to interesting ramifications for relative-state interpretations. From a quantum engineering perspective, these results may be useful in characterizing decoherence free subspaces and other passive error avoidance protocols.</description>

Abstract: We study quantum advantage in one-step rendezvous games on simple graphs analytically, numerically, and using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors. Our protocols realise the recently discovered [arXiv:2207.14404] optimal bounds for small cycle graphs and cubic graphs. In the case of cycle graphs, we generalise the protocols to arbitrary graph size. The NISQ processor experiments realise the expected quantum advantage with high accuracy for rendezvous on the complete graph K3. In contrast, for the graph 2K4, formed by two disconnected 4-vertex complete graphs, the performance of the NISQ hardware is sub-classical, consistent with the deeper circuit and known qubit decoherence and gate error rates.</description>

Abstract: Matter-wave jets are ejected from a Bose-Einstein condensate subjected to a modulation of the interaction strength. For sufficiently strong modulation additional higher harmonic matter-wave jets emerge. Here we report the first experimental observation of incommensurable "golden" $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ matter-wave jets in a Bose-Einstein condensate exposed to a single frequency interaction modulation. We study the formation of higher-order jets and the corresponding incommensurable density waves in quasi-one-dimensional geometry with numerical one dimensional (1D) Gross-Pitaevskii equation simulation. We explore the process of jet formation experimentally and theoretically for a wide range of modulation amplitudes and frequencies and establish a phase diagram delineating different regimes of jet formation.</description>

Abstract: Tensor networks are factorizations of high-dimensional tensors into networks of smaller tensors. They have applications in physics and mathematics, and recently have been proposed as promising machine learning architectures. To ease the integration of tensor networks in machine learning pipelines, we introduce TensorKrowch, an open source Python library built on top of PyTorch. Providing a user-friendly interface, TensorKrowch allows users to construct any tensor network, train it, and integrate it as a layer in more intricate deep learning models. In this paper, we describe the main functionality and basic usage of TensorKrowch, and provide technical details on its building blocks and the optimizations performed to achieve efficient operation.</description>

      <title>Relevant long-range interaction of the entanglement Hamiltonian emerges from a short-range system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond the Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture, we find the entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) is actually not closely similar to the original Hamiltonian on the virtual edge. Unexpectedly, the EH has some relevant long-range interacting terms which hugely affect the physics. Without loss of generality, we study a spin-1/2 Heisenberg bilayer to obtain the entanglement information between the two layers through our newly developed quantum Monte Carlo scheme, which can simulate large-scale EH. Although the entanglement spectrum carrying the Goldstone mode seems like a Heisenberg model on a single layer, which is consistent with Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture, we demonstrate that there actually exists a finite-temperature phase transition of the EH. The results violate the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which means there should be relevant long-range terms in the EH. It reveals that the Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture ignores necessary corrections for the EH which may lead totally different physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Engineering conduction-band valley couplings is a key challenge for Si-based spin qubits. Recent work has shown that the most reliable method for enhancing valley couplings entails adding Ge concentration oscillations to the quantum well. However, ultrashort oscillation periods are difficult to grow, while long oscillation periods do not provide useful improvements. Here, we show that the main benefits of short-wavelength oscillations can be achieved in long-wavelength structures through a second-order coupling process involving Brillouin-zone folding induced by shear strain. We finally show that such strain can be achieved through common fabrication techniques, making this an exceptionally promising system for scalable quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wavefunction effects in uncorrelated systems are characterized by the Berry curvature and quantum metric. Beyond those, we propose gauge-independent tensors describing Bloch wavefunction effects on local interaction between correlated particles. We derive an effective hydrodynamic theory for ultracold bosons in optical lattices. Ground states and collective modes of superfluids in isotropic harmonic traps are solved for highly symmetric lattices. In a dynamic process, the wavefunction effects are featured by the eigenfrequency, amplitude, and phase shift of an excited breathing mode and can be observed in experiments. We also give a tight-binding model of a bipartite square lattice with nontrivial wavefunction effects. Our discovery advances the connections between the modern band theory and quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological index of a one-dimensional topological p-wave superconductor can be revealed when driving with a classical vector potential i.e. an electromagnetic wave, through the quasiparticles inter-band transition rates. As a function of driving frequency $\omega$, it is possible to obtain a measure of this topological invariant from the resonance envelope classifying the two distinct topological phases of the short-range Kitaev wire. We also propose to probe the topological phase transition in the model through the responses of the global capacitance in the presence of the light field and also through the Josephson current between the wire and the proximity coupled bulk superconductor. The system may also be implemented on the Bloch sphere allowing alternative ways to measure the $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants through circuit or cavity quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) has fueled machine learning (ML) across many domains. When paired data measurements $(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\nu})$ are coupled to covariates, a challenging conditional distribution learning setting arises. Existing approaches for learning a $\textit{global}$ transport map parameterized through a potentially unseen context utilize Neural OT and largely rely on Brenier's theorem. Here, we propose a first-of-its-kind quantum computing formulation for amortized optimization of contextualized transportation plans. We exploit a direct link between doubly stochastic matrices and unitary operators thus unravelling a natural connection between OT and quantum computation. We verify our method (QontOT) on synthetic and real data by predicting variations in cell type distributions conditioned on drug dosage. Importantly we conduct a 24-qubit hardware experiment on a task challenging for classical computers and report a performance that cannot be matched with our classical neural OT approach. In sum, this is a first step toward learning to predict contextualized transportation plans through quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Exact time-evolving scattering states in open quantum-dot systems with an interaction: Discovery of time-evolving resonant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study exact time-evolving many-electron states of an open double quantum-dot system with an interdot Coulomb interaction. A systematic construction of the time-evolving states for arbitrary initial conditions is proposed. For any initial states of one- and two-electron plane waves on the electrical leads, we obtain exact solutions of the time-evolving scattering states, which converge to known stationary scattering eigenstates in the long-time limit. For any initial states of localized electrons on the quantum dots, we find exact time-evolving states of a new type, which we refer to as time-evolving resonant states. In contrast to stationary resonant states, whose wave functions spatially diverge and not normalizable, the time-evolving resonant states are normalizable since their wave functions are restricted to a finite space interval due to causality. The exact time-evolving resonant states enable us to calculate the time-dependence of the survival probability of electrons on the quantum dots for the system with the linearized dispersions. It decays exponentially in time on one side of an exponential point of resonance energies while, on the other side, it oscillates during the decay as a result of the interference of the two resonance energies.</description>

Abstract: From the quasisymmetry-group perspective [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 120604 (2021)], we show the universal existence of collective, coherent modes of excitations in many-body scar models in the degenerate limit, where the energy spacing in the scar tower vanishes. The number of these modes, as well as the quantum numbers carried by them, are given, not by the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, but by the quasisymmetry of the scar tower: hence the name quasi-Nambu-Goldstone modes. Based on this, we draw a concrete analogy between the paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the many-body scar physics in the degenerate limit.</description>

      <title>Out-of-plane magnetic phase diagram of Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate Na2Co2TeO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the magnetic properties and mapped out the phase diagram of the honeycomb magnet Na2Co2TeO6 with Co 3d7 in out-of-plane magnetic fields. This material has previously been proposed to show nearest-neighbor Kitaev interactions between Co spins and maybe even Kitaev quantum spin liquid behavior in high fields. At low magnetic fields, we observe a thermal phase transition at TN = 27 K, transitioning from a paramagnetic state to a canonical ferrimagnetic state. Under the application of magnetic fields, a spin flop-like phase transition occurred before saturation of J = 1/2 between 10 K and TN. Below 10 K, a peak-dip-peak structure emerges between 10 and 17 T in the magnetic susceptibility (dM/dH) before the magnetic saturation, reminiscent of magnetic plateau behavior. The measurement of the magnetocaloric effect also shows dip-peak-dip behavior in this field range. Our data can be explained by an XXZ model with a single ion anisotropy and possibly small Kitaev and {\Gamma} exchange interactions. We also unambiguously determined the magnetization saturation field that helps constrain the energy scale of the exchange interactions</description>
