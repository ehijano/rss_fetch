      <title>Eavesdropping risk evaluation for wavy-surface-assisted terahertz channel in emulated rain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) data transmission through reflective methods plays a pivotal role in enhancing communication efficiency and expanding user reach. However, this innovation introduces significant eavesdropping risks, particularly magnified by the complex scattering effects encountered under adverse weather conditions. This study delves into the assessment of eavesdropping vulnerabilities within a metallic wavy-surface-assisted NLOS terahertz (THz) channel, emphasizing the dynamics of bistatic scattering during rainfall. Our observations reveal the feasibility of successful signal interception under these conditions, highlighting a prevalent security concern for outdoor terahertz communication networks utilizing NLOS channels to broaden coverage. This insight underscores the critical need for addressing and mitigating potential eavesdropping threats to ensure secure and reliable terahertz communications in varied environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Organic solvent boosts charge storage and charging dynamics of conductive MOF supercapacitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conductive metal-organic frameworks (c-MOFs) and ionic liquids (ILs) have emerged as auspicious combinations for high-performance supercapacitors. However, the nanoconfinement from c-MOFs and high viscosity of ILs slow down the charging process. This hindrance can, however, be resolved by adding solvent. Here, we performed constant-potential molecular simulations to scrutinize the solvent impact on charge storage and charging dynamics of MOF-IL-based supercapacitors. We find conditions for &gt;100% enhancement in capacity and ~6 times increase in charging speed. These improvements were confirmed by synthesizing near-ideal c-MOFs and developing multiscale models linking molecular simulations to electrochemical measurements. Fundamentally, our findings elucidate that the solvent acts as an ionophobic agent to induce a substantial enhancement in charge storage, and as an ion traffic police to eliminate convoluted counterion and co-ion motion paths and create two distinct ion transport highways to accelerate charging dynamics. This work paves the way for the optimal design of MOF supercapacitors.</description>

      <title>A peridynamic investigation of particle oxidation, size and material during cold-spray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold spray technology, distinguished by its unique ability to deposit particles in a solid state, offers unparalleled potential for applications such as coating, repair, and additive manufacturing. In this research, we employed a peridynamic modeling approach to systematically analyze the effects of key powder features on deposit properties. Notably, our model incorporates the explicit modeling of nanometer-sized oxide layers, providing a more accurate representation of real-world conditions. We assessed the influence of parameters such as particle size, oxidation conditions, and material type on crucial deposition indicators like critical velocity and compression ratio. Our results demonstrated excellent agreement with reported experimental data, affirming the effectiveness of the proposed numerical framework. Specifically, our findings highlighted that, for a given impact velocity, smaller particles, thicker oxide layers, and harder materials contribute to limited oxide removal and a decreased likelihood of successful adhesion. Additionally, we present a predictive framework that establishes a correlation between particle size and critical velocity, providing valuable insights for optimizing cold spray deposition parameters. This innovative approach not only enhances our understanding of the intricate interplay between powder features and deposit properties but also paves the way for a more efficient and cost-effective optimization process in cold spray applications.</description>

      <title>Aerosol Jet Printing of High-Temperature Multimodal Sensors for Strain and Temperature Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating multiple sensing capabilities into a single multimodal sensor greatly enhances its applications for in-situ sensing and structural health monitoring. However, the fabrication of multimodal sensors is complicated and limited by the available materials and existing manufacturing methods that often involve complex and expensive fabrication processes. In this study, a high-temperature multimodal sensor is demonstrated by aerosol jet printing of gold and ITO nanoparticle inks. The printed multimodal sensor for concurrent strain and temperature sensing possesses a high gauge factor of 2.54 and thermopower of 55.64 V/{\deg}C combined with excellent high-temperature thermal stability up to 540 {\deg}C. Compared to traditional single-modality sensors, the printed multimodal sensor significantly increases sensing capacity and improves spatial resolution using microscale printed patterns. The study also demonstrates that the strain sensor with integrated thermocouple enables in-situ compensation of the temperature effect on strain sensing, significantly improving strain measurement accuracy at high temperatures. By combining aerosol jet printing with nanomaterial inks, a wide range of multifunctional devices can be developed for a broad range of emerging applications.</description>

      <title>Oriented artificial nanofibers and laser induced periodic surface structures as substrates for Schwann cells alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People with injuries to the peripheral nervous system, due to its poor functional regeneration, suffer from paralysis of the facial muscles, fingers and hands, or toes and feet, often for the rest of their lives. Therefore, to improve patients' quality of life, there is an urgent need for conduits that effectively support the healing of large defects in nerve pathways through specific guidance of nerve cells. This paper describes two specific methods for achieving directed growth of Schwann cells, a type of glial cells that can support the regeneration of the nerve pathway by guiding the neuronal axons in the direction of their alignment. One method implies the exposure of a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) foil to a KrF* laser beam, that renders a nanorippled surface topography. The other method uses aligned polyamide-6 (PA-6) nanofibers produced via electrospinning on a very fast rotating structured collector, which enables easy nanofiber detachment, without additional effort. Schwann cells growth on these substrates was inspected after one week of cultivation by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM). For both methods we show that Schwann cells grow in a certain direction, predetermined by nanoripples and nanofibers orientation. In contrast, cells cultivated onto unstructured surfaces or randomly oriented nanofibers, show an omnidirectional growth behavior.</description>

Abstract: This report experimentally demonstrates the feasibility of applying an electrical current though a stationary graphene structure to induce magnetic non-reciprocity or, in other words, to create a static magnetic diode, and thereby validate the suggestion of Prat-Camps [1] et al. regarding the use of graphene for such a purpose. The described graphene-based static magnetic diode is assessed against the rotating copper magnetic diode of Prat-Camps and found to be comparable.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Invalidity of Solution Methods Involved in Solving Compatibility Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the theory of elasticity, the constraint of compatibility conditions on displacement field is not equivalent to the property of displacement field. The difference may broaden the possibility of solutions to elasticity problems, which means that the solution methods involved in solving the compatibility equations like stress-based solution method and stress function method may be invalid. The study argues the validity of the solution methods involved in solving the compatibility equations. It is concluded that the absence of constraints on local rigid body rotation causes the non-uniqueness of displacement fields for a rectangular beam purely bent and a cantilever loaded at the end.</description>

      <title>Octave-spanning Kerr soliton microcombs on thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative Kerr solitons from optical microresonators, commonly referred to as soliton microcombs, have been developed for a broad range of applications, including precision measurement, optical frequency synthesis, and ultra-stable microwave and millimeter wave generation, all on a chip. An important goal for microcombs is self referencing, which requires octave-spanning bandwidths to detect and stabilize the comb carrier envelope offset frequency. Further, detection and locking of the comb spacings are often achieved using frequency division by electro-optic modulation. The thin-film lithium niobate photonic platform, with its low loss, strong second-order nonlinearity, and large Pockels effect, is ideally suited for these tasks. However, octave-spanning soliton microcombs are challenging to demonstrate on this platform, largely complicated by strong Raman effects hindering reliable fabrication of soliton devices. Here, we demonstrate entirely connected and octave-spanning soliton microcombs on thin-film lithium niobate. With appropriate control over microresonator free spectral range and dissipation spectrum, we show that soliton-inhibiting Raman effects are suppressed, and soliton devices are fabricated with near-unity yield. Our work offers an unambiguous method for soliton generation on strongly Raman-active materials. Further, it anticipates monolithically integrated, self-referenced frequency standards in conjunction with established technologies, such as periodically poled waveguides and electro-optic modulators, on thin-film lithium niobate.</description>

      <title>Tunable double notch filter on thin-film lithium niobate platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tunable optical filter at the chip scale plays a crucial role in fulfilling the need for the reconfigurability in channel routing, optical switching, and wavelength division multiplexing systems. In this letter, we propose a tunable double notch filter on thin-film lithium niobate using dual micro-ring architecture. This unique integrated filter is essential for complex photonic integrated circuits, along with multiple channels and various frequency spacing. With only one loaded voltage, the device demonstrates a wide frequency spacing tunability from 16.1 GHz to 89.9 GHz by reversely tunning the resonances of the two micro-rings while the center wavelength between the two resonances remains unaltered. Moreover, by utilizing the pronounced electro-optic properties of lithium niobate, associated with the tight light confinement nanophotonic waveguides, the device demonstrates a spacing tunability of 0.82 GHz/V and a contrast of 10~16 dB. In addition, the device has an ultracompact footprint of 0.0248 mm2.</description>

      <title>Broadband transmissive polarization rotator by gradiently-twisted $\alpha$-MoO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization engineering has been proven to enhance the capabilities of light manipulation and thus facilitate the development of integrated photonic devices. In this study, we introduce a polarization rotator based on gradiently-twisted $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ thin film, that works for the mid infrared range and functions in a transmission mode. To be specific, the proposed device is constructed by gradiently-twisted $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ multilayers with a subwavelength thickness of only 5 microns, namely, one-third of the working wavelength. Our analytical calculation demonstrates the efficacy of this subwavelength thin film rotator in converting a linearly polarized wave into its orthogonal counterpart, thanks to its chiral nature. The twisted $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ multilayers exhibit the capability to significantly manipulate dispersion characteristics while maintaining low optical losses, thereby enabling a wide bandwidth exceeding 2.5 THz with a polarization ratio surpassing 17 dB. Moreover, the operational frequency can be adjusted across a 3.4 THz range by altering the incident angle of the incident waves. This adaptable design, characterized by its polarization versatility, can be customized to suit practical applications within wireless communication, radar systems, optical switching, and imaging technologies.</description>

      <title>Electron Spectroscopy using Transition-Edge Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition-edge sensors (TESs) have the potential to perform electron spectroscopic measurements with far greater measurement rates and efficiencies than can be achieved using existing electron spectrometers. Existing spectrometers filter electrons by energy before detecting a narrow energy band at a time, discarding the vast majority of electrons available for measurement. In contrast, transition-edge sensors (TES) have intrinsic energy sensitivity and so do not require prior filtering to perform energy-resolved measurements. Despite this fundamental advantage, TES electron spectroscopy has not, to our knowledge, previously been reported in the literature. We present the results of a set of proof-of-principle experiments demonstrating TES electron spectroscopy experiments using Mo/Au TESs repurposed for electron calorimetry. Using these detectors, we successfully measured the electron spectrum generated by an electron beam striking a graphite target with energies between 750 and 2000 eV, at a noise-limited energy resolution of 4 eV. Based on the findings of these experiments, we suggest improvements that could be made to TES design to enhance their electron detection capabilities through the use of of a dedicated electron absorber in the device with integrated electron optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a unique combination of electrochemical techniques to elucidate the dependency of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and absorption on pH and overpotential for iron and nickel. Impedance spectroscopy shows the dominance of the Volmer-Heyrovsky reaction pathway, challenging the common consideration of Volmer-Tafel dominance. Polarization slopes agree with the Volmer or Heyrovsky rate-determining step, with limitations at high overpotential. The evolution of steady-state permeation current density with overpotential is rationalised through newly-developed theory. Surface activity and absorption trends are captured. Combined with modelling, this work provides a path for quantifying hydrogen uptake and establishing an equivalent fugacity for aqueous electrolytes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser absorption Doppler velocimeters use a crossed-beam configuration to cancel error due to laser frequency drift and absorption model uncertainty. This configuration complicates the spatial interpretation of the measurement since the two beams sample different volumes of gas. Here, we achieve single-beam velocimetry with a portable dual comb spectrometer (DCS) with high frequency accuracy and stability enabled by GPS-referencing, and a new high-temperature water vapor absorption database. We measure the inlet flow in a supersonic ramjet engine and demonstrate single-beam measurements that are on average within 19 m/s of concurrent crossed-beam measurements. We estimate that the DCS and the new database contribute 1.6 and 13 m/s to this difference respectively.</description>

      <title>Complete Interband Transitions for Non-Hermitian Spin-Orbit-Coupled Cold-Atom Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, synthetic spin-orbit coupling has been introduced into cold-atom systems for more flexible control of the Hamiltonian, which was further made time-varying through two-photon detuning to achieve dynamic control of the cold-atom state. While an intraband transition can be adiabatically obtained, a complete interband transition, rather than a superposition of different bands, obtained through fast sweeping is usually guaranteed by having the positions of the initial and final states be far away from any band gap in the quasimomentum space. Here, by introducing an additional non-Hermitian parameter through an atom-loss contrast together with two-photon detuning as two controllable external parameters, both intraband and complete interband transitions can be achieved independent of the positions of the initial and final states. In addition, a point-source diagram approach in the 2D external parameter space is developed to visualize and predict the locations of any nonadiabatic transitions. This control protocol can have potential applications in quantum state control and quantum simulations using cold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum counterdiabatic driving with local control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppression of diabatic transitions in quantum adiabatic evolution stands as a significant challenge for ground state preparations. Counterdiabatic driving has been proposed to compensate for diabatic losses and achieve shortcut to adiabaticity. However, its implementation necessitates the generation of adiabatic gauge potential, which requires knowledge of the spectral gap of instantaneous Hamiltonians and involves highly non-local drivings in many-body systems. In this work, we consider local counterdiabatic (LCD) driving with approximate adiabatic gauge potential. Using transverse-field Ising model as an example, we present an in-depth study of the performance and optimization of LCD protocols. We then propose a novel two-step protocol based on LCD and simple local single-body control to further improve the performance. The optimization of these LCD-based protocols does not require knowledge of instantaneous Hamiltonians, and only additional local driving is involved. To benchmark the performance of LCD and the proposed local control-enhanced LCD technique, we experimentally implement digitized adiabatic quantum evolution in a trapped-ion system. We characterize the quality of the prepared states and explore the scaling behavior with system size up to 14 qubits. Our demonstration of quantum shortcut to adiabaticity opens a path towards preparing ground states of complex systems with accessible local controls.</description>

      <title>Heterodyne dispersive cavity ring-down spectroscopy exploiting eigenmode frequencies for high-fidelity measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring low light absorption with combined uncertainty &lt; 1 permille is crucial in a wide range of applications. Popular cavity ring-down spectroscopy can provide ultra-high precision, below 0.01 permille, but its accuracy is strongly dependent on the measurement capabilities of the detection system and typically is about 10 permille. Here, we exploit the optical frequency information carried by the ring-down cavity electromagnetic field, not explored in conventional CRDS, for high-fidelity spectroscopy. Instead of measuring only the decaying light intensity, we perform heterodyne detection of ring-downs followed by Fourier analysis to provide exact frequencies of optical cavity modes and a dispersive spectrum of a gas sample from them. This approach is insensitive to inaccuracies in light intensity measurements and eliminates the problem of detector band nonlinearity, the main cause of measurement error in traditional CRDS. Using the CO and HD line intensities as examples, we demonstrate the sub-permille accuracy of our method, confirmed by the best ab initio results, and the long-term repeatability of our dispersion measurements at 10^(-4) level. Such results have not been achieved in optical spectroscopy before. The high accuracy of the presented method indicates its potential in atmospheric studies, isotope ratio metrology, thermometry, and the establishment of primary gas standards.</description>

      <title>Design, fabrication, and performance of a versatile graphene epitaxy system for the growth of epitaxial graphene on SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A versatile Graphene Epitaxy (GrapE) furnace has been designed and fabricated for the growth of epitaxial graphene (EG) on silicon carbide (SiC) under diverse growth environments ranging from high vacuum to atmospheric argon pressure. Radio-frequency (RF) induction enables heating capabilities up to 2000{\deg}C, with controlled heating ramp rates achievable up to 200{\deg}C/s. Details of critical design aspects and temperature characteristics of the GrapE system are discussed. The GrapE system, being automated, has enabled the growth of high-quality EG monolayers and turbostratic EG on SiC using diverse methodologies such as close confinement sublimation (CCS), open configuration, polymer-assisted CCS, and rapid thermal annealing. This showcases the versatility of the GrapE system in EG growth. Comprehensive characterizations involving atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and low-energy electron diffraction techniques were employed to validate the quality of the produced EG.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Neural Network Advantage for Radar-Based Drone Detection and Classification in Low Signal-to-Noise Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the performance of a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN) and a comparable classical Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for detection and classification problem using a radar. Specifically, we take a fairly complex radar time-series model derived from electromagnetic theory, namely the Martin-Mulgrew model, that is used to simulate radar returns of objects with rotating blades, such as drones. We find that when that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is high, CNN outperforms the HQNN for detection and classification. However, in the low SNR regime (which is of greatest interest in practice) the performance of HQNN is found to be superior to that of the CNN of a similar architecture.</description>

      <title>Aluminum Josephson junction microstructure and electrical properties modification with thermal annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits based on Al/AlOx/Al Josephson junction are one of the most promising candidates for the physical implementation of universal quantum computers. Due to scalability and compatibility with the state-of-the-art nanoelectronic processes one can fabricate hundreds of qubits on a single silicon chip. However, decoherence in these systems caused by two-level-systems in amorphous dielectrics, including a tunneling barrier AlOx, is one of the major problems. We report on a Josephson junction thermal annealing process development to crystallize an amorphous barrier oxide (AlOx). The dependences of the thermal annealing parameters on the room temperature resistance are obtained. The developed method allows not only to increase the Josephson junction resistance by 175%, but also to decrease by 60% with precisions of 10% in Rn. Finally, theoretical assumptions about the structure modification in tunnel barrier are proposed. The suggested thermal annealing approach can be used to form a stable and reproducible tunneling barriers and scalable frequency trimming for a widely used fixed-frequency transmon qubits.</description>

      <title>Advances in high-pressure laser floating zone growth: the Laser Optical Kristallmacher II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optical floating zone crystal growth technique is a well-established method for obtaining large, high-purity single crystals. While the floating zone method has been constantly evolving for over six decades, the development of high-pressure (up to 1000 bar) growth systems has only recently been realized via the combination of laser-based heating sources with an all-metal chamber. While our inaugural high-pressure laser floating zone furnace design demonstrated the successful growth of new volatile and metastable phases, the furnace design faces several limitations with imaging quality, heating profile control, and chamber cooling power. Here, we present a second-generation design of the high-pressure laser floating zone furnace, "Laser Optical Kristallmacher II" (LOKII), and demonstrate that this redesign facilitates new advances in crystal growth by highlighting several exemplar materials: ${\alpha}$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, and La$_2$CuO$_{4+{\delta}}$. Notably, for La$_2$CuO$_{4+{\delta}}$, we demonstrate the feasibility and long-term stability of traveling solvent floating zone growth under a record pressure of 700 bar.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the Environmental Stability of Perovskite Thin Films via PMMA and AZ5214-Photoresist Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a pioneering strategy to enhance the environmental stability of perovskite thin films, a critical step forward in advancing their application in optoelectronics. Through the innovative application of matrix encapsulation techniques, we focus on the stabilization of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) films. These films are meticulously prepared via a two-step solution deposition method under controlled ambient conditions. Our approach involves the application of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and AZ5214 photoresist layers through spin-coating, aimed at singularly encapsulating the perovskite films. This encapsulation acts as a robust hydrophobic barrier, significantly mitigating moisture ingress and simultaneously addressing the challenge of pinhole presence within the perovskite structure. Through a series of detailed characterizations-spanning scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy-we demonstrate that, despite the thicker nature of the AZ5214 photoresist compared to the PMMA layer, it exhibits markedly enhanced stability. Notably, the integrity and optical properties of the perovskite films are preserved for extended periods of up to 960 hours under environmental exposure. This breakthrough highlights the superior performance of AZ5214 photoresist over PMMA in prolonging the operational life of perovskite thin films, thereby offering a promising avenue for their deployment in a wide range of optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.10121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate multimode optomechanical sensing of individual nanoparticles with radius of a hundred of nanometers. A semiconductor optomechanical disk resonator is optically driven and detected under ambient conditions, as nebulized nanoparticles land on it. Multiple mechanical and optical resonant signals of the disk are tracked simultaneously, providing access to several physical informations about the landing analyte in real-time. Thanks to a fast camera registering the time and position of landing, these signals can be employed to weigh each nanoparticle with precision. Sources of error and deviation are discussed and modeled, indicating a path to evaluate the elasticity of the nanoparticles on top of their mere mass. The device is optimized for future investigation of biological particles in the high megadalton range, such as large viruses.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Drain Noise in High Electron Mobility Transistors: Thermal and Hot Electron Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the on-wafer characterization of $S$-parameters and microwave noise temperature ($T_{50}$) of discrete metamorphic InGaAs high electron mobility transistors (mHEMTs) at 40 K and 300 K and over a range of drain-source voltages ($V_{DS}$). From these data, we extract a small-signal model and the drain (output) noise current power spectral density ($S_{id}$) at each bias and temperature. This procedure enables $S_{id}$ to be obtained while accounting for the variation of small-signal model, noise impedance match, and other parameters under the various conditions. We find that the thermal noise associated with the channel conductance can only account for a portion of the measured output noise. Considering the variation of output noise with physical temperature and bias and prior studies of microwave noise in quantum wells, we hypothesize that a hot electron noise source based on real-space transfer of electrons from the channel to the barrier could account for the remaining portion of $S_{id}$. We suggest further studies to gain insights into the physical mechanisms. Finally, we calculate that the minimum HEMT noise temperature could be reduced by up to $\sim 50$% and $\sim 30$% at cryogenic temperature and room temperature, respectively, if the hot electron noise could be suppressed.</description>

Abstract: Photons do not carry sufficient momentum to induce indirect optical transitions in semiconducting materials such as silicon, necessitating the assistance of lattice phonons to conserve momentum. Compared to direct bandgap semiconductors, this renders silicon a less attractive material for a wide variety of optoelectronic applications. In this work, we introduce an alternative strategy to fulfill the momentum-matching requirement in indirect optical transitions. We demonstrate that when confined to scales below ~3 nm, photons acquire sufficient momentum to allow electronic transitions at the band edge of Si without the assistance of a phonon. Confined photons allow simultaneous energy and momentum conservation in two-body photon-electron scattering; in effect, converting silicon into a direct bandgap semiconductor. We show that this less-explored concept of light-matter interaction leads to a marked increase in the absorptivity of Si from the UV to the near-IR. The strategy provides opportunities for more efficient use of indirect semiconductors in photovoltaics, energy conversion, light detection and emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a floating tunable coupler to mediate interactions between qubits on separate chips to build a modular architecture. We demonstrate three different designs of multi-chip tunable couplers using vacuum gap capacitors or superconducting indium bump bonds to connect the coupler to a microwave line on a common substrate and then connect to the qubit on the next chip. We show that the zero-coupling condition between qubits on separate chips can be achieved in each design and that the relaxation rates for the coupler and qubits are not noticeably affected by the extra circuit elements. Finally, we demonstrate two-qubit gate operations with fidelity at the same level as qubits with a tunable coupler on a single chip. Using one or more indium bonds does not degrade qubit coherence or impact the performance of two-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Ions-induced Epitaxial Growth of Perovskite Nanocomposites for Highly Efficient Light-Emitting Diodes with EQE Exceeding 30%</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites, a class of cost-effective semiconductor materials, are of great interest for modern and upcoming display technologies that prioritize the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with high efficiency and excellent color purity. The prevailing approach to achieving efficient luminescence from pervoskites is enhancing exciton binding effect and confining carriers by reducing their dimensionality or grain size. However, splitting pervoskite lattice into smaller ones generates abundant boundaries in solid films and results in more surface trap states, needing exact passivation to suppress trap-assisted nonradiative losses. Here, an ions-induced heteroepitaxial growth method is employed to assembe perovskite lattices with different structures into large-sized grains to produce lattice-anchored nanocomposites for efficient LEDs with high color purity. This approach enables the nanocomposite thin films, composed of three-dimensional (3D) CsPbBr3 and its variant of zero-dimensional (0D) Cs4PbBr6, to feature significant low trap-assisted nonradiative recombination, enhanced light out-coupling with a corrugated surface, and well-balanced charge carrier transport. Based on the resultant 3D/0D perovskite nanocomposites, we demonstrate the perovskite LEDs achieving an remarkable external quantum efficiency of 31.0% at the emission peak of 521 nm with a narrow full width at half-maximum of only 18 nm. This research introduces a novel approach to the development of well-assembled nanocomposites for perovskite LEDs, demonstrating high efficiency comparable to that of state-of-the-art organic LEDs.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Pancharatnam-Berry Metasurface for Unidirectional Wavefront Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces have been widely used for manipulating electromagnetic waves due to their low intrinsic loss and easy fabrication. The metasurfaces employing the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) geometric phase, called PB metasurfaces, have been extensively applied to realize spin-dependent functionalities, such as beam steering, focusing, holography, etc. The demand for PB metasurfaces in complex environments has brought about one challenging problem, i.e., the interference of multiple wave channels that limits the performance of PB metasurfaces. A promising solution is developing nonreciprocal PB metasurfaces that can isolate undesired wave channels and exhibit unidirectional functionalities. Here, we propose a mechanism to realize nonreciprocal PB metasurfaces of subwavelength thickness by using the magneto-optical effect of YIG material in synergy with the PB geometric phase of spatially rotating meta-atoms. Using full-wave numerical simulations, we show that the metasurface composed of dielectric cylinders and a thin YIG layer can achieve nearly 92% and 81% isolation of circularly polarized lights at 5.5 GHz and 6.5 GHz, respectively, attributed to the enhancement of the magneto-optical effect by the resonant Mie modes and Fabry-P\'erot cavity mode. In addition, the metasurface can enable efficient unidirectional wavefront manipulations of circularly polarized lights, including nonreciprocal beam steering and nonreciprocal beam focusing. The proposed metasurface can find highly useful applications in optical communications, optical sensing, and quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose here a set of new methods to directly detect light mass dark matter through its scattering with abundant atmospheric muons or accelerator beams. Firstly, we plan to use the free cosmic-ray muons interacting with dark matter in a volume surrounded by tracking detectors, to trace possible interaction between dark matter and muons. Secondly, we will interface our device with domestic or international muon beams. Due to much larger muon intensity and focused beam, we anticipate the detector can be made further compact and the resulting sensitivity on dark matter searches will be improved. In line with above projects, we will develop muon tomography methods and apply them on atmospheric and environmental sciences, archaeology and civil engineering. Furthermore, we will measure precisely directional distributions of cosmic-ray muons, either at mountain or sea level, and the differences may reveal possible information of dark matter distributed near the earth. In the future, we may also extend our study to muon on target experiments. Specifically, our methods can have advantages over exotic dark matters which are either muon-philic or slowed down due to some mechanism.</description>

Abstract: Silicon photonics with the advantages of low power consumption, low cost, and high yield is a crucial technology for facilitating high-capacity optical communications and interconnects. The graphene photodetectors (GPDs) featuring broadband operation, high speed, and low integration cost can be good additions to the conventional SiGe photodetectors, supporting silicon-integrated on-chip photodetection in new wavelength bands beyond 1.6 microns (e.g., U-band and 2 microns). Here we realize a silicon-integrated four-channel wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical receiver based on a micro-ring resonator (MRR) array and four p-n homojunction GPDs. These GPDs based on the photo-thermoelectric (PTE) effect operating under zero (current) bias exhibit responsivities of about 1.1 V/W and flat frequency responses up to 67 GHz which is set-up limited. The GPDs show good consistence benefiting from the compact active region array (0.006 mm^2) covered by a single mechanically exfoliated hBN/graphene/hBN stack. Moreover, the WDM graphene optical receiver realized the 4 x 16 Gbps non-return to zero (NRZ) optical signal transmission. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first GPD-array-based optical receiver using high-quality mechanically exfoliated graphene and edge graphene-metal conduct with low resistance. Apparently, our design is also compatible with CVD-grown graphene, which can also result in a good consistence of the GPDs. This work shed light on the large-scale integration of GPDs with high consistency and uniformity, enabling the application of high-quality mechanically exfoliated graphene, and promoting the development of the graphene photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Probing macroscopic temperature changes with non-radiative processes in hyperbolic meta-antennas</title>

Abstract: Multilayered metal-dielectric nanostructures display both strong plasmonic behavior and hyperbolic optical dispersion. The latter is responsible for the appearance of two separated radiative and non-radiative channels in the extinction spectrum of these structures. This unique property can open a wealth of opportunities towards the development of multifunctional systems that simultaneously can behave as optimal scatterers and absorbers at different wavelengths, an important feature to achieve multiscale control light-matter interactions in different spectral regions for different types of applications, such as optical computing or detection of thermal radiation. Nevertheless, the temperature dependence of the optical properties of these multilayered systems has never been investigated. In this work we study how radiative and non-radiative processes in hyperbolic meta-antennas can probe temperature changes of the surrounding medium. We show that, while radiative processes are essentially not affected by a change in the external temperature, the non-radiative ones are strongly affected by a temperature variation. By combining experiments and temperature dependent effective medium theory, we find that this behavior is connected to enhanced damping effects due to electron-phonon scattering. Contrary to standard plasmonic systems, a red-shift of the non-radiative mode occurs for small variations of the environment temperature. Our study shows that to probe temperature changes it is essential to exploit non-radiative processes in systems supporting plasmonic excitations, which can be used as very sensitive thermometers via linear absorption spectroscopy.</description>
