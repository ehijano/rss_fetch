      <title>Feasibility of Nash-Moser iteration for Cheng-Yau-type gradient estimates of nonlinear equations on complete Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we employ the Nash-Moser iteration technique to determine a condition under which the positive solution $u$ of the generalized nonlinear Poisson equation $$\operatorname{div} (\varphi(|\nabla u|^2)\nabla u) + \psi(u^2)u = 0,$$ on a complete Riemannian manifold with Ricci curvature bounded from below can be shown to satisfy a Cheng-Yau-type gradient estimate. We define a class of $\varphi$-Laplacian operators by $\Delta_{\varphi}(u):=\operatorname{div} (\varphi(|\nabla u|^2)\nabla u)$, where $\varphi$ is a $C^2$ function under some certain growth conditions. This can be regarded as a natural generalization of the $p$-Laplacian, the $(p,q)$-Laplacian and the exponential Laplacian, as well as having a close connection to the prescribed mean curvature problem. We illustrate the feasibility of applying the Nash-Moser iteration for such Poisson equation to get the Cheng-Yau-type gradient estimates in different cases with various $\varphi$ and $\psi$. Utilizing these estimates, we proves the related Harnack inequalities and a series of Liouville theorems. Our results can cover a wide range of quasilinear Laplace operator (e.g. $p$-Laplacian for $\varphi(t)=t^{p/2-1}$), and Lichnerowicz-type nonlinear equations (i.e. $\psi(t) = At^{p} + Bt^{q} + Ct\log t + D$).</description>

      <title>Rigidity of eigenvalues of shrinking Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the rigidity of eigenvalues of shring Ricci solitons. It is known that the drifted Laplacian on shrinking Ricci solitons has discrete spectrum, its eigenvalues have a lower bound and a rigidity result holds. Firstly, we show that if the $n^\text{th}$ eigenvalue is close to this lower bound, then the $n$-soliton must be the trivial Gaussian soliton $\mathbb{R}^n$. Secondly, we show similar results for the $(n-1)^\text{th}$ and $(n-2)^\text{th}$ eigenvalue under a non-collapsing condition. Lastly, we give an alomost rigidity for the $k^\text{th}$ eigenvalue with general $k$. Part of our results could be viewed as an soliton (could be noncompact) analog of Theorem 1.1 (which only holds for compact manifolds) in Peterson (Invent. Math. 138 (1999): 1-21).</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of tangent flows at infinity for finite-entropy shortening curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that an ancient smooth curve shortening flow with finite-entropy embedded in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has a unique tangent flow at infinity. To this end, we show that its rescaled flows backwardly converge to a line with multiplity $m\geq 3$ exponentially fast in any compact region, unless the flow is a shrinking circle, a static line, a paper clip, or a translating grim reaper. In addition, we figure out the exact numbers of tips, vertices, and inflection points of the curves at negative enough time. Moreover, the exponential growth rate of graphical radius and the convergence of vertex regions to grim reaper curves will be shown.</description>

      <title>Bakry-\'Emery, Hardy, and Spectral Gap Estimates on Manifolds with Conical Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spectral properties and geometric functional inequalities on Riemannian manifolds of dimension $\ge3$ with (finite or countably many) conical singularities $\{z_i\}_{i\in\mathfrak I}$ in the neighborhood of which the largest lower bound for the Ricci curvature is \begin{equation}\label{d2} k(x)\simeq K_i-\frac{s_i}{d^2(z_i,x)}. \end{equation} Thus none of the existing Bakry-\'Emery inequalities or curvature-dimension conditions apply. In particular, $k$ does not belong to the Kato (or (extended Kato) class, and $(M,g)$ is not tamed. Manifolds with such a singular Ricci bound appear quite naturally., e.g. as cones over spheres of radius $&gt;1$
  For such manifolds with conical singularities we will prove
  * a version of the Bakry-\'Emery inequality
  * a novel Hardy inequality
  * a spectral gap estimate.</description>

      <title>Willmore surfaces in spheres via loop groups: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decades, the authors made some systematic research on global and local properties of Willmore surfaces in terms of the DPW method. In this note we give a survey, mainly including the basic framework of the DPW method for the global geometry of Willmore surfaces via the conformal Gauss map, applications on constructions of Willmore $2$-spheres, characterizations of minimal surfaces, Willmore deformations of Willmore surfaces and Bjoerling problems for Willmore surfaces. Moreover, we also obtained some results on harmonic maps via DPW, including a duality theorem for harmonic maps into an inner non-compact symmetric space and its dual inner compact symmetric space, and harmonic maps of finite uniton type.</description>

      <title>Existence and non-existence of cohomogeneity one Einstein metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives sufficient conditions for the existence and non-existence of cohomogeneity one Einstein metrics on double disk bundles of two summands type. These conditions are inequalities that only involve geometric data from the principal orbits. The existence theorem yields five infinite families and ten other sporadic examples of new Einstein metrics. The non-existence theorem yields five examples whose principal orbits and singular orbits admit invariant Einstein metrics.</description>

      <title>On the index of minimal hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{S}^{n+1}$ with $\lambda_1&lt;n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that a closed minimal hypersurface in $\SSS$ with $\lambda_1&lt;n$ has Morse index at least $n+4$, providing a partial answer to a conjecture of Perdomo. As a corollary, we re-obtain a partial proof of the famous Urbano Theorem for minimal tori in $\mathbb{S}^3$: a minimal torus in $\mathbb{S}^3$ has Morse index at least $5$, with equality holding if and only if it is congruent to the Clifford torus. The proof is based on a comparison theorem between eigenvalues of two elliptic operators, which also provides us simpler new proofs of some known results on index estimates of both minimal and $r$-minimal hypersurfaces in a sphere.</description>

      <title>Morse index of minimal products of minimal submanifolds in spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tang-Zhang, Choe-Hoppe, showed independently that one can produce minimal submanifolds in spheres via Clifford type minimal product of minimal submanifolds. In this note, we show that the minimal product is immersed by its first eigenfunctions (of its Laplacian) if and only if the two beginning minimal submanifolds are immersed by their first eigenfunctions. Moreover, we give estimates of Morse index and nullity of the minimal product. In particular, we show that the Clifford minimal submanifold $\left(\sqrt{\frac{n_1}{n}}S^{n_1},\cdots,\sqrt{\frac{n_k}{n}}S^{n_k}\right)\subset S^{n+k-1}$ has index $(k-1)(n+k+1)$ and nullity $(k-1)\sum_{1\leq i&lt;j\leq k}(n_i+1)(n_j+1)$ (with $n=\sum n_j$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Riemannian metric on a closed manifold is said to be geometrically formal if the wedge product of any two harmonic forms is harmonic; equivalently, the interior product of any two harmonic forms is harmonic. Given a Riemannian foliation on a closed manifold, we say that a bundle-like metric is transversely geometrically formal if the interior product of any two basic harmonic forms is basic harmonic. In this paper, we examine the geometric and topological consequences of this condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use cotangent bundles of spaces of smooth embeddings to construct symplectic dual pairs involving the group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms. Via symplectic reduction we obtain descriptions of coadjoint orbits of this group in terms of nonlinear Grassmannians of augmented submanifolds. For codimension one embeddings these submanifolds are further constrained to the leaves of isodrastic foliations with finite codimensions.</description>

Abstract: We study fully nonlinear elliptic equations on Hermitian manifolds through blow-up argument and partial uniform ellipticity. We apply our results to draw geometric conclusions on finding conformal Hermitian metrics with prescribed Chern-Ricci curvature functions. By some obstruction from geometric function theory, our assumptions are almost sharp.</description>

      <title>K-stability of special Gushel-Mukai manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gushel-Mukai manifolds are specific families of $n$-dimensional Fano manifolds of Picard rank $1$ and index $n-2$ where $3\leq n \leq 6$. A Gushel-Mukai $n$-fold is either ordinary, i.e. a hyperquadric section of a quintic Del Pezzo $(n+1)$-fold, or special, i.e. it admits a double cover over the quintic Del Pezzo $n$-fold branched along an ordinary Gushel-Mukai $(n-1)$-fold. In this paper, we prove that a general special Gushel-Mukai $n$-fold is K-stable for every $3\leq n\leq 6$. Furthermore, we give a description of the first and last walls of the K-moduli of the pair $(M,cQ)$, where $M$ is the quintic Del Pezzo fourfold (or fivefold) and $Q$ is an ordinary Gushel-Mukai threefold (or fourfold). Besides, we compute $\delta$-invariants of quintic Del Pezzo fourfolds and fivefolds which were shown to be K-unstable by K. Fujita, and show that they admit K\"ahler-Ricci solitons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tensor invariant is defined on a paraquaternionic contact manifold in terms of the curvature and torsion of the canonical paraquaternionic connection involving derivatives up to third order of the contact form. This tensor, called paraquaternionic contact conformal curvature, is similar to the Weyl conformal curvature in Riemannian geometry, the Chern-Moser tensor in CR geometry, the para contact curvature in para CR geometry and to the quaternionic contact conformal curvature in quaternionic contact geometry.
  It is shown that a paraquaternionic contact manifold is locally paraquaternionic contact conformal to the standard flat paraquaternionic contact structure on the paraquaternionic Heisenberg group, or equivalently, to the standard para 3-Sasakian structure on the paraquaternionic pseudo-sphere iff the paraquaternionic contact conformal curvature vanishes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a combinatorial description of the embedded contact complex (ECC) of a certain family of contact toric lens spaces that we call concave lens spaces. We also define a notion of a concave toric domain that generalizes the usual concave toric domain in a way that possesses a singularity point and has a boundary a lens space. After desingularization these toric domains include the unitary cotangent bundle of $\mathbb{S}^2$ and the unitary cotangent bundle of $\mathbb{R}P^2$. We use the combinatorial expression of the ECC to compute the ECH capacities of these toric domains. Furthermore, for certain concave toric domains we describe a packing of symplectic manifolds that recovers their ECH capacities.</description>

      <title>Minimal Elements of the Causal Boundary with Applications to Spacetime Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1972, Geroch, Kronheimer, and Penrose introduced what is now called the causal boundary of a spacetime. This boundary is constructed out of Terminal Indecomposable Past sets (TIPs) and their future analogues (TIFs), which are the pasts and futures of inextendible causal curves. The causal boundary is a key tool to understand the global structure of a spacetime. In this paper, we show that in a spacetime with compact Cauchy surfaces, there is always at least one minimal TIP and one minimal TIF, minimal meaning that it does not contain another TIP (resp.\ TIF) as a proper subset. We then study the implications of the minimal TIP and TIF meeting each other. This condition generalizes some of the "no observer horizon" conditions that have been used in the literature to obtain partial solutions of the Bartnik splitting conjecture. We also show that such a no observer horizons condition is satisfied when the spacetime has a (possibly discrete) timelike conformal symmetry, generalizing a result of Costa e Silva, Flores, and Herrera about conformal Killing vector fields.</description>
