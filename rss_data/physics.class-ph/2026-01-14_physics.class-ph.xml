      <title>N-body Systems with Linear Wind Resistance: Analytic Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attractive and repulsive linear Hookean form of gravity is known to allow for analytic solutions to N-body systems for arbitrary masses and initial conditions. This linear system is very well suited for use in the advanced undergraduate classroom with the position of every particle rj(t) known analytically in terms of only sine, cosine, and exponential functions. Here it is shown that simple analytic solutions are also possible when linear wind resistance is included, provided that the force due to wind resistance force on each particle is proportional to the mass of that particle. Surprising analytic expressions for the behavior of the system if only a single particle in the system is subject to a linear wind resistance are also presented.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Lamb modes in 3D tapered waveguides: Cut-off effects and ZGV resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to enhance our understanding of the physical behavior of adiabatic modes in inhomogeneous elastic plates, particularly their remarkable capacity to adapt to gradual perturbations. The study investigates the propagation characteristics of higher-order adiabatic Lamb modes in waveguides with linearly varying thickness, with a focus on the influence of critical thicknesses on their propagation. This is achieved by leveraging the broadband excitation capabilities of a pulsed laser generating higher order Lamb modes to reveal various critical thicknesses, such as the cut-off and Zero-Group Velocity (ZGV) thicknesses. Remarkably, ZGV resonances can be induced at locations well beyond the laser source. Moreover, the mode's behavior is strongly influenced by thickness variations in all directions, imparting the plate an anisotropic-like behavior. Additionally, based on the observed effects, our experimental approach enables precise reconstruction of elastic waveguide profiles in additively manufactured aluminum plates with such thickness variations. The reconstructed profiles show a strong correlation with reference measurements across the scanned area.</description>

      <title>The connection between electromagnetic stress tensors and the dielectric constant in a medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform explicit calculations for microscopic models to confirm that a single, unique electromagnetic stress tensor exists in a dielectric medium: the microscopic tensor $\sigma^{#}$. We demonstrate that the conventional macroscopic stress tensor of continuum electrodynamics, which contains the derivative of the dielectric coefficient, is merely a representation of $\sigma^{#}$'s spatial average. This result establishes that, contrary to claims in the literature, both this averaged electromagnetic stress and the hydrodynamic pressure always possess a unique physical meaning.</description>

      <title>EEG Brain mapping based on the Duffing oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a Duffing oscillator based measurement framework for detecting frequency components associated with postsynaptic potential related activity in EEG recordings. The Duffing oscillator is employed as a nonlinear measurement system whose high sensitivity to weak periodic inputs enables robust frequency estimation in the presence of strong noise. Because postsynaptic potentials are embedded in noisy EEG recordings, they are treated as weak signals. Based on the detected weak-signal frequency distributions across EEG channels, topographic maps of brain activity are constructed to visualize spatial variations in neural activation. For this purpose, EEG signals recorded from two musicians and two audience members during a music experiment were analysed. The frequency components of the weak signals were searched within the 4 37 Hz range across all EEG channels. Subsequently, topographic brain maps were generated according to the number of detected weak-signal components. The results indicate that Duffing oscillator based weak signal detection is an effective tool for EEG brain mapping. Compared with Fourier and wavelet-based methods, the proposed technique provides a more detailed representation of brain activation. These findings suggest that the proposed approach has potential for investigating various pathological conditions and for enhancing the understanding of cognitive and behavioural functions of the human brain.</description>
