      <title>CR-39 track detector signatures of slow neutron like signals in Heavy-water electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report reproducible track-detector signals consistent with slow neutron capture events, recorded in D$_2$O electrolysis involving D-Pd deposited on Pt cathode. Sensitivity to slow neutrons was achieved using boron-coated CR-39 (BCR) detectors, which register charged particle tracks arising from the $^{10}$B$(n,\alpha)^{7}$Li reaction. These detectors were positioned adjacent to identically prepared uncoated CR-39 control detectors (CCR), which are effectively insensitive to slow neutrons and serve to quantify background contributions from charged particles and fast neutrons under the present experimental conditions. A reproducible differential detector signature (BCR $&gt;$ CCR) would thus indicative of slow neutron fluences. Across multiple independent D$_2$O electrolysis experiments in $0.25~\mathrm{T}$ field, the BCR exhibited significantly excess track signals relative to CCRs. Under these conditions, the observed differential response corresponds to an inferred detector-equivalent slow neutron flux of approximately $(6.7 \pm 0.2)~\mathrm{cm^{-2},s^{-1}}$. Removal of the magnetic field resulted in a reduction of the differential signal by a factor of $\sim6$, indicating a strong empirical dependence on the applied field. In contrast, H$_2$O electrolysis performed under otherwise identical conditions produced no measurable differential detector response, establishing the necessity of deuterated electrochemical conditions for the observed effect. The results are reported strictly as detector signatures consistent with slow neutron capture and do not assert any theoretical explanation. Instead, this work establishes a control verified and detector validated experimental protocol for detecting low flux slow neutrons, and provides empirical constraints relevant to slow neutron studies in experiments involving metal-deuteride systems.</description>

      <title>Improving TauFinder Reconstruction at a 10 TeV Muon Collider with the MAIA Detector Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to improve the TauFinder reconstruction algorithm for the MAIA detector concept. Through this work, we seek to increase the reconstruction efficiency and identification of hadronically decaying tau leptons. Through our work, we introduce a dynamic signal cone, known as a shrinking cone, which adjusts its size based on the transverse momentum of the tau candidate. In addition to the already studied one charged hadron and three charged hadron decay modes we extend TauFinder to include decays that consist of one charged hadron and up to two neutral pions. Furthermore, we have developed a tagger that prevents electrons being misidentified as one-prong tau candidates. Applying this tagger results in near-perfect electron rejection with negligible decrease in one-prong tau reconstruction efficiency.</description>

      <title>Optimized Broadband Cryogenic Ferromagnetic Resonance Spectrometer using a Closed Cycle Refrigerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a vector network analyzer (VNA) based broadband cryogenic ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectrometer, operating up to 20 GHz over a temperature range of 11 to 350 K. A cost effective architecture is implemented through the integration of a closed cycle refrigerator (CCR) and a custom fabricated grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW), designed for broadband transmission and reliable cryogenic operation. The VNA calibration is performed prior to measurements to account for microwave background and transmission losses, enabling reliable extraction of FMR spectra across the full temperature / frequency range. The sensitivity of the spectrometer is benchmarked using a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film, yielding well resolved resonances with narrow linewidths and high sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Constellation: The Autonomous Control and Data Acquisition System for Dynamic Experimental Setups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operation of instruments and detectors in laboratory or beamline environments presents a complex challenge, requiring stable operation of multiple concurrent devices, often controlled by separate hardware and software solutions. These environments frequently undergo modifications, such as the inclusion of different auxiliary devices depending on the experiment or facility, adding further complexity. The successful management of such dynamic configurations demands a flexible and robust system capable of controlling data acquisition, monitoring experimental setups, enabling seamless reconfiguration, and integrating new devices with limited effort.
  This paper presents Constellation, a flexible and network-distributed control and data acquisition software framework tailored to laboratory and beamline environments, that addresses the limitations of existing solutions. The framework is designed with a focus on extensibility, providing a streamlined interface for instrument integration. It supports efficient system setup via network discovery mechanisms, promotes stability through autonomous operational features, and provides comprehensive documentation and supporting tools for operators and application developers such as controllers and logging interfaces.
  At the core of the architectural design is the autonomy of the individual components, called satellites, which can make independent decisions about their operation and communicate these decisions to other components. This paper introduces the design principles and framework architecture of Constellation, presents the available graphical user interfaces, shares insights from initial successful deployments, and provides an outlook on future developments and applications.</description>

      <title>Performance evaluation of Luxium Solutions BCF-XL wavelength-shifting fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the performance of single-clad wavelength-shifting fibers newly developed by Luxium Solutions, BCF-92XL, BCF-9929AXL, and BCF-9995XL and compare them with the multi-clad Kuraray Y-11 fiber. The BCF-XL fibers exhibit faster decay times (92XL: $2.10\pm0.01$ ns, 9929AXL: $2.10\pm0.02$ ns, 9995XL: $2.41\pm0.03$ ns) than Y-11 ($7.44\pm0.06$ ns). The attenuation lengths are comparable to that of Y-11 within the measurement range up to 3.2 m. When coupled to an EJ-204 plastic scintillator, the BCF-XL fibers achieve superior time resolution while maintaining light yields comparable to those expected for a single-clad Y-11 fiber.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Autonomy in Scientific Experiments: A Hierarchical Taxonomy for Autonomous Large-Scale Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from automated data collection to fully autonomous discovery requires a shared vocabulary to benchmark progress. While the automotive industry relies on the SAE J3016 standard, current taxonomies for autonomous science presuppose an owner-operator model that is incompatible with the operational rigidities of Large-Scale User Facilities. Here, we propose the Benchmarking Autonomy in Scientific Experiments (BASE) Scale, a 6-level taxonomy (Levels 0-5) specifically adapted for these unique constraints. Unlike owner-operator models, User Facilities require zero-shot deployment where agents must operate immediately without extensive training periods. We define the specific technical requirements for each tier, identifying the Inference Barrier (Level 3) as the critical latency threshold where decisions shift from scalar feedback to semantic digital twins. Fundamentally, this level extends the decision manifold from spatial exploration to temporal gating, enabling the agent to synchronise acquisition with the onset of transient physical events. By establishing these operational definitions, the BASE Scale provides facility directors, funding bodies, and beamline scientists with a standardised metric to assess risk, define liability, and quantify the intelligence of experimental workflows.</description>

      <title>PANDA-film: an automated system for electrodeposition of polymer thin films and their wetting analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin polymer films are widely used as functional and protective coatings. However, determining the composition and processing conditions that produce a desired function is a tedious process due to the large number of factors that must be considered and the manual nature of most synthesis and characterization methods. Self-driving labs (SDLs), or robotic systems that prepare and test materials samples, are designed to overcome this bottleneck by enabling the efficient exploration of complex parameter spaces. In this paper, we report the development and testing of the polymer analysis and discovery array (PANDA)-film, a modular SDL for electrochemically synthesizing polymer films and then determining their water contact angle as a measure of surface energy. The system is designed to be highly modular and based upon a lowcost gantry platform to facilitate adoption. In addition to validating fluid handling and electrochemical tasks, we introduce two novel modular capabilities that enable PANDA-film to run sustained campaigns to study the wetting properties of films: (1) an electromagnetic capping/decapping system to mitigate fluid evaporation, and (2) a top-down optical method to determine water contact angle based upon reflectance. These capabilities are validated by depositing and characterizing a poly(allyl methacrylate) (PAMA) film using electrodeposition of polymer networks (EPoN). Comprehensive details for replicating the hardware and software of PANDA-film are included.</description>

      <title>Monitoring of structural changes in materials under the exposure of ionization radiation using a vibrating wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionizing radiation (X-rays, proton beams) causes structural changes in materials. If a vibrating metallic wire is subjected to such radiation, the natural frequency of the wire is affected as a result of changes in the elastic characteristics of the material. This paper presents the results of experiments on the impact of X-ray radiation in the range of 100-165 keV and a proton beam with energy 18 MeV on the structure of stainless steel wire. In case of proton irradiation an irreversible change in the wire frequency was observed, which indicated residual changes in the structure of the wire material. X-ray diffractometry methods were used to analyze the structural changes.</description>

      <title>The design and expected performance of the ALICE ITS3 upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the LHC Long Shutdown 3 (2026-29) ALICE will replace its three innermost tracking layers by a new detector, the "ITS3". It will be based on newly developed, wafer-scale monolithic active pixel sensors, which are bent into truly cylindrical layers and held in place by light mechanics made from carbon foam. Unprecedented low values of material budget (0.09\% $X_0$ per layer) and proximity to the interaction point (19 mm) lead to a factor two improvement in pointing resolutions for particles from very low $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ (O(100 MeV/$c$)), achieving, for example, 20 $\mu$m and 15 $\mu$m in the transversal and longitudinal directions, respectively, for 1 GeV/$c$ particles. After a successful R&amp;D phase (2019-2023), which demonstrated the feasibility of this innovative detector and led to the Technical Design Report (https://cds.cern.ch/record/2890181/), the final sensor and mechanics are being developed right now.
  This contribution will review the conceptual design and the main R&amp;D achievements, as well as the current activities and road to completion and installation. It includes a projection of the improved physics performance, in particular for heavy-flavor mesons and baryons, as well as for thermal dielectrons that will come into reach with this new detector installed.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Physics Instrument Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the use of large language models (LLMs) for physics instrument design and compare their performance to reinforcement learning (RL). Using only prompting, LLMs are given task constraints and summaries of prior high-scoring designs and propose complete detector configurations, which we evaluate with the same simulators and reward functions used in RL-based optimization. Although RL yields stronger final designs, we find that modern LLMs consistently generate valid, resource-aware, and physically meaningful configurations that draw on broad pretrained knowledge of detector design principles and particle--matter interactions, despite having no task-specific training. Based on this result, as a first step toward hybrid design workflows, we explore pairing the LLMs with a dedicated trust region optimizer, serving as a precursor to future pipelines in which LLMs propose and structure design hypotheses while RL performs reward-driven optimization. Based on these experiments, we argue that LLMs are well suited as meta-planners: they can design and orchestrate RL-based optimization studies, define search strategies, and coordinate multiple interacting components within a unified workflow. In doing so, they point toward automated, closed-loop instrument design in which much of the human effort required to structure and supervise optimization can be reduced.</description>

      <title>Performance of the Pair Spectrometer in Hall D at Jefferson Lab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article describes the performance of the pair spectrometer installed in experimental Hall D at Jefferson Lab and its operation in multiple experiments with the GlueX detector. The primary purpose of the pair spectrometer is the precise determination of the flux of beam photons incident on the GlueX target, a critical input for physics analyses such as absolute cross-section measurements. The photon energy spectrum is determined by reconstructing electron-positron pairs produced in a thin converter inserted into the photon beam. The spectrometer is integrated into the GlueX trigger system, enabling continuous real-time monitoring of the photon flux and the recording of $e^+e^-$ pair candidates for offline analysis. In addition, the pair spectrometer provides a versatile test facility for evaluating calorimeter prototypes using leptons with well-defined energies produced via electromagnetic pair production.</description>

      <title>Performance Benchmarks for 2-View and 3-View Fiber-Projection Fine-Grained Particle Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained scintillator detectors are critical for precision measurements in nuclear and particle physics, where accurate reconstruction of interaction vertices and secondary particle directions enables separation of signal from background events. A well-known design choice is the fiber readout geometry: traditional 2-View systems use orthogonal X and Y fibers, while next-generation 3-View designs add a third Z-fiber layer that provides unambiguous 3D voxel identification. The 2-View approach suffers from combinatorial ghost hits, that the false 3D candidates arising from fiber projection ambiguities, degrading reconstruction performance in high-multiplicity events. This paper presents comprehensive simulation benchmarks quantifying the performance difference between 2-View and 3-View geometries across key metrics. We find that the 3-View geometry reduces ghost hits by 30--90\% depending on event topology, provides robust vertex resolution across complex topologies, and maintains superior angular resolution for shower direction reconstruction. These benchmarks inform the design optimization of future detectors and provide quantitative guidance for reconstruction algorithm development across a broad range of experiments including neutrino physics, rare kaon/pion decays, and collider calorimetry.</description>

      <title>Sub-Pixel Electron Beam Alignment for Machine Learning Characterization of Hybrid Pixel Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their radiation hardness, kilohertz frame rates, and high dynamic range, hybrid pixel detectors have recently expanded their application range to electron diffraction and recently also electron imaging. However, these detectors typically have pixel sizes about ten times larger than those of direct electron detectors commonly used for imaging and more prominent electron multiple scattering effects. To overcome these limitations, machine learning approaches can be utilized to reconstruct the electron entrance point and achieve super-resolution. As this process is inherently stochastic, and machine learning relies on suitable training data, high-quality, representative training data are essential for developing models that achieve the best possible resolution. In this work, we present two novel experimental methods for generating such training data. The first method employs precise microscope alignment to scan the detector plane using a finely focused electron beam of 2 {\mu}m diameter, enabling controlled sub-pixel mapping. The second method utilizes specially designed aperture masks with sub-pixel-sized holes to accurately localize electron entry points. We developed and validated two experimental strategies for collecting training data at acceleration voltages of 60, 80, 120, and 200 keV, which enable sub-pixel labeling for hybrid pixel detectors. Notably, our methodology is broadly applicable to a wide range of hybrid pixel detectors.</description>

      <title>Noise2Void for Denoising Atomic Resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Noise2Void technique is demonstrated for successful denoising of atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images. The technique is applied to denoising atomic resolution images and videos of gold adatoms on a graphene surface within a graphene liquid cell, with the denoised experimental data qualitatively demonstrating improved visibility of both the Au adatoms and the graphene lattice. The denoising performance is quantified by comparison to similar simulated data and the approach is found to significantly outperform both total variation and simple Gaussian blurring. Compared to other denoising methods, the Noise2Void technique has the combined advantages that it requires no manual intervention during training or denoising, no prior knowledge of the sample and is compatible with real time data acquisition rates of at least 45 frames per second.</description>

      <title>CANISIUS The Austrian Neutron Spin Echo Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06216</link>

Abstract: The broad band resonant spin echo interferometer, CANISIUS, is presented. CANISIUS is built in a versatile way, such that it can be operated in both a continuous broad band beam or a pulsed Time of Flight beam. This versatility also extends to the modes available to the instrument, such as Neutron Resonant Spin Echo, Spin Echo (Modulated) Small Angle Neutron Scattering and coherent averaging to produce structured wavefunctions for scattering. The instrument may also be used as an interferometer, to probe fundamental questions in quantum mechanics. In this paper we detail both the continuous and Time of Flight options of the instruments. In addition we demonstrate the applicability of our interferometer to ultra small angle scattering in a white beam. Finally we demonstrate a new spin echo interferometry tool, which uses incomplete recombination of the two path states to generate composite wavefunctions with special structure. In particular we show that this method produces neutron wavefunctions that exist in a superposition of two quantum mechanical OAM modes, l =+1 or -1 We illustrate that just as this method can be used to generate certain structured waves, it may also be used to characterize the structure of the input wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Online Electron Reconstruction at CLAS12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online reconstruction is key for monitoring purposes and real time analysis in High Energy and Nuclear Physics experiments. A necessary component of reconstruction algorithms is particle identification that combines information left by a particle passing through several detector components to identify the particle's type. Of particular interest to electroproduction Nuclear Physics experiments such as CLAS12 is electron identification which is used to trigger data recording. A machine learning approach was developed for CLAS12 to reconstruct and identify electrons by combining raw signals at the data acquisition level from several detector components. This approach achieves an electron identification purity above 75% whilst retaining an efficiency close to 100%. The machine learning tools are capable of running at high rates exceeding the data acquisition rates and will allow electron reconstruction in real time. This work enhances online analyses and monitoring and can contribute to improved triggering at CLAS12. This machine learning driven approach will also be crucial for experiments aiming to transition to streaming readout operations where online reconstruction will be a key component of the data taking paradigm.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Sub-Percent Energy Resolution in the NEXT-100 Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NEXT-100 is a high-pressure xenon time projection chamber with electroluminescent amplification, designed to operate with up to approximately 70.5 kg at 13.5 bar. It is the most recent detector developed by the NEXT collaboration to search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay ($\beta\beta 0\nu$) of Xe-136. The NEXT gas TPC technology offers the best energy resolution near the Q-value of the decay ($Q_{\beta\beta}$ = 2458 keV) among xenon detectors, which is set by design to be &lt;1% FWHM. We report here the high-energy calibration of the detector using a Th-228 source, demonstrating linear response and an energy resolution of $(0.90 \pm 0.02)$% FWHM at the Tl-208 photopeak (2615 keV). This performance extrapolates to a resolution at the double-beta decay end-point of $R(Q_{\beta\beta})$ = $(0.93 \pm 0.02)$% FWHM, confirming the detector's capability for precision energy measurement in the search for $\beta\beta 0\nu$.</description>

      <title>High-throughput Parasitic-independent Probe Thermal Resistance Calibration for Robust Thermal Mapping with Scanning Thermal Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanostructured materials, critical for thermal management in semiconductor devices, exhibit a strong size dependence in thermal transport. Specifically, studying the variation of thermal resistance across grain boundaries is of critical importance in designing effective thermal interface materials for heterogeneous integration. Frequency-domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR)-based techniques can provide thermal resistance mapping in the micrometer ({\mu}m) length scale. Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) has the potential for quantification of local thermal transport with orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution (&lt; 100 nm). However, challenges in the accurate quantification of the raw signal to thermal conductivity and surface sensitivity limit its widespread adoption as a characterization standard for understanding nanoscale heat transport and defect-mediated thermal properties modulation in nanostructured films. Here, we introduce a circuit-based probe thermal resistance (Rp) calibration technique that is independent of any parasitic heat transport pathways; thus, the calibration allows accurate determination of the heat dissipated from the SThM probe and the resulting tip temperature increase, thereby enabling extraction of the local thermal resistance of the film. In this study, SThM achieved sub-100 nm spatial resolution in mapping thermal resistance across a 15 nm-thick Al film deposited via e-beam evaporation on SiO2 substrate. Finally, the thermal resistance mapping is converted to thermal conductivity using the finite element modeling-based calibration technique, where the average of the pixel-level Rc values yields the effective thermal conductivity of 2.87 +/- 0.18 W/m.K, in good agreement with published theoretical frameworks explaining heat transport modes in ultra-thin Al.</description>

      <title>Using Open Source EDA Tools in ASICs for HEP: A Mixed Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work compares open-source electronic design automation tools with a commercial environment using three representative integrated circuit blocks in the IHP 130 nm open PDK: a common-mode noise filter, a finite-state machine, and a voltage-controlled oscillator. The study reports design effort and quality of results for digital logic, including area, power, and timing closure, and examines analog layout feasibility. For the finite-state machine at 50 MHz, the open-source flow reached 0.029 mm$^2$ (post-layout) and 4.37 mW (estimated) with 828 standard cells, whereas the commercial flow achieved 0.019 mm$^2$ and 2.00 mW with 497 cells, corresponding to increases of 53\% in area and 118\% in power. The common-mode noise filter totals 1.879 mm$^2$ with 1703 flip-flops at 50 MHz. The voltage-controlled oscillator occupies 0.0025 mm$^2$ and achieves a simulated maximum oscillation frequency of 2.65 GHz. The contribution is a side-by-side quantification of quality of results across digital and analog blocks in the IHP open PDK. The results indicate that open-source tools are viable for early prototyping, training, and collaboration, while commercial flows retain advantages in automation and quality of results when strict targets on power and area or precision analog layout are required.</description>

      <title>Performance of an LYSO-Based Active Converter for a Photon Pair-Spectrometer aiming for 52.8 MeV photon detection in Future $\mu^+ \to e^+ \gamma$ Search Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For future $\mu^+ \to e^+ \gamma$ search experiments with a branching-ratio sensitivity of $10^{-15}$, we are developing a photon pair-spectrometer employing an active LYSO converter, aiming at target resolutions of 30 ps in timing and 200 keV in energy measurement for detecting 52.8 MeV photons. The converter generates electron-positron pairs from incident photons while simultaneously measuring their energy deposition and timing. On the basis of simulation studies, we optimized the converter thickness and segment dimensions, and accordingly fabricated prototype LYSO segments. Their single-MIP detection performance was evaluated using an electron beam at the KEK PF-AR test beamline. The prototypes exhibited excellent performance, achieving a time resolution of 25 ps and a light yield of $10^4$ photoelectrons, both substantially surpassing the design requirements.</description>

      <title>First Light from Beam Neutrinos on an LAPPD in ANNIE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Accelerator Neutrino Neutron Interaction Experiment (ANNIE) is both a physics experiment and a technology testbed for next-generation light-based neutrino detection. In this paper, we report the first demonstration of a fully integrated Large Area Picosecond Photodetector (LAPPD) operating in a running neutrino beam experiment. Particular focus is given to the design, commissioning, and successful deployment of the Packaged ANNIE LAPPD (PAL), a waterproof, self-triggering module incorporating fast waveform digitization and precision timing synchronized to the ANNIE detector subsystems. We identify beam-correlated LAPPD data frames consistent with charged-current neutrino interactions observed in multiple detector subsystems, establishing the first detection of neutrino-induced Cherenkov light with an LAPPD. These results validate the system-level performance of LAPPDs under realistic experimental conditions-including long-term stability, timing synchronization, and event matching with conventional PMT and muon detector systems-marking a critical step toward their deployment in future large-scale neutrino and particle detectors.</description>
