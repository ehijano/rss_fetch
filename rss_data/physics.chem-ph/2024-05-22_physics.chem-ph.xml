      <title>Multi-task learning for molecular electronic structure approaching coupled-cluster accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) plays an important role in quantum chemistry, providing fast-to-evaluate predictive models for various properties of molecules. However, as most existing ML models for molecular electronic properties use density function theory (DFT) databases as the ground truth in training, their prediction accuracy cannot go beyond the DFT. In this work, we developed a unified ML method for electronic structures of organic molecules using the gold-standard CCSD(T) calculations as training data. Tested on hydrocarbon molecules, our model outperforms the DFT with the widely-used B3LYP functional in both computation costs and prediction accuracy of various quantum chemical properties. We apply the model to aromatic compounds and semiconducting polymers on both ground state and excited state properties, demonstrating its accuracy and generalization capability to complex systems that are hard to calculate using CCSD(T)-level methods.</description>

      <title>Charge-transport forecasted via deep learning in the photosystem II reaction center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting future physical behavior through the limited theoretical simulation data available is an emerging research paradigm resulted by the integration of artificial intelligence technology and quantum physics. In this work, the charge-transport(CT) behavior was forecasted over a long time by a deep learning model, the long short-term memory (LSTM) network with error threshold training method in the photosynthesis II reaction center (PSII-RC). The theoretical simulation data within 8 fs was fed to the modified LSTM network for training, which brings out a distinct prediction with difference of $10^{-4}$ orders of magnitude over a long time period compared to the collection time for training sets. The results indicate the potential of employing LSTM to reveal the physics governing CT in addition to quantum physical methods. The implications of this work warrant further investigation to fully elucidate the scope and efficacy of LSTM for advancing our understanding of photosynthesis at the molecular scale.</description>

      <title>Exploring Ground and Excited States via Single Reference Coupled-Cluster Theory and Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of the root structure of coupled cluster equations holds both foundational and practical significance for computational quantum chemistry. This study provides insight into the intricate root structures of these non-linear equations at both the CCD and CCSD level of theory. We utilize computational techniques from algebraic geometry, specifically the monodromy and parametric homotopy continuation methods, to calculate the full solution set. We compare the computed CC roots against various established theoretical upper bounds, shedding light on the accuracy and efficiency of these bounds. We hereby focus on the dissociation processes of four-electron systems such as (H$_2$)$_2$ in both D$_{2{\rm h}}$ and D$_{\infty {\rm h}}$ configurations, H$_4$ symmetrically distorted on a circle, and lithium hydride. We moreover investigate the ability of single-reference coupled cluster solutions to approximate excited state energies. We find that multiple CC roots describe energies of excited states with high accuracy. Remarkably, our investigations reveal that for systems like lithium hydride, CC not only provides high-accuracy approximations to several excited state energies but also to the states themselves.</description>

      <title>GW with hybrid functionals for large molecular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A low-cost approach for stochastically sampling static exchange during TDHF-type propagation is presented. This enables the use of an excellent hybrid DFT starting point for stochastic GW quasiparticle energy calculations. Generalized Kohn-Sham molecular orbitals and energies, rather than those of a local-DFT calculation, are used for building the Green's function and effective Coulomb interaction. The use of an optimally tuned hybrid diminishes the starting point dependency in one-shot stochastic GW, effectively avoiding the need for self-consistent GW iterations.</description>

      <title>A Phase Space Approach to Vibrational Circular Dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show empirically that a phase-space non-Born-Oppenheimer electronic Hamiltonian approach to quantum chemistry (where the electronic Hamiltonian is parameterized by both nuclear position and momentum, (H(R,P)) is both a practical and accurate means to recover vibrational circular dichroism spectra. We further hypothesize that such a phase space approach may lead to very new dynamical physics beyond spectroscopy circular dichroism, with potential implications for understanding chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS), noting that classical phase space approaches conserve the total nuclear plus electronic momentum, whereas classical Born-Oppenheimer approaches do not (they conserve only the nuclear momentum)</description>

      <title>A modified expression for the Hamiltonian expectation value exploiting the short-range behavior of the wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expectation value of the Hamiltonian using a model wave function is widely used to estimate the eigenvalues of electronic Hamiltonians. We explore here a modified formula for models based on long-range interaction. It scales differently the singlet and triplet component of the repulsion between electrons not present in the model (its short-range part). The scaling factors depend uniquely on the parameter used in defining the model interaction, and are constructed using only exact properties. We show results for the ground states and low-lying excited states of Harmonium with two to six electrons. We obtain important improvements for the estimation of the exact energy, not only over the model energy, but also over the expectation value of the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>More than just smoke and mirrors: Gas-phase polaritons for optical control of chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas phase molecules are a promising platform through which to elucidate the mechanisms of action and scope of polaritons for optical control of chemistry. Polaritons arise from the strong coupling of a dipole-allowed molecular transition with the photonic mode of an optical cavity. There is mounting evidence of modified reactivity under polaritonic conditions; however, the complex condensed-phase environment of most experimental demonstrations impedes mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon. While the gas phase was the playground of early efforts in atomic cavity quantum electrodynamics, we have only recently demonstrated the formation of molecular polaritons under these conditions. Studying the reactivity of isolated gas-phase molecules under strong coupling would eliminate solvent interactions and enable quantum state resolution of reaction progress. In this Perspective, we contextualize recent gas-phase efforts in the field of polariton chemistry and offer a practical guide for experiment design moving forward.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy factor spectra for weakly allowed electronic transitions in chiral ketones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chemical calculations of one-photon absorption, electronic circular dichroism and anisotropy factor spectra for the A-band transition of fenchone, camphor and 3-methylcyclopentanone (3MCP) are reported. While the only weakly allowed nature of the transition leads to comparatively large anisotropies, a proper theoretical description of the absorption for such a transition requires to account for non-Condon effects. We present experimental data for the anisotropy of 3MCP in the liquid phase and show that corresponding Herzberg-Teller corrections are critical to reproduce the main experimental features. The results obtained with our comprehensive theoretical model highlight the importance of the vibrational degree of freedom, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the dynamics in electronic circular dichroism.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order correlators in electronic structure using Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator spreading has profound implications in diverse fields ranging from statistical mechanics and blackhole physics to quantum information. The usual way to quantify it is through out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), which are the quantum analog to Lyapunov exponents in classical chaotic dynamics. In this work we explore the phenomenon of operator spreading in quantum simulation of electronic structure in quantum computers. To substantiate our results, we focus on a hydrogen chain $H_4$ and demonstrate that operator spreading is enhanced when the chain is far from its equilibrium geometry. We also investigate the dynamics of bipartite entanglement and its dependence on the partition's size. Our findings reveal distinctive signatures closely resembling area- and volume-laws in equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium geometries, respectively. Our results provide insight of operator spreading of coherent errors in quantum simulation of electronic structure and can be experimentally implemented in various platforms available today.</description>

      <title>Entropy Production by Underdamped Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy production (EP) is a central quantity in nonequilibrium physics as it monitors energy dissipation, reversibility, and free energy differences during thermodynamic transformations. Estimating EP, however, is challenging both theoretically and experimentally due to limited access to the system dynamics. For overdamped Langevin dynamics and Markov jump processes it was recently proposed that, from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TUR), short-time cumulant currents can be used to estimate EP without knowledge of the dynamics. Yet, estimation of EP in underdamped Langevin systems remains an active challenge. To address this, we derive a modified TUR that relates the statistics of two specific novel currents -- one cumulant current and one stochastic current -- to a system's EP. These two distinct but related currents are used to constrain EP in the modified TUR. One highlight is that there always exists a family of currents such that the uncertainty relations saturate, even for long-time averages and in nonsteady-state scenarios. Another is that our method only requires limited knowledge of the dynamics -- specifically, the damping-coefficient to mass ratio and the diffusion constant. This uncertainty relation allows estimating EP for both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics. We validate the method numerically, through applications to several underdamped systems, to underscore the flexibility in obtaining EP in nonequilibrium Langevin systems.</description>

      <title>Nano-gap electrode dielectrophoresis for tether-free trapping and interferometric-scattering detection of single 20 nm particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate detection and characterization of nanoparticles within confined spaces is crucial for applications ranging from nanofluidics to biotechnology. We present a novel approach that combines interferometric scattering (iSCAT) detection with trapping by dielectrophoresis (DEP) to achieve label-free detection of nanoparticles that are trapped and/or actuated between nano-gap electrodes. DEP utilizes the interaction between the induced dipole of the particle and the applied electric field to create a trapping potential. We demonstrate our method by trapping and label-free detection of down to 20 nm polystyrene nanoparticles. Additionally, we demonstrate that the signal-to-noise ratio of our detection can be boosted up to 20-fold by periodic actuation of the nanoparticle in the trap. This is done by a digital lock-in detection scheme on the modulated scattering signal. Our method holds promise for various applications, including assembly of nanoparticles, single-particle property analysis, and nanofluidic devices.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining conformational dynamics with multi-dimensional generalized Langevin equation: how, when, and why</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A data-driven ab initio generalized Langevin equation (AIGLE) approach is developed to learn and simulate high-dimensional, heterogeneous, coarse-grained conformational dynamics. Constrained by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, the approach can build coarse-grained models in dynamical consistency with all-atom molecular dynamics. We also propose practical criteria for AIGLE to enforce long-term dynamical consistency. Case studies of a toy polymer, with 20 coarse-grained sites, and the alanine dipeptide, with two dihedral angles, elucidate why one should adopt AIGLE or its Markovian limit for modeling coarse-grained conformational dynamics in practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the condensation of fluids confined by a pair of non-parallel plates of finite height $H$. We show that such a system experiences two types of condensation, termed single- and double-pinning, which can be characterized by one (single-pinning) or two (double-pinning) edge contact angles describing the shape of menisci pinned at the system edges. For both types of capillary condensation we formulate the Kelvin-like equation and determine the conditions under which the given type of condensation occurs. We construct the global phase diagram revealing a reentrant phenomenon pertinent to the change of the capillary condensation type upon varying the inclination of the walls. Asymptotic properties of the system are discussed and a link with related phase phenomena in different systems is made. Finally, we show that the change from a single- to a double-pinned state is a continuous transition, the character of which depends on the wetting properties of the walls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond-fast and nanometre-size pulses of electrons are emerging as unique probes for ultrafast dynamics at the nanoscale. Presently, such pulses are achievable only in highly sophisticated ultrafast electron microscopes or equally complex setups involving few-cycle-pulsed lasers with stable carrier-envelope phase (CEP) and nanotip probes. Here, we show that the generation of femtosecond pulses of nanoscale tunnelling electrons can be achieved in any ultrafast optical laboratory, using any (deep-UV to mid-IR) femtosecond laser in combination with photosensitive asymmetric nanogap (PAN) diodes fabricated via easy-to-scale adhesion lithography. The dominant mechanism producing tunnelling electrons in PANs is strong-field emission, which is easily achievable without CEP locking or external bias voltage. We employ PANs to demonstrate ultrafast nanoscopy of metal-halide perovskite quantum dots immobilised inside a 10-nm Al/Au nanogap and to characterise laser pulses across the entire optical region (266-6700 nm). Short electron pulses in PANs open the way towards scalable on-chip femtosecond electron measurements and novel design approaches for integrated ultrafast sensing nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Energy Rank Alignment: Using Preference Optimization to Search Chemical Space at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searching through chemical space is an exceptionally challenging problem because the number of possible molecules grows combinatorially with the number of atoms. Large, autoregressive models trained on databases of chemical compounds have yielded powerful generators, but we still lack robust strategies for generating molecules with desired properties. This molecular search problem closely resembles the "alignment" problem for large language models, though for many chemical tasks we have a specific and easily evaluable reward function. Here, we introduce an algorithm called energy rank alignment (ERA) that leverages an explicit reward function to produce a gradient-based objective that we use to optimize autoregressive policies. We show theoretically that this algorithm is closely related to proximal policy optimization (PPO) and direct preference optimization (DPO), but has a minimizer that converges to an ideal Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution with the reward playing the role of an energy function. Furthermore, this algorithm is highly scalable, does not require reinforcement learning, and performs well relative to DPO when the number of preference observations per pairing is small. We deploy this approach to align molecular transformers to generate molecules with externally specified properties and find that it does so robustly, searching through diverse parts of chemical space. While our focus here is on chemical search, we also obtain excellent results on an AI supervised task for LLM alignment, showing that the method is scalable and general.</description>

      <title>Orbital-optimized versus time-dependent density functional calculations of intramolecular charge transfer excited states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01604v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of time-independent, orbital optimized calculations of excited states is assessed with respect to charge transfer excitations in organic molecules in comparison to the linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) approach. A direct optimization method to converge on saddle points of the electronic energy surface is used to carry out calculations with the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals PBE and BLYP for a set of 27 excitations in 15 molecules. The time-independent approach is fully variational and provides a relaxed excited state electron density from which the extent of charge transfer is quantified. The TD-DFT calculations are generally found to provide larger charge transfer distances compared to the orbital optimized calculations, even when including orbital relaxation effects with the Z-vector method. While the error on the excitation energy relative to theoretical best estimates is found to increase with the extent of charge transfer up to ca. $-2$ eV for TD-DFT, no correlation is observed for the orbital optimized approach. The orbital optimized calculations with the LDA and the GGA functionals provide a mean absolute error of $\sim$0.7 eV, outperforming TD-DFT with both local and global hybrid functionals for excitations with long-range charge transfer character. Orbital optimized calculations with the global hybrid functional B3LYP and the range-separated hybrid functional CAM-B3LYP on a selection of states with short- and long-range charge transfer indicate that inclusion of exact exchange has a small effect on the charge transfer distance, while it significantly improves the excitation energy, with the best performing functional CAM-B3LYP providing an absolute error typically around 0.15 eV.</description>

      <title>Molecular chirality quantification: Tools and benchmarks</title>

Abstract: Molecular chirality has traditionally been viewed as a binary property where a molecule is classified as either chiral or achiral, yet in the recent decades mathematical methods for quantifying chirality have been explored. Here we use toy molecular systems to systematically compare the performance of two state of the art chirality measures (1) the Continuous Chirality Measure (CCM) and (2) the Chirality Characteristic ($\chi$). We find that both methods exhibit qualitatively similar behavior when applied to simple molecular systems such as a four-site molecule or the polymer double-helix, but we show that the CCM may be more suitable for evaluating the chirality of arbitrary molecules or abstract structures such as normal vibrational modes. We discuss a range of considerations for applying these methods to molecular systems in general, and we provide links to user-friendly codes for both methods. We aim this paper to serve as a concise resource for scientists attempting to familiarize themselves with these chirality measures or attempting to implement chirality measures in their own work.</description>

      <title>Coupling Polyatomic Molecules to Lossy Nanocavities: Lindblad versus Schr\"odinger description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of cavities to impact molecular structure and dynamics has become popular. As cavities, in particular plasmonic nanocavities, are lossy and the lifetime of their modes can be very short, their lossy nature must be incorporated into the calculations. The Lindblad master equation is commonly considered as an appropriate tool to describe this lossy nature. This approach requires the dynamics of the density operator and is thus substantially more costly than approaches employing the Schr\"odinger equation for the quantum wave function when several or many nuclear degrees of freedom are involved. In this work we compare numerically the Lindblad and Schr\"odinger descriptions discussed in the literature for a molecular example where the cavity is pumped by a laser. The laser and cavity properties are varied over a range of parameters. It is found that the Schr\"odinger description adequately describes the dynamics of the polaritons and emission signal as long as the laser intensity is moderate and the pump time is not much longer than the lifetime of the cavity mode. Otherwise, it is demonstrated that the Schr\"odinger description gradually fails. We also show that the failure of the Schr\"odinger description can often be remedied by renormalizing the wave function at every step of the time propagation. The results are discussed and analyzed.</description>

      <title>Going for Gold(-Standard): Attaining Coupled Cluster Accuracy in Oxide-Supported Nanoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure of oxide-supported metal nanoclusters plays an essential role in their sharply enhanced catalytic activity over bulk metals. Simulations provide the atomic-scale resolution needed to understand these systems. However, the sensitive mix of metal-metal and metal-support interactions which govern their structure puts stringent requirements on the method used, requiring going beyond standard density functional theory (DFT). The method of choice is coupled cluster theory [specifically CCSD(T)], but its computational cost has so far prevented applications. In this work, we showcase two approaches to make CCSD(T) accuracy readily achievable in oxide-supported nanoclusters. First, we leverage the SKZCAM protocol to provide the first benchmarks of oxide-supported nanoclusters, revealing that it is specifically metal-metal interactions that are challenging to capture with DFT. Second, we propose a CCSD(T) correction ($\Delta$CC) to the metal-metal interaction errors in DFT, reaching comparable accuracy to the SKZCAM protocol at significantly lower cost. This forges a path towards studying larger systems at reliable accuracy, which we highlight by identifying a ground state structure in agreement with experiments for Au$_{20}$ on MgO; a challenging system where DFT models have yielded conflicting predictions.</description>

      <title>A Novel Class of Phase Space Representations for the Exact Population Dynamics of Two-State Quantum Systems and the Relation to Triangle Window Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isomorphism of the two-state system is heuristic in understanding the dynamical or statistical behavior of the simplest yet most quantum system that has no classical counterpart. We use the constraint phase space developed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 204105; 2019, 151, 024105 and J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 2496-2501, non-covariant phase space functions, time-dependent weight functions, and time-dependent normalization factors to construct a novel class of phase space representations of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system. The equations of motion of the trajectory on constraint phase space are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression for the population dynamics is always positive semi-definite. We also prove that the triangle window function approach, albeit proposed as a heuristic empirical model in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 144108, is related to a special case of the novel class and leads to an isomorphic representation of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system.</description>

      <title>Conditions for enhancement of chemical reactions in gas phase inside a dark cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancing chemical reactions, such as $A+B \to [\textit{activated complex}]^\# \to C+D$, in gas phase through its coupling to quantum-electrodynamics (QED) modes in a dark cavity is investigated. The main result is that the enhancement of the reaction rate by a dark cavity is for asymmetric reactions (products different from reactants.) Notice that in addition to the cavity been dark, the reactants are in their ground electronic and vibrational states, i.e., it is indeed dark. Theoretical derivation, utilizing the non-Hermitian formalism of quantum mechanics (NHQM), provides conditions and guidelines for selecting the proper type of reactions that can be enhanced by a dark cavity. Nevertheless, the time-dependent simulations of such experiments can be carried out using the standard (Hermitian) scattering theory (but including the conditions derived via NHQM). We believe that this work opens a gate to new types of studies and hopefully helps to close the gap between theory and experiments in this fascinating, relatively new field of research. As an example, we demonstrate that the asymmetric reaction rates of $O+D_2\to [ODD]^{\#} \to OD+D$ and $H+ArCl \to [ArHCl]^{\#} \to H+Ar+Cl$ can be enhanced by a dark cavity. Contrary, the dark cavity effect on the symmetric reaction of hydrogen exchange in methane will be negligible.</description>

      <title>Collective Quantum Entanglement in Molecular Cavity Optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an optomechanical scheme for reaching quantum entanglement in vibration polaritons. The system involves $N$ molecules, whose vibrations can be fairly entangled with plasmonic cavities. We find that the vibration-photon entanglement can exist at room temperature and is robust against thermal noise. We further demonstrate the quantum entanglement between the vibrational modes through the plasmonic cavities, which shows a delocalized nature and an incredible enhancement with the number of molecules. The underlying mechanism for the entanglement is attributed to the strong vibration-cavity coupling which possesses collectivity. Our results provide a molecular optomechanical scheme which offers a promising platform for the study of noise-free quantum resources and macroscopic quantum phenomena.</description>
