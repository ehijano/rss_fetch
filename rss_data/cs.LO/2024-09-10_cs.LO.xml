      <title>Deciding the synthesis problem for hybrid games through bisimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid games are games played on a finite graph endowed with real variables which may model behaviors of discrete controllers of continuous systems. The synthesis problem for hybrid games is decidable for classical objectives (like LTL formulas) when the games are initialized singular, meaning that the slopes of the continuous variables are piecewise constant and variables are reset whenever their slope changes. The known proof adapts the region construction from timed games. In this paper we show that initialized singular games can be reduced, via a sequence of alternating bisimulations, to timed games, generalizing the known reductions by bisimulation from initialized singular automata to timed automata. Alternating bisimulation is the generalization of bisimulation to games, accomodating a strategy translation lemma by which, when two games are bisimilar and carry the same observations, each strategy in one of the games can be translated to a strategy in the second game such that all the outcomes of the second strategy satisfies the same property that are satisfied by the first strategy. The advantage of the proposed approach is that one may then use realizability tools for timed games to synthesize a winning strategy for a given objective, and then use the strategy translation lemma to obtain a winning strategy in the hybrid game for the same objective.</description>

      <title>Parf: Adaptive Parameter Refining for Abstract Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The core challenge in applying abstract interpretation lies in the configuration of abstraction and analysis strategies encoded by a large number of external parameters of static analysis tools. To attain low false-positive rates (i.e., accuracy) while preserving analysis efficiency, tuning the parameters heavily relies on expert knowledge and is thus difficult to automate. In this paper, we present a fully automated framework called Parf to adaptively tune the external parameters of abstract interpretation-based static analyzers. Parf models various types of parameters as random variables subject to probability distributions over latticed parameter spaces. It incrementally refines the probability distributions based on accumulated intermediate results generated by repeatedly sampling and analyzing, thereby ultimately yielding a set of highly accurate parameter settings within a given time budget. We have implemented Parf on top of Frama-C/Eva - an off-the-shelf open-source static analyzer for C programs - and compared it against the expert refinement strategy and Frama-C/Eva's official configurations over the Frama-C OSCS benchmark. Experimental results indicate that Parf achieves the lowest number of false positives on 34/37 (91.9%) program repositories with exclusively best results on 12/37 (32.4%) cases. In particular, Parf exhibits promising performance for analyzing complex, large-scale real-world programs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we take first steps toward developing defeasible reasoning on concepts in KLM framework. We define generalizations of cumulative reasoning system C and cumulative reasoning system with loop CL to conceptual setting. We also generalize cumulative models, cumulative ordered models, and preferential models to conceptual setting and show the soundness and completeness results for these models.</description>

      <title>A Fibrational Theory of First Order Differential Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a categorical framework for reasoning about abstract properties of differentiation, based on the theory of fibrations. Our work encompasses the first-order fragments of several existing categorical structures for differentiation, including cartesian differential categories, generalised cartesian differential categories, tangent categories, as well as the versions of these categories axiomatising reverse derivatives. We explain uniformly and concisely the requirements expressed by these structures, using sections of suitable fibrations as unifying concept. Our perspective sheds light on their similarities and differences, as well as simplifying certain constructions from the literature.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Logical Zonotope: A Set Representation for Reachability Analysis of Logical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a set representation called polynomial logical zonotopes for performing exact and computationally efficient reachability analysis on logical systems. We prove that through this polynomial-like construction, we are able to perform all of the fundamental logical operations (XOR, NOT, XNOR, AND, NAND, OR, NOR) between sets of points exactly in a reduced space, i.e., generator space with reduced complexity. Polynomial logical zonotopes are a generalization of logical zonotopes, which are able to represent up to $2^n$ binary vectors using only $n$ generators. Due to their construction, logical zonotopes are only able to support exact computations of some logical operations (XOR, NOT, XNOR), while other operations (AND, NAND, OR, NOR) result in over-approximations in the generator space. In order to perform all fundamental logical operations exactly, we formulate a generalization of logical zonotopes that is constructed by dependent generators and exponent matrices. While we are able to perform all of the logical operations exactly, this comes with a slight increase in computational complexity compared to logical zonotopes. To illustrate and showcase the computational benefits of polynomial logical zonotopes, we present the results of performing reachability analysis on two use cases: (1) safety verification of an intersection crossing protocol and (2) reachability analysis on a high-dimensional Boolean function. Moreover, to highlight the extensibility of logical zonotopes, we include an additional use case where we perform a computationally tractable exhaustive search for the key of a linear feedback shift register.</description>

      <title>Completions of Kleene's second model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14656v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate completions of partial combinatory algebras (pcas), in particular of Kleene's second model $\mathcal{K}_2$ and generalizations thereof. We consider weak and strong notions of embeddability and completion that have been studied before in the literature. It is known that every countable pca can be weakly embedded into $\mathcal{K}_2$, and we generalize this to arbitrary cardinalities by considering generalizations of $\mathcal{K}_2$ for larger cardinals. This emphasizes the central role of $\mathcal{K}_2$ in the study of pcas. We also show that $\mathcal{K}_2$ and its generalizations have strong completions.</description>

      <title>Cut elimination for Cyclic Proofs: A Case Study in Temporal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider modal logic extended with the well-known temporal operator `eventually' and provide a cut-elimination procedure for a cyclic sequent calculus that captures this fragment. The work showcases an adaptation of the reductive cut-elimination method to cyclic calculi. Notably, the proposed algorithm applies to a cyclic proof and directly outputs a cyclic cut-free proof without appealing to intermediate machinery for regularising the end proof.</description>

      <title>QBF Merge Resolution is powerful but unnatural</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13428v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Merge Resolution proof system (M-Res) for QBFs, proposed by Beyersdorff et al. in 2019, explicitly builds partial strategies inside refutations. The original motivation for this approach was to overcome the limitations encountered in long-distance Q-Resolution proof system (LD-Q-Res), where the syntactic side-conditions, while prohibiting all unsound resolutions, also end up prohibiting some sound resolutions. However, while the advantage of M-Res over many other resolution-based QBF proof systems was already demonstrated, a comparison with LD-Q-Res itself had remained open. In this paper, we settle this question. We show that M-Res has an exponential advantage over not only LD-Q-Res, but even over LQU$^+$-Res and IRM, the most powerful among currently known resolution-based QBF proof systems. Combining this with results from Beyersdorff et al. 2020, we conclude that M-Res is incomparable with LQU-Res and LQU$^+$-Res. Our proof method reveals two additional and curious features about M-Res: (i) M-Res is not closed under restrictions, and is hence not a natural proof system, and (ii) weakening axiom clauses with existential variables provably yields an exponential advantage over M-Res without weakening. We further show that in the context of regular derivations, weakening axiom clauses with universal variables provably yields an exponential advantage over M-Res without weakening. These results suggest that M-Res is better used with weakening, though whether M-Res with weakening is closed under restrictions remains open. We note that even with weakening, M-Res continues to be simulated by eFrege $+$ $\forall$red (the simulation of ordinary M-Res was shown recently by Chew and Slivovsky).</description>

      <title>Unified Fairness for Weak Memory Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the verification of omega-regular linear temporal properties of concurrent programs running under weak memory semantics. We observe that in particular, these properties may enforce liveness clauses, whose verification in this context is seldom studied. The challenge lies in precluding demonic nondeterminism arising due to scheduling, as well as due to multiple possible causes of weak memory consistency. We systematically account for the latter with a generic operational model of programs running under weak memory semantics, which can be instantiated to a host of memory models. This generic model serves as the formal basis for our definitions of fairness to preclude demonic nondeterminism: we provide both language-theoretic and probabilistic versions, and prove them equivalent in the context of the verification of omega-regular linear temporal properties. As a corollary of this proof, we obtain that under our fairness assumptions, both qualitative and quantitative verification Turing-reduce to close variants of control state reachability: a safety-verification problem.
  A preliminary version of this article titled "Overcoming Memory Weakness with Unified Fairness" appeared in the proceedings of CAV 2023.</description>

      <title>On the Expressivity of Recurrent Neural Cascades with Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Cascades (RNC) are the class of recurrent neural networks with no cyclic dependencies among recurrent neurons. Their subclass RNC+ with positive recurrent weights has been shown to be closely connected to the star-free regular languages, which are the expressivity of many well-established temporal logics. The existing expressivity results show that the regular languages captured by RNC+ are the star-free ones, and they leave open the possibility that RNC+ may capture languages beyond regular. We exclude this possibility for languages that include an identity element, i.e., an input that can occur an arbitrary number of times without affecting the output. Namely, in the presence of an identity element, we show that the languages captured by RNC+ are exactly the star-free regular languages. Identity elements are ubiquitous in temporal patterns, and hence our results apply to a large number of applications. The implications of our results go beyond expressivity. At their core, we establish a close structural correspondence between RNC+ and semiautomata cascades, showing that every neuron can be equivalently captured by a three-state semiautomaton. A notable consequence of this result is that RNC+ are no more succinct than cascades of three-state semiautomata.</description>
