      <title>Algebraic and Topological Persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis addresses the theory of topological spaces and the foundations of persistence theory. We will discuss chain complexes and the associated simplicial homology groups, as well as their relationship with singular homology theory. Moreover, we present the fundamental concepts of algebraic topology, including exact and short exact sequences and relative homology groups derived from quotienting with subspaces of a topological space. These tools are used to prove the Excision Theorem in algebraic topology. Subsequently, the theorem is applied to demonstrate the equivalence of simplicial and singular homology for triangulable topological spaces, i.e. those topological spaces which admit a simplicial structure. This enables a more general theory of homology to be adopted in the study of filtrations of point clouds. The chapter on homological persistence makes use of these tools throughout. We develop the theory of persistent homology, the homology of filtrations of topological spaces, and the corresponding dual concept of persistent cohomology. This work aims to provide mathematicians with a robust foundation for productive engagement with the aforementioned theories. The majority of the proofs have been rewritten to clarify the relationships between the techniques discussed. The novel aspect of this contribution is the canonical presentation of persistence theory and the associated ideas through a rigorous mathematical treatment for triangulable topological spaces and closing some gaps in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Filtered spaces, filtered objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a operation on categories enriched in filtered spaces, whose effect is to turn categories of $E_1$-pages into categories of $E_2$-pages. This allows us to give a homotopical versions of several results that were previously implemented using $E_2$-model structures or more sophisticated machinery in higher algebra.
  We find that we can recover the homotopy theory of spaces from this page-turning operation on the homotopy theory of CW-complexes and filtration-shifting maps, a version of the cellular approximation theorem. In the category of filtered spectra, we show that this implements the procedure on filtered spectra sending the homotopy exact couple to its associated derived couple. Finally, we recover Pstragowski's category of synthetic spectra from applying this page-turning operation to the category of filtered modules over a spectral version of the Rees ring.</description>

      <title>An operadic proof of the BTT Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we explain an operadic proof of the BTT Theorem stating that the deformation theory of Calabi-Yau varieties is unobstructed. We also provide a short new proof of the non-commutative BTT for Calabi-Yau dg-categories. Finally, we observe that our proof also produces partial results in positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>Bounding the A-hat genus using scalar curvature lower bounds and isoperimetric constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove an upper bound on the $\widehat{A}$ genus of a smooth, closed, spin Riemannian manifold using its scalar curvature lower bound, Neumann isoperimetric constant, and volume. The proof of this result relies on spectral analysis of the Dirac operator. We also construct an example to show that the Neumann isoperimetric constant in this bound is necessary. Our result partially answers a question of Gromov on bounding characteristic numbers using scalar curvature lower bound.</description>

      <title>Residual finiteness of some automorphism groups of high dimensional manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for a smooth, closed 2-connected manifold $M$ of dimension $d \geq 6$, the topological mapping class group $\pi_0 \mathrm{Homeo}(M)$ is residually finite, in contrast to the situation for the smooth mapping class group $\pi_0 \mathrm{Diff}(M)$. Combined with a result of Sullivan, this implies that $\pi_0 \mathrm{Homeo}(M)$ is an arithmetic group. The proof uses embedding calculus, and is of independent interest: we show that the $T_k$-mapping class group, $\pi_0 T_k \mathrm{Diff}(M)$, is residually finite, for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$. The statement on the topological mapping class group is then deduced from the Weiss fibre sequence, convergence of the embedding calculus tower and smoothing theory.</description>

      <title>Tautological Rings of Fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.02676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the analogue of tautological rings of fibre bundles in the context of fibrations with Poincar\' e fibre, i.e. the ring obtained by fibre integrating powers of the fibrewise Euler class. We discuss how to compute the Euler ring with tools from rational homotopy theory and completely determine the tautological ring for even spheres, complex projective spaces and some products of odd spheres.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative divergence and the Turaev cobracket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16566v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The divergence map, an important ingredient in the algebraic description of the Turaev cobracket on a connected oriented compact surface with boundary, is reformulated in the context of non-commutative geometry using a flat connection on the space of 1-forms on a formally smooth associative algebra. We then extend this construction to the case of associative algebras with any finite cohomological dimension, which allows us to give a similar algebraic description of the Turaev cobracket on a closed surface. We also look into a relation between the Satoh trace and the divergence map on a free Lie algebra via geometry over Lie operad.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a comparison result between two duality statements - Takai duality, which is implemented by the crossed product functor $- \rtimes G: KK^{G} \to KK^{\hat G}$ on equivariant Kasparov categories; and Treumann duality, which asserts the existence of an exotic equivalence of stable $\infty$-categories $\text{Mod}(KU_p[G])^{ft} \simeq \text{Mod}(KU_p[\hat G])^{ft}$ given by tensoring with a particular $(G,\hat G)$-bimodule $M_E$ and $p$-completing.</description>
