      <title>More Axion Stars from Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if dark matter consists of QCD axions in the post-inflationary scenario more than ten percent of it efficiently collapses into Bose stars at matter-radiation equality. Such a result is mostly independent of the present uncertainties on the axion mass. This large population of solitons, with asteroid masses and Earth-Moon distance sizes, might plausibly survive until today, with potentially interesting implications for phenomenology and experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Supernova axions convert to gamma-rays in magnetic fields of progenitor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been established that axions could have been produced through the Primakoff process within the nascent proto-neutron-star formed following the type II supernova SN1987A, escaped the star due to their weak interactions, and then converted to gamma-rays in the Galactic magnetic fields; the non-observation of a gamma-ray flash coincident with the neutrino burst leads to strong constraints on the axion-photon coupling for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV. In this work we use SN1987A to constrain, for the first time, higher mass axions, all the way to $m_a \sim 10^{-3}$ eV, by accounting for axion-photon conversion on the still-intact magnetic fields of the progenitor star. Moreover, we show that gamma-ray observations of the next Galactic supernova, leveraging the magnetic fields of the progenitor star, could detect quantum chromodynamics axions for masses above roughly $50$ $\mu$eV, depending on the supernova. We propose a new full-sky gamma-ray satellite constellation that we call the GALactic AXion Instrument for Supernova (GALAXIS) to search for such future signals along with related signals from extragalactic neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Effects in Energy Correlators: From Characterizing Confinement Transition to Improving $\alpha_s$ Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy correlators provide a powerful observable to study fragmentation dynamics in QCD. We demonstrate that the leading nonperturbative corrections for projected $N$-point energy correlators are described by the same universal parameter for any $N$, which has already been determined from other event shape fits. Including renormalon-free nonperturbative corrections substantially improves theoretical predictions of energy correlators, notably the transition into the confining region at small angles. Nonperturbative corrections are shown to have a significant impact on $\alpha_s$ extractions.</description>

      <title>Hard processes in multi-TeV ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the ion-collision program at the Large Hadron Collider, plans for its high-luminosity upgrade, and on-going discussions for multi-TeV future hadron colliders, we systematically investigate hard-scattering, Standard Model processes in many-TeV ion-ion collisions. We focus on the symmetric beam configurations $^{208}$Pb-$^{208}$Pb, $^{131}$Xe-$^{131}$Xe, $^{12}$C-$^{12}$C, and $pp$, and we catalog total and fiducial cross sections for dozens of processes, ranging from associated-Higgs and multiboson production to associated-top pair production, at next-to-leading order in QCD for nucleon-nucleon collision energies from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=1$ to $100$ TeV. We report the residual scale uncertainties at this order as well as the uncertainties originating from fits of nuclear parton densities. We also discuss the propagation of nuclear dynamics (as encoded in nuclear parton densities) into parton luminosities, and ultimately into predictions for cross sections. Finally, we report on the emergence of trends and the reliability of extrapolating cross sections across different nuclei.</description>

      <title>Dihadron correlations in small-$x$ DIS at NLO: transverse momentum dependent fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute inclusive dihadron cross-section in Deep Inelastic Scattering at next-to-leading order (NLO) and small $x$ in the Color Glass Condensate. We focus on the kinematic limit where the hadrons are produced at forward rapidities (in the direction of the virtual photon) and back-to-back in the transverse plane. Our calculation demonstrates that the coefficient of the Sudakov double logarithm for this process is $-\frac{\alpha_s}{2\pi}\left[C_F+\frac{N_c}{2}\right]$ instead of $-\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{4\pi}$ when back-to-back jets are measured in the final state. To preserve the universality of the Sudakov soft factor associated with the Weizs\"{a}cker-Williams transverse momentum dependent (TMD) gluon distribution, we promote the collinear fragmentation functions into TMD fragmentation functions. We then perform the resummation of the Sudakov logarithms through Collins-Soper-Sterman evolution of the TMD fragmentation functions and the Weizs\"{a}cker-Williams TMD gluon distribution. Finally, analytic expressions are obtained for the NLO coefficient functions in the $\overline{\rm MS}$-scheme. These results pave the way towards numerically calculating dihadron correlations at small $x$ at the future Electron-Ion Collider with full NLO accuracy.</description>

      <title>Supernova Electron-Neutrino Interactions with Xenon in the nEXO Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-neutrino charged-current interactions with xenon nuclei were modeled in the nEXO neutrinoless double-beta decay detector (~5-tonne, 90% ${}^{136}$Xe, 10% ${}^{134}$Xe) to evaluate its sensitivity to supernova neutrinos. Predictions for event rates and detectable signatures were modeled using the MARLEY event generator. We find good agreement between MARLEY's predictions and existing theoretical calculations of the inclusive cross sections at supernova neutrino energies. The interactions modeled by MARLEY were simulated within the nEXO simulation framework and were run through an example reconstruction algorithm to determine the detector's efficiency for reconstructing these events. The simulated data, incorporating the detector response, were used to study the ability of nEXO to reconstruct the incident electron-neutrino spectrum and these results were extended to a larger xenon detector of the same isotope enrichment. We estimate that nEXO will be able to observe electron-neutrino interactions with xenon from supernovae as far as 5 to 8 kpc from earth, while the ability to reconstruct incident electron-neutrino spectrum parameters from observed interactions in nEXO is limited to closer supernovae.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in Dark Matter Explanation of the Galactic 511 keV Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The galactic 511~keV photon signal can be fully explained by the decaying dark matter generated through the freeze-in mechanism. The explanation of the 511~keV signal requires an extremely tiny coupling between the decaying dark matter and $e^+e^-$ pair and thus cannot be generated via direct freeze-in from standard model particles. We construct models involving two $U(1)$ hidden sectors, one of which couples directly to the standard model, the other couples directly to the first hidden sector while couples indirectly to the standard model. The decaying dark photon dark matter, which explains the 511~keV signal, is generated via a two-step freeze-in process. In the models we study, the freeze-in mechanism generates the entire dark matter relic density, and thus any types of additional dark matter components produced from other sources are unnecessary. The two-$U(1)$ model remains a strong candidate for explaining the 511 keV signal consistent with various dark matter density profiles.</description>

      <title>NLO friction in symmetry restoring phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between bubbles/domain walls and the surrounding medium are a topic of active research, particularly as they apply to friction effects on accelerated expansion during first-order phase transitions. In this paper, we analyze for the first time friction pressure on relativistic walls in phase transitions where gauge symmetry is restored, particularly motivated by the observation that this pressure can, in principle, be negative at leading order, since some particles lose mass by definition as they cross into the new phase. We find, however, that at NLO, the soft emission of vectors from a charged current leads to positive pressure scaling as the wall's Lorentz boost factor $\gamma_w$, similar to the case of gauge symmetry breaking. Contrary to the latter case, we find that the dominant contribution in single emission is safe from IR divergences and exhibits a much stronger dependence on the wall shape. Finally, we argue that in any phase transition, no multi-particle process on the wall can impart negative pressure greater than the leading order result, in the asymptotic limit of large velocity.</description>

      <title>Causal fermion states in magnetic field in relativistic rotating frame and electromagnetic radiation by rapidly rotating charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Dirac field uniformly rotating with angular velocity $\Omega$ and also subject to the constant magnetic field $B$ directed along the rotation axis. The causal states are constrained to the interior of the light cylinder of radius $c/\Omega$. When this radius is smaller than the system size, as in the quark-gluon plasma, the effect of the boundary on the fermion spectrum is critical. We derive the fermion spectrum and study its properties. We compute the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation emitted due to transitions between the fermion states. We study its dependence on energy and angular momentum for different values of the angular velocity and the magnetic field. Rotation has enormous impact on the electromagnetic radiation by the quark-gluon plasma with or without the magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: The power and the probability of electromagnetic radiation from an electron in a constant background tensor field violating Lorentz invariance are calculated. The case of a background field of the quasielectric type is considered. The angular distribution and the polarization of the radiation are studied. Using present experimental constraints on the background field strength, it is shown that the radiation effect can manifest itself under astrophysical conditions at ultrahigh electron energy.</description>

      <title>Single spin asymmetry $ A _ { U L } ^ { \sin ( 2 \phi _ { h } ) }$ in dihadron production in SIDIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper calculates the helicity-dependent dihadron fragmentation function (DiFF), by extending the dihadron spectator model and examine the single longitudinal spin asymmetry $A^{\sin(2\phi_h)}_{UL}$ from dihadron in semi-inclusive inelastic scattering (SIDIS). This function elucidates the relationship between the longitudinal polarization of the fragmented quark and the transverse momentum of the resulting hadron pairs. A study by the COMPASS collaboration detected a minimal signal in their experimental search for this azimuthal asymmetry in SIDIS. Here, we use the spectator model to calculate the unknown T-odd dihadron fragmentation function $H_1^\perp$. Adopting collinear factorization to describe the data, avoiding the transverse momentum dependent factorization and the associated resummation effects, helping us understand the asymmetry and explaining why the signal is so weak. We involve the approach of transverse momentum dependence in the model calculations, in order to formulate the differential cross sections and the spin asymmetries in terms of the collinear parton distributions and the collinear DiFFs. A transverse momentum factor analysis method was used, in which the transverse momentum of the final hadron pairs was not integrated. The asymmetry of $sin(2\phi_h)$ in COMPASS kinematics was calculated and compared with experimental data. In addition, predictions for the same asymmetry are also presented for HERMES and the Electron Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Status of QCD precision predictions for Drell-Yan processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute differential distributions for Drell-Yan processes at the LHC and the Tevatron colliders at next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD, including fiducial cuts on the decay leptons in the final state. The comparison of predictions obtained with four different codes shows excellent agreement, once linear power corrections from the fiducial cuts are included in those codes that rely on phase-space slicing subtraction schemes. For $Z$-boson production we perform a detailed study of the symmetric cuts on the transverse momenta of the decay leptons. Predictions at fixed order in perturbative QCD for those symmetric cuts, typically imposed in experiments, suffer from an instability. We show how this can be remedied by an all-order resummation of the fiducial transverse momentum spectrum, and we comment on the choice of cuts for future experimental analyses.</description>

      <title>Discontinuities of banana integrals in dispersion relation representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the discontinuities of banana integrals using the dispersion relation iteratively. We find a series of identities between the parameterized discontinuities of banana integrals (p-DOBIs). Similar to elliptic integrals, these identities enable the reduction of various p-DOBIs to be a linear combination of some fundamental ones. We present a practical application of p-DOBIs for the massive three-loop case and establish the expression of generalized dispersion relation, which enables us to obtain the dispersion relation representation of arbitrary banana integrals. Moreover, we propose a hypothesis for generalized dispersion relation and p-DOBIs, which provides a simple way to calculate the discontinuities and transform dispersion relation representation to p-DOBIs.</description>

      <title>Color dipole cross-section from unifying the color dipole picture and improved saturation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the color-dipole picture (CDP) for determination of the gluon density at low-$x$ which is obtained from the Altarelli-Martinelli equation by expansion at distinct points of expansion. The dipole cross-sections with respect to the improved saturation model of Bartels-Golec-Biernat-Kowalski (BGK) are obtained in a wide range of transverse sizes $r$ and compared with the Golec-Biernat-W$\ddot{\mathrm{u}}$sthoff (GBW) model. We find that the model gives a good description of the dipole cross-section at large $r$ which confirms saturation and matches the perturbative QCD result at a small $r$ due to the significant role of the running of the gluon distribution. The transition between these regions occurs with decreasing transverse sizes with a decrease of Bjorken $x$ and dependence on the expansion point.</description>

      <title>Prospect of measuring the top quark mass through energy correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaching a high precision of the top quark mass is an important task of the Large Hadron Collider. We perform a feasibility study of measuring the top quark mass through the three-point energy correlator. The expected sensitivity of the top quark mass in the boosted regime is presented. We further introduce its application to the low top $p_\text{T}$ regime and demonstrate that both the W boson and the top quark masses could be extracted from this single observable. Compared to traditional observables, the energy correlator shows robustness to uncertainties that usually dominate experimental measurements and provides a promising way to improve experimental precision.</description>

      <title>Detailed nuclear structure calculations for coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any discovery of `new physics' in the neutrino sector first requires a precise prediction of the expected Standard Model cross section. Currently, Coherent Elastic neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS) experiments are statistics limited. However, as new and future experiments scale up, it will be necessary to improve the theoretical predictions. Here we review the calculation of the CEvNS cross section in a consistent theory of hadronic currents and compute the relevant nuclear form factors using the nuclear shell model. The uncertainty on the form factors is explored by repeating the calculation for various shell model interactions and with Skyme-Hartree-Fock evaluations of the Weak-charge radii. We then refine the Standard Model predictions for the recent experimental results of the COHERENT experiment. We find that our cross sections are in good agreement with previous predictions, but with significantly smaller uncertainties - by up to a factor of 10. Near-future CEvNS experiments will meaningfully benefit from improved predictions through an increased sensitivity to new-physics signals.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium Polarization in Medium from Open Quantum Systems and Chromomagnetic Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spin-dependent in-medium dynamics of quarkonia by using the potential nonrelativistic QCD (pNRQCD) and the open quantum system framework. We consider the pNRQCD Lagrangian valid up to the order $\frac{r}{M^0}=r$ and $\frac{r^0}{M}=\frac{1}{M}$ in the double power counting. By considering the Markovian condition and applying the Wigner transformation upon the diagonal spin components of the quarkonium density matrix with the semiclassical expansion, we systematically derive the Boltzmann transport equation for quarkonia with polarization dependence in the quantum optical limit. Unlike the spin-independent collision terms governed by certain chromoelectric field correlators, new gauge invariant correlators of chromomagnetic fields determine the recombination and dissociation terms with polarization dependence at the order we are working. We also derive a Lindblad equation describing the in-medium transitions between spin-singlet and spin-triplet heavy quark-antiquark pairs in the quantum Brownian motion limit. The Lindblad equation is governed by new transport coefficients defined in terms of the chromomagnetic field correlators. Our formalism is generic and valid for both weakly-coupled and strongly-coupled quark gluon plasmas. It can be further applied to study spin alignment of vector quarkonia in heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Production of Completely Dark Photons with Nonminimal Couplings to Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photons are a theorized massive spin-1 particle which can be produced via various mechanisms, including cosmological gravitational particle production (GPP) in the early universe. In this work, we extend previous results for GPP of dark photons to include nonminimal couplings to gravity. We find that nonminimal couplings can induce a ghost instability or lead to runaway particle production at high momentum and discuss the constraints on the parameter space such that the theory is free of instabilities. Within the instability-free regime we numerically calculate the particle production and find that the inclusion of nonminimal couplings can lead to an enhancement of the particle number. As a result, GPP of nonminimally coupled dark photons can open the parameter space for production of a cosmological relevant relic density (constituting all or part of the dark matter) as compared to the minimally-coupled theory. These results are independent of the choice of inflation model, which we demonstrate by repeating the analysis for a class of rapid-turn multi-field inflation models.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction from self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Merging compact objects such as binary black holes provide a promising probe for the physics of dark matter (DM). The gravitational waves emitted during inspiral potentially allow to detect DM spikes around black holes. This is because the dynamical friction force experienced by the inspiraling black hole alters the orbital period and thus the gravitational wave signal. Aims. The dynamical friction arising from DM can potentially differ from the collisionless case when DM is subject to self-interactions. This paper aims to understand how self-interactions impact dynamical friction. Methods. To study the dynamical friction force, we use idealized N-body simulations, where we include self-interacting dark matter. Results. We find that the dynamical friction force for inspiraling black holes would be typically enhanced by DM self-interactions compared to a collisionless medium (ignoring differences in the DM density). At lower velocities below the sound speed, we find that the dynamical friction force can be reduced by the presence of self-interactions. Conclusions. DM self-interactions have a significant effect on the dynamical friction for black hole mergers. Assuming the Chandrasekhar formula may underpredict the deceleration due to dynamical friction.</description>

      <title>Neural Scaling Laws From Large-N Field Theory: Solvable Model Beyond the Ridgeless Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many machine learning models based on neural networks exhibit scaling laws: their performance scales as power laws with respect to the sizes of the model and training data set. We use large-N field theory methods to solve a model recently proposed by Maloney, Roberts and Sully which provides a simplified setting to study neural scaling laws. Our solution extends the result in this latter paper to general nonzero values of the ridge parameter, which are essential to regularize the behavior of the model. In addition to obtaining new and more precise scaling laws, we also uncover a duality transformation at the diagrams level which explains the symmetry between model and training data set sizes. The same duality underlies recent efforts to design neural networks to simulate quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Do high redshift QSOs and GRBs corroborate JWST?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is reporting unexpectedly massive high redshift galaxies that appear challenging from the $\Lambda$CDM perspective. Interpreted as a problem of cosmological origin, this necessitates Planck underestimating either matter density $\Omega_m$ or physical matter density $\Omega_m h^2$ at higher redshifts. Through standard frequentist profile likelihoods, we identify corroborating quasar (QSO) and gamma-ray burst (GRB) data sets where $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift $z_{\textrm{eff}}$, with $\Omega_m$ remaining anomalously large at higher redshifts. While the variation of $\Omega_m$ with $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ is at odds with the $\Lambda$CDM model, demarcating frequentist confidence intervals through differences in $\chi^2$ in profile likelihoods, the prevailing technique in the literature, points to $3.9 \sigma$ and $7.9 \sigma$ tensions between GRBs and QSOs, respectively, and Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. We explain the approximations inherent in the existing profile likelihood literature, and highlight fresh methodology that generalises the prescription. We show that alternative methods, including Bayesian approaches, lead to similar tensions.</description>

Our method is based on an explicit closed formula for the decomposition of rational functions with fully factorized denominators. We provide implementations in both the Wolfram Mathematica and C languages, made available at https://github.com/fekeshazy/LinApart .

      <title>The unexpected uses of a bowling pin: anisotropic flow in fixed-target $^{208}$Pb+$^{20}$Ne collisions as a probe of quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The System for Measuring Overlap with Gas (SMOG2) at the LHCb detector enables the study of fixed-target ion-ion collisions at relativistic energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}\sim100$ GeV in the centre-of-mass). With input from \textit{ab initio} calculations of the structure of $^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne, we compute 3+1D hydrodynamic predictions for the anisotropic flow of Pb+Ne and Pb+O collisions, to be tested with upcoming LHCb data. This will allow the detailed study of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation as well as experimental tests of the predicted nuclear shapes. Elliptic flow ($v_2$) in Pb+Ne collisions is greatly enhanced compared to the Pb+O baseline due to the shape of $^{20}$Ne, which is deformed in a bowling-pin geometry. Owing to the large $^{208}$Pb radius, this effect is seen in a broad centrality range, a unique feature of this collision configuration. Larger elliptic flow further enhances the quadrangular flow ($v_4$) of Pb+Ne collisions via non-linear coupling, and impacts the sign of the kurtosis of the elliptic flow vector distribution ($c_2\{4\}$). Exploiting the shape of $^{20}$Ne proves thus an ideal method to investigate the formation of QGP in fixed-target experiments at LHCb, and demonstrates the power of SMOG2 as a tool to image nuclear ground states.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on the $\Delta m^2_{21}$ tension with supernova neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One long-standing tension in the determination of neutrino parameters is the mismatched value of the solar mass square difference, $\Delta m_{21}^2$, measured by different experiments: the reactor antineutrino experiment KamLAND finds a best fit larger than the one obtained with solar neutrino data. Even if the current tension is mild ($\sim 1.5\sigma$), it is timely to explore if independent measurements could help in either closing or reassessing this issue. In this regard, we explore how a future supernova burst in our galaxy could be used to determine $\Delta m_{21}^2$ at the future Hyper-Kamiokande detector, and how this could contribute to the current situation. We study Earth matter effects for different models of supernova neutrino spectra and supernova orientations. We find that, if supernova neutrino data prefers the KamLAND best fit for $\Delta m_{21}^2$, an uncertainty similar to the current KamLAND one could be achieved. On the contrary, if it prefers the solar neutrino data best fit, the current tension with KamLAND results could grow to a significance larger than $5\sigma$. Furthermore, supernova neutrinos could significantly contribute to reducing the uncertainty on $\sin^2\theta_{12}$.</description>

      <title>Effects of stimulated emission and superradiant growth of non-spherical axion cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the stimulated emission of photons in non-spherical axion clusters with or without the axion source from the superradiance of a rotating black hole (BH). In particular, we focus on the cluster with the initial axion distribution in the $(l,m)=(1,1)$ mode which mimics the shape of an axion cloud induced by the BH superradiance. After establishing the hierarchy of Boltzmann equations governing a general non-spherical axion-photon system, we examine the evolution of photon and axion distributions in the cluster and possible stimulated emission signals. In the case without the axion source, the resultant signal would be a single photon pulse. As for the system with the BH superradiance as the axion source, multiple pulses are predicted. We also show that, for the latter case, the combined effects of stimulated emissions and the axion production from the BH superradiance could reach a balance where the axion cluster becomes uniformly and spherically distributed. Due to the energy and temporal characteristics of the obtained pulses, we demonstrate that the stimulated emissions from the axion cluster with axions sourced by the BH superradiance provide a candidate explanation to the observed fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Top-quark pole mass extraction at NNLO accuracy, from total, single- and double-differential cross sections for $t\bar{t}+X$ production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extract the top-quark mass value in the on-shell renormalization scheme from the comparison of theoretical predictions for $pp \rightarrow t\bar{t} + X$ at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD accuracy with experimental data collected by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations for absolute total, normalized single-differential and double-differential cross-sections during Run 1, Run 2 and the ongoing Run 3 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). For the theory computations of heavy-quark pair-production we use the MATRIX framework, interfaced to PineAPPL for the generation of grids of theory predictions, which can be efficiently used a-posteriori during the fit, performed within xFitter. We take several state-of-the-art parton distribution functions (PDFs) as input for the fit and evaluate their associated uncertainties, as well as the uncertainties arising from renormalization and factorization scale variation. Fit uncertainties related to the datasets are also part of the extracted uncertainty of the top-quark mass and turn out to be of similar size as the combined scale and PDF uncertainty. Fit results from different PDF sets agree among each other within 1$\sigma$ uncertainty, whereas some datasets related to $t\bar{t}$ decay in different channels (dileptonic vs. semileptonic) point towards top-quark mass values in slight tension among each other, although still compatible within $2.5 \sigma$ accuracy. Our results are compatible with the PDG 2022 top-quark pole-mass value. Our work opens the road towards more complex simultaneous NNLO fits of PDFs, the strong coupling $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ and the top-quark mass, using the currently most precise experimental data on $t\bar{t} + X$ total and multi-differential cross-sections from the LHC.</description>

      <title>Analysis of HERA data with a PDF parametrization inspired by quantum statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a determination of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton from HERA data using a PDF parametrization inspired by a quantum statistical model of the proton dynamics. This parametrization is characterised by a very small number of parameters, yet it leads to a reasonably good description of the data, comparable with other parametrizations on the market. It may thus provide an alternative to standard parametrizations, useful for studying parametrization bias and to possibly simplify the fit procedure thanks to the small number of parameters. Interestingly, the model reproduces key physical features, such as a $\bar d$ distribution larger than $\bar u$, that HERA data alone are not able to constrain when using more flexible parametrizations. Moreover, polarized distributions are described in the model by the same parameters of the unpolarized ones, giving us the possibility of extracting both types of distributions within the same fit.</description>

      <title>Extending Global Fits of 4D Composite Higgs Models with Partially Composite Leptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the first convergent Bayesian global fits of 4D Composite Higgs Models with partially-composite third generation quarks and leptons based on the minimal $SO(5) \rightarrow SO(4)$ symmetry breaking pattern. We consider two models with the $\tau$ lepton and its associated neutrino in different representations of $SO(5)$. Fitting each model with a wide array of experimental constraints allows us to analyse the Bayesian evidence and currently-observed fine-tuning of each model by calculating the Kullback-Leibler divergence between their respective priors and posteriors. Both models are found to be capable of satisfying all constraints simultaneously at the $3\sigma$ level at scales of $&lt; 5$ TeV, although the model with leptons in the $\mathbf{14}$ and $\mathbf{10}$ representations is strongly preferred over those in the $\mathbf{5}$ representation from a Bayesian viewpoint. Finally, we consider the experimental signatures for the preferred parameters in these models, including lepton partner decay signatures and gluon-fusion produced Higgs signal strengths, and discuss their potential phenomenology at future high-luminosity LHC runs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The MUonE experiment aims at providing a novel determination of the leading hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment through the study of elastic muon-electron scattering. Since the initial-state electrons are bound in a low-$Z$ atomic target, the interaction between the incoming muons and the nuclei is expected to be the main source of experimental background. In this article, we study the production of a real lepton pair from the muon-nucleus scattering, discussing its numerical impact in the MUonE kinematic configuration. The process is described as a scattering of a muon in an external Coulomb field with the addition of a form factor to describe the nuclear charge distribution. The calculation is implemented in the fully differential Monte Carlo event generator MESMER, without introducing any approximation on the angular variables.</description>

Abstract: We present numerical results for the two-loop virtual amplitude entering the NNLO corrections to Higgs boson production in association with a top quark pair at the LHC, focusing, as a proof of concept of our method, on the part of the quark-initiated channel containing loops of massless or massive quarks. Results for the UV renormalised and IR subtracted two-loop amplitude for each colour structure are given at selected phase-space points and visualised in terms of surfaces as a function of two-dimensional slices of the full phase space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar neutrinos induce elastic neutrino-electron scattering in dark matter direct detection experiments, resulting in detectable event rates at current facilities. We analyze recent data from the XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN, and PandaX-4T experiments and we derive stringent constraints on several $U(1)'$ extensions of the Standard Model, accommodating new neutrino-electron interactions. We provide bounds on the relevant coupling and mass of light vector mediators for a variety of models, including the anomaly-free $B-L$ model, lepton flavor-dependent interactions like $L_\alpha - L_{\beta}$, $B-2L_e - L_{\mu, \tau}$, $B-3L_\alpha$, and $B+2L_\mu +2 L_{\tau}$ models. We compare our results with other limits obtained in the literature from both terrestrial and astrophysical experiments. Finally, we present forecasts for improving current bounds with a future experiment like DARWIN.</description>

Abstract: We compute the light axial-vector and tensor meson two-photon transition form factors in the soft-wall holographic model of QCD in the flavor-symmetric case. They are used to evaluate the axial-vector and tensor meson contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon via the hadronic light-by-light scattering process. As expected, these contributions are smaller than the one from pseudoscalar mesons. The result for axial-vector mesons is higher than the value found in other approaches.</description>

      <title>Momentum dependent flavor radiative corrections to the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering for the neutrino charge-radius determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite being neutral particles, neutrinos can have a non-zero charge radius, which represents the only non-null neutrino electromagnetic property in the standard model theory. Its value can be predicted with high accuracy and its effect is usually accounted for through the definition of a radiative correction affecting the neutrino couplings to electrons and nucleons at low energy, which results effectively in a shift of the weak mixing angle. Interestingly, it introduces a flavour-dependence in the cross-section. Exploiting available neutrino-electron and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) data, there have been many attempts to measure experimentally the neutrino charge radius. Unfortunately, the current precision allows one to only determine constraints on its value. In this work, we discuss how to properly account for the neutrino charge radius in the CE$\nu$NS cross-section including the effects of the non-null momentum-transfer in the neutrino electromagnetic form factor, which have been usually neglected when deriving the aforementioned limits. We apply the formalism discussed to a re-analysis of the COHERENT cesium iodide and argon samples and the NCC-1701 germanium data from the Dresden-II nuclear power plant. We quantify the impact of this correction on the CE$\nu$NS cross-section and we show that, despite being small, it can not be neglected in the analysis of data from future high-precision experiments. Furthermore, this momentum dependence can be exploited to significantly reduce the allowed values for the neutrino charge radius determination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores a minimal renormalizable dark matter (DM) model, incorporating a sub-GeV Majorana DM and a singlet scalar particle $\phi$. Using scalar and pseudo-scalar interactions (couplings $c_s$ and $c_p$), we investigate implications for DM detection, considering $s$-wave, $p$-wave, and combined ($s$+$p$ wave) contributions in DM annihilation cross-section, as well as loop-correction contributions to DM-nucleon elastic scattering. Identifying a broad parameter space ($10 \,\rm{MeV} &lt; m_\chi \lesssim m_\phi$) within the $2\sigma$ allowed region, we explore scenarios ($\left|c_s\right|\gg \left|c_p\right|$, $\left|c_s\right|\ll \left|c_p\right|$, and $\left|c_s\right|\approx \left|c_p\right|$). We find that (i) a non-zero pseudo-scalar coupling alleviates direct detection constraints as a comparison with the previous pure scalar coupling case; (ii) CMB observations set stringent limits on pseudo-scalar interaction dominant cases, making $s$-wave annihilation viable only for $m_\chi&gt;1\,\rm{GeV}$; (iii) the preferred $\phi$-resonance region can be tested in the future indirect detection experiments, such as e-ASTROGAM.</description>

      <title>How higher charmonia shape the puzzling data of the $e^+e^-\to \eta J/\psi$ cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the BESIII collaboration performed a precise measurement of the $e^+e^-\to \eta J/\psi$ cross section. It is puzzling that the resonance parameters of the reported $Y(4230)$ show a substantial divergence from the previously measured results in both the open-charmed and hidden-charmed decay channels, and the line shape asymmetry of the data approaching 4.2 GeV also suggests that it might be difficult to characterize the details of the structure around 4.2 GeV by a single resonance. This has motivated our great curiosity about how the charmonium states are distributed in the measured energy range and how they shape the puzzling data of the $e^+e^-\to \eta J/\psi$ cross section. In this work, we use five theoretically constructed charmonia in the range of $4.0\rm{-}4.5$ $\text{GeV}$, i.e., $\psi(4040)$, $\psi(4160)$, $\psi(4220)$, $\psi(4380)$, and $\psi(4415)$, to apply a combined fit to the data, in which their calculated decay ratios into $\eta J/\psi$ via hadronic loop mechanism are taken as input. The fit results can reproduce the measured cross section data well, especially for the subtle line shape around 4.2 GeV, showing that the structure around 4.2 GeV is possible from the contribution of both $\psi(4160)$ and $\psi(4220)$.</description>

Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are good candidates for mediators to the dark sector. We explore scenarios in which an ALP mediates interactions between dark matter and electroweak gauge bosons. These models yield testable electromagnetic signals in astrophysical, cosmological, and terrestrial probes. We find promising prospects for both indirect detection and accelerator tests, with interesting parameter space already constrained by current experiments. Our work provides concrete benchmarks for future tests of the electroweak ALP portal.</description>

Abstract: We study a relic density of the flavino dark matter in modified Altarelli and Feruglio $A_4$ model which is respecting the $SU(2)_L\times A_4\times Z_3\times U(1)_R$ symmetry. We calculate the Lagrangian from the superpotential in the model. In estimating relic density, we consider the relevant interactions from the Lagrangian that realize the vacuum expectation value alignments and charged lepton masses where we assume that the supersymmetry breaking effects are small for flavon sector. As a result, we find the degenerate masses between the lightest ``flavon'' and ``flavino'', and only two parameters in the potential determines the relic density. Then allowed parameter space of these parameters are estimated from relic density calculation taking a constraint from lepton flavor violation into account. We also briefly discuss other dark matter physics such as direct detection, indirect detection and collider search.</description>

Abstract: We provide new constraints on the dark matter halo density profile of Milky Way (MW) dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) using the phase-space distribution function (DF) method. After assessing the systematics of the approach against mock data from the Gaia Challenge project, we apply the DF analysis to the entire kinematic sample of well-measured MW dwarf satellites for the first time. Contrary to previous findings for some of these objects, we find that the DF analysis yields results consistent with the standard Jeans analysis. In particular, in the present study we rediscover: i) a large diversity in the inner halo densities of dSphs (bracketed by Draco and Fornax), and ii) an anti-correlation between inner halo density and pericenter distance of the bright MW satellites. Regardless of the strength of the anti-correlation, we find that the distribution of these satellites in density vs. pericenter space is inconsistent with the results of the high-res N-body simulations that include a disk potential. Our analysis motivates further studies on the role of internal feedback and dark matter microphysics in these dSphs.</description>

Abstract: We present the electromagnetic (EM) dipole radiation flux from an eccentric Keplerian binary endowed with scalar charges, in the presence of scalar-photon coupling $\phi A_\mu A^\mu$ or $\phi F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. The scalar radiation is suppressed for orbital frequency below the scalar mass, while the scalar-mediated indirect EM radiation survives. We examine the constraints imposed on the scalar-photon and scalar-charge coupling by the current observational data, in case that the scalar charge is given by the muon number. The extensions of our calculation to the quadrupole order and hyperbolic orbit are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A summary of the constraints from searches performed by the ATLAS Collaboration for the electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos is presented. Results from eight separate ATLAS searches are considered, each using 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton data at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV collected at the Large Hadron Collider during its second data-taking run. The results are interpreted in the context of the 19-parameter phenomenological minimal supersymmetric standard model, where R-parity conservation is assumed and the lightest supersymmetric particle is assumed to be the lightest neutralino. Constraints from previous electroweak, flavour and dark matter related measurements are also considered. The results are presented in terms of constraints on supersymmetric particle masses and are compared with limits from simplified models. Also shown is the impact of ATLAS searches on parameters such as the dark matter relic density and the spin-dependent and spin-independent scattering cross-sections targeted by direct dark matter detection experiments. The Higgs boson and Z boson `funnel regions', where a low-mass neutralino would not oversaturate the dark matter relic abundance, are almost completely excluded by the considered constraints. Example spectra for non-excluded supersymmetric models with light charginos and neutralinos are also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The excesses in the electron and positron spectra observed by many experiments, such as PAMELA and AMS-02, have sparked significant theoretical investigation. It is not easy to distinguish the two primary hypotheses dark matter annihilation/decay and pulsars from the spectral features. Should pulsars be the source of this excess, the expected variability in their distribution may introduce distinct irregularities in the positron energy spectrum. In this study, we use an irregularity estimator to detect these potential features in the positron energy spectrum of AMS-02. Our analysis of the current AMS-02 data reveals these spectral irregularities with a statistical significance of $1.75\sigma$. However, our projection indicates that, with AMS-02 data collected over a period of 20 years, such irregularities could be identified with a confidence level of $3\sigma$ level in 71\% of our simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown that (near-)extremal Kerr black holes are sensitive probes of small higher-derivative corrections to general relativity. In particular, these corrections produce diverging tidal forces on the horizon in the extremal limit. We show that adding a black hole charge makes this effect qualitatively stronger. Higher-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Newman solution produce tidal forces that scale inversely in the black hole temperature. We find that, unlike the Kerr case, for realistic values of the black hole charge large tidal forces can arise before quantum corrections due to the Schwarzian mode become important, so that the near-horizon behavior of the black hole is dictated by higher-derivative terms in the effective theory.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional gauge anomalies and $p$-adic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how methods of number theory can be used to study anomalies in gauge quantum field theories in spacetime dimension two. To wit, the anomaly cancellation conditions for the abelian part of the local anomaly admit solutions if and only if they admit solutions in the reals and in the $p$-adics for every prime $p$ and we use this to build an algorithm to find all solutions.</description>

      <title>More on Black Holes Perceiving the Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last two years the dark dimension scenario has emerged as focal point of many research interests. In particular, it functions as a stepping stone to address the cosmological hierarchy problem and provides a colosseum for dark matter contenders. We reexamine the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) perceiving the dark dimension could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe. We re-assess limits on the abundance of PBHs as dark matter candidates from $\gamma$-ray emission resulting from Hawking evaporation. We re-evaluate constraints from the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the direction of the Galactic center which offer the best and most solid upper limits on the dark matter fraction composed of PBHs. The revised mass range which allows PBHs to assemble all cosmological dark matter is estimated to be $10^{15} \alt M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. We demonstrate that due to the constraints from $\gamma$-ray emission, quantum corrections due to the speculative memory burden effect do not modify this mass range. We also investigate the main characteristics of PBHs which are localized in the bulk. We show that PBHs localized in the bulk can make all cosmological dark matter if $10^{11} \alt M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. Finally, we comment on the black holes that could be produced if one advocates a space with two boundaries for the dark dimension.</description>

      <title>Dark Dimension and the Effective Field Theory limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [1] we pointed out that in the Dark Dimension scenario [2] theoretical issues arise when the prediction for the vacuum energy $\rho$, that is obtained from swampland conjectures in string theory, is confronted with the corresponding result for $\rho$ in the field theory limit. One of the problems arises from the field theory side and is due to previous results for $\rho$ that, according to our analysis, turn out to be incorrect, although widely spread. Our work was challenged in [3]. Here we show why in our opinion the claims in [3] are inconsistent, actually based on arguments deprived of physical meaning, providing further support to our findings. We conclude by discussing ideas on the physical mechanism that could trigger the suppression of large UV contributions to $\rho$.</description>

      <title>An Infra-Red Fixed-Point in QCD with a Dilaton in Nuclear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possible consequence of an IR fixed point in QCD for $N_f=2, 3$ in nuclear matter is discussed. It is shown in terms of d(ilaton)-$\chi$ effective field theory (d$\chi$EFT) incorporated in a generalized effective field theory (G$n$EFT) implemented with hidden local symmetry and hidden scale symmetry that the recently measured superallowed Gamow-Teller transition in the doubly-magic-shell nucleus $^{100}$Sn indicates a surprisingly large anomaly-induced quenching (AIQ) of $g_A$ from the free-space value of 1.276 to $\approx 0.8 $. Combined with the quenching expected from strong nuclear correlations, the effective coupling in nuclei, $g_A^{\rm eff}$ would come to $\sim 1/2$. If this result were reconfirmed, it would impact not only nuclear structure and dense compact-star matter -- where $g_A$ figures in $\pi$-N coupling via the Goldberger-Treiman relation -- but also in search for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), e.g. $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, where 4th power of $g_A$ figures.</description>

      <title>Constraints from Fermi observations of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts on cosmological parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compile a \emph{Fermi} sample of the \emph{long} GRBs from \emph{Fermi} observations with 15 years of the Fermi-GBM catalogue with identified redshift, in which the GOLD sample contains 123 long GRBs at $z\le5.6$ and the FULL sample contains 151 long GRBs with redshifts at $z\le8.2$. The Amati relation (the $E_{\rm p,i}$-$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation) are calibrated at $z&lt;1.4$ by a Gaussian Process from the latest observational Hubble data (OHD) with the cosmic chronometers method to obtain GRBs at high-redshift $z\ge1.4$ which can be used to constrain cosmological models via the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. From the cosmology-independent GRBs with the GOLD sample at $z\ge1.4$ and the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at $0.01&lt;z\leq2.3$, we obtain $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.354\pm0.018, H_0 = 73.05\pm0.2 \rm km/s/Mpc$ for the flat $\Lambda$CDM model; $w_0 = -1.22^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$ for the flat $w$CDM model; and $w_{a} = -1.12^{+0.45}_{-0.83}$ for the flat Chevallier-Polarski-Linder model at the 1$\sigma$ confidence level. Our results with the GOLD and FULL sample are almost identical, which are more stringent than the previous results with GRBs.</description>
