      <title>Resonant second harmonic generation in a two-dimensional electron system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear response of a disordered two-dimensional electronic system, lacking inversion symmetry, to an external alternating electric field. The application of an in-plane static magnetic field induces local contributions to the current density that are quadratic in the electric field and linear in the magnetic field. This current oscillates at twice the frequency of the external irradiation and there are two linearly independent vector combinations that contribute to the current density. This particular mechanism coexists with the topological Berry-dipole contribution to the second harmonic of the current density, which can be generated by quantum confinement. Additional nonlocal terms in the current density are possible in the regime away from the normal incidence. The total current exhibits a nonreciprocal character upon reversal of the magnetic field direction. We evaluate the magnitude of this effect by computing its dependence on the strength of spin-orbit coupling and the disorder scattering rate. Importantly, we show that these local second-harmonic contributions can be resonantly excited when the frequency of the external radiation approaches the energy separation between the spin-orbit split bands.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Topological Quantum Chemistry and Catalog of Topological Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt the topological quantum chemistry formalism to layer groups, and apply it to study the band topology of 8,872 entries from the computational two-dimensional (2D) materials databases C2DB and MC2D. In our analysis, we find 4,073 topologically non-trivial or obstructed atomic insulator entries, including 905 topological insulators, 602 even-electron number topological semimetals, and 1,003 obstructed atomic insulators. We thus largely expand the library of known topological or obstructed materials in two dimensions, beyond the few hundreds known to date. We additionally classify the materials into four categories: experimentally existing, stable, computationally exfoliated, and not stable. We present a detailed analysis of the edge states emerging in a number of selected new materials, and compile a Topological 2D Materials Database (2D-TQCDB) containing the band structures and detailed topological properties of all the materials studied in this work. The methodology here developed is implemented in new programs available to the public, designed to study the topology of any non-magnetic monolayer or multilayer 2D material.</description>

      <title>Polarized Superradiance from CsPbBr3 Quantum Dot Superlattice with Controlled Inter-dot Electronic Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative emission of photons from an ensemble of quantum dots (QDs) as superradiance can arise from the electronically coupled QDs with a coherent emitting excited state. This contrasts with superfluorescence (Dicke superradiance), where the cooperative photon emission occurs via a spontaneous buildup of coherence in an ensemble of incoherently excited QDs via their coupling to a common radiation mode. While superfluorescence has been observed in perovskite QD systems, reports of superradiance from the electronically coupled ensemble of perovskite QDs are rare. Here, we demonstrate the generation of polarized superradiance with a very narrow linewidth (&lt;5 meV) and a large redshift (~200 meV) from the electronically coupled CsPbBr3 QD superlattice achieved through a combination of strong quantum confinement and ligand engineering. In addition to photon bunching at low excitation densities, the superradiance is polarized in contrast to the uncoupled exciton emission from the same superlattice. This finding suggests the potential for obtaining polarized cooperative photon emission via anisotropic electronic coupling in QD superlattices even when the intrinsic anisotropy of exciton transition in individual QDs is weak.</description>

      <title>Magnetic response of topological insulator layer with metamaterial substrate induced by an electric point source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) are materials with unique surface conductive properties that distinguish them from normal insulators and have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in electronics and spintronics. However, their weak magnetic field response in traditional setups has limited practical applications. Here, we show that integrating TIs with active metamaterial substrates can significantly enhance the induced magnetic field by more than 10^4 times. Our results demonstrate that selecting specific permittivity and permeability values for the active metamaterial substrate optimizes the magnetic field at the interface between the TI layer and the metamaterial, extending into free space. This represents a substantial improvement over previous methods, where the magnetic field decayed rapidly. The findings reveal that the TI-metamaterial approach enhances the magnetic field response, unveiling new aspects of TI electromagnetic behavior and suggesting novel pathways for developing materials with tailored electromagnetic properties. The integration of metamaterials with TIs offers promising opportunities for advancements in materials science and various technological applications. Overall, our study provides a practical and effective approach to exploring the unique magnetic field responses of TIs, potentially benefiting other complex material systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Hall Effect in KTaO$_3$ Two-Dimensional Electron Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of a Hall effect, a finite transverse voltage induced by a longitudinal current, usually requires the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, for example through the application of an external magnetic field or the presence of long range magnetic order in a sample. Recently it was suggested that under certain symmetry conditions, the presence of finite Berry curvatures in the band structure of a system with time-reversal symmetry but without inversion symmetry can give rise to a nonlinear Hall effect in the presence of a probe current. In order to observe the nonlinear Hall effect, one requires a finite component of a so-called Berry dipole along the direction of the probe current. We report here measurements of the nonlinear Hall effect in two-dimensional electron gases fabricated on the surface of KTaO$_3$ with different surface crystal orientations as a function of the probe current, a transverse electric field and back gate voltage. For all three crystal orientations, the transverse electric field modifies the nonlinear Hall effect. We discuss our results in the context of the current understanding of the nonlinear Hall effect as well as potential experimental artifacts that may give rise to the same effects.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Terahertz Resonances from Ballistic Electron Funnelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new mechanism for second-harmonic generation through geometrically rectifying-funneling-ballistic electrons in THz optical resonators. Our resonant rectifiers inherently act as second-order harmonic generators, rectifying currents without the presence of a potential barrier. Particle-in-cell simulations reveal that femtosecond electron-surface scattering plays a critical role in this process. We differentiate electron funneling from nonlocal plasmonic drag and bulk Dirac anharmonicity, showing that funneling can reduce the required field intensity for second-harmonic generation by 3-4 orders of magnitude. We provide design guidelines for generating funneling-induced second-harmonic generation, including resonance mode matching and materials selection. This approach offers a practical pathway for low-field, geometrically tunable THz upconversion and rectification, operating from sub-10 THz to multiple tens of THz in graphene.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Cost-Effective Mid-Infrared Resonant Silicon Microstructures for Surface-Enhanced Infrared Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mid-infrared region is crucial for elucidating the unique biochemical signatures of microorganisms. The MIR resonant structures turned out to facilitate exceptional performance owing to the enhance electric field confinement in the nano-sized aperture. However, the extension of such technique in bacteria-sensing remains limited, primarily due to its micrometre size. This work is the first demonstration of a MIR resonant structure, the gold-coated micro-structured inverted pyramid array of silicon exhibiting light-trapping capabilities, for the bacteria detection in entire MIR range. The electric-field localization within the micro-sized cavity of inverted pyramid amplifies the light-matter interaction by harnessing surface plasmon polaritons, leading to improved detection sensitivity. The confinement of electric field is further corroborated by electric-field simulations based on finite element method. In particular, we observed notable enhancement in both the quantitative and qualitative detection of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus for the bacteria cell with very low concentration, reflecting the efficacy of our detection method. Furthermore, the cost-effective micro structured silicon is fabricated using metal-assisted chemical etching method with the lithography-free method, along with the capabilities of wafer-scale fabrication. Moreover, our device configuration even demonstrates the characteristics of reusability and reproducibility offers substantial benefits over conventional detection schemes. Consequently, this CMOS technology-compatible biosensor signifies promising ways for the integration of this technology with forthcoming bio-applications.</description>

      <title>Trions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduced dielectric screening in atomically thin semiconductors leads to remarkably strong electron interactions. As a result, bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) and charged excitons (trions), which have binding energies in the hundreds and tens of meV, respectively, typically dominate the optical properties of these materials. However, the long-range nature of the interactions between charges represents a significant challenge to the exact calculation of binding energies of complexes larger than the exciton. Here, we demonstrate that the trion binding energy can be efficiently calculated directly from the three-body Schr\"odinger equation in momentum space. Key to this result is a highly accurate way of treating the pole of the electronic interactions at small momentum exchange (i.e., large separation between charges). Our results are in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo calculations, while yielding a substantially larger ratio of the trion to exciton binding energies than obtained in recent variational calculations. Our numerical approach may be extended to a host of different few-body problems in 2D semiconductors, and even potentially to the description of exciton polarons.</description>

      <title>Chiral Light-Matter Interactions with Thermal Magnetoplasmons in Graphene Nanodisks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of self-hybridized thermal magnetoplasmons in doped graphene nanodisks at finite temperatures when subjected to an external magnetic field. Using a semi-analytical approach, which fully describes the eigenmodes and polarizability of the graphene nanodisks, we show that the hybridization originates from the coupling of transitions between thermally populated Landau levels and localized magnetoplasmon resonances of the nanodisks. Owing to their origin, these modes combine the extraordinary magneto-optical response of graphene with the strong field enhancement of plasmons, making them an ideal tool for achieving strong chiral light-matter interactions, with the additional advantage of being tunable through carrier concentration, magnetic field, and temperature. As an illustration of their capabilities, we demonstrate that the thermal magnetoplasmons supported by an array of graphene nanodisks enable chiral perfect absorption and chiral thermal emission.</description>

      <title>Binding energy of polaronic trions and biexcitons in CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of polaron formation on the ground state of excitons, trions and biexcitons confined in CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals is studied in the framework of effective mass Hamiltonians, using a Haken-like (Bajaj) potential for carrier-phonon coupling. The binding energy of trions agrees well with that observed in experiments, with position-dependent dielectric screening playing a significant role. For biexcitons, however, neither polaronic effects, nor dielectric confinement, nor electronic correlations --here accounted for with a variational Quantum Monte Carlo method-- suffice to explain the large binding energies reported by single nanocrystal spectroscopy experiments. This result reinforces the hypothesis that biexcitons polarize the perovskite lattice differently from excitons and trions.</description>

      <title>A Density Functional Theory Study of Magnetic Transition in MnO2 adsorbed Vanadium Carbide (V$_2$C) MXene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work reports nonmagnetic behavior (0.04 $\mu$B) in two-dimensional (2D) V2C-OF MXene and ferromagnetism in MnO$_2$ adsorbed V2C-OF MXene. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to study the magnetic moments of V$_2$C-OF and MnO$_2$@V$_2$C-OF MXene. The MXene, which is derived from the exfoliation of its parent V$_2$AlC MAX phase, shows a good potential to be a ferromagnetic when MnO$_2$ is adsorbed on it. The V$_2$C MXene and MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene were successfully synthesized, as characterized using X-ray diffraction, showing an increased c-lattice parameter from 22.6{\AA} to 27.2{\AA} after MnO$_2$ adsorption. The DFT study confirmed that MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene changed from nonmagnetic (in V$_2$C MXene) to a strong ferromagnetic with a magnetic moment of 4.48$\mu$B for Mn adsorbed V$_2$C-OF MXene. The current work is a step-forward towards understanding of magnetism in two-dimensional materials for future 2D spintronics.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Photon Blockade and Quantum Light Generation from Cavity Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong coupling regime of photons and quantum materials inside optical cavities has emerged as a promising environment for manipulating states of matter with light. Here, in turn, we show that photons bear witness to cavity quantum-electrodynamical modifications of the material, leading to profoundly non-classical properties of light passing through the cavity. By generalizing quantum-optical input-output relations to correlated quantum materials, we study the second-order photon coherence g2(t) and demonstrate that antibunching of transmitted photons serves as direct evidence of light-induced changes to the cavity-embedded material. We show that materials near a quantum critical point can realize a collective many-body photon blockade, enabling the generation of single photons or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs via leveraging strong matter fluctuations. Our findings provide new routes for interrogating and harnessing cavity-embedded quantum materials as quantum light sources, as a resource for photon-based computation and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Theory of anomalous Hall effect from screened vortex charge in a phase disordered superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments showing evidence for chiral superconductivity in an anomalous Hall phase of tetralayer graphene, we study the relation between the normal state anomalous Hall conductivity and that in the phase disordered state above the critical temperature of the superconductor. By a numerical calculation of superconductivity in an anomalous Hall metal, we find that a difference in vortex and antivortex charge is determined by the Fermi surface Berry phase. Combining this with the vortex dynamics in a back-ground supercurrent leads to a Hall response in the phase disordered state of the superconductor that is close to the normal state anomalous Hall response. However, using a gauge-invariant superconducting response framework, we find that while vortex charge is screened by interactions, the screening charge, after a time-delay, reappears in the longitudinal current. Thus, the dc Hall conductivity in this phase, instead of matching the screened vortex charge, matches the ac Hall conductance in the superconducting and normal phase, which are similar.</description>

      <title>Critical states exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The critical states of disordered systems are intriguing subjects within the realm of condensed matter physics and complex systems. These states manifest in materials where disorder plays a significant role, and are distinguished by their multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, accurately characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge. In this study, we argue that critical states exhibit a certain invariance in both position and momentum spaces, leading to their delocalization in both domains. More specifically, it is expected that typical physical quantities characterizing critical states, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, should exhibit invariance in both position space and momentum space. Subsequent numerical simulations validate the correctness of this invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.</description>

      <title>Ultra-sensitive Short-Wave Infrared Single-Photon Detection using a Silicon Single-Electron Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-sensitive short-wave infrared (SWIR) photon detection is a crucial aspect of ongoing research in quantum technology. However, developing such detectors on a CMOS-compatible silicon technological platform has been challenging due to the low absorption coefficient for silicon in the SWIR range. In this study, a codoped silicon-based single-electron transistor (SET) in a silicon-on-insulator field-effect transistor (SOI-FET) configuration is fabricated, which successfully detects single photons in the SWIR range with ultra-high sensitivity. The detection mechanism is evidenced by the shift in the onset of the SET current peaks and by the occurrence of random telegraph signals (RTS) under light irradiation, as compared to the dark condition. The calculated sensitivity of our device, in terms of noise equivalent power, is approximately 10-19 W Hz-1/2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been experimentally shown to exhibit room-temperature single-photon emission. This emission is attributed to defect states in the wide band-gap of hBN, which allow new optical transitions between these dispersion-less defect levels. In this work, we study the new spectral features introduced by interacting atomic defects in consecutive layers of bilayer hBN. Density Functional theory simulations have been carried out to calculate the energy band structure, frequency-dependent complex dielectric functions, and Kohn-Sham states to demonstrate and understand the cause of the emission enhancements. We found that placing colour centres in the vicinity of each other in bilayer hBN introduces new polarization dependent spectral features, with strong dependence on the distance and relative orientation between atomic defects. Our results provide a pathway to engineering single photon emission in hBN via inter-defect interaction.</description>

      <title>How orbitals and oxidation states determine apparent topographies in scanning tunneling microscopy: the case of fluorine on silver surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use density functional theory calculations to characterize the early stages of fluorination of silver's (100) and (110) surfaces. In the Ag(100) surface, the hollow site is the most favorable for F adatoms. In the Ag(110) surface, three adsorption sites, namely hollow, long bridge, and short bridge, exhibit similar energies. These locations are also more favorable than an F adatom occupying a vacancy site irrespectively of whether the vacancy was present or not in the pristine surface. The computed energy as a function of surface coverage is used to compute the equilibrium thermodynamics phase diagram. We argue that for the typical pressure and temperature of fluorination experiments, the state of the surface is not determined by thermodynamics but by kinetics. Combining these results with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) topographic simulations, we propose assignments to features observed experimentally. We present a minimal model of the apparent topography of adatoms in different locations in terms of hydrogenic orbitals, explaining the observed trends. The model links the STM apparent topography to structural information and the oxidation states of the Ag atoms near the adatom.</description>

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns, typically formed by overlaying two layers of two-dimensional materials, exhibit an effective long-range periodicity that depends on the short-range periodicity of each layer and their spatial misalignment. Here, we study moir\'e patterns in objective structures with symmetries different from those in conventional patterns such as twisted bilayer graphene. Specifically, the mathematical descriptions for ring patterns, 2D Bravais lattice patterns, and helical patterns are derived analytically as representative examples of objective moir\'e patterns, using an augmented Fourier approach. Our findings reveal that the objective moir\'e patterns retain the symmetries of their original structures but with different parameters. In addition, we present a non-objective case, conformal moir\'e patterns, to demonstrate the versatility of this approach. We hope this geometric framework will provide insights for solving more complex moir\'e patterns and facilitate the application of moir\'e patterns in X-ray diffractions, wave manipulations, molecular dynamics, and other fields.</description>

      <title>Charge-Neutral Electronic Excitations in Quantum Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments on quantum materials have uncovered many interesting quantum phases ranging from superconductivity to a variety of topological quantum matter including the recently observed fractional quantum anomalous Hall insulators. The findings have come in parallel with the development of approaches to probe the rich excitations inherent in such systems. In contrast to observing electrically charged excitations, the detection of charge-neutral electronic excitations in condensed matter remains difficult, though they are essential to understanding a large class of strongly correlated phases. Low-energy neutral excitations are especially important in characterizing unconventional phases featuring electron fractionalization, such as quantum spin liquids, spin ices, and insulators with neutral Fermi surfaces. In this perspective, we discuss searches for neutral fermionic, bosonic, or anyonic excitations in unconventional insulators, highlighting theoretical and experimental progress in probing excitonic insulators, new quantum spin liquid candidates and emergent correlated insulators based on two-dimensional layered crystals and moir\'e materials. We outline the promises and challenges in probing and utilizing quantum insulators, and discuss exciting new opportunities for future advancements offered by ideas rooted in next-generation quantum materials, devices, and experimental schemes.</description>

      <title>Cubic Dirac Semimetals: General Theory and Application to Rare-Earth Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetry exhibit unique topological properties. However, the origin of these behaviors remains presently unclear. Here, we develop minimal models for Dirac semimetals (DSMs) with accidental band crossings and higher-order topology in cubic systems, incorporating candidate magnetic order to analyze bulk, surface, and hinge state characteristics. In certain cubic-symmetric DSMs, we identify an effective Z2 chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states. Our results highlight distinct features in surface state dispersions, Fermi arcs, polarization dependence, and band splitting that correlate with photoe- mission data in rare-earth monopnictides. We also suggest candidate materials and experimental tests for further validation. These findings advance our understanding of surface states in rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetries and illuminate the role of DSM physics in these systems.</description>

      <title>Layer-dependent evolution of electronic structures and correlations in rhombohedral multilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity and magnetism in trilayer rhombohedral graphene (RG) establishes an ideal, untwisted platform to study strong correlation electronic phenomena. However, the correlated effects in multilayer RG have received limited attention, and, particularly, the evolution of the correlations with increasing layer number remains an unresolved question. Here, we show the observation of layer-dependent electronic structures and correlations, under surprising liquid nitrogen temperature, in RG multilayers from 3 to 9 layers by using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We explicitly determine layer-enhanced low-energy flat bands and interlayer coupling strengths. The former directly demonstrates the further flattening of low-energy bands in thicker RG, and the latter indicates the presence of varying interlayer interactions in RG multilayers. Moreover, we find significant splittings of the flat bands, ranging from ~50-80 meV, at 77 K when they are partially filled, indicating the emergence of interaction-induced strongly correlated states. Particularly, the strength of the correlated states is notably enhanced in thicker RG and reaches its maximum in the six-layer, validating directly theoretical predictions and establishing abundant new candidates for strongly correlated systems. Our results provide valuable insights into the layer dependence of the electronic properties in RG and demonstrate it as a suitable system for investigating robust and highly accessible correlated phases.</description>

Abstract: Whispering gallery resonators offer a versatile platform for manipulating the photonic transmission. Here, we study such a system, including periodically distributed pointlike impurities along the resonator with ring geometry. Based on an exact expression for the transmission probability we obtain here, we demonstrate that the bound states in the continuum (BICs) form from the whispering gallery modes at the high-symmetry momenta in the ring's Brillouin zone. Furthermore, the presence of the inversion symmetry allows for a selective decoupling of resonant states, favoring the BIC generation and, therefore, allowing extra tunability in the optical transmission of the system.</description>

Abstract: Semiconductor integrated circuits operated at cryogenic temperature will play an essential role in quantum computing architectures. These can offer equivalent or superior performance to their room-temperature counterparts while enabling a scaling up of the total number of qubits under control. Silicon integrated circuits can be operated at a temperature stage of a cryogenic system where cooling power is sufficient ($\sim$3.5+ K) to allow for analog signal chain components (e.g. amplifiers and mixers), local signal synthesis, signal digitization, and control logic. A critical stage in cryo-electronics development is the characterization of individual transistor devices in a particular technology node at cryogenic temperatures. This data enables the creation of a process design kit (PDK) to model devices and simulate integrated circuits operating well below the minimum standard temperature ranges covered by foundry-released models (e.g. -55 {\deg}C). Here, an efficient approach to the characterization of large numbers of components at cryogenic temperature is reported. We developed a system to perform DC measurements with Kelvin sense of individual transistors at 4.2 K using integrated on-die multiplexers, enabling bulk characterization of thousands of devices with no physical change to the measurement setup.</description>

      <title>Emergence of moir\'e superlattice potential in graphene by twisted-hBN layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices formed in stacks of two or more 2D crystals with similar lattice structures have recently become excellent platforms to reveal new physics in low-dimensional systems. They are, however, highly sensitive to the angle and lattice constant differences between the associated crystals, limiting the range of the material choice and the possible moir\'e patterns for a given 2D crystal. Here, we present a novel approach to realize an atomically flat substrate with a periodic moir\'e pattern that can induce the moir\'e potential on the material on top by van der Waals (vdW) interactions, without suffering from the lattice and angle mismatch. By constructing a twisted hBN (thBN) moir\'e substrate at an angle of about 1$^\circ$, we show that the graphene on top, aligned around 15$^\circ$ with the neighboring hBN layers, exhibits typical transport properties under a hexagonal moir\'e potential, including multiple satellite Dirac points (DPs), Hofstadter butterfly effect, and Brown-Zak oscillations. All features point to the existence of the moir\'e potential in graphene formed by thBN with $\sim$1$^\circ$ twist angle. Further statistical study shows that the twist from a parallel interface between the hBN layers is critical to induce the moir\'e potential. Our study demonstrates that the thBN moir\'e substrate can be used to investigate moir\'e physics in arbitrary materials without being constrained by their lattice constants.</description>

      <title>Volkov-Pankratov states in a driven semimetal for a generic interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Volkov-Pankratov states are nontopological massive bound states which generally arise across the smooth interface between two adjacent regions of a two-band semimetal, over which a gap parameter changes sign smoothly. In this work, we show that these modes can be engineered even for a generic smooth interface without any sign inversion. We consider threefold and twofold topological semimetals in which two adjacent regions are illuminated by light with different phases. We show that the interface can exhibit an asymmetric Rosen-Morse potential well for a certain parameter regime even without any sign change of the gap term. Such a quantum well can host a number of Volkov-Pankratov states. We also note that even in a two-band two-dimensional semimetal like graphene, the Volkov-Pankratov states can emerge if one induces a momentum shift rather than opening a gap. Finally, we discuss the transport signatures over those interfacial quantum wells. We note that although the Ramsauer-Townsend effect appears over the symmetric-type P\"oschl-Teller potential well, this effect is absent over an asymmetric Rosen-Morse potential well. We reveal that a transition from a unit transmission to a unit reflection can be achieved by just controlling light parameters in a periodically driven graphene. We observe that the unit reflection phenomenon is direction sensitive; i.e., only incoming electrons from one particular side (left or right) can be perfectly reflected back without any transmission.</description>

Abstract: We study two-dimensional systems with Galilean invariance gapped under magnetic fields. When such quantum Hall systems are coupled with external sources for charge, energy, and momentum currents, they exhibit invariance under the Milne boost as well as under the gauge and general coordinate transformations. We construct the most general effective action consistent with all the symmetries in the derivative expansion, where an electric field is regarded as order of unity so as to allow for nonlinear responses. The resulting action is shown to consist of four terms proportional to the Hall conductivity and viscosity and the energy density and magnetization. We then compute the local currents induced by electromagnetic fields, revealing universal relations among distinct kinds of responses. In particular, we find the Hall conductivity determining the longitudinal conductivity at nonzero frequency and the Hall viscosity contributing to the nonlinear electrothermal conductivity at nonzero wave number.</description>

Abstract: The coalescence of eigenstates is a unique phenomena in non-Hermitian systems. Remarkably, it has been noticed in some non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions that the whole set of eigenstates can coalesce to only a few eigenstates. In the parameter space, the point at which such a coalescence of macroscopic eigenstates occurs is dubbed as an infernal point. In this paper, based on the non-Bloch band theory and amoeba formulation, we establish the criteria for the presence of infernal points in one-dimensional and higher dimensional open-boundary non-Hermitian systems. In addition, we find an explanation of the extreme localization of the wave functions and unveil the mechanism for the coalescence of enormous eigenstates at the infernal points. Our work provides a general theory for infernal points in open-boundary non-Hermitian systems in arbitrary dimensions, and hence paves the way to study the intriguing infernal points systematically.</description>

Abstract: Monolayer NiI$_2$ garners large research interest due to its multiferroic behavior stemming from the interplay between its non-collinear magnetic order and the spin-orbit coupling. This prompts an investigation into the stability of the magnetic order in NiI$_2$ and similar materials under external stimuli. In this work, we report the effect of biaxial and uniaxial strain on the magnetic ground state, the critical temperature, and the magnonic properties of the NiX$_2$ (X = I, Br, Cl) monolayers. For all three materials, we reveal intricate strain-dependent phase diagrams, including ferromagnetic, helimagnetic, and skyrmionic phases. Moreover, we discuss the necessity of considering the biquadratic exchange interaction in the latter analysis. We reveal that the biquadratic exchange significantly alters both the magnetic ground state and the critical temperature of the magnetic order, and we demonstrate that its importance becomes even more explicit when monolayer Ni-dihalides are strained. Finally, we calculate the magnonic dispersion for the predicted magnetic states, showing that the skyrmionic phase functions as a magnonic crystal, and demonstrate the presence of strain-tunable soft magnon modes at finite wavevectors in the helimagnetic phase.</description>

      <title>Quasicrystalline 30$^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer graphene: Fractal patterns and electronic localization properties</title>

Abstract: The recently synthesized 30$^\circ$ twisted bilayer graphene (30$^\circ$-TBG) systems are unique quasicrystal systems possessing dodecagonal symmetry with graphene's relativistic properties.
  We employ a real-space numerical atomistic framework that respects both the dodecagonal rotational symmetry and the massless Dirac nature of the electrons to describe the local density of states of the system.
  The approach we employ is very efficiency for systems with very large unit cells and does not rely on periodic boundary conditions. These features allow us to address a broad class of multilayer two-dimensional crystal with incommensurate configurations, particularly TBGs. Our results reveal that the 30$^\circ$-TBG electronic spectrum consist of extended states together with a set of localized wave functions. The localized states exhibit fractal patterns consistent with the quasicrystal tiling.</description>

      <title>Topological Josephson parametric amplifier array: A proposal for directional, broadband, and low-noise amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13728v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-noise microwave amplifiers are crucial for detecting weak signals in fields such as quantum technology and radio astronomy. However, designing an ideal amplifier is challenging, as it must cover a wide frequency range, add minimal noise, and operate directionally - amplifying signals only in the observer's direction while protecting the source from environmental interference. In this work, we demonstrate that an array of non-linearly coupled Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs) can collectively function as a directional, broadband quantum amplifier by harnessing topological effects. By applying a collective four-wave-mixing pump with inhomogeneous amplitudes and linearly increasing phase, we break time-reversal symmetry in the JPA array and stabilize a topological amplification regime where signals are exponentially amplified in one direction and exponentially suppressed in the opposite. We show that compact devices with few sites $N\sim 11-17$ can achieve exceptional performance, with gains exceeding 20 dB over a bandwidth ranging from hundreds of MHz to GHz, and reverse isolation suppressing backward noise by more than 30 dB across all frequencies. The device also operates near the quantum noise limit and provides topological protection against up to 15% fabrication disorder, effectively suppressing gain ripples. The amplifier's intrinsic directionality eliminates the need for external isolators, paving the way for fully on-chip, near-ideal superconducting pre-amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Catalog of Unconventional Magnons in Collinear Magnets</title>

Abstract: Topological magnons have garnered significant interest for their potential in both fundamental research and device applications, owing to their exotic, uncharged, yet topologically protected boundary modes. However, their comprehension has been hindered by the absence of fundamental symmetry descriptions of magnetic materials, which are primarily governed by isotropic Heisenberg interactions in spin Hamiltonians. The ensuing magnon dispersions enable gapless magnon band nodes that go beyond the scenario of representation theory of the magnetic space groups (MSGs), thus referred to as unconventional magnons. Here we developed spin space group (SSG) theory to elucidate collinear magnetic configurations, classifying the 1421 collinear SSGs into four types, constructing their band representations, and providing a comprehensive tabulation of unconventional magnons, such as duodecuple points, octuple nodal lines, and charge-4 octuple points. Based on the MAGNDATA database, we identified 498 collinear magnets with unconventional magnons, among which over 200 magnon band structures were obtained by using first-principles calculations and linear spin wave theory. Additionally, we evaluated the influence of the spin-orbit coupling-induced exchange interaction in these magnets and found that more than 80% are predominantly governed by the Heisenberg interactions, indicating that SSG serves as an ideal framework for describing magnon band nodes in most 3d, 4d and half-filled 4f collinear magnets. Our work offers new pathways for exploring uncharged transports in magnonic systems, holding promise for advancements in next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Twisted coupled wire model for a moir\'e sliding Luttinger liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer WTe$_2$ revealed the existence of anisotropic Luttinger liquid behavior. To generically characterize such anisotropic twisted bilayer systems, we study a model of a twisted bilayer of two-dimensional (2D) arrays of coupled wires, which effectively form an array of coupled moir\'e wires. We solve the model by the transfer matrix method, and identify quasi-1D electron bands in the system at small twist angles. With electron interactions added, we show that the moir\'e wires have an effective Luttinger parameter $g_\text{eff}$ much lower than that of the microscopic wires. This leads to a sliding Luttinger liquid (SLL) temperature regime, in which power-law current voltage relations arise. For parameters partly estimated from WTe$_2$, a microscopic interaction $U\sim0.7$eV yields a temperature regime of SLL similar to that in the WTe$_2$ experiments.</description>

      <title>Two-doublon Bloch oscillations in the mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactions between particles normally induce the decay of the particles Bloch oscillations (BOs) in a periodic lattice. In the limit of strong on-site interactions, spin-$1/2$ fermions may form doublon bound states and undergo BOs in the presence of a tilted potential. Here we investigate the impact of nearest-neighbor interaction $V$ on the multi-doublon BOs in a mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model. We derive an effective Hamiltonian for doublons, and show that a slight change in $V$ can qualitatively alter their dynamic behaviors. Notably, at a resonance point, the doublons behave like free hard-core bosons. Under a tilted potential, the system may exhibit different types of multi-doublon BOs at or deviation from the resonance point. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate our conclusions in both one- and two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral Nonlinear Polaritonics with van der Waals Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the strong-coupling regime, the interaction between light and matter reaches a hybridization state where the photonic and material components become inseparably linked. Using tailored states of light to break symmetries in such systems can underpin the development of novel non-equilibrium quantum materials. Chiral optical cavities offer a promising way for this, enabling either temporal or spatial symmetry-breaking, both of which are unachievable with conventional mirror cavities. For spatial symmetry-breaking a cavity needs to discriminate the handedness of circularly polarized light, a functionality that can only be achieved with metamaterials. Here, we suggest and demonstrate experimentally a chiral transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) metasurface with broken out-of-plane symmetry, allowing for a selective formation of self-hybridized exciton-polaritons with specific chirality. Our metasurface cavity maintains maximum chirality for oblique incidence up to 20{\deg}, significantly outperforming all previously known designs, thereby turning the angle of incidence from a constraint to a new degree of freedom for sub-nanometer precise control of resonance wavelengths. Moreover, we study the chiral strong-coupling regime in nonlinear experiments and show the polariton-driven nature of chiral third-harmonic generation. Our results demonstrate a clear pathway towards novel quantum material engineering with implications in a wide range of photonics research, such as superconductivity and valleytronics.</description>
