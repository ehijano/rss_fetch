      <title>NACSOS-nexus: NLP Assisted Classification, Synthesis and Online Screening with New and EXtended Usage Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NACSOS is a web-based platform for curating data used in systematic maps. It contains several (experimental) features that aid the evidence synthesis process from finding and ingesting primary data (mainly scientific publications), basic search and exploration thereof, but mainly the handling of managing the manual and automated annotations. The platform supports prioritised screening algorithms and is the first to fully implement statistical stopping criteria. Annotations by multiple coders can be resolved and customisable quality metrics are computed on-the-fly. In its current state, the annotations are performed on document level. The ecosystem around NACSOS offers packages for accessing the underlying database and practical utility functions that have proven useful in a multitude of projects. Further, it provides the backbone of living maps, review ecosystems, and our public literature hub for sharing high-quality curated corpora.</description>

      <title>myAURA: Personalized health library for epilepsy management via knowledge graph sparsification and visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: We report the development of the patient-centered myAURA application and suite of methods designed to aid epilepsy patients, caregivers, and researchers in making decisions about care and self-management.
  Materials and Methods: myAURA rests on the federation of an unprecedented collection of heterogeneous data resources relevant to epilepsy, such as biomedical databases, social media, and electronic health records. A generalizable, open-source methodology was developed to compute a multi-layer knowledge graph linking all this heterogeneous data via the terms of a human-centered biomedical dictionary.
  Results: The power of the approach is first exemplified in the study of the drug-drug interaction phenomenon. Furthermore, we employ a novel network sparsification methodology using the metric backbone of weighted graphs, which reveals the most important edges for inference, recommendation, and visualization, such as pharmacology factors patients discuss on social media. The network sparsification approach also allows us to extract focused digital cohorts from social media whose discourse is more relevant to epilepsy or other biomedical problems. Finally, we present our patient-centered design and pilot-testing of myAURA, including its user interface, based on focus groups and other stakeholder input.
  Discussion: The ability to search and explore myAURA's heterogeneous data sources via a sparsified multi-layer knowledge graph, as well as the combination of those layers in a single map, are useful features for integrating relevant information for epilepsy.
  Conclusion: Our stakeholder-driven, scalable approach to integrate traditional and non-traditional data sources, enables biomedical discovery and data-powered patient self-management in epilepsy, and is generalizable to other chronic conditions.</description>

      <title>Open Access Improves the Dissemination of Science: Insights from Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wikipedia is a well-known platform for disseminating knowledge, and scientific sources, such as journal articles, play a critical role in supporting its mission. The open access movement aims to make scientific knowledge openly available, and we might intuitively expect open access to help further Wikipedia's mission. However, the extent of this relationship remains largely unknown. To fill this gap, we analyze a large dataset of citations from the English Wikipedia and model the role of open access in Wikipedia's citation patterns. We find that both the accessibility (open access status) and academic impact (citation count) significantly increase the probability of an article being cited on Wikipedia. Specifically, open-access articles are extensively and increasingly more cited in Wikipedia, as they show an approximately 64.7% higher likelihood of being cited in Wikipedia when compared to closed-access articles, after controlling for confounding factors. This open-access citation effect is particularly strong for articles with high citation counts and published in recent years. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of open access in facilitating the dissemination of scientific knowledge, thereby increasing the likelihood of open-access articles reaching a more diverse audience through platforms such as Wikipedia. Simultaneously, open-access articles contribute to the reliability of Wikipedia as a source by affording editors timely access to novel results.</description>

      <title>The Rise and Fall of the Initial Era</title>

Abstract: Bibliographic data is a rich source of information that goes beyond the use cases of location and citation -- it also encodes both cultural and technological context. For most of its existence, the scholarly record has changed slowly and hence provides an opportunity to gain insight through its reflection of the cultural norms of the research community over the last four centuries. While it is often difficult to distinguish the originating driver of change, it is still valuable to consider the motivating influences that have led to changes in the structure of the scholarly record. An "initial era" is identified during which initials were used in preference to full names by authors on scholarly communications. Causes of the emergence and demise of this era are considered as well as the implications of this era on research culture and practice.</description>
