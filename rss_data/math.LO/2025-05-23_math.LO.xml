      <title>Free five-valued Nelson Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Five-valued Nelson algebras are those satisfying the condition: $((x\to z)\to y)\to(((y \to x)\to y)\to y)=1$. We give alternative equations defining these algebras, and determine the structure and number of elements of the free five-valued Nelson algebra with a finite number of free generators.</description>

      <title>A model with fragments of projective determinacy and failures of $\mathsf{DC}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a construction of a model of second order arithmetic in which (boldface) $\bm{\Pi^1_n}$-determinacy holds, but (lightface) $\Pi^1_{n+2}$-$\mathsf{DC}$ fails, thus showing that no projective level of determinacy implies full $\mathsf{DC}_{\mathbb{R}}$. The construction builds upon the work of Gitman, Friedman, and Kanovei.</description>

      <title>Flipping and Forking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monadic stability and the more general monadic dependence (or NIP) are tameness conditions for classes of logical structures, studied in the 80's in Shelah's classification program in model theory. They recently emerged in algorithmic and structural graph theory and finite model theory as central notions in relation with the model checking problem for first-order logic: the problem was shown to be fixed-parameter tractable for inputs which come from a fixed class of graphs which is monadically stable, and is conjectured to be tractable in all monadically dependent classes. Several combinatorial characterizations of such graph classes turned out to be essential in their algorithmic treatment; they are all based on the fundamental operation of "flipping" a graph.
  We introduce the notions of $\textit{flips}$ and $\textit{flip independence}$ in arbitrary relational structures. We lift prior combinatorial characterizations of monadically stable graph classes to monadically stable classes of relational structures. We show the equivalence of flip independence with $\textit{forking independence}$ (over models) -- a logical notion of paramount importance in stability theory -- in monadically stable structures, shedding new light on the relevance of flips, also characterizing forking independence (over models) combinatorially. We give more precise descriptions of forking independence in the case of monadically stable graphs, and relational structures with a nowhere dense Gaifman graph.</description>

      <title>A note on the definability of genus for Zariski geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.02218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we propose a notion of genus in the context of Zariski geometries and we obtain natural generalizations of the Riemann--Hurwitz Theorem and the Hurwitz Theorem in the context of very ample Zariski geometries. As a corollary, we show that such notion of genus cannot be first-order definable in the full language of a Zariski geometry.</description>

      <title>Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, Maximum Deconstructibility, and singly-generated torsion classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deconstructibility is an often-used sufficient condition on a class $\mathcal{C}$ of modules that allows one to carry out homological algebra \emph{relative to $\mathcal{C}$}. The principle \textbf{Maximum Deconstructibility (MD)} asserts that a certain necessary condition for a class to be deconstructible is also sufficient. MD implies, for example, that the classes of Gorenstein Projective modules, Ding Projective modules, their relativized variants, and all torsion classes are deconstructible over any ring. MD was known to follow from Vop\v{e}nka's Principle and imply the existence of an $\omega_1$-strongly compact cardinal. We prove that MD is equivalent to Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, and to the assertion that each torsion class of abelian groups is generated by a single group within the class (yielding the converse of a theorem of G\"obel and Shelah).</description>

      <title>Big Ramsey degrees using parameter spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.00967v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the universal homogeneous partial order has finite big Ramsey degrees and discuss several corollaries. Our proof relies on parameter spaces and the Carlson-Simpson theorem rather than on (a strengthening of) the Halpern-L\"auchli theorem and the Milliken tree theorem, which are typically used to bound big Ramsey degrees in the existing literature (originating from the work of Laver and Milliken).
  This new technique has many additional applications. We show that the homogeneous universal triangle-free graph has finite big Ramsey degrees, providing a short proof of a recent result by Dobrinen. Moreover, generalizing an indivisibility (vertex partition) result of Nguyen van Th\'e and Sauer, we give an upper bound on big Ramsey degrees of metric spaces with finitely many distances. This leads to a new combinatorial argument for the oscillation stability of the Urysohn Sphere.</description>

      <title>Vague Knowledge: Evidence from Analyst Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People in the real world often possess vague knowledge of future payoffs, for which quantification is not feasible or desirable. We argue that language, with differing ability to convey vague information, plays an important but less known-role in representing subjective expectations. Empirically, we find that in their reports, analysts include useful information in linguistic expressions but not numerical forecasts. Specifically, the textual tone of analyst reports has predictive power for forecast errors and subsequent revisions in numerical forecasts, and this relation becomes stronger when analyst's language is vaguer, when uncertainty is higher, and when analysts are busier. Overall, our theory and evidence suggest that some useful information is vaguely known and only communicated through language.</description>
