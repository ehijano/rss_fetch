      <title>Millimeter-scale rigid diamond probe for high sensitivity endoscopic-magnetometry applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetometry based on diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers has been extensively studied for applications requiring diverse capabilities, spanning from nanometer spatial resolution to subpicotesla sensitivity. Among various applications, diamond magnetometers can demonstrate high sensitivity magnetic sensing within millimeter-scale size for endoscopic applications. However, the trade-off between sensitivity and spatial resolution of diamond magnetometry makes it difficult to achieve such a probe. In this study, we present a millimeter-scale rigid diamond magnetometer probe with enhanced sensitivity via optimizing the optical design. By coupling the frustum diamond with the miniaturized compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) lens, we enhance the fluorescence collection efficiency by 37% within 4 mm diameter, and the achieved sensitivity is 200 pT/Hz1/2 based on the sample with the resonance linewidth of ~8 MHz. With this verified structure, endoscopes with mm-size probe and picotesla sensitivity can be projected for surgical and industrial applications in the future.</description>

      <title>Beam Test Performance of AstroPix sensor with 120 GeV protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AstroPix is a high-voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS) monolithic active pixel sensor (MAPS) developed for precision gamma-ray imaging and spectroscopy in the medium energy regime, as well as for precise shower imaging and tracking in the Barrel Imaging Calorimeter (BIC) of the Electron Proton/Ion Collider (ePIC) detector at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). We present beam test results of the AstroPix v3 sensor using a 120 GeV proton beam at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility (FTBF), performed as part of the broader experimental campaign for the BIC prototype calorimeter. The sensor's 500 um pixel pitch enabled precise measurement of the beam profile, providing important information for calorimeter performance studies. Using the measured 120 GeV proton data, we measure the energy deposit of minimum ionizing particles and use them to extract the corresponding effective depletion depth.</description>

      <title>CAGE: An Internal Source Scanning Cryostat for HPGe Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of current and future-generation neutrinoless double beta decay experiments relies on the ability to eliminate or reduce extraneous backgrounds. In addition to constructing experiments using radiopure materials and handling in underground laboratories, it is necessary to understand and reduce known backgrounds in data analysis. The Large Enriched Germanium Experiment for Neutrinoless double beta Decay is searching for this decay using 76Ge-enriched high-purity germanium detectors submerged in an active liquid argon veto. A significant background in LEGEND is surface events from shallowly-impinging radiation on detector surfaces. In this paper we introduce the Collimated Alphas, Gammas, and Electrons (CAGE) scanning system, an internal-source scanning vacuum cryostat, designed to perform studies of surface events on sensitive surfaces of HPGe in a surface-lab. CAGE features a collimated radionuclide source inside a movable infrared shield that is able to perform precision scans of detector surfaces by utilizing three independent motor stages for source positioning. This allows detailed studies of pulse shapes as a function of source position and incident angle, where defining features can be extracted and exploited for removing surface backgrounds in data analysis in LEGEND. In this paper, we describe CAGE and demonstrate its performance with a commissioning run with 241Am. The commissioning run was completed with the source at normal incidence, and we estimate a beam spot precision of 3.1 mm, which includes positioning uncertainties and the beam-spot size. Using the 59.5 keV gamma population from 241Am, we show that low-energy photon events near the passivated surface feature risetimes that increase with radial distance from the detector center. We suggest a specific metric that can be used to discriminate low-energy gamma backgrounds in LEGEND with similar characteristics.</description>

      <title>Shallow Trap States Control Electrical Performance of Amorphous Oxide Semiconductor Thin-Film Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of n-type amorphous oxide semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs) is largely controlled by the density of states (DoS) near the conduction band mobility edge. Here, the full subgap DoS of amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) TFTs, used in display panels and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) development, is measured by ultrabroadband photoconduction (UP-DoS) microscopy to within 0.1 eV of the mobility edge. The measured subgap DoS for 25 TFT processing conditions accurately predicts each transfer curve, showing how shallow defect states are electron traps that rigidly tune subthreshold swing, threshold voltage and drift mobility. For a set of TFTs, the subthreshold transfer characteristics can be independently simulated from the experimental shallow defect DoS, with no adjustable parameters. The full transfer curve is simulated by introducing a single parameter: the conduction band tail energy. Additionally, the simulation reveals that the shallow trap density controlling subthreshold behavior can be directly extracted from transfer curves. Finally, a systematic In-enrichment study, combined with DFT+U DoS simulations, enables identification of vacancy cation coordination environments for all experimentally observed subgap peaks. The dominant trap controlling conventional a-IGZO TFT performance is centered at ~0.32 eV below the conduction band mobility edge and is assigned to a Ga-Ga-In oxygen vacancy defect.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear multiphysics model for the design validation of the ASTAROTH copper-steel cryogenic chamber</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the global efforts to directly detect dark matter, the only positive claim so far relies on NaI(Tl) crystal detectors, making this technology of particular interest. ASTAROTH is a project aimed at developing the next generation of such detectors by reading out their scintillation light with SiPM matrices operated at cryogenic temperatures. This paper describes the innovative design of the ASTAROTH cryostat, consisting of a double-walled copper-steel cryogenic chamber that cools the detectors by means of a liquid argon bath. The detectors are thermalized in a helium atmosphere at a temperature tunable from 87 to 150 K. The design has been validated in terms of heat transfer efficiency and mechanical stress, developing a nonlinear multiphysics model. The mechanical properties of OFHC copper were experimentally evaluated on dedicated tensile samples. The simulation results show that the structural integrity is guaranteed. At the highest operating temperature, the region with the steepest temperature gradient exhibits stresses that slightly exceed the yield strength of copper (localized strain-hardened condition). Following construction, the cryostat was commissioned and has been in regular operation for over 30 cooling cycles, with no signs of degradation. The temperature can be tuned across the full target range and remains stable within 0.1 K. These results demonstrate that this is a viable design for next-generation dark matter detectors, as well as for a variety of applications requiring uniform and tunable gas-conducted cooling of instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise in a squeezed-light-enhanced multiparameter quantum sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum enhancement of sensitivity using squeezed light in a multi-parameter quantum sensor, the hybrid dc-rf optically pumped magnetometer (hOPM) [Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 034054, (2024)]. Using a single spin ensemble, the hOPM acquires both the dc field strength (scalar magnetometry), and resonantly detects one quadrature of the ac magnetic field at a chosen frequency (rf magnetometry). In contrast to the Bell-Bloom scalar magnetometer [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193601 (2021)], the back-action evasion in the hOPM is incomplete, leading to a nontrivial interplay of the three quantum noise sources in this system: photon shot noise, spin projection noise, and measurement back-action noise. We observe these interactions using squeezed light as a tool to control the distribution of optical quantum noise between $S_2$ and $S_3$ polarization Stokes components, and the resulting effect on readout quantum noise and measurement back-action. These results demonstrate quantum-enhanced sensitivity in a continuously operating multi-parameter sensor and reveal fundamental trade-offs between sensitivity, back-action, and bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of PID Performance at CEPC and Optimization with Combined dN/dx and Time-of-Flight Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive study of charged-hadron particle identification (PID) at the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), based on full simulation of hadronic $Z$-pole events. A unified PID strategy is developed by combining energy loss measurements (dN/dx) from the time projection chamber (TPC) and time-of-flight (ToF) information from both the inner (ITK) and outer (OTK) silicon trackers. The PID discriminant is constructed using residuals between measured and expected observables under multiple particle hypotheses, with identification regions optimized to maximize kaon efficiency and purity across bins of momentum and polar angle. Results show that the TPC alone, while highly efficient (90.3\%), suffers from dN/dx curve overlaps and low-energy detection limits, yielding only 23.2\% purity. Incorporating ToF from OTK improves the purity to 30.5\%. A full combination of ITK, TPC, and OTK significantly enhances performance, achieving 97.1\% efficiency and 85.5\% purity (product: 83.1\%). These results demonstrate that the CEPC baseline detector fulfills the requirements for precision flavor tagging and provide clear guidance for future optimization of timing detector configurations.</description>
