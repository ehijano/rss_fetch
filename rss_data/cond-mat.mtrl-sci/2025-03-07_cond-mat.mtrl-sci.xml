      <title>Materials Graph Library (MatGL), an open-source graph deep learning library for materials science and chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph deep learning models, which incorporate a natural inductive bias for a collection of atoms, are of immense interest in materials science and chemistry. Here, we introduce the Materials Graph Library (MatGL), an open-source graph deep learning library for materials science and chemistry. Built on top of the popular Deep Graph Library (DGL) and Python Materials Genomics (Pymatgen) packages, our intention is for MatGL to be an extensible ``batteries-included'' library for the development of advanced graph deep learning models for materials property predictions and interatomic potentials. At present, MatGL has efficient implementations for both invariant and equivariant graph deep learning models, including the Materials 3-body Graph Network (M3GNet), MatErials Graph Network (MEGNet), Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Network (CHGNet), TensorNet and SO3Net architectures. MatGL also includes a variety of pre-trained universal interatomic potentials (aka ``foundational materials models (FMM)'') and property prediction models are also included for out-of-box usage, benchmarking and fine-tuning. Finally, MatGL includes support for Pytorch Lightning for rapid training of models.</description>

      <title>Effect of Alloying on Intrinsic Ductility in WTaCrV High Entropy Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tungsten (W) exhibits desirable properties for extreme applications, such as the divertor in magnetic fusion reactors, but its practicality remains limited due to poor formability and insufficient irradiation resistance. In this work, we study the intrinsic ductility of body-centered cubic WTaCrV based high entropy alloys (HEAs), which are known to exhibit excellent irradiation resistance. The ductility evaluations are carried out using a criterion based on the competition between the critical stress intensity factors for emission (KIe) and cleavage (KIc) in the {110} slip planes and {110} crack planes, which are evaluated within the linear elastic fracture mechanics framework and computed using density functional theory calculations. The results suggest that increasing the alloying concentrations of V and reducing the concentrations of W can significantly improve the ductility in these HEAs. The elastic anisotropy for these HEAs is analyzed using the Zener anisotropy ratio and its correlation with the concentration of W in the alloys is studied. Results indicate that these alloys tend to be fairly isotropic independently from the concentration of W in them. The computed data for the elastic constants of these HEAs is also compared against the available experimental data. The results are in good agreement, hence validating the robustness and accuracy of the computational methods. Multiple phenomenological ductility metrics were also computed and analyzed against the analytical model. The results suggest that these models may have higher computational efficiency due to less number of parameters required for their computation. Some models, like the surrogate D parameter and the Pugh ratio, show a good correlation with the Rice model. The potential of these empirical models to serve as surrogate screening models for optimizing the compositional space is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport Properties in Epitaxial Films of Metallic Delafossite PdCoO$_2$: Effects of Thickness and Width Variations in Hall Bar Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a combined structural and magnetotransport study of Hall bar devices of various lateral dimensions patterned side-by-side on epitaxial PdCoO$_2$ thin films. We study the effects of both the thickness of the PdCoO$_2$ film and the width of the channel on the electronic transport and the magnetoresistance properties of the Hall bar devices. All the films with thicknesses down to 4.88 nm are epitaxially oriented, phase pure, and exhibit a metallic behavior. At room temperature, the Hall bar device with the channel width $\text{W}=2.5\, \mu\text{m}$ exhibits a record resistivity value of $0.85\,\mu\Omega$cm, while the value of $2.70\,\mu\Omega$cm is obtained in a wider device with channel width $\text{W}=10\, \mu\text{m}$. For the 4.88 nm thick sample, we find that while the density of the conduction electrons is comparable in both channels, the electrons move about twice as fast in the narrower channel. At low temperatures, for Hall bar devices of channel width $2.5\,\mu\text{m}$ fabricated on epitaxial films of thicknesses 4.88 and 5.21 nm, the electron mobilities of $\approx$ 65 and 40 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, respectively, are extracted. For thin-film Hall bar devices of width $10\,\mu\text{m}$ fabricated on the same 4.88 and 5.21 nm thick samples, the mobility values of $\approx$ 32 and 18 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ are obtained. The magnetoresistance characteristics of these PdCoO$_2$ films are observed to be temperature dependent and exhibit a dependency with the orientation of the applied magnetic field. When the applied field is oriented 90{\deg} away from the crystal $c$-axis, a persistent negative MR at all temperatures is observed; whereas when the field is parallel to the $c$-axis, the negative magnetoresistance is suppressed at temperatures above 150K.</description>

      <title>Mapping strain and structural heterogeneities around bubbles in amorphous ionically conductive Bi$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While amorphous materials are often approximated to have a statistically homogeneous atomic structure, they frequently exhibit localized structural heterogeneity that challenges simplified models. This study uses 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy to investigate the strain and structural modifications around gas bubbles in amorphous Bi$_2$O$_3$ induced by argon irradiation. We present a method for determining strain fields surrounding bubbles that can be used to measure the internal pressure of the gas. Compressive strain is observed around the cavities, with higher-order crystalline symmetries emerging near the cavity interfaces, suggesting paracrystalline ordering as a result of bubble coarsening. This ordering, along with a compressive strain gradient, indicates that gas bubbles induce significant localized changes in atomic packing. By analyzing strain fields with maximum compressive strains of 3\%, we estimate a lower bound on the internal pressure of the bubbles at 2.5 GPa. These findings provide insight into the complex structural behavior of amorphous materials under stress, particularly in systems with gas inclusions, and offer new methods for probing the local atomic structure in disordered materials. Although considering structural heterogeneity in amorphous systems is non-trivial, these features have crucial impacts on material functionalities, such as mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and electronic mobility.</description>

      <title>Machine learning driven search of hydrogen storage materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to a low-carbon economy demands efficient and sustainable energy-storage solutions, with hydrogen emerging as a promising clean-energy carrier and with metal hydrides recognized for their hydrogen-storage capacity. Here, we leverage machine learning (ML) to predict hydrogen-to-metal (H/M) ratios and solution energy by incorporating thermodynamic parameters and local lattice distortion (LLD) as key features. Our best-performing ML model provides improvements to H/M ratios and solution energies over a broad class of ternary alloys (easily extendable to multi-principal-element alloys), such as Ti-Nb-X (X = Mo, Cr, Hf, Ta, V, Zr) and Co-Ni-X (X = Al, Mg, V). Ti-Nb-Mo alloys reveal compositional effects in H-storage behavior, in particular Ti, Nb, and V enhance H-storage capacity, while Mo reduces H/M and hydrogen weight percent by 40-50%. We attributed to slow hydrogen kinetics in molybdenum rich alloys, which is validated by our pressure-composition isotherm (PCT) experiments on pure Ti and Ti5Mo95 alloys. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular simulations also confirm that Ti and Nb promote H diffusion, whereas Mo hinders it, highlighting the interplay between electronic structure, lattice distortions, and hydrogen uptake. Notably, our Gradient Boosting Regression model identifies LLD as a critical factor in H/M predictions. To aid material selection, we present two periodic tables illustrating elemental effects on (a) H2 wt% and (b) solution energy, derived from ML, and provide a reference for identifying alloying elements that enhance hydrogen solubility and storage.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Oxidation Mechanisms of Octa-Penta Graphene: A Multidimensional Exploration from First-Principles to Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Octa-penta graphene (OPG), a novel carbon allotrope characterized by its distinctive arrangement of pentagonal and octagonal rings, has garnered considerable attention due to its exceptional structure and functional properties. This study systematically investigates the oxidation mechanisms of OPG and elucidates the oxygen migration patterns on the OPG monolayer through first-principles calculations and machine-learning-based molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations. Specifically, the oxidation processes on OPG-L and OPG-Z involve exothermic chemisorption, where oxygen molecules dissociate at the surfaces, forming stable epoxy groups. Furthermore, the integrated-crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP) and Bader charge analyses provide insights into the physical mechanisms of oxygen atom adsorption. Importantly, we found that oxidation also impact the electronic properties of OPG, with OPG-L retaining its metallic characteristics post-oxygen adsorption, whereas OPG-Z undergoes a transformation from a metallic to a semiconducting state due to the introduction of oxygen. Oxygen migration on OPG monolayer involves breaking and reforming of C-O bonds, with varying stability across adsorption sites and limited migration along the basal plane. MLMD simulations corroborate these migration patterns, offering detailed migration trajectories consistent with theoretical predictions. These findings enhance the understanding of oxygen migration dynamics on OPG, facilitate its experimental validations, and highlight its potential as a novel 2D material for applications in batteries, heat-resistant materials, and oxidation-resistant coatings.</description>

      <title>A Foundational Potential Energy Surface Dataset for Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate potential energy surface (PES) descriptions are essential for atomistic simulations of materials. Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (UMLIPs)$^{1-3}$ offer a computationally efficient alternative to density functional theory (DFT)$^4$ for PES modeling across the periodic table. However, their accuracy today is fundamentally constrained due to a reliance on DFT relaxation data.$^{5,6}$ Here, we introduce MatPES, a foundational PES dataset comprising $\sim 400,000$ structures carefully sampled from 281 million molecular dynamics snapshots that span 16 billion atomic environments. We demonstrate that UMLIPs trained on the modestly sized MatPES dataset can rival, or even outperform, prior models trained on much larger datasets across a broad range of equilibrium, near-equilibrium, and molecular dynamics property benchmarks. We also introduce the first high-fidelity PES dataset based on the revised regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed (r$^2$SCAN) functional$^7$ with greatly improved descriptions of interatomic bonding. The open source MatPES initiative emphasizes the importance of data quality over quantity in materials science and enables broad community-driven advancements toward more reliable, generalizable, and efficient UMLIPs for large-scale materials discovery and design.</description>

      <title>Investigations of Metal-Organic structures for applications in Organic Spin Valve devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic spintronics has drawn the interest of the science community due to various applications in spin-valve devices. But to date, an efficient room-temperature Organic Spin Valve device has not been experimentally realized due to the complicated spin transport at the metal-organic interfaces. These studies are always challenging due to the complicated spin-polarized charge transfer at the metal-organic interfaces. The present study focuses on a comprehensive understanding of the interfacial properties that are essential for advancing device performance and functionality. The Ferromagnetic metals and half-metallic electrodes such as Co, Co2FeAl, etc., and fullerene (C60) bilayer samples are prepared and studied via different structural and magnetic characterizations. Due to the mechanical softness of C60, deep penetration of ferromagnetic metal atoms is observed inside the C60 film. In-situ MOKE measurements reveal the origin of the 23 {\AA} thick magnetic dead layer at the interface, which is attributed to the diffused ferromagnetic clusters exhibiting superparamagnetic behavior. In contrast to the inorganic substrates, magnetic anisotropy tends to develop at 40 {\AA} thick Co film deposited on C60 which enhances with increasing thickness. The XRD measurements confirm the presence of in-plane compressive strain and texturing along the hcp (002) phase in the Co film. The anomaly observed in the hard axis of magnetization is due to high dispersion in the local magnetic anisotropy. The variation of the magnetic anisotropy axis is observed in the Co2FeAlwedge deposited in the proximity of C60. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between ferromagnetic materials and organic semiconductors offering potential avenues for tailoring magnetoresistance effects and fundamental understanding of organic spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect in Dirac semimetal probed by in-plane magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) formulated by geometric properties of Bloch wavefunctions is a ubiquitous transport phenomenon not limited to magnetic systems but also allowed in non-magnetic ones under an external field breaking time-reversal symmetry. On the other hand, detection of field-induced AHE is practically challenging because the band modulation through the Zeeman and spin-orbit couplings is typically small compared to other contributions as induced by the Lorentz force. Here, we demonstrate on Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$ films that the field-induced AHE in non-magnetic systems can be quantitatively probed by applying and rotating the magnetic field within the Hall deflection plane. Measurements on the Cd$_3$As$_2$ (112) plane reveal that AHE emerges as a clear three-fold symmetric component for the in-plane field rotation. This intrinsic response becomes more pronounced in ultralow-electron-density films where significant variations in the geometric properties are expected under the magnetic field. Our findings open new opportunities in the research of Hall responses manifested as orbital magnetization in non-magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Pervasive protonation of perovskite membranes made by the water-soluble sacrificial layer method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fabrication of perovskite oxide free-standing films (membranes) by lift-off methods using water-soluble sacrificial layers is appealing because of the new mechanical degrees of freedom that these membranes present over conventional epitaxial films. However, little is known about how their fabrication process, and in particular the exposure to water during the etching step, affects their properties. Here, we investigate how membranes of two perovskite archetypes, antiferroelectric PbZrO3 and paraelectric SrTiO3, are affected by water-based etching step. Using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, we find evidence that hydrogen penetrates the perovskite structure. Concomitant with this protonation, the functional properties also change, and both materials display ferroelectric-like behavior that is absent in bulk ceramics or hydrogen-free films at room temperature. We also find that thermal annealing can be used to expel the hydrogen from the membranes, which henceforth recover bulk-like properties. The two main conclusions of this work are that (i) any perovskite membrane made by sacrificial layer hydrolysis is vulnerable to hydrogen penetration (protonation) that can induce important but extrinsic changes in functional properties, and (ii) the hydrogen can, and should, be expelled by annealing to recover intrinsic behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments reveal negative (non-Laplacian) surface stresses in metal oxide nanoparticles, partly associated with humidity during fabrication and annealing. Using a neural network interatomic potential for MgO, we prove that water adsorption induces surface hydroxylation, shifting facets from {100} to {110} to {111} and switching the average surface stress from positive to negative. Predicted lattice strains versus nanoparticle size agree well with experiments, clarifying experimental correlations. The new framework informs broad applications in catalysis, sensors, batteries, and biomedicine.</description>

      <title>T-MSD: An improved method for ionic diffusion coefficient calculation from molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic conductivity is a critical property of solid ionic conductors, directly influencing the performance of energy storage devices such as batteries. However, accurately calculating ionic conductivity or diffusion coefficient remains challenging due to the complex, dynamic nature of ionic motion, which often yield significant deviations, especially at room temperature. In this study, we propose an improved method, T-MSD, to enhance the accuracy and reliability of diffusion coefficient calculations. Combining time-averaged mean square displacement analysis with block jackknife resampling, this method effectively addresses the impact of rare, anomalous diffusion events and provides robust statistical error estimates from a single simulation. Applied to large-scale deep-potential molecular dynamics simulations, we show that T-MSD eliminates the need for multiple independent simulations while ensuring accurate diffusion coefficient calculations across systems of varying sizes and simulation durations. This approach offers a practical and reliable framework for precise ionic conductivity estimation, advancing the study and design of high-performance solid ionic conductors.</description>

      <title>Identifying high-energy electronic states of NV$^-$ centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond is a prototype photoluminescent point defect spin qubit with promising quantum technology applications, enabled by its efficient optical spin polarization and readout. Its low-lying electronic states and optical spin polarization cycle have been well characterized over decades, establishing it as a benchmark system for state-of-the-art computational methods in point defect research. While the optical cycle is well understood, a comprehensive energetic analysis of higher-lying states has received less attention until recently. In this joint experimental theoretical study, we identify and characterize five high-energy states beyond those involved in the optical cycle. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we determine their transition energies and relative oscillator strengths. Additionally, we perform two independent numerical studies employing two state-of-the-art post-DFT methods to support the experimental findings and assign energy levels. These results enhance our understanding of the NV center's energy spectrum and providing a broader reference for benchmarking high-level first-principles methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric induced magneto-optical effects in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magneto-optical effects (MOEs), as a fundamental physical phenomenon, can reveal the electronic structures of materials. The related probing methods are widely used in the study of magnetic materials. However, space-time inversion ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric antiferromagnets were previously believed to be magneto-optically inactive. Here, we point out that this traditional understanding is incorrect. Based on our generic formulas and symmetry analysis, we find that in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets, it is the quantum metric, i.e., the real part of the quantum geometry, that induces MOEs. Combining a tight-binding model and first-principles calculations, we confirm this observation by showing MOEs in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnet. Our work demonstrates that $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets previously thought to lack MOEs can indeed exhibit MOEs and greatly broaden the research on MOEs.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the effect of adding B4C at the W-on-Si interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the W-on-Si interface and the effect of adding a B4C interlayer at such interface, using low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy, X-ray reflectivity, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. We extract the effective width of the interface in three different structures having: no-B4C, 0.24 nm, and 1.2 nm of B4C deposited in between the W and the Si films. The analysis reveals that the W distribution does not get significantly sharper when B4C atoms are deposited at the W-on-Si interface, showing that B4C does not act as a physical barrier against the diffusion of atoms during the deposition of these structures. W/Si thin-film structures are used in various applications, including X-ray optics. While many studies reported that adding a sub-nm thick B4C film at the W/Si interfaces is beneficial for the overall reflectivity of the structures, the physical mechanisms involved were not yet fully understood. In this context, being able to characterize the width of the interfaces with sub-nm resolution is key. In this study, we show how the analysis of the sub-surface signal of the LEIS spectra enables the characterization of the interface W-on-(B4C-)Si, highlighting the importance of systematically extracting the values of the effective interface width for the analysis and understanding of thin-film growth.</description>

      <title>Duality of Wave Modulation and Nanotwinning in Ni-Mn-Ga Martensite via Long-Period Commensurate States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the crystal structure of magnetic shape memory alloys is crucial for elucidating their martensite twin boundary supermobility and related functionalities. This study analyzes and discusses the structure of martensitic single crystals of Ni50.0Mn27.7Ga22.3 and Ni50.0Mn28.1Ga21.9. Neutron and X-ray diffraction reveal an anharmonic, incommensurate five-layer modulation that evolves with temperature. This evolution gives rise to two key microstructural features: i) periodic nanodomains, identified as emerging a/b-nanotwins, and ii) long-period commensurate structures, such as the 34O, 24O, and 14O states, whose orthorhombic unit cells inherently realize a/b-nanotwins. Ab initio calculations show that these long-period structures are energetically favorable, leading to a lock-in transition. In the alloys studied, the 24O state is the locked-in phase at low temperatures, whereas literature data indicate that Ni50Mn25Ga25 (exact Ni2MnGa stoichiometry) evolves toward the 14O phase. Crucially, these results unify two seemingly contrasting structural descriptions -- wave-like modulation and discrete nanotwinning -- thereby establishing a foundation for a deeper understanding of the crystal-structure-functionality relationship in magnetic shape memory alloys.</description>

      <title>Energy barriers for small electron polaron hopping in bismuth ferrite from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence from first-principles calculations indicates that excess electrons in BiFeO3 form small polarons with energy levels deep inside the electronic band gap. Hence, n-type electronic transport could occur by hopping of small electron polarons rather than by band-like transport. Here, by means of first-principles calculations, small electron polaron hopping in BiFeO3 is investigated. Both bulk BiFeO3 and a typical ferroelectric domain wall, the neutral 71{\deg} domain wall, are considered. The latter is included to account for experimental observations of electrical conductivity at domain walls in otherwise insulating ferroelectrics. The object of this study is to shed light on the intrinsic electron conduction in rhombohedral BiFeO3 and the effect of pristine neutral ferroelectric domain walls. The computed energy barriers for small electron polaron hopping are of the order of the thermal energy at room temperature, both in bulk and within the neutral 71{\deg} domain wall. The domain wall is found to act as a two-dimensional trap for small electron polarons with a trap depth of about two to three times the thermal energy at room temperature. Based on these findings, the intrinsic n-type mobility and diffusion constant in BiFeO3 at room temperature are estimated, and experimental conductivity data for BiFeO3 are discussed.</description>

      <title>Accurate predictive model of band gap with selected important features based on explainable machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly advancing field of materials informatics, nonlinear machine learning models have demonstrated exceptional predictive capabilities for material properties. However, their black-box nature limits interpretability, and they may incorporate features that do not contribute to, or even deteriorate, model performance. This study employs explainable ML (XML) techniques, including permutation feature importance and the SHapley Additive exPlanation, applied to a pristine support vector regression model designed to predict band gaps at the GW level using 18 input features. Guided by XML-derived individual feature importance, a simple framework is proposed to construct reduced-feature predictive models. Model evaluations indicate that an XML-guided compact model, consisting of the top five features, achieves comparable accuracy to the pristine model on in-domain datasets while demonstrating superior generalization with lower prediction errors on out-of-domain data. Additionally, the study underscores the necessity for eliminating strongly correlated features to prevent misinterpretation and overestimation of feature importance before applying XML. This study highlights XML's effectiveness in developing simplified yet highly accurate machine learning models by clarifying feature roles.</description>

      <title>Tuning Magnetism of Metal-Organic Framework by Different Types of Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are expected to be sensitive to external pressures because of their inherently flexible structures. Although pressure-driven structural transitions have been intensively studied, the influence of pressure on magnetism has been less exploited for MOFs. Especially, the efficiency of applied pressure may strongly depend on the pressure-transmitting medium (PTM) which may have a complex interaction with MOFs. Here, we report the distinctive effects of different types of pressure, including isotropic hydrostatic pressure, quasi-hydrostatic pressure, and uniaxial pressure, on the anisotropic magnetism of the perovskite MOF, [CH3NH3][Co(COOH)3]. It is found that the hydrostatic pressure has the minimal effect whereas the uniaxial pressure has the highest efficiency in tuning magnetization and magnetic anisotropy of the MOF. First-principles calculations reveal that the applied low pressures (less than 11 kbar) do not induce notable lattice distortion in the framework or the superexchange path. Instead, the modulation of hydrogen bonds is identified as a critical factor for pressure tuning of magnetization and anisotropy. These findings underscore the potential applications of directional pressure in precisely controlling the magnetic and electronic properties of MOFs.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Antagonistic Collision-Controlled Reactivity in Energetic Molecular Perovskites with Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise regulation of chemical decompositions in energetic materials, whether towards rapid ignition or stable endurance, requires atomic-scale principles governing reactivity, which remain elusive yet. Herein, we resolve this challenge through deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations, uncovering a universal collision-control principle in energetic molecular perovskites, $\text{(H}_{2}\text{dabco)B(ClO}_{4}\text{)}_{3}$, where $\text{H}_{2}\text{dabco}^{2+}$ = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1,4-diium, B = $\text{Na}^{+}$, $\text{K}^{+}$, $\text{Rb}^{+}$, $\text{NH}_{4}^{+}$ for DAP-1, DAP-2, DAP-3 and DAP-4, respectively. Atomic-scale simulation with Arrhenius fitting for over 100-ps trajectories reveals that increasing B-site ionic radius ($\text{Na}^{+} &lt; \text{K}^{+} &lt; \text{Rb}^{+}$) simultaneously reduces both activation energy $E_{a}$, which enhances reactivity, and pre-exponential factor $A$ which suppresses collision probabilities for hydrogen transfer between site $X$ and site $A$, with sharply opposing kinetic consequences. This duality well explains the peak stability and insensitivity in $\text{K}^{+}$-based DAP-2, which optimally balance thermal endurance and collision dissipation. For ammonium-based DAP-4, though the radius of $\text{NH}_{4}^{+}$ is close to $\text{K}^{+}$, the reactive B-site cation triggers proton transfer that promotes $\text{C-H}$ bond rupture. By linking static cation radii to dynamic $E_{a}$-ln$(A)$ coupling, we rationalize non-monotonic decomposition temperatures ($\text{K}^{+} &gt; \text{NH}_{4}^{+} &gt; \text{Rb}^{+} &gt; \text{Na}^{+}$) macroscopic stability and establishes cornerstones for universal energetic material design.</description>

      <title>Sign reversal of Berry curvature triple driven by magnetic phase transition in a ferromagnetic polar metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear Hall effects have been observed in quantum materials where Berry curvature and its momentum-space derivatives, such as the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) and Berry curvature triple (BCT), play a central role. While inversion symmetry breaking is widely recognized as a key criterion, the impact of time-reversal symmetry breaking remains less explored. Here, we report an abrupt enhancement of nonlinear Hall conductivity in non-centrosymmetric SrRuO3 (111) thin films during the paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition. Scaling analysis reveals a sign reversal of the skew scattering contribution upon time-reversal symmetry breaking, which we attribute to the sign reversal of BCT at the Fermi surface. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support this interpretation, showing the spin-polarized band splitting shifts the Fermi level asymmetrically for different spin channels. Our findings establish SrRuO3 (111) thin films as a promising platform for exploring magnetically tunable nonlinear transport effects.</description>

      <title>Annihilation-limited Long-range Exciton Transport in High-mobility Conjugated Copolymer Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A combination of ultrafast, long-range and low-loss excitation energy transfer from the photo-receptor location to a functionally active site is essential for cost-effective polymeric semiconductors. Delocalized electronic wavefunctions along {\pi}-conjugated polymer backbone can enable efficient intrachain transport, while interchain transport is generally thought slow and lossy due to weak chain-chain interactions. In contrast to the conventional strategy of mitigating structural disorder, amorphous layers of rigid conjugated polymers, exemplified by highly planar poly(indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole) (IDT-BT) donor-accepter copolymer, exhibit trap-free transistor performance and charge-carrier mobilities similar to amorphous silicon. Here we report long-range exciton transport in HJ-aggregated IDTBT thin-film, in which the competing exciton transport and exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) dynamics are spectroscopically separated using a phase-cycling-based scheme and shown to depart from the classical iffusion-limited and strong-coupling regime. In the thin film, we find an annihilation-limited mechanism with a per-encounter annihilation probability of much less than 100%, facilitating the minimization of EEA-induced excitation losses. In contrast, excitons on isolated IDTBT chains diffuse over 350 nm with 0.56 cm2 s-1 diffusivity, before eventually annihilating with unit probability on first contact. We complement the pump-probe studies with temperature dependent photocurrent and EEA measurements from 295 K to 77 K and find a remarkable correspondence of annihilation rate and photocurrent activation energies in the 140 K to 295 K temperature range.</description>

      <title>QE-CONVERSE: An open-source package for the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution to compute non-perturbatively orbital magnetization from first principles, including NMR chemical shifts and EPR parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital magnetization, a key property arising from the orbital motion of electrons, plays a crucial role in determining the magnetic behavior of molecules and solids. Despite its straightforward calculation in finite systems, the computation in periodic systems poses challenges due to the ill-defined position operator and surface current contributions. The modern theory of orbital magnetization, implemented in the Density Functional Theory (DFT) framework, offers an accurate solution via the "converse approach." Here, we introduce QE-CONVERSE, a refactored, modular implementation of this method, replacing outdated routines from Quantum ESPRESSO (version 3.2). QE-CONVERSE integrates modern computational libraries like scaLAPACK and ELPA, enhancing scalability, especially for large supercell calculations. This work focuses on providing the community with a reliable, accurate orbital magnetization package for properties such as Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) g-tensors and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, particularly where perturbative methods fail. We demonstrate QE-CONVERSE's effectiveness with benchmark cases, including the NMR shifts of ${}^{27}$Al in alumina and ${}^{17}$O and ${}^{29}$Si in $\alpha$-quartz, as well as the EPR g-tensor for $_{ }^{n}\Sigma(n\geq 2)$ radicals and nitrogen defects in silicon. Results show excellent agreement with theoretical and experimental data, with improved accuracy in EPR calculations over linear response methods. QE-CONVERSE is fully compatible with recent Quantum ESPRESSO versions, enabling new possibilities for studying complex materials</description>

      <title>Mesostructural origins of the anisotropic compressive properties of low-density closed-cell foams: A deeper understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many closed-cell foams exhibit an elongated cell shape in the foam rise direction, resulting in anisotropic compressive properties. Nevertheless, the underlying deformation mechanisms and how cell shape anisotropy induces this mechanical anisotropy are not yet fully understood, in particular for the foams with a high cell face fraction and low relative density. Moreover, the impacts of mesostructural stochastics are often overlooked. This contribution conducts a systematic numerical study on the anisotropic compressive behaviour of low-density closed-cell foams, which accounts for cell shape anisotropy, cell structure and different mesostructural stochastics. Representative volume elements (RVE) of foam mesostructures are modeled, with cell walls described as Reissner-Mindlin shells in a finite rotation setting. A mixed stress-strain driven homogenization scheme is introduced, which allows for enforcing an overall uniaxial stress state. Quantitative analysis of the cell wall deformation behavior confirms the dominant role of membrane deformation in the initial elastic region, while the bending contribution gets important only after foam yielding. Following the identified deformation mechanisms, analytical models are developed that relates mechanical anisotropy to cell shape anisotropy. It is found that cell shape anisotropy translates into the anisotropy of compressive properties through three pathways, cell load-bearing area fraction, cell wall buckling stress and cell wall inclination angle. Besides, the resulting mechanical anisotropy is strongly affected by the cell shape anisotropy stochastics while almost insensitive to the cell size and cell wall thickness stochastics. The present findings provide deeper insights into the relationships between the anisotropic compressive properties and mesostructural features of close-cell foams.</description>

      <title>Intervalley-Coupled Twisted Bilayer Graphene from Substrate Commensuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that intervalley coupling can be induced in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) by aligning the bottom graphene layer with either of two types of commensurate insulating triangular Bravais lattice substrate. The intervalley coupling folds the $\pm K$ valleys of TBG to $\Gamma$-point and hybridizes the original TBG flat bands into a four-band model equivalent to the $p_x$-$p_y$ orbital honeycomb lattice model, in which the second conduction and valence bands have quadratic band touchings and can become flat due to geometric frustration. The spin-orbit coupling from the substrate opens gaps between the bands, yielding topological bands with spin Chern numbers $\mathcal{C}$ up to $\pm 4$. For realistic substrate potential strengths, the minimal bandwidths of the hybridized flat bands are still achieved around the TBG magic angle $\theta_M=1.05^\circ$, and their quantum metrics are nearly ideal. We identify two candidate substrate materials Sb$_2$Te$_3$ and GeSb$_2$Te$_4$, which nearly perfectly realize the commensurate lattice constant ratio of $\sqrt{3}$ with graphene. These systems provide a promising platform for exploring strongly correlated topological states driven by geometric frustration.</description>

      <title>Observation of Multiplet Lines in Seeded Stimulated Mn K{\alpha}1 X-ray Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the successful resolution of the multiplet structure of the K{\alpha}1 x-ray emission in manganese (Mn) complexes through seeded stimulated X-ray emission spectroscopy (seeded S-XES). By employing a femtosecond pump pulse above the Mn K edge to generate simultaneous 1s core-holes, and a second-color tunable seed pulse to initiate the stimulated emission process, we were able to enhance individual lines within the K{\alpha}1 emission. This approach allows to resolve the fine multiplet features that are obscured by the life-time broadening in conventional Mn K{\alpha} XES. The work builds on our previous observation that S-XES from Mn(II) and Mn(VII) complexes pumped at high intensities can exhibit stimulated emission without sacrificing the chemical sensitivity to oxidation states. This technique opens the door to controlled high-resolution electronic structure spectroscopy in transition metal complexes beyond core hole life time broadening with potential applications in catalysis, inorganic chemistry, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Stress-stress correlations in two-dimensional amorphous and crystalline solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stress-stress correlations in crystalline solids with long-range order can be straightforwardly derived using elasticity theory. In contrast, the `emergent elasticity' of amorphous solids, rigid materials characterized by an underlying disordered structure, defies direct explanation within traditional theoretical frameworks. To address this challenge, tensor gauge theories have been recently proposed as a promising approach to describe the emergent elasticity of disordered solids and predict their stress-stress correlations. In this work, we revisit this problem in two-dimensional amorphous and crystalline solids by employing a canonical elasticity theory approach, supported by experimental and simulation data. We demonstrate that, with respect to static stress-stress correlations, the response of a 2D disordered solid is indistinguishable from that of a 2D isotropic crystalline solid and it is well predicted by vanilla elasticity theory. Moreover, we show that the presence of pinch-point singularities in the stress response is not an exclusive feature of amorphous solids. Our results confirm previous observations about the universal character of static stress-stress correlations in crystalline and amorphous packings.</description>

      <title>Casimir-like effect driven self-assembly of graphene on molten metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Casimir effect, explained by Hendrik Casimir in 1948, is a macroscopic manifestation of quantum electrodynamics. Symmetry breaking due to space confinement of vacuum fluctuations in between two planar mirrors results in an attractive force acting between the two mirrors. Here, we show that spontaneous self-assembly of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials grown on molten metals (rheotaxy) is driven by the mechanical forces exerted by the liquid on the graphene domain and that these forces are subject to a Casimir-like effect. We present in situ environmental and ultrahigh vacuum scanning electron microscopy observations of chemical vapor deposition of graphene on both solid and molten gold and copper, which reveal that the self-assembly occurs via translational and rotational motions of graphene domains during growth on molten metals. Using high-temperature (~ 1300 K) atomic force microscopy measurements of graphene/molten-metal interfaces, coupled with density functional theory and continuum modelling of 2D layers floating on a liquid surface, we attribute the observed phenomena to Casimir-like effect of surface undulations and give further guidance for achieving seamless stitching of 2D layer domains into large scale monolayers.</description>

      <title>Quantum interference and occupation control in high harmonic generation from monolayer $WS_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional hexagonal materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit valley degrees of freedom, offering fascinating potential for valley-based quantum computing and optoelectronics. In nonlinear optics, the K and K' valleys provide excitation resonances that can be used for ultrafast control of excitons, Bloch oscillations, and Floquet physics. Under intense laser fields, however, the role of coherent carrier dynamics away from the K/K' valleys is largely unexplored. In this study, we observe quantum interferences in high harmonic generation from monolayer $WS_2$ as laser fields drive electrons from the valleys across the full Brillouin zone. In the perturbative regime, interband resonances at the valleys enhance high harmonic generation through multi-photon excitations. In the strong-field regime, the high harmonic spectrum is sensitively controlled by light-driven quantum interferences between the interband valley resonances and intraband currents originating from electrons occupying various points in the Brillouin zone, also away from K/K' valleys such as $\Gamma$ and M. Our experimental observations are in strong agreement with quantum simulations, validating their interpretation. This work proposes new routes for harnessing laser-driven quantum interference in two-dimensional hexagonal systems and all-optical techniques to occupy and read-out electronic structures in the full Brillouin zone via strong-field nonlinear optics, advancing quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Concurrent Multifractality and Anomalous Hall Response in the Nodal Line Semimetal Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ Near Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological states of matter exhibit unique protection against scattering by disorder. Different topological classes exhibit distinct forms and degrees of protection. Here, we investigate the response of the ferromagnetic nodal line semimetal Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ to disorder and electronic interactions. By combining global magneto-transport with atomic-scale scanning tunneling spectroscopy we find a simultaneous onset of diverse phenomena below a common temperature scale of about 15 K: A crossover from metallic to insulating temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistivity, saturation of the anomalous Hall conductivity to its maximal value, formation of a sharp zero-bias dip in the tunneling density of state, and emergence of multi-fractal structure of the electronic wavefunction peaking at the Fermi energy. These concurrent observations reflect the emergence of a novel energy scale possibly related to the opening of a gap in the nodal line band of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. Our study provides overarching insight into the role of disorder, electronic interactions and Berry curvature in setting the micro- and macro-scale responses of topological semimetals.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent tensor network method for correlated super-moir\'e matter beyond one billion sites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moir\'e systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\'e quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Permeability Time-varying Metamaterials at Microwave Frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate magnetic permeability time-varying metamaterials at GHz frequencies using ferromagnetic permalloy (Ni80Fe20; Py). We observe frequency up and down conversion of 4 GHz microwaves through the metamaterials, which is caused by the temporal modulation of permeability in the Py layer. Moreover, the efficiency of the up-conversion to a higher frequency is much larger than that of the down conversion to a lower frequency. These experimental results are reproduced well via numerical calculation, verifying that the significant up-conversion efficiency is traced back to nonlinear magnetization dynamics in the metamaterials. The present study opens a door to microwave sources toward the 6th-generation mobile communication system, four-dimensional metamaterials with spatio-temporal modulation, and nonlinear spintronics.</description>

      <title>Currernt Flow Mapping in Conducting Ferroelectric Domain Walls using Scanning NV-Magnetometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrical conductivity of parallel plate capacitors, with ferroelectric lithium niobate as the dielectric layer, can be extensively and progressively modified by the controlled injection of conducting domain walls. Domain wall-based memristor devices hence result. Microstructures, developed as a result of partial switching, are complex and so simple models of equivalent circuits, based on the collective action of all conducting domain wall channels acting identically and in parallel, may not be appropriate. Here, we directly map the current density in ferroelectric domain wall memristors in-situ, by mapping Oersted fields, using nitrogen vacancy centre microscopy. Current density maps were found to directly correlate with the domain microstructure, revealing that a strikingly small fraction of the total domain wall network is responsible for the majority of the current flow. This insight forces a two order of magnitude correction to the carrier densities, previously inferred from standard scanning probe or macroscopic electrical characterisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ongoing demands for smaller and more energy efficient electronic devices necessitate alternative interconnect materials with lower electrical resistivity at reduced dimensions. Despite the emergence of many promising candidates, synthesizing high quality nanostructures remains a major bottleneck in evaluating their performance. Here, we report the successful synthesis of Weyl semimetal NbAs nanowires via thermomechanical nanomolding, achieving single crystallinity and controlled diameters as small as 40 nm. Our NbAs nanowires exhibit a remarkably low room-temperature resistivity of 9.7 +/- 1.6 microOhm-cm, which is three to four times lower than their bulk counterpart. Theoretical calculations corroborate the experimental observations, attributing this exceptional resistivity reduction to surface dominant conduction with long carrier lifetime at finite temperatures. Further characterization of NbAs nanowires and bulk single crystals reveals high breakdown current density, robust stability, and superior thermal conductivity. Collectively, these properties highlight the strong potential of NbAs nanowires as next-generation interconnects, which can surpass the limitations of current copper-based interconnects. Technologically, our findings present a practical application of topological materials, while scientifically showcasing the fundamental properties uniquely accessible in nanoscale platforms.</description>

      <title>Erratum: Photovoltage from ferroelectric domain walls in BiFeO$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:1905.10321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the original article a mistake in the methodology lead to an incorrect prediction of exciton delocalization below a critical exciton density. This unrealistic delocalized exciton state yielded a sizable domain-wall photovoltage. When done correctly, the simulations yield self-trapped (localized) excitons at all considered exciton densities, without any evidence for a transition to a delocalized exciton. This realistic self-trapped exciton state yields only a negligible domain-wall photovoltage. The original conclusion that ferroelectric domain walls could be responsible for the measured photovoltage if carrier lifetime and diffusion length are higher than expected is incorrect. Correct is: The domain-wall photovoltage in BiFeO3 is much too small to explain the measured photovoltage. The original analysis is meaningful for ferroelectrics without carrier self-trapping, not for BiFeO3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electron spin decay lifetime in materials can be characterized by relaxation (T1) and irreversible (T2) and reversible (T2*) decoherence processes. Their interplay leads to a complex dependence of spin relaxation times on the direction and magnitude of magnetic fields, relevant for spintronics and quantum information applications. Here, we use real-time first-principles density matrix dynamics simulations to directly simulate Hahn echo measurements, disentangle dephasing from decoherence, and predict T1, T2 and T2* spin lifetimes. We show that g-factor fluctuations lead to non-trivial magnetic field dependence of each of these lifetimes in inversion-symmetric crystals of CsPbBr3 and silicon, even when only intrinsic spin-phonon scattering is present. Most importantly, fluctuations in the off-diagonal components of the g-tensor lead to a strong magnetic field dependence of even the T1 lifetime in silicon. Our calculations elucidate the detailed role of anisotropic g-factors in determining the spin dynamics even in simple, low spin-orbit coupling materials such as silicon.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric transport of strained CsK$_2$Sb: The role of electron velocities and scattering within extended Fermi surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this first-principles study, we investigated the thermoelectric properties of the full-Heusler compound CsK$_2$Sb at different compressive strains. This material exhibits a valence band structure with significant effective mass anisotropy, forming tube-like energy isosurfaces below the band edge, akin to that of two-dimensional (2D) systems. Such systems can have a large number of high-mobility charge carriers and a beneficial density of states profile. In the calculations, we predicted a maximum p-type figure of merit ($zT$) of 2.6 at 800 K, in line with previous predictions of high $zT$. This high $zT$ arises from the low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.35 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ and the beneficial electronic band structure. The high density of states significantly increased the electron-scattering space, but this effect was largely compensated by reduced scattering rates of electrons with large momentum ${\mathbf{q}}$. We further explored the effect of enhancing the low-dimensionality through compressive strain. This increased the p-type power factor by up to 66 %; partly due to more strongly pronounced 2D features of the valence band, but primarily due to increased Fermi velocities. However, compressive strain also increased phonon velocities and hence the lattice thermal conductivity. The maximum p-type $zT$ thus only increased slightly, to 2.7 at 1 % compressive strain. In the conduction band, strain aligned the $\Gamma$- and X-centered valleys, resulting in the optimal n-type $zT$ increasing from 0.9 to 2.3 at 2 % compressive strain. Thus, highly strained CsK$_2$Sb has the potential for both good p- and n-type thermoelectricity.</description>

Abstract: Sixfold-degenerate valleys in Si have attracted considerable attention for valleytronics application. Using optical pump-terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy, we study the dynamics of valley polarization in bulk Si(001) at room temperature. Linearly polarized pump pulses excite electrons and holes with asymmetric distributions in momentum space, leading to in-plane anisotropic conductivity. By varying the polarization directions of the pump light relative to the in-plane crystalline axes, the valley polarization of electrons and the momentum asymmetry of holes are separately probed through observing the polarization rotation of THz pulses. We demonstrate that the valley relaxation time of electrons near the conduction band minimum exceeds 1.5 ps at room temperature, in good agreement with theoretically calculated intervalley phonon scattering with f process. This work paves the way for Si-based room-temperature valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Observation of transverse Thomson effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermoelectric Thomson effect, predicted in the 1850s by William Thomson, produces volumetric heating/cooling in a conductor due to the concerted action of the Seebeck and Peltier effects. Recently, transverse thermoelectrics studies on the Nernst and Ettingshausen effects have progressed rapidly to enable versatile thermal management technologies and to explore topological transport properties. However, a transverse Thomson effect, arising from the concerted action of the Nernst and Ettingshausen effects, has not yet been observed. Here, we report the observation of the transverse Thomson effect in a conductor. We observed volumetric heating/cooling in a semimetallic Bi$_{88}$Sb$_{12}$ alloy induced by a charge current, temperature gradient, and magnetic field applied orthogonally to each other using thermoelectric imaging techniques. We found that the heating/cooling can be switched by the field direction. Our experiments and analyses reveal the essential difference between the conventional and transverse Thomson effects; the former depends sorely on the temperature derivative of the Seebeck coefficient, while the latter depends not only on the temperature derivative of the Nernst coefficient but also on its magnitude. The observation of the transverse Thomson effect fills a missing piece in the history of thermoelectrics and provides a new principle for active thermal management technologies.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of surface structure estimation in $L1_0$-FePd(001)/graphene heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a theoretical and computational investigations of the atomic scale structure of the heterointerface formed between the (001) surface of $L1_0$-ordered iron palladium (FePd) alloy and graphene (Gr), namely, $L1_0$-FePd(001)/Gr. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that the topmost surface layer consisting of Pd (Pd-terminated surface) becomes more energetically stable than Fe, and Pd-terminated surfaces are not conducive to Gr adsorption. On the other hand, under oxygen atmosphere conditions, our calculation suggests the presence of Fe-terminated surfaces with Gr-covered structures reproducing recent experimental observations. Moreover, the finding of Fe--O bonds formed by oxidizated surface is also consistent with those of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These findings are crucial for understanding the fabrication processes of interfaces in Fe-based $L1_0$ alloy materials.</description>

      <title>Realization of discretized response in rare-earth vanadates accessed by AC susceptibility and magnetocaloric methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report presents a new technique to probe the quantitative dynamical response of the magnetic field induced heating/cooling process in rare-earth vanadium materials. The approach combines AC susceptibility and AC caloric measurements to reveal the intrinsic timescale associated with the magnetic relaxation process of rare-earth ions at low temperatures. Utilizing the well-known crystal field effect in YbVO4, we prove and demonstrate a discretized thermal analysis through a common spin-lattice relaxation phenomenon. The demonstration experiment presented in this study provides a general approach to quantitatively address multiple measured quantities in one unified discretized thermal circuit analysis. It can be extended to study other magnetic, dielectric, and elastic materials exhibiting a complex response to an external driving field in the presence of intrinsic interactions and fluctuations, particularly when an energy dissipation process is within an accessible frequency regime.</description>

      <title>Tunable Thermal Conductivity and Mechanical Properties of Metastable Silicon by Phase Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extensive applications of cubic silicon in flexible transistors and infrared detectors are much hindered by its intrinsic properties. Metastable silicon phases, such as Si-III, IV and XII prepared using extreme pressure method, provide a unique "genetic bank" with diverse structures and exotic characteristics, however, exploration on their inherent physical properties remains immature. Herein, we demonstrate the phase engineering strategy to modulate the thermal conductivity and mechanical properties of metastable silicon. The thermal conductivity obtained via Raman optothermal approach presents the broad tunability across various Si-I, III, XII and IV phases. The hardness and Young's modulus of Si-IV are remarkably greater than those of Si-III/XII mixture, confirmed by nanoindentation technique. Moreover, it was found that the pressure-induced structural defects can substantially degrade the thermal and mechanical properties of silicon. This systematic investigation can offer feasible route to design novel semiconductors and further advance their desirable applications in advanced nanodevices and mechanical transducers.</description>

      <title>Particle Trajectory Prediction in Discrete Element Simulations using a Graph-Based Interaction-Aware Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the applicability of a graph-based interaction-aware trajectory prediction model, originally developed for the transportation domain, to forecast particle trajectories in three-dimensional discrete element simulations. The model and our enhancements are validated at two typical particle simulation use cases: (i) particle flow in a representative unit cell with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) in combination with sinusoidal velocity profile and (ii) shear flow in a representative unit cell with Lees-Edwards boundary conditions (LEBCs). For the models to learn the particle behavior subjected to these boundary conditions requires additional data transformation and feature engineering, which we introduce. Furthermore, we introduce and compare two novel training procedures for the adapted prediction model, which we call position-centric training (PCT) and velocity-centric training (VCT). The results show that the models developed for the transportation domain can be adapted to learn the behavior of particles in discrete element simulations.</description>
