      <title>A Relativistic Scalar Model for Fractional Interaction between Dark Matter and Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a series of recent papers we put forward a ``fractional gravity'' framework striking an intermediate course between a modified gravity theory and an exotic dark matter (DM) scenario, which envisages the DM component in virialized halos to feel a non-local interaction mediated by gravity. The remarkable success of this model in reproducing several aspects of DM phenomenology motivates us to look for a general relativistic extension. Specifically, we propose a theory, dubbed Relativistic Scalar Fractional Gravity or RSFG, in which the trace of the DM stress-energy tensor couples to the scalar curvature via a non-local operator constructed with a fractional power of the d'Alembertian. We derive the field equations starting from an action principle, and then we investigate their weak field limit, demonstrating that in the Newtonian approximation the fractional gravity setup of our previous works is recovered. We compute the first-order post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ and its relation with weak lensing, showing that although in RSFG the former deviates from its GR values of unity, the latter is unaffected. We also perform a standard scalar-vector-tensor-decomposition of RSFG in the weak field limit, to highlight that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light, though also an additional scalar mode becomes dynamical. Finally, we derive the modified conservation laws of the DM stress energy tensor in RSFG, showing that a new non-local force emerges, and hence that the DM fluid deviates from the geodesic solutions of the field equations.</description>

      <title>Phantom black holes and wormholes in Einstein-bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study Einstein-bumblebee gravity theory minimally coupled with external matter -- a phantom/non-phantom(conventional) scalar field, find that these scalar fields can affect the black hole solutions, i.e., giving a hair to a black hole. In this model, the contents of the scalar field and the forms of its potential are completely determined by the black hole spacetime. The constant bumblebee field $b_\mu$ affects a spacetime via the coupling constant $\ell$ and its motion equations. If $\ell&gt;-1$, the phantom field is admissible and the conventional scalar field is forbidden; if $\ell&lt;-1$, the phantom field is forbidden and the conventional scalar field is admissible. When the bumblebee potential is quadratic, we obtain a wormhole solution asymptotically to Ellis wormhole, it can be called Ellis-bumblebee-phantom (EPB) wormhole which is regular everywhere and has no singularity. An Schwarzschild-like wormhole with naked singularity and an asymptotic flat phantom black hole solutions are also obtained. When the bumblebee potential is linear, we derive a phantom (anti-)de-Sitter (dS/AdS) black hole solution which can be asymptotic to Schwarzschild dS/AdS black hole. The phantom potential and the Lagrange-multiplier $\lambda$ behave as a cosmological constant $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Static vacuum 3+1 black holes that cannot be put into stationary rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that some of the static Myers/Korotkin-Nicolai (MKN) vacuum 3+1 static black holes cannot be put into stationary rotation. Namely, they cannot be deformed into axisymmetric stationary vacuum black holes with non-zero angular momentum. Other than axisymmetry, no assumptions are made on the possible deformations. The phenomenon occurs in particular for those MKN solutions for which the distance along the axis between the two horizon's poles is sufficiently small compared to the square root of its area. The MKN solutions, sometimes called periodic Schwarzschild, are physically regular but asymptotically Kasner.
  The static rigidity presented here appears to be the first in the literature of General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from black hole emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using adiabatic point-particle black hole perturbation theory, we simulate plausible gravitational wave~(GW) signatures in two exotic scenarios (i) where a small black hole is emitted by a larger one ('black hole emission') and (ii) where a small black hole is emitted by a larger one and subsequently absorbed back ('black hole absorption'). While such scenarios are forbidden in general relativity!(GR), alternative theories (such as certain quantum gravity scenarios obeying the weak gravity conjecture, white holes, and Hawking radiation) may allow them. By leveraging the phenomenology of black hole emission and absorption signals, we introduce straightforward modifications to existing gravitational waveform models to mimic gravitational radiation associated with these exotic events. We anticipate that these (incomplete but) initial simulations, coupled with the adjusted waveform models, will aid in the development of null tests for GR using GWs.</description>

      <title>Holographic Dark Energy with Torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the holographic dark energy model with axial torsion which satisfy the cosmological principle. Subsequently, by using the torsional analogues of Friedmann equations for the new equation from Einstein-Cartan gravity theory, we obtain the equation of state for dark energy in this model. We find that the extended holographic dark energy from the particle horizon as the infrared (IR) cut-off does not give the accelerating expansion of the universe. Also, employing the future event horizon as IR cut-off still achieves the accelerating expansion of the universe. In contrast, there is a possibility that the Hubble radius as IR cut-off achieves to the accelerating expansion of the universe in superluminal region for axial torsion. More precisely, the current value of ratio for torsion to the matter density, $\gamma^{0}=0.5$ gives the equation of state of dark energy $\omega_{\Lambda}\cong-1$.</description>

      <title>Large fluctuations and Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we review in detail different mechanisms of generation of large primordial fluctuations and their implications for the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) and scalar-induced secondary gravity waves (SIGW), with the ultimate aim of understanding the impact of loop correction on quantum correlations and the power spectrum. To accomplish the goal, we provide a concise, comprehensive, but in depth review of conceptual and technical details of the standard model of the universe, namely, causal structure and inflation, quantization of primordial perturbations and field theoretic techniques such as "in-in" formalism needed for the estimation of loop correction to the power spectrum. We discuss at length the severe constraints (no-go) on PBH production in single-field inflation imposed by appropriately renormalized quantum loop corrections, computed while maintaining the validity of the perturbation framework and assuming sufficient inflation to address the causality problem. Thereafter, we discuss in detail the efforts to circumvent the no-go result in Galileon inflation, multiple sharp transition (MST)-induced inflation, and stochastic single field inflation using an effective field theoretic (EFT) framework applicable to a variety of models. We provide a thorough analysis of the Dynamical Renormalization Group (DRG) resummation approach, adiabatic and late-time renormalization schemes, and their use in producing solar and sub-solar mass PBHs. Additionally, we give a summary of how scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) are produced in MST setups and Galileon inflation.Finally, the PBH overproduction issue is thoroughly discussed.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical and cosmological scenarios for gravitational wave heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) passing through a viscous shell of matter are expected to be damped resulting in an increase in the temperature of the fluid as energy is transferred to it from the GWs. In previous work we constructed a model for this process, obtaining an expression for the temperature distribution inside the shell, and it was shown that the temperature increase can be astrophysically significant. In this paper we extend the analysis to GW heating and damping following a binary neutron star merger, GW heating during a core-collapse supernova, and primordial gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>The M\"obius Game: A Quantum-Inspired Test of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a tight inequality to test the dynamical nature of spacetime. A general-relativistic violation of that inequality certifies change of curvature, in the same sense as a quantum-mechanical violation of a Bell inequality certifies a source of entanglement. The inequality arises from a minimal generalization of the Bell setup. It represents a limit on the winning chance of a collaborative multi-agent game played on the M\"obius graph. A long version of this Letter including other games and how these games certify the dynamical character of the celebrated quantum switch is accessible as arXiv:2309.15752 [gr-qc].</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Bianchi IX under the presence of matter: approximate Kasner map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to analyze the effects of the matter fields in the evolution of the Bianchi IX cosmology close to the singularity. Although the dynamics of this model is very involved, asymptotically, as the singularity is approached, it can be well approximated as a succession of Bianchi I periods connected by quick bounces against potential walls. Moreover, in such limit, matter fields (excluding stiff matter) are known to be subdominant with respect to the anisotropies. Therefore, by performing an expansion around small volumes, and assuming that the dominant matter contribution in this regime can be described as a barotropic perfect fluid with a linear equation of state, we obtain an approximate analytic solution of the dynamics. Then, we explicitly compute the form of the transition (Kasner) map that relates the pre- and post-bounce Bianchi I periods including the leading matter effects. As an important conclusion, we observe that generically the presence of matter leads to a post-bounce velocity with a lower deflection angle than in the vacuum case, and thus effectively increases the convex curvature of the potential walls. This effect may have important consequences in the chaotic nature of general relativity near spacelike singularities.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Dark Energy Stars within Vanishing Complexity Factor Formalism: Hydrostatic Equilibrium, Radial Oscillations, and Observational Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure and radial oscillations of anisotropic compact stars composed of dark energy, using the vanishing complexity factor formalism within general relativity. This novel approach establishes a direct link between the energy density and anisotropic factor, providing a robust framework for studying these exotic stellar objects. Employing an Extended Chaplygin Gas equation of state, we numerically compute interior solutions for both isotropic and anisotropic stars, revealing distinct differences in their properties. Additionally, we examine the oscillation modes and frequencies of these stars, highlighting the impact of anisotropy on their pulsational behavior. Our results reveal distinct differences in the stellar properties, such as the metric potentials, pressure, speed of sound, and relativistic adiabatic index, between the two cases. Furthermore, we calculate the large frequency separation for the fundamental and first excited modes, offering insights relevant for future asteroseismology studies. Our findings shed light on the complex interplay of gravity, matter, and anisotropy in compact stars, providing a new perspective on dark energy's role in their structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>A better space of generalized connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a base manifold $M$ and a Lie group $G$, we define $\widetilde{\cal A}_M$ a space of generalized $G$-connections on $M$ with the following properties:
  - The space of smooth connections ${\cal A}^\infty_M = \sqcup_\pi {\cal A}^\infty_\pi$ is densely embedded in $\widetilde{\cal A}_M = \sqcup_\pi \widetilde{\cal A}^\infty_\pi$; moreover, in contrast with the usual space of generalized connections, the embedding preserves topological sectors.
  - It is a homogeneous covering space for the standard space of generalized connections of loop quantization $\bar{\cal A}_M$.
  - It is a measurable space constructed as an inverse limit of of spaces of connections with a cutoff, much like $\bar{\cal A}_M$. At each level of the cutoff, a Haar measure, a BF measure and heat kernel measures can be defined.
  - The topological charge of generalized connections on closed manifolds $Q= \int Tr(F)$ in 2d, $Q= \int Tr(F \wedge F)$ in 4d, etc, is defined.
  - On a subdivided manifold, it can be calculated in terms of the spaces of generalized connections associated to its pieces. Thus, spaces of boundary connections can be computed from spaces associated to faces.
  - The soul of our generalized connections is a notion of higher homotopy parallel transport defined for smooth connections. We recover standard generalized connections by forgetting its higher levels.
  - Higher levels of our higher gauge fields are often trivial. Then $\widetilde{\cal A}_\Sigma = \bar{\cal A}_\Sigma$ for $\dim \Sigma = 3$ and $G=SU(2)$, but $\widetilde{\cal A}_M \neq \bar{\cal A}_M$ for $\dim M = 4$ and $G=SL(2, {\mathbb C})$ or $G=SU(2)$. Boundary data for loop quantum gravity is consistent with our space of generalized connections, but a path integral for quantum gravity with Lorentzian or euclidean signatures would be sensitive to homotopy data.</description>

      <title>A New Covariant Entropy Bound from Cauchy Slice Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We begin an investigation of a new holographic covariant entropy bound (HCEB) in gravity. This bound arises from Cauchy slice holography, a recently proposed duality between the bulk gravity theory and a `boundary' theory that lives on Cauchy slices. The HCEB is the logarithm of the maximum number of states of this theory that can pass through a given cut $\sigma$ of a Cauchy slice $\Sigma$ ($\sigma$ is thus a codimension-2 surface in the bulk). We show that the bound depends only on the codimension-2 data on $\sigma$, and is thus independent of the choice of slice $\Sigma$. For classical states, the HCEB upper bounds the entanglement between two subregions of the boundary of $\Sigma$.
  We calculate the bound explicitly in pure three-dimensional GR with negative cosmological constant, where the Cauchy slice theory is the $T \overline{T}$-deformation of the dual CFT. We find that the imaginary energy eigenstates in the spectrum of the deformed theory play a crucial role for obtaining a valid bound in Lorentzian signature. Our bound agrees with the area of a surface at certain marginal and extremal surfaces, but differs elsewhere. In particular, it exceeds the area by an arbitrarily large amount for (anti)trapped surfaces, such as those that lie inside a black hole. Finally, we discuss how these results can be used to write down tensor networks corresponding to arbitrary Cauchy slices.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons-Like Formulation of Exotic Massive 3D Gravity Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Chern-Simons-like formulation of exotic general massive gravity models within the framework of third-way to three-dimensional gravity. We classify our construction into two main approaches: one using torsional cosmological Einstein and exotic massive gravity equations, and the other a torsion-free approach. The former approach, while mathematically appealing, precludes the construction of critical exotic models where the central charges vanish. In contrast, the latter approach has a wider parameter space and allows for the construction of critical models. An explicit example of an exotic general model is provided to illustrate both methods. Our methodology represents the first step towards establishing the most general Chern-Simons-like formulation of third-way to three-dimensional gravity, which would enable the study of identifying its bulk/boundary unitary sector.</description>

      <title>The mass effect -- Variations of masses and their impact on cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize and explain the current status of variations of fundamental masses in cosmology, with a particular focus on variations of the electron mass. We show that electron mass variations not only allow for significant easing of the Hubble tension but are also preferred at a decent level of significance using the latest DESI data (between $2\sigma$ and $3.6\sigma$ depending on the model and the data). This extreme success of the model is neither tightly constrained from light element abundances generated during big bang nucleosynthesis nor from post-recombination observations using quasars and atomic clocks, though future data is expected to give strong evidence in favor of or against this model. Models of baryon mass variations, on the other hand, are shown to generally not be cosmologically interesting.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves from sub-solar mass primordial black holes could be detected in LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA data. Here, we apply a method originally designed to look for rapidly spinning-down neutron stars, the generalized frequency-Hough transform, to search for planetary-mass primordial black holes using data from the first half of the third observing run of advanced LIGO. In this companion paper to arXiv:2402.19468, in which the main results of our search are presented, we delve into the details of the search methodology, the choices we have made regarding the parameter space to explore, the follow-up procedure we use to confirm or reject possible candidates returned in our search, and a comparison of our analytic procedure of generating upper limits to those obtained through injections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the presence of logarithmic CFT doublets in the soft sector of celestial CFT related with supertranslations. We show that the quantum operator associated with a $\log u$ late-time behavior for the asymptotic gravitational shear forms a logarithmic CFT pair of conformal dimension $\Delta=1$ with an IR-regulated supertranslation Goldstone current. We discuss this result in connection with previous encounters of log CFT structures in the IR-finite part of celestial OPEs.</description>

      <title>Model-agnostic assessment of dark energy after DESI DR1 BAO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryon acoustic oscillation measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (Data Release 1) have revealed exciting results that show evidence for dynamical dark energy at $\sim3\sigma$ when combined with cosmic microwave background and type Ia supernova observations. These measurements are based on the $w_0w_a$CDM model of dark energy. The evidence is less in other dark energy models such as the $w$CDM model. To avoid imposing a dark energy model, we reconstruct the distance measures and the equation of the state of dark energy independent of any dark energy model and driven only by observational data. To this end, we use both single-task and multi-task Gaussian Process regression. Our results show that the model-agnostic evidence for dynamical dark energy is much less than the evidence from DESI with the $w_0w_a$CDM model. Our analysis also provides model-independent constraints on cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant and the matter-energy density parameter at present. We find that the reconstructed values of these parameters are not consistent with the results reported in DESI with the $w_0w_a$CDM model. However, they are almost consistent with DESI for the $w$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Hayward spacetime with axion scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a static spherically symmetric system in which Einstein gravity is minimally coupled with a self-interacting complex scalar field and a nonlinear electromagnetic field, referred to as Hayward axion stars. Employing numerical methods, we find that it essentially describes axion stars with the magnetic charge. In the absence of magnetic charge and with only the scalar field present, the system reduces to axion stars. We discover that when the magnetic charge $q$ exceeds a critical value, extreme solutions with frequencies $\omega$ approaching zero can be found and the critical horizon emerges. Within this horizon, the scalar field and energy density are highly concentrated and decrease precipitously at its boundary. The time component of the metric function approaches zero within this region, indicating that gravity is extremely intense, and time nearly ceases to flow. To an observer at infinity, the star appears to be frozen, hence we refer to these extreme solutions exhibiting a critical horizon as Hayward axion frozen stars. Furthermore, it is important to note that as $\omega \rightarrow 0$, the mass of the Hayward axion frozen star becomes independent of the decay constant and is only determined by the magnetic charge. Additionally, we find that the frozen star solutions possess two light rings. With an increase in the magnetic charge, these light rings move outward, while changes in the decay constant have little effect on their positions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that it is possible to define a classical system associated with a Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) theory via the implementation of a consistent symplectic structure. This provides a solid framework for the classical Hamiltonian formulation of such theories and the study of the dynamics of physical systems in the corresponding deformed phase space. By further characterizing the functions that govern non-commutativity in the configuration space using the algebra of angular momentum, we determine a general form for the rotation generator in these theories and crucially, we show that, under these conditions, unlike what has been previously found in the literature at the quantum level, this requirement does not lead to the superselection of GUP models at the classical level. Finally, we demonstrate that a properly defined GUP theory can be correctly interpreted classically if and only if the corresponding quantum commutators satisfy the Jacobi identities.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of universe's late-time acceleration and dark energy has overseen a great deal of research into cosmological singularities and particularly future singularities. Perhaps the most extreme of such singlarities is the big rip, which has propelled a lot of work into ways of moderating it or seeking out alternatives to it and two such alternatives to the big rip are the Little rip and Pseudo rip. Another possibility to consider the far future of the universe is through bounce cosmologies, which presents its own interesting ideas. So in this work we investigate the Little rip, Pseudo rip and Bounce cosmology in non-standard cosmological backgrounds with a generalized equation of state in the presence of a viscous fluid. In particular we discuss about Chern-Simons cosmology and the RS-II Braneworld and discuss how the exotic and non-conventional nature of gravity in such cosmologies affect universal evolution in these scenarios. We find out that there are very significant differences in the behaviour of such cosmic scenarios in these universes in comparison to how they appear in the simple general relativistic universe.</description>

      <title>On the fractional density gradient blow-up conjecture of Rendall</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On exponentially expanding Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetimes, there is a distinguished family of spatially homogeneous and isotropic solutions to the relativistic Euler equations with a linear equation of state of the form $p=\sigma \rho$, where $\sigma \in [0,1]$ is the square of the sound speed. Restricting these solutions to a constant time hypersurface yields initial data that uniquely generates them. In this article, we show, for sound speeds satisfying $\frac{1}{3}&lt;\sigma &lt;\frac{k+1}{3k}$ with $k\in \mathbb{Z}_{&gt;\frac{3}{2}}$, that $\mathbb{T}^2$-symmetric initial data that is chosen sufficiently close to spatially homogeneous and isotropic data uniquely generates a $\mathbb{T}^2$-symmetric solution of the relativistic Euler equations that exists globally to the future. Moreover, provided $k\in \mathbb{Z}_{&gt;\frac{5}{2}}$, we show that there exist open sets of $\mathbb{T}^2$-symmetric initial data for which the fractional density gradient becomes unbounded at timelike infinity. This rigorously confirms, in the restricted setting of relativistic fluids on exponentially expanding FLRW spacetimes, the fractional density gradient blow-up scenario conjectured by Rendall in \cite{Rendall:2004}.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave fluxes on generic orbits in near-extreme Kerr spacetime: higher spin and large eccentricity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15295v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To obtain the waveform template of gravitational waves (GWs), substantial computational resources and exceedingly high precision are often required. In the previous study [JCAP 11 (2023) 070], we efficiently and accurately calculate GW fluxes of a particle in circular orbits around a Schwarzschild black hole using the confluent Heun function. We extend the previous method to calculate the asymptotic GW fluxes from a particle in generic orbits around a near-extreme Kerr black hole. Especially when dealing with the computational difficulties in large eccentricity $e=0.9$, higher spin $a=0.999$, higher harmonic modes, and strong-field regions, our results are much better than the results of the numerical integration method based on the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi method.</description>

Abstract: In the framework of Einstein's gravity, we study the thermodynamic equation state, $P=P(V,T)$, associated with a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. In this scenario, we consider the components of the dark sector as non-interacting fluids that dominate the universe's energy content at late times. Under these circumstances, the functional structure of the cosmological coincidence parameter plays a relevant role in admitting first-order $P-V$ phase transitions; specifically, the dark energy density and the coincidence parameter must be given in terms of the radius of the apparent horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter density can be significantly enhanced by the supermassive black hole at the galactic center, leading to a structure called dark matter spike. Dark matter spike may change the spacetime properties of black holes that constitute deviations from GR black holes. Based on these interesting background, we construct a set of solutions of black holes in a dark matter spike under the Newtonian approximation and full relativity. Combining the mass model of M87, we study the quasinormal modes of black holes in the scalar field and axial gravitational perturbation, then compared them with Schwarzschild black hole. Besides, the impacts of dark matter on the quasinormal mode of black holes have been studied in depth. In particular, in the axial gravitational perturbation, our results show that the impacts of dark matter spike on the quasinormal mode of black holes can reach up to $10^{-4}$. These new features from quasinormal mode of black holes under the Newtonian approximation and full relativity may provide some help for the establishment of the final dark matter model, and provide a new thought for the indirect detection of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A communication protocol with non-zero quantum capacity is found when the two communicating parts are particle detector models in (3+1)-dimensional spacetime. In particular, as detectors, we consider two harmonic oscillators interacting with a scalar field, whose evolution is generalized for whatever background spacetime and whatever spacetime smearing of the detectors. We then specialize to Minkowski spacetime and an initial Minkowski vacuum, considering a rapid interaction between the field and the two detectors, studying the case where the receiver is static and the sender is moving. The possibility to have a quantum capacity greater than zero stems from a relative acceleration between the detectors. Indeed, no reliable quantum communication is possible when the two detectors are static or moving inertially with respect to each other, but a reliable quantum communication can be achieved between a uniformly accelerated sender and an inertial receiver.</description>

Abstract: The response of black holes to small perturbations is known to be partially described by a superposition of quasinormal modes. Despite their importance to enable strong-field tests of gravity, little to nothing is known about what overtones and quasinormal-mode amplitudes are like for black holes in extensions to general relativity. We take a first step in this direction and study what is arguably the simplest model that allows first-principle calculations to be made: a nonrotating black hole in an effective-field-theory extension of general relativity with cubic-in-curvature terms. Using a phase-amplitude scheme that uses analytical continuation and the Pr\"ufer transformation, we compute, for the first time, the quasinormal overtone frequencies (in this theory) and quasinormal-mode excitation factors (in any theory beyond general relativity). We find that the overtone quasinormal frequencies and their excitation factors are more sensitive than the fundamental mode to the lengthscale $l$ introduced by the higher-derivative terms in the effective field theory. We argue that a description of all overtones cannot be made within the regime of validity of the effective field theory, and we conjecture that this is a general feature of any extension to general relativity that introduces a new lengthscale. We also find that a parametrization of the modifications to the general-relativistic quasinormal frequencies in terms of the ratio between $l$ and the black hole's mass is somewhat inadequate, and we propose a better alternative. As an application, we perform a preliminary study of the implications of the breakdown, in the effective field theory, of the equivalence between the quasinormal mode spectra associated to metric perturbations of polar and axial parity of the Schwarzschild black hole in general relativity. We also present a simple justification for the loss of isospectrality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite originating in science fiction, warp drives have a concrete description in general relativity, with Alcubierre first proposing a spacetime metric that supported faster-than-light travel. Whilst there are numerous practical barriers to their implementation in real life, including a requirement for negative energy, computationally, one can simulate their evolution in time given an equation of state describing the matter. In this work, we study the signatures arising from a warp drive "containment failure", assuming a stiff equation of state for the fluid. We compute the emitted gravitational-wave signal and track the energy fluxes of the fluid. Apart from its rather speculative application to the search for extraterrestrial life in gravitational-wave detector data, this work is interesting as a study of the dynamical evolution and stability of spacetimes that violate the null energy condition. Our work highlights the importance of exploring strange new spacetimes, to (boldly) simulate what no one has seen before.</description>

Abstract: This article demonstrates that additionally to the well-known velocity memory effect, a vacuum gravitational plane wave can also induce a displacement memory on a couple of test particles. A complete classification of the conditions under which a velocity or a displacement memory effect occur is established. These conditions depend both the initial conditions of the relative motion and on the wave profile. The two cases where the wave admits a pulse or a step profile are treated. Our analytical expressions are then compared to numerical integrations to exhibit either a velocity or a displacement memory, in the case of these two families of profiles. Additionally to this classification, the existence of a new symmetry of polarized vacuum gravitational plane wave under M\"{o}bius reparametrization of the null time is demonstrated. Finally, we discuss the resolution of the geodesic deviation equation by means of the underlying symmetries of vacuum gravitational plane wave.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we have investigated the phase space analysis in modified Galileon cosmology, where the Galileon term is considered a coupled scalar field, $F(\phi)$. We focus on the exponential type function of $F(\phi)$ and the three well-motivated potential functions $V(\phi)$. We obtain the critical points of the autonomous system, along with their stability conditions and cosmological properties. The critical points of the autonomous system describe different phases of the Universe. In the results of our analysis, we have found the scaling solution for critical points, which determine different evolutionary eras for the Universe. The dark-energy-dominated critical points show stable behavior and indicate the Universe's late-time cosmic acceleration phase. Further, the results are examined with the cosmological data sets of the Hubble rate $H(z)$ and the Supernovae Ia.</description>

Abstract: We show that the information loss at the cosmological apparent horizon in an expanding universe has a direct correspondence with the Landauer principle of information dynamics. We show that the Landauer limit is satisfied in this case, which implies that the information erasure at the cosmological apparent horizon happens in the most efficient way possible. We also show that our results hold for extensions of the standard entropy formulations. We also discuss about the connections this result provides between information loss at black holes and that at the cosmological apparent horizon, and we term the "Cosmological Information Paradox". This is the first work which directly provides a correspondence between information dynamics and expanding cosmic horizons, and we discuss several interesting implications of this result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.00570v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In attempts to unify the four known fundamental forces in a single quantum-consistent theory, it is suggested that Lorentz symmetry may be broken at the Planck scale. Here we search for Lorentz violation at the low-energy limit by comparing orthogonally oriented atomic orbitals in a Michelson-Morley-type experiment. We apply a robust radiofrequency composite pulse sequence in the $^2F_{7/2}$ manifold of an Yb$^+$ ion, extending the coherence time from 200 $\mu$s to more than 1 s. In this manner, we fully exploit the high intrinsic susceptibility of the $^2F_{7/2}$ state and take advantage of its exceptionally long lifetime. We match the stability of the previous best Lorentz symmetry test nearly an order of magnitude faster and improve the constraints on the symmetry breaking coefficients to the 10$^{-21}$ level. These results represent the most stringent test of this type of Lorentz violation. The demonstrated method can be further extended to ion Coulomb crystals.</description>

      <title>Accretion, Evaporation and Superradiance Phase Diagram of (Primordial) Black Holes and $10^{-21}-10^{21}$ eV Scalar, Vector, Tensor Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the accretion, evaporation and superradiance phase diagram of astrophysical and primordial black holes in the mass range $10^{-33}-10^{11} \, M_\odot $. This black hole mass range corresponds to production of $10^{-21} - 10^{21}$ eV particles for superradiance (bosons) and evaporation (bosons and fermions). Only accretion and superradiance processes are relevant for heavy black holes, on the other hand for light black holes of primordial origin, all three processes can be relevant. We find that superradiance instability can happen even for black hole spin values as low as $10^{-9}-10^{-2}$. Since light black holes are very unstable to these perturbations and sensitive probes of bosonic particles, a single moderately spinning BH can probe 2-9 orders of magnitude of mass parameter space depending on the nature of the perturbations that are scalar (axion), vector (dark photon and/or photon with effective mass) and spin-2. If spinning black holes are observed, namely superradiance is not observed, due to self-interactions, we find limits on the axion decay constant and energy density.</description>

      <title>Footprints of the QCD Crossover on Cosmological Gravitational Waves at Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) have reported evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background at nHz frequencies, possibly originating in the early Universe. We show that the spectral shape of the low-frequency (causality) tail of GW signals sourced at temperatures around $T\gtrsim 1$ GeV is distinctively affected by confinement of strong interactions (QCD), due to the corresponding sharp decrease in the number of relativistic species. Bayesian analyses in the NANOGrav 15 years and the previous International PTA datasets reveal a significant improvement in the fit with respect to cubic power-law spectra, previously employed for the causality tail. This suggests that the inclusion of Standard Model effects on GWs can have a potentially decisive impact on model selection.</description>

      <title>A Fermi Model of Quantum Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum model of the Schwarzschild black hole as a quantum mechanics of a system of fermionic degrees of freedom. The system has a constant density of states and a Fermi energy that is inversely proportional to the size of the system. Assuming equivalence principle, we show that the degeneracy pressure of the Fermi degrees of freedom is able to withstand the collapse of gravity if the radius of the system is given precisely by the horizon radius of the Schwarzschild black hole. In our model, the fermionic degrees of freedom at each energy level can be entangled in certain different ways, giving rise to a multitude of degenerate ground states of the system. The counting of these microstates reproduces precisely the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. This simple Fermi model is universal and works also for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om charged black hole as well as black hole with a cosmological constant. From the properties of the Fermi variables, we propose that quantum gravity is characterized by a principle of {\it maximal capacity of states} where there can be no more than $V /l_P^3$ quantum states in any volume $V$. It implies a loss of spatial locality below the Planck length and suggests that any singularity predicted by general relativity is resolved and replaced by a quantum space in quantum gravity. In our model, a black hole spacetime is equipped with an uniform distribution of energy levels. This is another reason why black hole can be considered a simple harmonic oscillator of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>The Unruh-DeWitt model and its joint interacting Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we make the connection between the Unruh-DeWitt particle detector model applied to quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and the rigorous construction of the spin-boson model. With some modifications, we show that existing results about the existence of a spin-boson ground state can be adapted to the Unruh-DeWitt model. In the most relevant scenario involving massless scalar fields in (3+1)-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetimes, where the Unruh-DeWitt model describes a simplified model of light-matter interaction, we argue that common choices of the spacetime smearing functions regulate the ultraviolet behaviour of the model but can still exhibit infrared divergences. In particular, this implies the well-known expectation that the joint interacting Hilbert space of the model cannot be described by the tensor product of a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space and the Fock space of the vacuum representation. We discuss the conditions under which this problem does not arise and the relevance of the operator-algebraic approach for better understanding of particle detector models and their applications. Our work clarifies the connection between obstructions due to Haag's theorem and infrared bosons in the spin-boson models, and paves the way for more rigorous study of entanglement and communication in the UDW framework involving multiple detectors.</description>

      <title>Prospects for weighing neutrinos in interacting dark energy models using joint observations of gravitational waves and $\gamma$-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological observations can be used to weigh neutrinos, but this method is model-dependent, with results relying on the cosmological model considered. If we consider interactions between dark energy and dark matter, the neutrino mass constraints differ from those derived under the standard model. On the contrary, gravitational wave (GW) standard siren observations can measure absolute cosmological distances, helping to break parameter degeneracies inherent in traditional cosmological observations, thereby improving constraints on neutrino mass. This paper examines the constraints on neutrino mass within interacting dark energy (IDE) models and explores how future GW standard siren observations could enhance these results. For multi-messenger GW observations, we consider the joint observations of binary neutron star mergers by third-generation ground-based GW detectors and short $\gamma$-ray burst observations by missions similar to the THESEUS satellite project. Using current cosmological observations (CMB+BAO+SN), we obtain an upper limit on the neutrino mass in the IDE models of 0.15 (or 0.16) eV. With the inclusion of GW data, the upper limit on the neutrino mass improves to 0.14 eV. This indicates that in the context of IDE models, the improvement in neutrino mass constraints from GW observations is relatively limited. However, GW observations significantly enhance the constraints on other cosmological parameters, such as matter density parameter, the Hubble constant, and coupling strength between dark energy and dark matter.</description>
