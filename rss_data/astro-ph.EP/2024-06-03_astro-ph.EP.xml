      <title>Direct Imaging Detection of the Protoplanet AB Aurigae b at Wavelengths Covering Pa$\beta$: Rebuttal to Biddle et al. (2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Biddle et al. (2024) claimed a non-detection of the protoplanet AB Aurigae b in Keck/NIRC2 Pa$\beta$ imaging. I reprocess these newly-public data and compare them to data from the extreme AO platform (SCExAO/CHARIS) used to discover AB Aur b. AB Aur b is decisively imaged with SCExAO/CHARIS at wavelengths covering Pa$\beta$. The Biddle et al. non detection of AB Aur b results from a far poorer image quality that is non competitive with SCExAO/CHARIS. Their contrast limits and thus constraints on accretion are overestimated due to an inaccurate AB Aur b source model. Consequentially, the revised Pa$\beta$ 2-$\sigma$ upper limit from these data is about three times higher than previously reported. Irrespective of image quality, single-band Pa$\beta$ imaging is ill suited to conclusively identifying accretion onto AB Aur b. Instead, high-resolution H$\alpha$ spectroscopy may provide accretion signatures. Aside from PDS 70, AB Aurigae remains the system with the strongest evidence for having a directly-imaged protoplanet.</description>

      <title>Are WASP-107-like Systems Consistent with High-eccentricity Migration?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WASP-107 b seems to be a poster child of the long-suspected high-eccentricity migration scenario. It is on a 5.7-day, polar orbit. The planet is Jupiter-like in radius but Neptune-like in mass with exceptionally low density. WASP-107 c is on a 1100-day, $e=0.28$ orbit with at least Saturn mass. Planet b may still have a residual eccentricity of $0.06\pm 0.04$: the ongoing tidal dissipation leads to the observed internally heated atmosphere and hydrodynamic atmospheric erosion. We present a population synthesis study coupling octopole Lidov-Kozai oscillations with various short-range forces, while simultaneously accounting for the radius inflation and tidal disruption of the planet. We find that a high-eccentricity migration scenario can successfully explain nearly all observed system properties. Our simulations further suggest that the initial location of WASP-107 b at the onset of migration is likely within the snowline ($&lt;0.5\,{\rm AU}$). More distant initial orbits usually lead to tidal disruption or orbit crossing. WASP-107 b most likely lost no more than 20\% of its mass during the high-eccentricity migration, i.e. it did not form as a Jupiter-mass object. More vigorous tidally-induced mass loss leads to disruption of the planet during migration. We predict that the current-day mutual inclination between the planets b and c is substantial: at least 25-55$^\circ$ which may be tested with future Gaia astrometric observations. Knowing the current-day mutual inclination may further constrain the initial orbit of planet b. We suggest that the proposed high-eccentricity migration scenario of WASP-107 may be applicable to HAT-P-11, GJ-3470, HAT-P-18, and GJ-436 which have similar orbital architectures.</description>

      <title>Study of hydrated asteroids via their polarimetric properties at low phase angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Ch-type asteroids are distinctive among other dark asteroids in that they exhibit deep negative polarization branches (NPBs). Nevertheless, the physical and compositional properties that cause their polarimetric distinctiveness are less investigated. Aims. We aim to investigate the polarimetric uniqueness of Ch-type asteroids by making databases of various observational quantities (i.e., spectroscopic and photometric properties as well as polarimetric ones) of dark asteroids.Methods. We conducted an intensive polarimetric survey of 52 dark asteroids (including 31 Ch-type asteroids) in the R$_\mathrm{C}$-band to increase the size of polarimetric samples. The observed data are compiled with previous polarimetric, spectroscopic, and photometric archival data to find their correlations. Results. We find remarkable correlations between these observed quantities, particularly the depth of NPBs and their spectroscopic features associated with the hydrated minerals. The amplitude of the opposition effect in photometric properties also shows correlations with polarimetric and spectral properties. However, these observed quantities do not show noticeable correlations with the geometric albedo, thermal inertia, and diameter of asteroids. Conclusions. Based on the observational evidence, we arrive at our conclusion that the submicrometer-sized structures (fibrous or flaky puff pastry-like structures in phyllosilicates) in the regolith particles could contribute to the distinctive NPBs of hydrated asteroids.</description>

      <title>Multiple-arc optimization of low-thrust earth-moon orbit transfers leveraging implicit costate transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on minimum-time low-thrust orbit transfers from a prescribed low Earth orbit to a specified low lunar orbit. The well-established indirect formulation of minimum-time orbit transfers is extended to a multibody dynamical framework, with initial and final orbits around two distinct primaries. To do this, different representations, useful for describing orbit dynamics, are introduced, i.e., modified equinoctial elements (MEE) and Cartesian coordinates (CC). Use of two sets of MEE, relative to either Earth or Moon, allows simple writing of the boundary conditions about the two celestial bodies, but requires the formulation of a multiple-arc trajectory optimization problem, including two legs: (a) geocentric leg and (b) selenocentric leg. In the numerical solution process, the transition between the two MEE representations uses CC, which play the role of convenient intermediate, matching variables. The multiple-arc formulation at hand leads to identifying a set of intermediate necessary conditions for optimality, at the transition between the two legs. This research proves that a closed-form solution to these intermediate conditions exists, leveraging implicit costate transformation. As a result, the parameter set for an indirect algorithm retains the reduced size of the typical set associated with a single-arc optimization problem. The indirect heuristic technique, based on the joint use of the necessary conditions and a heuristic algorithm (i.e., differential evolution in this study) is proposed as the numerical solution method, together with the definition of a layered fitness function, aimed at facilitating convergence. The minimum-time trajectory of interest is sought in a high-fidelity dynamical framework, with the use of planetary ephemeris and the inclusion of the simultaneous gravitational action of Sun, Earth, and Moon, along the entire transfer path.</description>

      <title>Impact disruption of Bjurb\"ole porous chondritic projectile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ~200 m/s impact of a single 400-kg Bjurb\"ole L/LL ordinary chondrite meteorite onto sea ice resulted in the catastrophic disruption of the projectile. This resulted in a significant fraction of decimeter-sized fragments that exhibit power law cumulative size and mass distributions. This size range is underrepresented in impact experiments and asteroid boulder studies. The Bjurb\"ole projectile fragments share similarities in shape (sphericity, and roughness at small and large scale) with asteroid boulders. However, the mean aspect ratio (3D measurement) and apparent aspect ratio (2D measurement) of Bjurb\"ole fragment is 0.83 and 0.77, respectively, indicating that Bjurb\"ole fragments are more equidimensional compared to both fragments produced in smaller scale impact experiments and asteroid boulders. These differences may be attributed either to the fragment source (projectile vs. target), to the high porosity and low strength of Bjurb\"ole, to the lower impact velocity compared with typical asteroid collision velocities, or potentially to fragment erosion during sea sediment penetration or cleaning.</description>

      <title>Early-time small-scale structures in hot-exoplanet atmosphere simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the critical influence of small-scale flow structures (e.g., fronts, vortices, and waves) that immediately arise in hot-exoplanet atmosphere simulations initialized with a resting state. A hot, 1:1 spin-orbit synchronized Jupiter is used here as a clear example; but, the phenomenon is generic and important for any type of hot synchronized planet--gaseous, oceanic, or telluric. When the early-time structures are not captured in simulations (due to, e.g., poor resolution and/or too much dissipation), the flow behavior is markedly different at later times--in an observationally significant way; for example, the flow at large-scale is smoother and much less dynamic. This results in the temperature field, and its corresponding thermal flux, to be incorrectly predicted in numerical simulations, even when the quantities are spatially averaged.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of UV-driven synthesis of complex organic molecules on icy grain surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex organic molecules (COMs) have been widely observed in molecular clouds and protostellar environments. One of the formation mechanisms of COMs is radical reactions on the icy grain surface driven by UV irradiation. While many experiments have reported that various COMs can be synthesized under such ice conditions, the majority of the reaction processes are unclear. Complementary numerical simulations are necessary to unveil the synthetic process behind the formation of COMs. In this study, we develop a chemical reaction simulation using a Monte Carlo method. To explore the complex reaction network of COM synthesis, the model was designed to eliminate the need to prepare reaction pathways and to keep computational costs low. With this simulation, we investigate the chemical reactions occurring on icy dust surfaces during and after UV irradiation, assuming a protoplanetary disk environment. We aim to reveal the types of organic molecules produced in a disk and the formation mechanisms of COMs, in particular, amino acids and sugars. The results show that photodissociation and subsequent radical-radical reactions cause random rearrangement of the covalent bonds in the initial molecules composed of methanol, formaldehyde, ammonia, and water. Consequently, highly complex molecules such as amino acids and sugars were produced in a wide range of the initial conditions. We found that the final abundances of amino acids and sugars have extremely similar dependence on the atomic ratios of the initial molecules, which peak at C/H~0.1-0.3 and O/H~0.3-0.5, although the amino acids abundance is usually more than ten times higher than that of sugars. To understand this dependence, a semi-analytical formula was derived. Additionally, parameter surveys have suggested that the decomposition reactions of amino acids and sugars undergo a rapid transition within the threshold of a given parameter.</description>

      <title>Detection of an Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting the nearby ultracool dwarf star SPECULOOS-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Located at the bottom of the main sequence, ultracool dwarf stars are widespread in the solar neighbourhood. Nevertheless, their extremely low luminosity has left their planetary population largely unexplored, and only one of them, TRAPPIST-1, has so far been found to host a transiting planetary system. In this context, we present the SPECULOOS project's detection of an Earth-sized planet in a 17 h orbit around an ultracool dwarf of M6.5 spectral type located 16.8 pc away. The planet's high irradiation (16 times that of Earth) combined with the infrared luminosity and Jupiter-like size of its host star make it one of the most promising rocky exoplanet targets for detailed emission spectroscopy characterization with JWST. Indeed, our sensitivity study shows that just ten secondary eclipse observations with the Mid-InfraRed Instrument/Low-Resolution Spectrometer on board JWST should provide strong constraints on its atmospheric composition and/or surface mineralogy.</description>

      <title>Gravitational disturbance on asteroidal ring systems by close encounter with a small object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, rings are found around a Centaur (10199) Chariklo, trans-neptunian objects (TNOs) (136108) Haumea, and (50000) Quaoar. These discoveries suggest that asteroidal ring systems may be common, particularly in the outer solar system. Since collisions are a ubiquitous and fundamental evolutionary process throughout the solar system, we conjecture that asteroidal ring systems must have experienced close encounters with small objects as part of their evolutionary process. Here, we investigate the response of ring systems when they experience gravitational disturbance by a close encounter with another small object, by calculating the change in eccentricity and the fraction of lost ring particles. We find that a perturber needs to be as massive as or more massive than the ringed object, and needs to pass in the immediate vicinity of the ring in order to cause significant disruption. The change in eccentricity expected for Chariklo's inner ring and Quaoar's outer ring agrees with the analytical expression derived from the impulse approximation, while that for Haumea's ring agrees with the analytical expression called "exponential regime". If we define a lifetime of a ring as the mean time to experience disruptive close encounters that can raise the eccentricity of ring particles greater than 0.1, the lifetime for ring systems around Chariklo, Haumea, and Quaoar are &gt;10^4 Gyr. We conclude that ring systems around Chariklo, Haumea, and Quaoar are highly unlikely to suffer from close encounters with another small object even if those systems are as old as 4 Gyr. We also find that the lifetime is shorter for smaller ringed objects, and it still exceeds 4 Gyr for km-sized ringed objects in the outer solar system. Therefore, regardless of the size of ringed objects, asteroidal ring systems in the outer solar system are unlikely to suffer severe damage by close encounter with a small object.</description>

      <title>The TEMPO Survey II: Science Cases Leveraged from a Proposed 30-Day Time Domain Survey of the Orion Nebula with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TEMPO (Transiting Exosatellites, Moons, and Planets in Orion) Survey is a proposed 30-day observational campaign using the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. By providing deep, high-resolution, short-cadence infrared photometry of a dynamic star-forming region, TEMPO will investigate the demographics of exosatellites orbiting free-floating planets and brown dwarfs -- a largely unexplored discovery space. Here, we present the simulated detection yields of three populations: extrasolar moon analogs orbiting free-floating planets, exosatellites orbiting brown dwarfs, and exoplanets orbiting young stars. Additionally, we outline a comprehensive range of anticipated scientific outcomes accompanying such a survey. These science drivers include: obtaining observational constraints to test prevailing theories of moon, planet, and star formation; directly detecting widely separated exoplanets orbiting young stars; investigating the variability of young stars and brown dwarfs; constraining the low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function; constructing the distribution of dust in the Orion Nebula and mapping evolution in the near-infrared extinction law; mapping emission features that trace the shocked gas in the region; constructing a dynamical map of Orion members using proper motions; and searching for extragalactic sources and transients via deep extragalactic observations reaching a limiting magnitude of $m_{AB}=29.7$\,mag (F146 filter).</description>

      <title>Unambiguous detection of mesospheric CO2 clouds on Mars using 2.7 {\mu}m absorption band from the ACS/TGO solar occultations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesospheric CO2 clouds are one of two types of carbon dioxide clouds known on Mars. We present observations of mesospheric CO2 clouds made by Atmospheric Chemistry Suit (ACS) onboard the ESA-Roscosmos ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO). We analyzed 1663 solar occultation sessions of Thermal InfraRed (TIRVIM) and Middle InfraRed (MIR) channels of ACS covering more than two Martian years that contain spectra of 2.7 {\mu}m carbon dioxide ice absorption band. That allowed us to unambiguously discriminate carbon dioxide ice aerosols from mineral dust and water ice aerosols, not relying on the information of atmospheric thermal conditions. CO2 clouds were detected in eleven solar occultation observations at altitudes from 39 km to 90 km. In five cases, there were two or three layers of CO2 clouds that were vertically separated by 5-15 km gaps. Effective radius of CO2 aerosol particles is in the range of 0.1-2.2 {\mu}m. Spectra produced by the smallest particles indicate a need for a better resolved CO2 ice refractive index. Nadir optical depth of CO2 clouds is in the range 5*10^{-4}-4*10^{-2} at both 2.7 {\mu}m and 0.8 {\mu}m. Asymmetrical diurnal distribution of detections observed by ACS is potentially due to local time variations of temperature induced by thermal tides. Two out of five cases of carbon dioxide cloud detections made by the TIRVIM instrument reveal the simultaneous presence of CO2 ice and H2O ice aerosols. Temperature profiles measured by the Near InfraRed (NIR) channel of ACS are used to calculate CO2 saturation ratio S at locations of carbon dioxide clouds. Supersaturation S &gt; 1 is detected in only 5 out of 19 cases of CO2 cloud layers; extremely low values of S &lt; 0.1 are found in 9 out of 19 cases.</description>

      <title>Stellar Characterization and Chemical Abundances of Exoplanet Hosting M dwarfs from APOGEE Spectra: Future JWST Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanets hosting M dwarfs are the best targets to characterize Earth-like or super-Earth planetary atmospheres with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We determine detailed stellar parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, log$g$, and $\xi$) and individual abundances of twelve elements for four cool M dwarfs hosting exoplanets TOI-1685, GJ 436, GJ 3470, and TOI-2445, scheduled for future observations by the JWST. The analysis utilizes high-resolution near-infrared spectra from the SDSS-IV APOGEE survey between 1.51-1.69$\mu$. Based on 1D-LTE plane-parallel models, we find that TOI-2445 is slightly metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -0.16$\pm$0.09), while TOI-1685, GJ 436 and GJ 3470 are more metal-rich ([Fe/H] = 0.06$\pm$0.18, 0.10$\pm$0.20 dex, 0.25$\pm$0.15). The derived C/O ratios for TOI-2445, TOI-1685, GJ 436, and GJ 3470 are 0.526$\pm$0.027, 0.558$\pm$0.097, 0.561$\pm$0.029, and 0.638$\pm$0.015, respectively. From results for 28 M dwarfs analyzed homogeneously from APOGEE spectra, we find exoplanet-hosting M dwarfs exhibit a C/O abundance ratio approximately 0.01 to 0.05 higher than those with non-detected exoplanets, at limits of a statistically significant offset. A linear regression of [Fe/H] \textit{vs.} C/O distribution reveals a noticeable difference in the angular coefficient between FGK dwarfs (0.27) and M dwarfs (0.13). Assuming our abundance ratios of Ca/Mg, Si/Mg, Al/Mg, and Fe/Mg, we determine a mass of 3.276$^{+0.448}_{-0.419}$$M_{\oplus}$ for TOI-2445 b, having density (6.793$^{+0.005}_{-0.099}$ g.cm$^{-3}$) and core mass fraction (0.329$_{-0.049}^{+0.028}$) very similar to Earth's. We also present an atlas of 113 well-defined spectral lines to analyze M dwarfs in the $H$-band and a comprehensive evaluation of uncertainties from variations in the atmospheric parameters, signal-to-noise, and pseudo-continuum.</description>

      <title>Dust evolution during the protostellar collapse: influence on the coupling between the neutral gas and the magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling between the magnetic field and the gas during the collapsing phase of star-forming cores is strongly affected by the dust size distribution, which is expected to evolve. We aim to investigate the influence of key parameters on the evolution of the dust distribution as well as on the magnetic resistivities during the protostellar collapse. We perform collapsing single zone simulations with shark. The code computes the evolution of the dust distribution, accounting for different grain growth and destruction processes. It also computes the magnetic resistivities. We find that the dust distribution significantly evolves during the protostellar collapse, shaping the magnetic resistivities. The peak size of the distribution, the population of small grains and consequently the magnetic resistivities are controlled by both coagulation and fragmentation rates. Under standard assumptions, the small grains coagulate very early as they collide by ambipolar drift, yielding magnetic resistivities orders of magnitude away from the non-evolving dust case. In particular, the ambipolar resistivity \eta_AD is very high prior to nH=10^10 cm^-3, and as a consequence magnetic braking should be ineffective. In this case, large size protoplanetary disks should result, which is inconsistent with recent observations. To alleviate this tension, we identify mechanisms to reduce the ambipolar resistivity during the protostellar collapse. The most promising are namely: electrostatic repulsion and grain-grain erosion. The evolution of the magnetic resistivities during the protostellar collapse and consequently the shape of the magnetic field in the early life of the protoplanetary disk strongly depends on the possibility to repopulate the small grains or to prevent their early coagulation. Therefore, it is crucial to better constrain the collision outcomes and the dust grain elastic properties.</description>

      <title>Quiescent Solar Wind Regions in the Near-Sun Environment: Properties and Radial Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regions of magnetic field with near-radial, Parker Spiral-like geometry known as quiescent regions have been observed in Parker Solar Probe data. These regions have very low $\delta B / \langle |B| \rangle$ compared to non-quiescent solar wind at the same heliocentric distances. Quiescent regions are observed to have lower solar wind bulk speeds, lower proton temperatures, and lower proton density, consistent with properties of the slow solar wind. Inside of 15 Rs, identified quiescent regions show distinct thermal properties, having higher proton temperature anisotropies and lower parallel plasma betas compared to switchback patches observed at the same heliocentric distances. When placed on $\mathcal{R}$ vs $\beta_{\parallel p}$ plots (where $\mathcal{R}$ is the proton temperature anisotropy), quiescent region solar wind is shown to be more stable to proton cyclotron and firehose instabilities than non-quiescent solar wind at the same heliocentric distances. It is shown that quiescent regions evolve similarly to the surrounding non-quiescent solar wind, but quiescent solar wind begins at a different location in the $\mathcal{R}$ vs $\beta_{\parallel p}$ parameter space, suggesting that these regions have separate origins than the more turbulent non-quiescent solar wind. Namely, enhanced temperature anisotropies and enhanced magnetic field strength may be consistent with magnetic field lines which have undergone less magnetic field expansion compared to non-quiescent wind at the same heliocentric distances.</description>

      <title>Inter-planetary type-IV solar radio bursts: A comprehensive catalog and statistical results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decameter hectometric (DH; 1-14 MHz) type-IV radio bursts are produced by flare-accelerated electrons trapped in post-flare loops or the moving magnetic structures associated with the CMEs. From a space weather perspective, it is important to systematically compile these bursts, explore their spectro-temporal characteristics, and study the associated CMEs. We present a comprehensive catalog of DH type-IV bursts observed by the Radio and Plasma Wave Investigation (WAVES) instruments onboard Wind and STEREO spacecraft, covering the period of white-light CME observations by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the SOHO mission between November 1996 and May 2023. The catalog has 139 bursts, of which 73% are associated with a fast (&gt;900 km/s) and wide (&gt;60$^o$) CME, with a mean CME speed of 1301 km/s. All DH type-IV bursts are white-light CME-associated, with 78% of the events associated with halo CMEs. The CME source latitudes are within $\pm$45$^o$. 77 events had multi-vantage point observations from different spacecraft, letting us explore the impact of line of sight on the dynamic spectra. For 48 of the 77 events, there was good data from at least two spacecraft. We find that, unless occulted by nearby plasma structures, a type-IV burst is best viewed when observed within $\pm$60$^o$ line of sight. Also, the bursts with a duration above 120 min, have source longitudes within $\pm$60$^o$. Our inferences confirm the inherent directivity in the type-IV emission. Additionally, the catalog forms a sun-as-a-star DH type-IV burst database.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Model Independent Radius Determination of Single FGK and M Dwarfs Using Gaia DR3 Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring fundamental stellar parameters is key to fully comprehending the evolution of stars. However, current theoretical models over-predict effective temperatures, and under-predict radii, compared to observations of K and M dwarfs (radius inflation problem). In this work, we developed a model independent method to infer precise radii of single FGK and M dwarfs using Gaia DR3 parallaxes and photometry, and we used it to study the radius inflation problem. We calibrated nine surface brightness-color relations for the three Gaia magnitudes and colors using a sample of stars with angular diameter measurements. We achieved an accuracy of 4% in our angular diameter estimations, which Gaia's parallaxes allow us to convert to a physical radii. We validated our method by comparing our radius measurements with literature samples and the Gaia DR3 catalog, which confirmed the accuracy of our method and revealed systematic offsets in the Gaia measurements. Moreover, we used a sample with measured Halpha equivalent width (HaEW), a magnetic activity indicator, to study the radius inflation problem. We demonstrated that active stars have larger radii than inactive stars, showing that radius inflation is correlated with magnetic activity. We found a correlation between the radius inflation of active stars and HaEW for the mass bin 0.5&lt;M[Msun]&lt;= 0.6, but we found no correlation for lower masses. This could be due to lack of precision in our radius estimation or a physical reason. Radius measurements with smaller uncertainties are necessary to distinguish between the two scenarios.</description>

      <title>Ohm's Law, the Reconnection Rate, and Energy Conversion in Collisionless Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous plasma process that transforms magnetic energy into particle energy during eruptive events throughout the universe. Reconnection not only converts energy during solar flares and geomagnetic substorms that drive space weather near Earth, but it may also play critical roles in the high energy emissions from the magnetospheres of neutron stars and black holes. In this review article, we focus on collisionless plasmas that are most relevant to reconnection in many space and astrophysical plasmas. Guided by first-principles kinetic simulations and spaceborne in-situ observations, we highlight the most recent progress in understanding this fundamental plasma process. We start by discussing the non-ideal electric field in the generalized Ohm's law that breaks the frozen-in flux condition in ideal magnetohydrodynamics and allows magnetic reconnection to occur. We point out that this same reconnection electric field also plays an important role in sustaining the current and pressure in the current sheet and then discuss the determination of its magnitude (i.e., the reconnection rate), based on force balance and energy conservation. This approach to determining the reconnection rate is applied to kinetic current sheets of a wide variety of magnetic geometries, parameters, and background conditions. We also briefly review the key diagnostics and modeling of energy conversion around the reconnection diffusion region, seeking insights from recently developed theories. Finally, future prospects and open questions are discussed.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST High Contrast: Achieving direct spectroscopy of faint substellar companions next to bright stars with the NIRSpec IFU</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The JWST NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) presents a unique opportunity to observe directly imaged exoplanets from 3-5 um at moderate spectral resolution (R~2,700) and thereby better constrain the composition, disequilibrium chemistry, and cloud properties of their atmospheres. In this work, we present the first NIRSpec IFU high-contrast observations of a substellar companion that requires starlight suppression techniques. We develop specific data reduction strategies to study faint companions around bright stars, and assess the performance of NIRSpec at high contrast. First, we demonstrate an approach to forward model the companion signal and the starlight directly in the detector images, which mitigates the effects of NIRSpec's spatial undersampling. We demonstrate a sensitivity to planets that are 3e-6 fainter than their stars at 1'', or 3e-5 at 0.3''. Then, we implement a reference star point spread function (PSF) subtraction and a spectral extraction that does not require spatially and spectrally regularly sampled spectral cubes. This allows us to extract a moderate resolution (R~2,700) spectrum of the faint T-dwarf companion HD 19467 B from 2.9-5.2 um with signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)~10 per resolution element. Across this wavelength range, HD~19467~B has a flux ratio varying between 1e-5-1e-4 and a separation relative to its star of 1.6''. A companion paper by Hoch et al. more deeply analyzes the atmospheric properties of this companion based on the extracted spectrum. Using the methods developed here, NIRSpec's sensitivity may enable direct detection and spectral characterization of relatively old (~1 Gyr), cool (~250 K), and closely separated (~3-5 au) exoplanets that are less massive than Jupiter.</description>

      <title>TOI-1173 A $b$: The First Inflated Super-Neptune in a Wide Binary System</title>

Abstract: Among Neptunian mass exoplanets ($20-50$ M$_\oplus$), puffy hot Neptunes are extremely rare, and their unique combination of low mass and extended radii implies very low density ($\rho &lt; 0.3$~g~cm$^{-3}$). Over the last decade, only a few puffy planets have been detected and precisely characterized with both transit and radial velocity observations, most notably including WASP-107~$b$, TOI-1420~$b$, and WASP-193 $b$. In this paper, we report the discovery of TOI-1173 A $b$, a low-density ($\rho = 0.195_{-0.017}^{+0.018}$~g~cm$^{-3}$) super-Neptune with $P = 7.06$ days in a nearly circular orbit around the primary G-dwarf star in the wide binary system TOI-1173 A/B. Using radial velocity observations with the MAROON-X and HIRES spectrographs and transit photometry from TESS, we determined a planet mass of $M_{\rm{p}} = 27.4\pm1.7\ M_{\oplus}$ and radius of $R_{\rm{p}} = 9.19\pm0.18\ R_{\oplus}$. TOI-1173 A $b$ is the first puffy Super-Neptune planet detected in a wide binary system (projected separation $\sim 11,400$~AU). We explored several mechanisms to understand the puffy nature of TOI-1173 A $b$, and showed that tidal heating is the most promising explanation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TOI-1173 A $b$ likely has maintained its orbital stability over time and may have undergone von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai migration followed by tidal circularization given its present-day architecture, with important implications for planet migration theory and induced engulfment into the host star. Further investigation of the atmosphere of TOI-1173 A $b$ will shed light on the origin of close-in low-density Neptunian planets in field and binary systems, while spin-orbit analyses may elucidate the dynamical evolution of the system.</description>

      <title>The utility of infrasound in global monitoring of extraterrestrial impacts: A case study of the 23 July 2008 Tajikistan bolide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among various observational techniques used for detection of large bolides on a global scale is a low frequency sound known as infrasound. Infrasound, which is also one of the four sensing modalities used by the International Monitoring System (IMS), offers continuous global monitoring, and can be leveraged for planetary defense. Infrasonic records can provide an additional dimension for event characterization and a distinct perspective that might not be available through any other observational method. This paper describes infrasonic detection and characterization of the bolide that disintegrated over Tajikistan on 23 July 2008. This event was detected by two infrasound stations at distances of 1530 and 2130 km. Propagation paths to one of the stations were not predicted by the model despite being clearly detected. The presence of the signal is attributed to the acoustic energy being trapped in a weak but leaky stratospheric AtmoSOFAR channel. The infrasound signal analysis indicates that the shock originated at the point of the main breakup at an altitude of 35 km. The primary mode of shock production of the signal detected at the two stations was a spherical blast resulting from the main gross fragmentation episode. The energy estimate, based on the signal period, is 0.17-0.51 kt of TNT equivalent, suggesting a mass of 6.6-23.5 tons. The corresponding object radius, assuming the chondritic origin, was 0.78-1.18 m.</description>
