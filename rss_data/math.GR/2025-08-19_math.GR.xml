      <title>On Modular maximal-cyclic braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by a conjecture by Guarnieri and Vendramin concerning the number of braces with a generalized quaternion adjoint group, many researchers have studied braces whose adjoint group is a non-abelian $2$-group with a cyclic subgroup of index $2$. Following this direction, braces with generalized quaternion, dihedral, and semidihedral adjoint groups have been classified. It was found that the number of such braces stabilizes as the group order increases. In this paper, we consider the remaining open case of modular maximal-cyclic groups. We show that these braces possess only one non-cyclic additive group structure, and, in contrast to previous findings, the number of such braces increases with increasing order.</description>

      <title>A robust family of residually finite groups; spectra of residual finiteness growth, computability properties, and other applications (with an appendix by Arman Darbinyan and Emmanuel Rauzy)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a family of residually finite groups that helps us to systematically study the residual finiteness growth function (RFG) from various perspectives.
  First, by strengthening results of Bou-Rabee and Seward and also of Bradford, we show that any non-decreasing function $f: \nn \rightarrow \nn$ that satisfies $f(n) &gt; \exp{(\varepsilon n\log{n})}$ for some $\varepsilon&gt;0$ can be realized (up to the standard equivalence) as RFG function of a two-generated residually finite group. Moreover, such a group can be found among solvable groups of derived length $3$; due to what, in a strengthened way, we extend a theorem of Kharlampovich, Miasnikov and Sapir.
  {Next, we consider computability aspects related to those growth functions. In particular, we characterize the decidability of the word problem in residually finite groups with respect to \emph{individual residual finiteness depth} functions. Then, we give a full description of sufficiently fast {growing} functions that are realizable as RFG for some group \emph{with decidable word problem} in terms of \emph{left-computable functions.} We also show that a Turing degree can be realized via RFG of a group with decidable word problem if and only if it is recursively enumerable.
  Finally, applying the introduced theoretical framework, we answer several open questions and extend known results. For example, answering a question of Minasyan, by providing a construction, we show the existence of conjugacy separable groups with decidable word problem and undecidable conjugacy problem. Two more applications, including an answer to a question by Nies, can be found in the appendix coauthored with Rauzy.}</description>

      <title>On commutative invariants for modules over crossed products of minimax nilpotent linear groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a minimax nilpotent torsion-free normal subgroup of a soluble group $G$ of finite rank, $R$ be a finitely generated commutative domain and $R*N$ be a crossed product of $R$ and $N$. In the paper we construct a correspondence between an $R*N$-module $W$ and a finite set $M$ of equivalent classes of prime ideals minimal over $Ann_{kA}(W/WI)$, where $kA$ is a group algebra of an abelian minimax group $A$ and $I$ is an appropriative $G$-invariant ideal of $RG$. It is shown that if $Wg \cong W$ for all $ g \in g $ then the action of the group $G$ by conjugations on $N$ can be extended to an action of the group $G$ on the set $M$. The results allow us to apply methods of commutative algebra to the study of $W$.</description>

      <title>Elusive groups from non-split extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite transitive permutation group is elusive if it contains no derangements of prime order. These groups are closely related to a longstanding open problem in algebraic graph theory known as the Polycirculant Conjecture, which asserts that no elusive group is $2$-closed. Existing constructions of elusive groups mostly arise from split extensions. In this paper, we initiate the construction of elusive groups via non-split extensions. This approach offers a key advantage: it allows the construction of elusive groups even when the acting group is not elusive. As a demonstration, we construct elusive groups of new degrees, namely $p^{3k-4}(p+1)/2$ for each Mersenne prime $p\geq7$ and integer $k\geq2$, along with the first odd degree $225$ and the first twice odd degree $450$. We conclude by proposing further problems to advance this new direction of research.</description>

      <title>On combination theorems and Bowditch boundaries of relatively hyperbolic TDLC groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the work of Farb, Bowditch, and Groves-Manning on discrete relatively hyperbolic groups, we introduce an approach to relative hyperbolicity for totally disconnected locally compact (TDLC) groups. For compactly generated TDLC groups, we prove that this notion is equivalent to the one introduced by Arora-Pedroza. Let $G=A\ast_C B$ or $G=A\ast_C$ where $A$ and $B$ are relatively hyperbolic TDLC groups and $C$ is compact. We prove that $G$ is a relatively hyperbolic TDLC group and give a construction of the Bowditch boundary of $G$. As a consequence, we prove that if the rough ends of $G$ are infinite, then the topology of the Bowditch boundary of $G$ is uniquely determined by the topology of the Bowditch boundary of $A$ and $B$. Further, we show that if a relatively hyperbolic TDLC group has one rough end, then its Bowditch boundary is connected. Finally, we show that if the Gromov boundary of a hyperbolic TDLC group $G$ is totally disconnected, then $G$ splits as a finite graph of compact groups.</description>

      <title>Some generalizations of Camina pairs and orders of elements in cosets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate certain generalizations of Camina pairs. Let $H$ be a nontrivial proper subgroup of a finite group $G$. We first show that every nontrivial irreducible complex character of $H$ induces homogeneously to $G$ if and only if for every $x\in G\setminus H$, the element $x$ is conjugate to $xh$ for all $h\in H$. Furthermore we prove that if $xh$ is conjugate to either $x$ or $x^{-1}$ for all $h\in H$ and all $x\in G\setminus H$, then the normal closure $N$ of $H$ in $G$ also satisfies the same condition, and $N$ is nilpotent. Finally, we determine the structure of $H$ under the assumption that for every element $x\in G\setminus H$ of odd order, the coset $xH$ consists entirely of elements of odd order.</description>

Abstract: We construct a description of graded derivations in group algebras. Using this result for arbitrary graduation of the group algebra, we describe all possible structures of DG algebras. The corresponding examples are given. The description is given in terms of characters on a groupoid analogous to the groupoid of inner action.</description>

      <title>On transitive permutation groups with exponential graph growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a finite connected graph and $G$ a vertex-transitive group of its automorphisms. The pair $(\Gamma, G)$ is said to be locally-$L$ if the permutation group induced by the action of the vertex-stabiliser $G_v$ on the set of neighbours of a vertex $v$ in $\Gamma$ is permutation isomorphic to $L$. The maximum growth of $|G_v|$ as a function of $|V\Gamma|$ for locally-$L$ pairs $(\Gamma,G)$ is called the graph growth of $L$. We prove that if $L$ is a transitive permutation group on a set $\Omega$ admitting a nontrivial block $B$ such that the pointwise stabiliser of $\Omega\setminus B$ in $L$ is nontrivial, then the graph growth of $L$ is exponential. This generalises several results in the literature on transitive permutation groups with exponential graph growth.</description>

      <title>Groups that (do not) act isometrically on hyperbolic spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that if a group acts isometrically on a good hyperbolic space of finite volume entropy through a non-elementary action, then it admits an affine action on some $L^p$ -space with an unbounded orbit for sufficiently large $p$. As an application, we prove that any isometric action of a group with the fixed point property $F_\infty$ on a good hyperbolic space must have a bounded orbit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the boundary of the "Jewel space" $\mathcal J_n$ constructed in arXiv:1709.01296. This is an equivariant deformation retract of Outer space $CV_n$ on which $Out(F_n)$ acts properly and cocompactly, and is homeomorphic to the Bestvina-Feighn bordification of $CV_n$. In the current paper we analyze the structure of the boundary of $\mathcal J_n$. We then use the desctiption of the simplicial closure $CV_n^*$ as the sphere complex of a connected sum of $n$ copies of $S^1\times S^2$ to prove that this boundary is homotopy equivalent to the subcomplex of $CV_n^*$ spanned by vertices at infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an explicit characterization of solvable factors in factorizations of finite classical groups of Lie type. This completes the classification of solvable factors in factorizations of almost simple groups, finishing the program initiated in [Memoirs of the AMS, 279 (2022), no.~1375] and [Advances in Mathematics, 377 (2021), 107499]. In particular, it resolves the final remaining case in the long-standing problem of determining exact factorizations of almost simple groups. As a byproduct, we obtain a new characterization of one-dimensional transitive groups, offering further insights into their group structures. We also apply our classification to describe quasiprimitive permutation groups with a solvable transitive subgroup, leading to an interesting result that these subgroups are ``small''.</description>

Abstract: The orbital chromatic polynomial introduced by Cameron and Kayibi counts the number of proper $\lambda$-colorings of a graph modulo a group of symmetries. In this paper, we establish expansions for the orbital chromatic polynomial of the $n$-cycle for the group of rotations and its full automorphism group. As a side result, we obtain a new proof of Fermat's Little Theorem.</description>

      <title>Conformal measure rigidity and ergodicity of horospherical foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove two main theorems: conformal measure rigidity and ergodicity of horospherical foliations, especially in higher rank. Both theorems are new even for relatively Anosov groups.
  First, we establish a higher rank extension of rigidity theorems of Sullivan, Tukia, Yue, and Kim-Oh for representations of rank one discrete subgroups of divergence type, in terms of the push-forwards of conformal measures via boundary maps. We consider a certain class of higher rank discrete subgroups, which we call hypertransverse subgroups. It includes all rank one discrete subgroups, Anosov subgroups, relatively Anosov subgroups, and their subgroups. Our proof of the rigidity theorem generalizes the idea of Kim-Oh to self-joinings of higher rank hypertransverse subgroups, overcoming the lack of $\mathrm{CAT}(-1)$ geometry on symmetric spaces. In contrast to the work of Sullivan, Tukia, and Yue, our argument is closely related to the study of horospherical foliations.
  We also show the ergodicity of horospherical foliations with respect to Burger-Roblin measures. This generalizes the classical work of Hedlund, Burger, and Roblin in rank one and of Lee-Oh for Borel Ansov subgroups in higher rank. Moreover, we describe the ergodic decomposition of Burger-Roblin measures and Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measures when a given parabolic subgroup is minimal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A discrete subset $S$ of a topologically gyrogroup $G$ is called a {\it suitable set} for $G$ if $S\cup \{1\}$ is closed and the subgyrogroup generated by $S$ is dense in $G$, where $1$ is the identity element of $G$. In this paper, we mainly study the existence of suitable set of strongly topologically orderable gyrogroups, which extends some result in some papers in the literature. In particular, the existences of suitable set of each
  locally compact or not totally disconnected strongly topologically orderable gyrogroup are affirmative.</description>
