      <title>The cold Jupiter eccentricity distribution is consistent with EKL driven by stellar companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05066v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large eccentricities of cold Jupiters and the existence of hot Jupiters have long challenged theories of planet formation. A proposed solution to both of these puzzles is high-eccentricity migration, in which an initially cold Jupiter is excited to high eccentricities before being tidally circularized. Secular perturbations from an inclined stellar companion are a potential source of eccentricity oscillations, a phenomenon known as the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. Previous studies have found that the cold Jupiter eccentricity distribution produced by EKL is inconsistent with observations. However, these studies assumed all planets start on circular orbits. Here, we revisit this question, considering that an initial period of planet-planet scattering on $\sim$Myr timescales likely places planets on slightly eccentric orbits before being modulated by EKL on $\sim$Myr-Gyr timescales. Small initial eccentricities can have a dramatic effect by enabling EKL to act at lower inclinations. We numerically integrate the secular hierarchical three-body equations of motion, including general relativity and tides, for populations of cold giant planets in stellar binaries with varied initial eccentricity distributions. For populations with modest initial mean eccentricities, the simulated eccentricity distribution produced by EKL is statistically consistent with the observed eccentricities of cold single-planet systems. The lower eccentricities in a multi-planet control sample suggest that planetary companions quench stellar EKL. We show that scattering alone is unlikely to reproduce the present-day eccentricity distribution. We also show that the anisotropic inclination distribution produced by EKL may lead radial velocity measurements to underestimate giant planet masses.</description>

      <title>KMT-2024-BLG-1044L: A sub-Uranus microlensing planet around a host at the star-brown dwarf mass boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analysed microlensing data to uncover the nature of the anomaly that appeared near the peak of the short-timescale microlensing event KMT-2024-BLG-1044. Despite the anomaly's brief duration of less than a day, it was densely observed through high-cadence monitoring conducted by the KMTNet survey. Detailed modelling of the light curve confirmed the planetary origin of the anomaly and revealed two possible solutions, due to an inner--outer degeneracy. The two solutions provide different measured planet parameters: $(s, q)_{\rm inner} = [1.0883 \pm 0.0027, (3.125 \pm 0.248)\times 10^{-4}]$ for the inner solutions and $(s, q)_{\rm outer} = [1.0327 \pm 0.0054, (3.350 \pm 0.316)\times 10^{-4}]$ for the outer solutions. Using Bayesian analysis with constraints provided by the short event timescale ($t_{\rm E} \sim 9.1$~day) and the small angular Einstein radius ($\theta_{\rm E}\sim 0.16$~mas for the inner solution and $\sim 0.10$~mas for the outer solutio), we determined that the lens is a planetary system consisting of a host near the boundary between a star and a brown dwarf and a planet with a mass lower than that of Uranus. The discovery of the planetary system highlights the crucial role of the microlensing technique in detecting planets that orbit substellar brown dwarfs or very low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Migration of celestial bodies in the Solar system and in several exoplanetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A review of the results on the migration of celestial bodies in the Solar System and in some exoplanetary systems is presented. Some problems of planet accumulation and migration of planetesimals, small bodies and dust in the forming and present Solar System are considered. It has been noted that the outer layers of the Earth and Venus could have accumulated similar planetesimals from different areas of the feeding zone of the terrestrial planets.The formation of the embryos of the Earth and the Moon from a common rarefied condensation with subsequent growth of the main mass of the embryo of the Moon near the Earth is also discussed. The influence of changes in the semimajor axis of Jupiter's orbit on the formation of the asteroid belt is discussed, as well as the influence of planetesimals from the feeding zone of the giant planets on the formation of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. The migration of bodies to the terrestrial planets from different distances from the Sun is considered. It is noted that bodies from the feeding zone of the giant planets and from the outer asteroid belt could deliver to the Earth a quantity of water comparable to the mass of water in the Earth's oceans. The migration of bodies ejected from the Earth is considered. The probabilities of collisions of dust particles with the Earth are usually an order of magnitude greater than the probabilities of collisions of their parent bodies with the Earth. The migration of planetesimals is considered in exoplanetary systems Proxima Centauri and TRAPPIST-1. The amount of water delivered to the inner planet Proxima Centauri b, may have been more than the amount delivered to the Earth. The outer layers of neighboring planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system may contain similar material if there were many planetesimals near their orbits during the late stages of planetary accumulation.</description>

      <title>Variability of the inner dead zone edge in 2D radiation hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner regions of protoplanetary disks are prone to thermal instability (TI), which can significantly impact the thermal and dynamic evolution of planet-forming regions. Observable as episodic accretion outbursts, such periodic disturbances shape the disk's vertical and radial structure. We investigate the stability of the inner disk edge around a Class II T Tauri star and analyse the consequences of TI on the inner disk's evolution in both the vertical and radial dimensions. A particular focus is laid on the emergence and destruction of solid-trapping pressure maxima. Our 2D axisymmetric radiation hydrodynamic models include the transition to the dead zone from a highly turbulent inner disk, heating by both stellar irradiation and viscous dissipation, vertical and radial radiative transport and an adaptive dust-to-gas mass ratio. The simulated time frames include both the TI- and quiescent phases. We track the TI on S-curves of thermal stability. The TI in our models can develop in disks with moderate accretion rates and results from the activation of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the dead zone. The TI creates an extensive MRI active region around the midplane and disrupts the stable pebble- and migration trap at the inner edge of the dead zone. Our simulations consistently show the occurrence of TI-reflares, which, together with the initial TI, produce pressure maxima in the inner disk within 1 AU, possibly providing favourable conditions for streaming instability. On a timescale of a few thousand years, TI regularly disrupts the disk's radial and vertical structure within 1 AU. While several pressure maxima are created, stable migration traps are destroyed and reinstated after the TI phase. Our models provide a foundation for more detailed investigations into phenomena such as short-term variability of accretion rates.</description>

      <title>Planetesimal gravitational collapse in a gaseous environment: Thermal and dynamic evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetesimal formation models often invoke the gravitational collapse of pebble clouds to overcome various barriers to grain growth and propose processes to concentrate particles sufficiently to trigger this collapse. On the other hand, the geochemical approach for planet formation constrains the conditions for planetesimal formation and evolution by providing temperatures that should be reached to explain the final composition of planetesimals, the building blocks of planets. To elucidate the thermal evolution during gravitational collapse, we used numerical simulations of a self-gravitating cloud of particles and gas coupled with gas drag. Our goal is to determine how the gravitational energy relaxed during the contraction is distributed among the different energy components of the system, and how this constrains a thermal and dynamical planetesimal's history. We identify the conditions necessary to achieve a temperature increase of several hundred kelvins, and as much as 1600 K. Our results emphasise the key role of the gas during the collapse.</description>

      <title>Sites of Planet Formation in Binary Systems. II. Double the Disks in DF Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents the latest results of our ALMA program to study circumstellar disk characteristics as a function of orbital and stellar properties in a sample of young binary star systems known to host at least one disk. Optical and infrared observations of the eccentric, ~48-year period binary DF Tau indicated the presence of only one disk around the brighter component. However, our 1.3 mm ALMA thermal continuum maps show two nearly-equal brightness components in this system. We present these observations within the context of updated stellar and orbital properties which indicate that the inner disk of the secondary is absent. Because the two stars likely formed together, with the same composition, in the same environment, and at the same time, we expect their disks to be co-eval. However the absence of an inner disk around the secondary suggests uneven dissipation. We consider several processes which have the potential to accelerate inner disk evolution. Rapid inner disk dissipation has important implications for planet formation, particularly in the terrestrial-planet-forming region.</description>

      <title>Examining the rotation of the planet-hosting M dwarf GJ 3942</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on radial velocities, EXORAP photometry, and activity indicators, the HADES team reported a 16.3-day rotation period for the M dwarf GJ 3992. However, an RV--H$\alpha$ magnitude-squared coherence estimate has significant peaks at frequencies 1/16 cycles/day and 1/32 cycles/day. We re-analyze HADES data plus Hipparcos, SuperWASP, and TESS photometry to see whether the rotation period could be 32 days with 16-day harmonic. SuperWASP shows no significant periodicities, while the Hipparcos observing cadence is suboptimal for detecting 16- and 32-day periodicities. Although the average TESS periodogram has peaks at harmonics of 1/16 cycles/day, the harmonic sequence is not fully resolved according to the Rayleigh criterion. The TESS observations suggest a 1/16 cycles/day rotation frequency and a 1/32 cycles/day subharmonic, though resolution makes the TESS rotation detection ambiguous.</description>

      <title>On nonlinear transitions, minimal seeds and exact solutions for the geodynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearly fifty years ago, Roberts (1978) postulated that Earth's magnetic field, which is generated by turbulent motions of liquid metal in its outer core, likely results from a subcritical dynamo instability characterised by a dominant balance between Coriolis, pressure and Lorentz forces. Here we numerically explore the generation of subcritical geomagnetic fields using techniques from optimal control and dynamical systems theory to uncover the nonlinear dynamical landscape underlying dynamo action. Through nonlinear optimisation, via direct-adjoint looping, we identify the minimal seed - the smallest magnetic field that attracts to a nonlinear dynamo solution. Additionally, using the Newton-hookstep algorithm, we converge stable and unstable travelling wave solutions to the governing equations. By combining these two techniques, complex nonlinear pathways between attracting states are revealed, providing insight into a potential subcritical origin of the geodynamo. This paper showcases these methods on the widely studied benchmark of Christensen et al. (2001), laying the foundations for future studies in more extreme and realistic parameter regimes. We show that the minimal seed reaches a nonlinear dynamo solution by first attracting to an unstable travelling wave solution, which acts as an edge state separating a hydrodynamic solution from a magnetohydrodynamic one. Furthermore, by carefully examining the choice of cost functional, we establish a robust optimisation procedure that can systematically locate dynamo solutions on short time horizons with no prior knowledge of its structure.</description>

      <title>Badminton Birdie-Like Aerodynamic Alignment of Drifting Dust Grains by Subsonic Gaseous Flows in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent (sub)millimeter polarization observations of protoplanetary disks reveal toroidally aligned, effectively prolate dust grains large enough (at least ~100 $\mu$m) to efficiently scatter millimeter light. The alignment mechanism for these grains remains unclear. We explore the possibility that gas drag aligns grains through gas-dust relative motion when the grain's center of mass is offset from its geometric center, analogous to a badminton birdie's alignment in flight. A simple grain model of two non-identical spheres illustrates how a grain undergoes damped oscillations from flow-induced restoring torques which align its geometric center in the flow direction relative to its center of mass. Assuming specular reflection and subsonic flow, we derive an analytical equation of motion for spheroids where the center of mass can be shifted away from the spheroid's geometric center. We show that a prolate or an oblate grain can be aligned with the long axis parallel to the gas flow when the center of mass is shifted along that axis. Both scenarios can explain the required effectively prolate grains inferred from observations. Application to a simple disk model shows that the alignment timescales are shorter than or comparable to the orbital time. The grain alignment direction in a disk depends on the disk (sub-)structure and grain Stokes number (St) with azimuthal alignment for large St grains in sub-Keplerian smooth gas disks and for small St grains near the gas pressure extrema, such as rings and gaps.</description>

      <title>New Cold Subdwarf Discoveries from Backyard Worlds and a Metallicity Classification System for T Subdwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the results of a spectroscopic survey of candidate T subdwarfs identified by the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 program. Near-infrared spectra of 31 sources with red $J-W2$ colors and large $J$-band reduced proper motions show varying signatures of subsolar metallicity, including strong collision-induced H$_2$ absorption, obscured methane and water features, and weak K I absorption. These metallicity signatures are supported by spectral model fits and 3D velocities, indicating thick disk and halo population membership for several sources. We identify three new metal-poor T subdwarfs ([M/H] $\lesssim$ $-$0.5), CWISE J062316.19+071505.6, WISEA J152443.14$-$262001.8, and CWISE J211250.11-052925.2; and 19 new "mild" subdwarfs with modest metal deficiency ([M/H] $\lesssim$ $-$0.25). We also identify three metal-rich brown dwarfs with thick disk kinematics. We provide kinematic evidence that the extreme L subdwarf 2MASS J053253.46+824646.5 and the mild T subdwarf CWISE J113010.07+313944.7 may be part of the Thamnos population, while the T subdwarf CWISE J155349.96+693355.2 may be part of the Helmi stream. We define a metallicity classification system for T dwarfs that adds mild subdwarfs (d/sdT), subdwarfs (sdT), and extreme subdwarfs (esdT) to the existing dwarf sequence. We also define a metallicity spectral index that correlates with metallicities inferred from spectral model fits and iron abundances from stellar primaries of benchmark T dwarf companions. This expansion of the T dwarf classification system supports investigations of ancient, metal-poor brown dwarfs now being uncovered in deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>A high resolution simulation of protoplanetary disk turbulence driven by the vertical shear instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A high resolution fourth-order Pad\'e scheme is used to simulate locally isothermal 3D disk turbulence driven by the vertical shear instability (VSI) using 268.4 M points. In the early non-linear period of axisymmetric VSI, angular momentum transport by vertical jets creates correlated N-shaped radial profiles of perturbation vertical and azimuthal velocity. This implies dominance of positive perturbation vertical vorticity layers and a recently discovered angular momentum staircase with respect to radius ($r$). These features are present in 3D in a weaker form. The 3D flow consists of vertically and azimuthally coherent turbulent shear layers containing small vortices with all three vorticity components active. Previously observed large persistent vortices in the interior of the domain driven by the Rossby wave instability are absent. We speculate that this is due to a weaker angular momentum staircase in 3D in the present simulations compared to a previous simulation. The turbulent viscosity parameter $\alpha(r)$ increases linearly with $r$. At intermediate resolution, the value of $\alpha(r)$ at midradius is close to that of a previous simulation. The specific kinetic energy spectrum with respect to radial wavenumber has a power law region with exponent $-1.84$, close to the value $-2$ expected for shear layers. The spectrum with respect to azimuthal wavenumber has a $-5/3$ region and lacks a $-5$ region reported in an earlier study. Finally, it is found that axisymmetric VSI has artifacts at late times, including a very strong angular momentum staircase, which in 3D is present weakly in the disk's upper layers.</description>
