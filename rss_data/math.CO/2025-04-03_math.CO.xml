      <title>Lefschetz properties of local face modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local faces modules are modules over face rings whose Hilbert function is the local h-vector of a triangulation of a simplex. We study when Lefschetz properties hold for local face modules. We prove new unimodality results for local h-vectors of vertex-induced triangulations and show that, even for regular triangulations, Lefschetz properties can fail for local face modules in positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>Levelable graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of positive weighted well-covered graphs, which we call levelable graphs, that are related to a construction of level artinian rings in commutative algebra. A graph $G$ is levelable if there exists a weight function with positive integer values on the vertices of $G$ such that $G$ is well-covered with respect to this weight function. That is, the sum of the weights in any maximal independent set of vertices of $G$ is the same. We describe some of the basic properties of levelable graphs and classify the levelable graphs for some families of graphs, e.g., trees, cubic circulants, Cameron--Walker graphs. We also explain the connection between levelable graphs and a class of level artinian rings. Applying a result of Brown and Nowakowski about weighted well-covered graphs, we show that for most graphs, their edge ideals are not Cohen--Macaulay.</description>

      <title>A symmetric multivariate Elekes-R\'{o}nyai theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a polynomial $P\in \mathbb{R}[x_{1},\cdots, x_{d}]$ of degree $ \delta $ that depends non-trivially on each of $x_1,...,x_d$ with $d\geq 2$. For any integer $t$ with $2\leq t\leq d$, any natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and any finite set $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ of size $n$, our first result shows that \[ |P(A, A, \dots, A)| \gg_{\delta} n^{\frac{3}{2} - \frac{1}{2^{d-t+2}}}, \] unless \begin{align*}
  &amp;P(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_d) = f\big( u_1(x_1) + u_2(x_2) + \cdots + u_d(x_d) \big) \quad \text{or }
  &amp;P(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_d) = f\big( v_1(x_1) v_2(x_2) \cdots v_d(x_d) \big), \end{align*} where $f$, $u_i$, and $v_i$ are nonconstant univariate polynomials over $\mathbb{R}$, and there exists an index subset $I \subseteq [d]$ with $|I| = t$ such that for any $i, j \in I$, we have $u_i = \lambda_{ij} u_j$ (in the additive case) or $|v_i|= |v_j|^{\kappa_{ij}}$ (in the multiplicative case) for some constants $\lambda_{ij}\in \mathbb{R}^{\neq 0},\kappa_{ij}\in\mathbb{Q}^{+}$. This result generalizes the symmetric Elekes-R\'onyai theorem proved by Jing, Roy, and Tran. Our second result is a generalized Erd\H{o}s-Szemer\'{e}di theorem for two polynomials in higher dimensions, generalizing another theorem by Jing, Roy, and Tran. A key ingredient in our proofs is a variation of a theorem by Elekes, Nathanson, and Ruzsa.</description>

      <title>Modulus of hypertrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorea [11] and later Frank et al. [8] generalized graphic matroids to hypergraphic matroids. In [8], the authors introduced hypertrees as a generalization of spanning trees and proved a form of the theorem of Tutte [18] and Nash-Williams [14]. In [3, 15, 17], the authors explored the modulus of the family of spanning trees in graphs and of the family of bases of matroids, and provided connections to the notions of strength and fractional arboricity. They also established Fulkerson duality for these families. In this paper, we extend these results to hypertrees, and show that the modulus of hypertrees uncovers a hierarchical structure within arbitrary hypergraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The K-theoretic Littlewood-Richardson rule, established by A. Buch, is a combinatorial method for counting the structure constants involved in the product of two Grothendieck polynomials of Grassmannian type. In this paper, we provide an explicit combinatorial formula in terms of set-valued contratableau for the K-theoretic Littlewood-Richardson rule generalizing contratableau model for the classical Littlewood-Richardson rule given by Carr\'e.</description>

      <title>A sharp upper bound for the number of connected sets in any grid graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connected set in a graph is a subset of vertices whose induced subgraph is connected. Although counting the number of connected sets in a graph is generally a \#P-complete problem, it remains an active area of research. In 2020, Vince posed the problem of finding a formula for the number of connected sets in the $(n\times n)$-grid graph. In this paper, we establish a sharp upper bound for the number of connected sets in any grid graph by using multistep recurrence formulas, which further derives enumeration formulas for the numbers of connected sets in $(3\times n)$- and $(4\times n)$-grid graphs, thus solving a special case of the general problem posed by Vince. In the process, we also determine the number of connected sets of $K_{m}\times P_{n}$ by employing the transfer matrix method, where $K_{m}\times P_{n}$ is the Cartesian product of the complete graph of order $m$ and the path of order $n$.</description>

      <title>On the twin-width of near-regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twin-width is a recently introduced graph parameter based on the repeated contraction of near-twins. It has shown remarkable utility in algorithmic and structural graph theory, as well as in finite model theory -- particularly since first-order model checking is fixed-parameter tractable when a witness certifying small twin-width is provided. However, the behavior of twin-width in specific graph classes, particularly cubic graphs, remains poorly understood. While cubic graphs are known to have unbounded twin-width, no explicit cubic graph of twin-width greater than 4 is known.
  This paper explores this phenomenon in regular and near-regular graph classes. We show that extremal graphs of bounded degree and high twin-width are asymmetric, partly explaining their elusiveness. Additionally, we establish bounds for circulant and d-degenerate graphs, and examine strongly regular graphs, which exhibit similar behavior to cubic graphs. Our results include determining the twin-width of Johnson graphs over 2-sets, and cyclic Latin square graphs.</description>

      <title>Interval Graphs are Reconstructible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is reconstructible if it is determined up to isomorphism by the multiset of its proper induced subgraphs. The reconstruction conjecture postulates that every graph of order at least 3 is reconstructible. We show that interval graphs with at least three vertices are reconstructible. For this purpose we develop a technique to handle separations in the context of reconstruction. This resolves a major roadblock to using graph structure theory in the context of reconstruction. To apply our novel technique, we also develop a resilient combinatorial structure theory for interval graphs. A consequence of our result is that interval graphs can be reconstructed in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Strongly regular graphs with parameters (85,14,3,2) do not exist</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the second smallest unresolved feasible set of parameters of strongly regular graphs, $(v,k,\lambda,\mu)=(85,14,3,2)$. Using the classification of cubic graphs of small degree, we restrict possible local structure of such a graph $G$. After that, we exhaustively enumerate possible neighbourhoods of a maximal $3$-clique of $G$ and check them against a variety of conditions, including the combinatorial ones, coming from $\lambda=3$ and $\mu=2$, as well as the linear algebra ones, utilising the Euclidean representation of $G$. These conditions yield contradiction in all cases, and hence, no $\mathrm{srg}(85,14,3,2)$ exists.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Bounds for the Graph Minor Structure Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Graph Minor Structure Theorem, originally proven by Robertson and Seymour [JCTB, 2003], asserts that there exist functions $f_1, f_2 \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that for every non-planar graph $H$ with $t := |V(H)|$, every $H$-minor-free graph can be obtained via the clique-sum operation from graphs which embed into surfaces where $H$ does not embed after deleting at most $f_1(t)$ many vertices with up to at most $t^2-1$ many ``vortices'' which are of ``depth'' at most $f_2(t)$. In the proof presented by Robertson and Seymour the functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ are non-constructive. Kawarabayashi, Thomas, and Wollan [arXiv, 2020] found a new proof showing that $f_1(t), f_2(t) \in 2^{\mathbf{poly}(t)}$. While believing that this bound was the best their methods could achieve, Kawarabayashi, Thomas, and Wollan conjectured that $f_1$ and $f_2$ can be improved to be polynomials.
  In this paper we confirm their conjecture and prove that $f_1(t), f_2(t) \in \mathbf{O}(t^{2300})$. Our proofs are fully constructive and yield a polynomial-time algorithm that either finds $H$ as a minor in a graph $G$ or produces a clique-sum decomposition for $G$ as above.</description>

      <title>On Average Distance, Level-1 Fourier Weight, and Chang's Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we improve the well-known level-1 weight bound, also known as Chang's lemma, by using an induction method. Our bounds are close to optimal no matter when the set is large or small. Our bounds can be seen as bounds on the minimum average distance problem, since maximizing the level-1 weight is equivalent to minimizing the average distance. We apply our new bounds to improve the Friedgut--Kalai--Naor theorem. We also derive the sharp version for Chang's original lemma for $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$. That is, we show that in $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$, Hamming balls maximize the dimension of the space spanned by large Fourier coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G$, let $n$ and $m$ denote the number of vertices and edges in $G$, respectively. Tur\'{a}n's theorem states that in a simple $K_{r+1}$ free graph, $m \leq \frac{n^2(r-1)}{2r}$. In this paper, we generalize this result as follows: For each $v \in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the order of the largest clique that contains $v$. We show that \[ m \leq \frac{n}{2}\sum_{v\in V(G)}\frac{c(v)-1}{c(v)}\] Furthermore, we characterize the class of extremal graphs that attain equality in this bound.</description>

      <title>On cycle covers of infinite bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a subset $X$ of vertices of $G$ with size at least two, we denote by $N^2_G(X)$ the set of vertices of $G$ that have at least two neighbors in $X$. We say that a bipartite graph $G$ with sides $A$ and $B$ satisfies the double Hall property if for every subset $X$ of vertices of $A$ with size at least 2, $\vert N^2_G(X)\vert \geq \vert X\vert$. Salia conjectured that if $G$ is a bipartite graph that satisfies the double Hall property, then there exists a cycle in $G$ that covers all vertices of $A$. In this work, we study this conjecture restricted to infinite graphs. For this, we use the definition of ends and infinite cycles. It is simple to see that Salia's conjecture is false for infinite graphs in general. Consequently, all our results are partial. Under certain hypothesis it is possible to obtain a collection of pairwise disjoint 2-regular subgraphs that covers $A$. We show that if side $B$ is locally finite and side $A$ is countable, then the conjecture is true. Furthermore, assuming the conjecture holds for finite graphs, we show that it holds for infinite graphs with a restriction on the degree of the vertices of $B$. This result is inspired by the result obtained by Bar\'at, Grzesik, Jung, Nagy and P\'alv\"olgyi for finite graphs. Finally, we also show that if Salia's conjecture holds for some cases of infinite graphs, then the conjecture about finite graphs presented by Lavrov and Vandenbussche is true.</description>

      <title>Computation of Minimum Numbers of Tile and Bond-Edge Types for DNA Self-Assembly of Select Archimedean Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This project mathematically models the self-assembly of DNA nanostructures in the shape of select Archimedean graphs using the flexible tile model. Under three different sets of restrictions called scenarios, we employ principles of linear algebra and graph theory to determine the minimum number of different DNA branched molecules and bond types needed to construct the desired shapes, theoretically reducing laboratory costs and the waste of biomaterials. We determine exact values for $T_3(G)$, the minimum number of molecule (or ``tile") types needed for all six order 12 and 24 Archimedean graphs. We also determine exact values for $B_3(G)$, the minimum number of strand (or ``bond-edge") types, for three of the six graphs and establish bounds for the remaining three. Two algorithms, implemented as Python scripts, are used to analyze proposed design strategies for the graphs.</description>

      <title>Towards Enabling Learning for Time-Varying finite horizon Sequential Decision-Making Problems*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameterized Sequential Decision Making (Para-SDM) framework models a wide array of network design applications spanning supply-chain, transportation, and sensor networks. These problems entail sequential multi-stage optimization characterized by states, control actions, and cost functions dependent on designable parameters. The challenge is to determine both the sequential decision policy and parameters simultaneously to minimize cumulative stagewise costs. Many Para-SDM problems are NP-hard and often necessitate time-varying policies. Existing algorithms tackling finite-horizon time-varying Para-SDM problems struggle with scalability when faced with a large number of states. Conversely, the sole algorithm addressing infinite-horizon Para-SDM assumes time (stage)-invariance, yielding stationary policies. However, this approach proves scalable for time-invariant problems by leveraging deep neural networks to learn optimal stage-invariant state-action value functions, enabling handling of large-scale scenarios. This article proposes a novel approach that reinterprets finite-horizon, time-varying Para-SDM problems as equivalent time-invariant problems through topography lifting. Our method achieves nearly identical results to the time-varying solution while exhibiting improved performance times in various simulations, notably in the small cell network problem. This fresh perspective on Para-SDM problems expands the scope of addressable issues and holds promise for future scalability through the integration of learning methods.</description>

      <title>Uniquely realisable graphs in polyhedral normed spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A framework (a straight-line embedding of a graph into a normed space allowing edges to cross) is globally rigid if any other framework with the same edge lengths with respect to the chosen norm is an isometric copy. We investigate global rigidity in polyhedral normed spaces: normed spaces where the unit ball is a polytope. We first provide a deterministic algorithm for checking whether or not a framework in a polyhedral normed space is globally rigid. After showing that determining if a framework is globally rigid is NP-Hard, we then provide necessary conditions for global rigidity for generic frameworks. We obtain stronger results for generic frameworks in $\ell_\infty^d$ (the vector space $\mathbb{R}^d$ equipped with the $\ell_\infty$ metric) including an exact characterisation of global rigidity when $d=2$, and an easily-computable sufficient condition for global rigidity using edge colourings. Our 2-dimensional characterisation also has a surprising consequence: Hendrickson's global rigidity condition fails for generic frameworks in $\ell_\infty^2$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic domination and lifts of random variables in percolation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider some matrix waiting for its coefficients to be written. For each column, sample independently one Bernoulli random variable of some parameter $p$. Seeing all this and possibly using extra randomness, Alice then chooses one spot in each column, in any way she wants. When the Bernoulli random variable of some column is equal to 1, the number 1 is written in the chosen spot. When the Bernoulli random variable of a column is 0, nothing is done on this column. We prove that, using extra randomness, it is possible for Bob to fill the empty spots with well chosen 0's and 1's so that the entries of the matrix are independent Bernoulli random variables of parameter $p$. We investigate various generalisations and variations of this problem, and use this result to revisit and generalise (nonstrict) monotonicity of the percolation threshold $p_c$ with respect to some sort of graph-quotienting, namely fibrations.
  In a second part, which is independent of the first one, we revisit strict monotonicity of $p_c$ with respect to fibrations, a result that naturally requires more assumptions than its nonstrict counterpart. We reprove the bond-percolation case of the result of Martineau--Severo without resorting to essential enhancements, using couplings instead.</description>

      <title>On zero-divisor graph of the ring of Gaussian integers modulo $2^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a commutative ring $R$, the zero-divisor graph of $R$ is a simple graph with the vertex set as the set of all zero-divisors of $R$ and two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if $xy = 0$. This article attempts to predict the structure of the zero-divisor graph of the ring of Gaussian integers modulo $2$ to the power $n$ and determine the size, chromatic number, clique number, independence number, and matching through associate classes of divisors of $2^n$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{2^n}[i]$. In addition, a few topological indices of the corresponding zero-divisor graph, are obtained.</description>

      <title>A spanning tree model for Khovanov homology, Rasmussen's s-invariant and exotic discs in the $4$-ball</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The checkerboard coloring of knot diagrams offers a graph-theoretical approach to address topological questions. Champanerkar and Kofman defined a complex generated by the spanning trees of a graph obtained from the checkerboard coloring whose homology is the reduced Khovanov homology. Notably, the differential in their chain complex was not explicitly defined. We explicitly define the combinatorial form of the differential within the spanning tree complex. We additionally provide a description of Rasmussen's $s$-invariant within the context of the spanning tree complex. Applying our techniques, we identify a new infinite family of knots where each of them bounds a set of exotic discs within the 4-ball.</description>

      <title>Investigating Simple Drawings of $K_n$ using SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a SAT framework which allows to investigate properties of simple drawings of the complete graph $K_n$ using the power of AI. In contrast to classic imperative programming, where a program is operated step by step, our framework models mathematical questions as Boolean formulas which are then solved using modern SAT solvers. Our framework for simple drawings is based on a characterization via rotation systems and finite forbidden substructures. We showcase its universality by addressing various open problems, reproving previous computational results and deriving several new computational results. In particular, we test and progress on several unavoidable configurations such as variants of Rafla's conjecture on plane Hamiltonian cycles, Harborth's conjecture on empty triangles, and crossing families for general simple drawings as well as for various subclasses. Moreover, based our computational results we propose some new challenging conjectures.</description>

      <title>Equality of tropical rank and dimension for tropical linear series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tropical rank of a semimodule of rational functions on a metric graph mirrors the concept of rank in linear algebra. Defined in terms of the maximal number of tropically independent elements within the semimodule, this quantity has remained elusive due to the challenges of computing it in practice. In this note, we establish that the tropical rank is, in fact, precisely equal to the topological dimension of the semimodule, one more than the dimension of the associated linear system of divisors. Moreover, we show that the equality of divisorial and tropical ranks in the definition of tropical linear series is equivalent to the pure dimensionality of the corresponding linear system. We conclude with complementary results and questions on combinatorial and topological properties of the tropical rank.</description>

      <title>Graphs with unique Grundy dominating sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.10172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ consider a procedure of building a dominating set $D$ in $G$ by adding vertices to $D$ one at a time in such a way that whenever vertex $x$ is added to $D$ there exists a vertex $y\in N_G[x]$ that becomes dominated only after $x$ is added to $D$. The maximum cardinality of a set $D$ obtained in the described way is called the Grundy domination number of $G$ and $D$ a Grundy dominating set. While a Grundy dominating set of a connected graph $G$ is not unique unless $G$ is the trivial graph, we consider a natural weaker uniqueness condition, notably that for every two Grundy dominating sets in a graph $G$ there is an automorphism that maps one to the other. We investigate both versions of uniqueness for several concepts of Grundy domination, which appeared in the context of domination games and are also closely related to zero forcing. For each of the four variations of Grundy domination we characterize the graphs that have only one Grundy dominating set of the given type, and characterize those forests that enjoy the weaker (isomorphism based) condition of uniqueness. The latter characterizations lead to efficient algorithms for recognizing the corresponding classes of forests.</description>

Abstract: The $\lambda$-quiddities of size $n$ are $n$-tuples of elements of a fixed set, solutions of a matrix equation appearing in the study of Coxeter's friezes. These can be considered on various sets with very different structures from one set to another. The main objective of this text is to obtain explicit formulas giving the number of $\lambda$-quiddities of size $n$ over finite fields and over the rings $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ with $N=4m$ and $m$ square free. We will also give some elements about the asymptotic behavior of the number of $\lambda$-quiddities verifying an irreducibility condition over $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ when $N$ goes to the infinity.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraphs and tree decompositions X. Towards logarithmic treewidth for even-hole-free graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13684v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalized $t$-pyramid is a graph obtained from a certain kind of tree (a subdivided star or a subdivided cubic caterpillar) and the line graph of a subdivided cubic caterpillar by identifying simplicial vertices. We prove that for every integer $t$ there exists a constant $c(t)$ such that every $n$-vertex even-hole-free graph with no clique of size $t$ and no induced subgraph isomorphic to a generalized $t$-pyramid has treewidth at most $c(t)\log{n}$. This settles a special case of a conjecture of Sintiari and Trotignon; this bound is also best possible for the class. It follows that several \textsf{NP}-hard problems such as \textsc{Stable Set}, \textsc{Vertex Cover}, \textsc{Dominating Set} and \textsc{Coloring} admit polynomial-time algorithms on this class of graphs. Results from this paper are also used in later papers of the series, in particular to solve the full version of the Sintiari-Trotignon conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since its introduction by Vapnik and Chervonenkis in the 1960s, the VC dimension and its variants have played a central role in numerous fields. In this paper, we investigate several variants of the VC dimension and their applications to dynamical systems. First, we prove a new bound for a recently introduced generalization of VC dimension, which unifies and extends various extremal results on the VC, Natarajan, and Steele dimensions. This new bound allows us to strengthen one of the main theorems of Huang and Ye [Adv. Math., 2009] in dynamical systems. Second, we refine a key lemma of Huang and Ye related to a variant of VC dimension by providing a more concise and conceptual proof. We also highlight a surprising connection among this result, combinatorics, dynamical systems, and recent advances in communication complexity.</description>

Abstract: We study the Kronecker product of two Schur functions $s_\lambda\ast s_\mu$, defined as the image of the characteristic map of the product of two $S_n$ irreducible characters. We prove special cases of a conjecture of Monical--Tokcan--Yong that its monomial expansion has a saturated Newton polytope. Our proofs employ the Horn inequalities for positivity of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients and imply necessary conditions for the positivity of Kronecker coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eberhard and Pohoata conjectured that every $3$-cube-free subset of $[N]$ has size less than $2N/3+o(N)$. In this paper we show that if we replace $[N]$ with $\mathbb{Z}_N$ the upper bound of $2N/3$ holds, and the bound is tight when $N$ is divisible by $3$ since we have $A=\{a\in \mathbb{Z}_N:a\equiv 1,2\pmod{3}\}.$ Inspired by this observation we conjecture that every $d$-cube-free subset of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ has size less than $(d-1)N/d$ where $N$ is divisible by $d$, and we show the tightness of this bound by providing an example $B=\{b\in\mathbb{Z}_N:b\equiv 1,2,\ldots,d-1\pmod{d}\}$. We prove the conjecture for several interesting cases, including when $d$ is the smallest prime factor of $N$, or when $N$ is a prime power. We also discuss some related issues regarding $\{x,dx\}$-free sets and $\{x,2x,\ldots,dx\}$-free sets. A main ingredient we apply is to arrange all the integers into some square matrix, with $m=d^s\times l$ having the coordinate $(s+1,l-\lfloor l/d\rfloor)$. Here $d$ is a given integer and $l$ is not divisible by $d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1974, Erd\H{o}s asked the following question: given a graph $G$ and a directed graph $\vec{H}$, how many ways are there to orient the edges of $G$ such that it does not contain $\vec{H}$ as a subgraph? We denote this value by $D(G, \vec{H})$. Further, we let $D(n, \vec{H})$ denote the maximum of $D(G, \vec{H})$ over all graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices. In 2006, Alon and Yuster gave an exact answer when $\vec{H}$ is a tournament. In 2023, Buci\'c, Janzer, and Sudakov gave asymptotic answers for all directed graphs $\vec{H}$, and in the same paper, they gave an exact answer when $\vec{H}$ is a directed cycle. In this paper, we give a better bound for some specific non-bipartite directed graphs. Further, we obtain exact values of $D(G, \vec{H})$ for some small non-edge-critical directed graphs $\vec{H}$. Finally, for these graphs, we classify all graphs $G$ that attain the bound $D(G, \vec{H}) = D(n, \vec{H})$.</description>

      <title>On cores of distance-regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We look at the question of which distance-regular graphs are core-complete, meaning they are isomorphic to their own core or have a complete core. We build on Roberson's homomorphism matrix approach by which method he proved the Cameron-Kazanidis conjecture that strongly regular graphs are core-complete. We develop the theory of the homomorphism matrix for distance-regular graphs of diameter $d$.
  We derive necessary conditions on the cosines of a distance-regular graph for it to admit an endomorphism into a subgraph of smaller diameter $e&lt;d$. As a consequence of these conditions, we show that if $X$ is a primitive distance-regular graph where the subgraph induced by the set of vertices furthest away from a vertex $v$ is connected, any retraction of $X$ onto a diameter-$d$ subgraph must be an automorphism, which recovers Roberson's result for strongly regular graphs as a special case for diameter $2$.
  We illustrate the application of our necessary conditions through computational results. We find that no antipodal, non-bipartite distance-regular graphs of diameter 3, with degree at most $50$ admits an endomorphism to a diameter 2 subgraph. We also give many examples of intersection arrays of primitive distance-regular graphs of diameter $3$ which are core-complete. Our methods include standard tools from the theory of association schemes, particularly the spectral idempotents.

Abstract: For a partition $\lambda \vdash n$, we let $\operatorname{pd}(\lambda)$, the parity difference of $\lambda$, be the number of odd parts of $\lambda$ minus the number of even parts of $\lambda$. We prove for $c_0\in\mathbb{R}$ an asymptotic expansion for the number of partitions of $n$ into distinct parts with normalised parity difference $n^{- 1/4}\operatorname{pd}(\lambda)$ greater than $c_0$ as $n\to \infty$. As a corollary, we find the distribution of the parity differences and parity biases for partitions of $n$ into distinct parts. We also establish analogous results for generalised parity differences modulo $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model theory, machine learning, and combinatorics each have generalizations of VC-dimension for fuzzy and real-valued versions of set systems. These different dimensions define a unique notion of a VC-class for both fuzzy sets and real-valued functions. We study these VC-classes, obtaining generalizations of certain combinatorial results from the discrete case. These include appropriate generalizations of $\varepsilon$-nets, the fractional Helly property and the $(p,q)$-theorem.
  We then apply these results to continuous logic. We prove that NIP for metric structures is equivalent to an appropriate generalization of honest definitions, which we use to study externally definable predicates and the Shelah expansion. We then examine distal metric structures, providing several equivalent characterizations, in terms of indiscernible sequences, distal types, strong honest definitions, and distal cell decompositions.</description>

      <title>Free cumulants and freeness for unitarily invariant random tensors</title>

Abstract: We address the question of the asymptotic description of random tensors that are local-unitary invariant, that is, invariant by conjugation by tensor products of independent unitary matrices. We consider both the mixed case of a tensor with $D$ inputs and $D$ outputs, and the case where there is a factorization between the inputs and outputs, called pure, which includes the random tensor models extensively studied in the physics literature.
  The finite size and asymptotic moments are defined using correlations of certain invariant polynomials encoded by $D$-tuples of permutations, up to relabeling equivalence. Finite size free cumulants associated to the expectations of these invariants are defined through invertible finite size moment-cumulants formulas.
  Two important cases are considered asymptotically: pure random tensors that scale like a complex Gaussian, and mixed random tensors that scale like a Wishart tensor. In both cases, we derive a notion of tensorial free cumulants associated to first order invariants, through moment-cumulant formulas involving summations over non-crossing permutations. The pure and mixed cases involve the same combinatorics, but differ by the invariants that define the distribution at first order. In both cases, the tensorial free-cumulants of a sum of two independent tensors are shown to be additive. A preliminary discussion of higher orders is provided.
  Tensor freeness is then defined as the vanishing of mixed first order tensorial free cumulants. The equivalent formulation at the level of asymptotic moments is derived in the pure and mixed cases, and we provide an algebraic construction of tensorial probability spaces, which generalize non-commutative probability spaces: random tensors converge in distribution to elements of these spaces, and tensor freeness of random variables corresponds to tensor freeness of the subspaces they generate.</description>

      <title>Emergence of network communities driven by local rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks with nodes and links. Often the nodes are segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here I demonstrate that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_ \kappa$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. Using the stochastic block model for community detection with correction for degree sequence, I show that networks generated by local rules have finite $r_ \kappa$ values while their randomized versions do not have emergent communities. I conclude that network communities are an emergent property of networks evolving with local rules.</description>
