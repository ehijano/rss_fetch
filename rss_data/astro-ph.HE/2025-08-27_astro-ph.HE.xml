      <title>Hillas meets Eddington: the case for blazars as ultra-high-energy neutrino sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars are promising high-energy neutrino source candidates. Yet, leptohadronic models face challenges in describing neutrino emission within a viable energy budget, and their predictive power is limited by the commonly used single-zone approximation and the reliance on phenomenological parameters. In this work, we present a new leptohadronic model where a sub-Eddington jet evolves from magnetically- to kinetically dominated. A small fraction of the electrons and protons picked up by the jet are continuously accelerated to a power-law spectrum, estimated based on the local magnetic field strength, turbulence, and ambient density, for which we assume power-law profiles. The model parameters are thus directly tied to the jet physics and are comparable in number to typical single-zone models. We then numerically calculate the emission along the jet. Applying the model to the IceCube candidate TXS 0506+056, we find that protons are accelerated to EeV energies in the inner jet, producing a neutrino flux up to order 100 PeV that is consistent with the public 10 year IceCube point-source data. Proton emission at 0.1 pc describes the X-ray and gamma-ray data, while electron emission at the parsec scale describes the optical data. Protons carry a power of about 1% of the Eddington luminosity, showing that the model is energetically viable. The particle spectra follow $E^{-1.8}$, with diffusion scaling as $E^{0.3}$, ruling out Bohm-like diffusion. Additional particle injection near the broad line region can reproduce the 2017 flare associated to a high-energy neutrino. We also apply the model to blazar PKS 0605-085, which may be associated with a recent neutrino detected by KM3NeT above 100 PeV. The results suggest that blazars are efficient neutrino emitters at ultra-high energies, making them prime candidates for future experiments targeting this challenging energy range.</description>

      <title>Radiation pressure role in accreting massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of radiation pressure on the circumbinary discs surrounding accreting massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at milli-parsec separations, using 3D hyper-Lagrangian resolution hydrodynamic simulations. The circumbinary discs in our simulations evolve under an adiabatic equation of state. The gas temperature is therefore allowed to change through viscous heating, black-body cooling and self-gravity. We take a significant step further by including the contribution of radiation pressure in the simulations. We model binaries with a total mass of $10^6 \, M_{\odot}$, eccentricities $e=0,0.45,0.9$ and mass ratios $q= 0.7, 1$. We find that the radiation pressure significantly alters the vertical and thermal structure of the disc, resulting in a geometrically thinner, therefore colder configuration. This leads to a reduced accretion rate onto the binary and suppresses cavity eccentricity growth and precession in circular equal mass binaries. The binary eccentricity remains approximately constant, while the semi-major axis decreases over time due to net negative torque, regardless of the initial binary orbital parameters.</description>

      <title>A search for minute-time-scale flares from the transient AT\,2024wpp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AT 2018cow-like fast blue optical transient AT2022tsd showed a large number of few-minute-duration, high-luminosity (~10^43 erg/s) flares. We present an intensive search for such flares from another 18cow-like event, AT2024wpp. We have used the Large Array Survey Telescope (LAST) to observe this transient between 28 and 74 days after the approximate time of zero flux. The target was observed for about 23 hours to a sensitivity that allows one to detect 3x10^42 erg/s flares at S/N&gt;5. No optical flares have been found, suggesting a one-sided 2-sigma confidence upper limit of &lt;0.02 on the flare's duty cycle, and flare rate lower than about 0.11/hr. These limits suggest that not all 18cow-like objects display a high rate of minute-timescale luminous flares. This can be explained either by diversity in the 18cow-like population or by viewing angle effects (e.g., beaming), or rather that the optical depth towards the central emitting region did not fall below unity during the particular search window.</description>

      <title>Topology of the Superconducting Heart of Neutron Stars: Effects of Microphysics and Gravitational-Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general-relativistic study of the distribution of proton superconductivity in strongly magnetized neutron stars (NSs), employing the $XNS$ code to solve the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations. This work extends the previous investigation by us in a few key directions: (i) we explore equilibrium configurations with both toroidal and poloidal magnetic field geometries, (ii) we account for complex many-body effects incorporating microscopically derived pairing gaps, and (iii) our models utilize equation(s) of state (EoS) derived from microscopic many-body theory, including realistic two- and three-body nuclear forces, as well as from relativistic mean-field models. We compare superconducting topologies across our collection of EoS and explore the influences of magnetic field geometry in stellar models parameterized by central density. Our models confirm the absence of $S$-wave superconductivity in the inner core and, importantly, reveal that non-superconducting regions exhibit complex three-dimensional geometries: doughnut-shaped for toroidal fields and prolate-shaped for poloidal fields -- spatial structures that are inherently absent from one-dimensional analyses. We also compute magnetic deformations and ellipticities for several millisecond pulsars (MSPs), estimating their continuous gravitational wave (CGW) strain. While these MSPs remain undetectable by current detectors, next-generation instruments such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer may detect their signals, opening an observational window into internal superconductivity and internal magnetic field of NSs, as well as, the fundamental microphysics of dense matter.</description>

      <title>Non-Thermal Ionization of Kilonova Ejecta: Observable Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18364v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characteristic rapid rise and decline at optical wavelengths of a kilonova is the product of the low ejecta mass ($\lesssim 0.05 M_\odot$) and high ejecta velocity ($\gtrsim 0.1$c). We show that, even at very early times ($\lesssim 2$ days), regions of ejecta fall below critical density and temperature thresholds at which non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects become important. Here, we present an approximate method for calculating the ionization state of the ejecta that accounts for the NLTE impact of high-energy electrons produced in the beta decay of freshly synthesized $r$-process elements. We find that incorporating ionization from high-energy electrons produces an ``inverted" and ``blended" ionization structure, where the most highly ionized species are located in the fastest moving homologous ejecta and multiple ionization states coexist. In radiation transport calculations, the higher degree of ionization reduces line blanketing in optical bands, leading to improved agreement with the light curve properties of AT\,2017gfo such as the duration, decay rates, brightness, and colors. Our quasi-NLTE implementation helps to alleviate tensions in kilonova modeling: for high-velocity ($\sim 0.3c$) ejecta components our models require less mass for a given peak brightness in optical bands, by as much as a factor of 3; our models can explain the presence of observed features associated to Sr II, W III, Se III, and Te III under conditions where LTE models would predict only neutral species; and we naturally predict the coexistence of species like Sr II and Ce III without the need for fine-tuning of the ejecta properties.</description>

      <title>Rotating Neutron Stars with Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If dark matter (DM) exists in halos around rotating neutron stars (NSs), it will be essential to understand the effects of rotation on the distribution of DM and baryonic matter (BM) in the stars to interpret observations. In this work, we construct rapidly rotating dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANS) with DM halos using the two-fluid approximation, where the BM and DM interact only through gravity. Our goal is to describe rapidly rotating millisecond-period DANS spun up by the accretion of BM from a zero angular momentum state. We extend the Rapidly Rotating Neutron Star (RNS) code to compute axisymmetric configurations in which the BM rotates rigidly while the DM remains torque-free and differentially rotates through the frame-dragging of spacetime. For the first time, we examine in detail local and global definitions of mass in general relativity for two-fluid systems, showing how their differences affect the interpretation of baryonic and dark component masses. We compute energy density and frame-dragging frequency profiles for DANS with three different characteristic DM halos. We demonstrate that rapid BM rotation reduces DM halo sizes if central energy densities are kept constant between non-rotating and rotating models. We also construct sequences of DANS to create mass and radius curves and compare rotating and non-rotating cases. Finally, we quantify deviations in the spacetime metric outside the baryonic surfaces of these sequences of stars caused by the DM halos. We hypothesize that the size of this quantity could indicate whether a DM halo will significantly impact X-ray pulse profile modeling. These results provide a framework for assessing the observational consequences of DM halos around rapidly rotating NSs.</description>

      <title>Super-Accreting Active Galactic Nuclei as Neutrino Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) often exhibit broad-line regions (BLRs), populated by high-velocity clouds in Keplerian orbits around the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) at subparsec scales. During episodes of intense super-Eddington accretion, the disk can launch a powerful radiation-driven wind that overtakes the BLR clouds, forming bowshocks. Two shocks arise: one into the wind and another into the cloud. If adiabatic, electrons and protons are efficiently accelerated via Fermi processes to relativistic energies. In dense winds, the resulting high-energy photons are absorbed and reprocessed within the photosphere, while neutrinos from inelastic $pp$ collisions escape. We explore the potential of super-accreting AGNs as neutrino sources and propose a new class of emitter: an AGN without jets or gamma-ray counterparts, but with a strong opaque disk wind. As a case study, we consider a SMBH with $M_{\rm BH}=10^6,M_{\odot}$ and accretion rates consistent with tidal disruption events (TDEs). We compute the main cooling processes for relativistic particles and show that super-Eddington SMBHs can produce detectable neutrino fluxes with only weak electromagnetic signatures. Such fluxes may be observable by IceCube-Gen2 in nearby galaxies with a high BLR cloud filling factor. For more massive black holes, detection remains possible with moderate filling factors if the source is close, or at larger distances if the filling factor is high. Our model thus provides a plausible scenario for extragalactic neutrino sources, where both flux and timescale are determined by the number of orbiting clouds and the duration of the super-accreting phase.</description>

      <title>Impacts of axion cooling on the direct detection of supernova axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae provide a unique opportunity to probe axions because they can be a copious source of the particles. It has recently been proposed that axion helioscopes can be used for the direct search for supernova axions if a supernova event appears within a few hundred parsecs. However, the event number of supernova axions has been estimated only within the post-process framework. In this study, we perform long-term supernova simulations for a 9.6M_sun star coupled with the axion emission to reevaluate the event number of axions detected by the helioscopes. We find that the additional cooling induced by the axion emission can significantly decrease the temperature in the proto-neutron star. As a result, the axion luminosity and hence the axion event number are reduced, compared with the result obtained through post-processing. Our result indicates that the nonlinear feedback of the axion emission is an essential factor to predict the axion detectability, and underscores the need for systematic simulation studies across various progenitor models.</description>

      <title>X-BPASS : Self-consistent modelling of stellar populations and their associated X-ray Binary emission in a binary stellar evolution framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray binaries play a significant role in the thermal and ionization history of galaxies. Their X-ray luminosity can shed light on galactic star formation rates and histories. Compact objects are also crucial in the evolution of gravitational wave progenitors. Here we present the results from our work to extend the binary population and spectral synthesis (BPASS) code suite to incorporate X-ray emission onto compact remnants in binary systems. We self-consistently model the accretion disc for each interacting binary system in a grid of stellar evolution models and then combine these to obtain the total X-ray spectra for stellar populations over a range of ages and metallicities. Crucially, these are estimated using the same stellar models as those used for modelling the stellar spectral energy distribution. We utilise first principle equations to calculate the X-ray binary (XRB) evolution, luminosity and spectral energy densities of individual accreting compact objects. Population synthesis using observationally motivated values for R_inner (the accretion disc inner truncation radius) reproduces the observed X-ray number evolution in the Small Magellanic Cloud and the inferred X-ray flux evolution for M51, validating our models. Using these models, we explore the implications of a self-consistent stellar and XRB emission population synthesis for ionizing photon production, the XRB dependence on metallicity and, for XRBs as a potential source of nebular He II emission seen in the spectra of high redshift galaxies. We conclude that XRBs contribute towards powering nebular He II emission without causing significant overestimates of hydrogen ionization.</description>

      <title>Return of the Clocked Burster: Exceptionally Short Recurrence Time in GS 1826-238</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18837v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an exceptionally short burst recurrence time in the well-known clocked burster GS 1826$-$238, observed with the CubeSat X-ray observatory NinjaSat. The source had remained in a persistent soft spectral state since its hard-to-soft transition in 2015 July until a soft-to-hard transition occurred in 2025 May. On 2025 June 23, NinjaSat began monitoring GS 1826$-$238 in the hard state and continued until the source returned to a steady soft state. During this period, we detected 19 X-ray bursts: 14 during the hard state, 4 in the transitional state, and 1 in the soft state. In the hard state, we identified a new clocked bursting epoch, during which the burst recurrence time remained highly stable and unprecedentedly short among the clocked bursting phases of GS 1826$-$238, with $t_{\rm rec} = 1.603 \pm 0.040$ hr ($1\sigma$ error). Furthermore, this recurrence time deviates significantly by approximately 37% from the previously established empirical relation $t_{\rm rec} \propto F_{\rm bol}^{-1.05}$, where $F_{\rm bol}$ is the bolometric persistent flux. These results suggest that the ignition conditions for X-ray bursts differed from those in earlier epochs. We explore possible explanations for this discrepancy and propose a scenario in which a smaller fraction of the neutron star surface was involved in fuel accumulation and nuclear burning. This situation leads to a high local accretion rate compared to earlier epochs, which naturally results in the exceptionally short recurrence time, as well as the observed reductions of approximately 38% in blackbody normalization (proportional to the emitting area) and 29% in burst fluence.</description>

      <title>Lightcurve Features of Magnetar-Powered Superluminous Supernovae with Gravitational-Wave Emission and High-Energy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a distinct class of stellar explosions, exhibiting peak luminosities 10-100 times brighter than those of normal SNe. Their extreme luminosities cannot be explained by the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and its daughter $^{56}\mathrm{Co}$ alone. Consequently, models invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed, capable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For these rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may also contribute significantly to the spin-down, particularly during their early evolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within the optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes transparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve. In this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the combined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of SLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for magnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence suppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further investigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the lightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities. Our results highlight the complex interplay between GW-driven spin-down and radiative transport in shaping the observable features of SLSNe, offering new insights into diagnosing the nature of their central engines.</description>

      <title>Detection of Diffuse Radio Emission inside the Supernova Remnant G338.3-0.0 associated with the Gamma-ray Source HESS J1640-465</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of diffuse radio emission within SNR G338.3-0.0 using new MeerKAT observations at 816 MHz and 1.4 GHz. The radio emission spatially overlaps with the X-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by PSR J1640-4631 and the GeV/TeV gamma-ray source HESS J1640-465. The morphology of this radio emission is centrally peaked and its extent is well-contained within the SNR shell. A lack of mid- and far-infrared counterparts and the absence of catalogued H II regions argues against a thermal origin, while the morphology and radial profile are suggestive of a PWN origin powered by PSR J1640-4631. Under this assumption, we use a one-zone, time dependant model to reproduce the size and broadband (radio, X-ray, and gamma-rays) spectral energy distribution of the PWN. The modelling and broadband properties of this PWN suggests it is currently interacting with the reverse shock within its host SNR. This evolutionary stage is associated with particles escaping the PWN and entering the ISM, suggesting this object may be an important source of Galactic PeV e+/e-</description>

      <title>SN2023syz and SN2025cbj: Two Type IIn Supernovae Associated with IceCube High-energy Neutrinos</title>

Abstract: Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are a subclass of core-collapse SNe in which strong interactions occur between the ejecta and dense circumstellar material, creating ideal conditions for the production of high-energy neutrinos. This makes them promising candidate sources of neutrinos. In this work, we conduct an association study between 163 SNe IIn observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility and 138 neutrino alert events detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory. After excluding alerts with poor localization, we find two SNe that are spatiotemporally coincident with neutrino events. IC231027A and IC250421A coincide with the positions of SN2023syz and SN2025cbj, respectively, within their localization uncertainties, and the neutrino arrival times are delayed by 38 days and 61 days relative to the discovery times of the corresponding SNe. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that the probability of such two coincidences occurring by chance in our sample is $p \sim 0.67\%$, suggesting a high likelihood that they arise from genuine associations, though the result is not yet statistical significant. Furthermore, model calculations show that the expected numbers of neutrino events from these SNe IIn could be consistent with the actual observations. Our study provides possible evidence that interacting SNe may be potential neutrino-emitting sources.</description>

Abstract: The dSphs around the Milky Way are commonly considered as systems that are supported by velocity dispersion against self-gravitation. They have been long accounted among the best targets to search for indirect DM signatures in the GeV-to-TeV gamma-rays due to absence of astrophysical gamma-ray foreground or background emission. We present forecasts on the sensitivity of the future CTAO for the search for annihilating or decaying DM in such targets. We perform an original selection of candidates out of the current catalog of known objects, including both classical and ultra-faint targets. For each of them, we calculate the expected amount of DM using the most updated and complete available samples of photometric and spectroscopic data of member stars, adopting a common framework of data treatment for both classes of objects. In this way, we are able to generate novel astrophysical factor profiles for general indirect DM searches that we compare with the current literature. Out of a starting sample of 64 dSphs, we highlight the 8 most promising targets - DraI, CBe, UMaII, UMi and Wil1 in the Northern hemisphere; RetII, Scl and SgrII in the Southern hemisphere - for which different DM density models (either cored or cuspy) lead to similar expectations, at variance with what happens for other DM targets - thus resulting in more robust predictions. We find that CTAO will provide the strongest limits above ~10 TeV, down to values of velocity-averaged annihilation cross section of ~5$ \times 10^{-25}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and up to decay lifetimes of ~10$^{26}$ s for combined limits on the best targets. We argue that the largest source of inaccuracy is due to the still imprecise determination of the DM content, especially for ultra-faint dSphs. We propose possible strategies of observation for CTAO, either optimized on a deep focus on the best known candidates, or on the diversification of targets.</description>

      <title>Astrophysics informed Gaussian processes for gravitational-wave populations: Evidence for the onset of the pair-instability supernova mass gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the latest Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) using a flexible, non-parametric framework to infer the underlying black hole mass distribution. Our model employs Gaussian Processes (GPs) with astrophysically motivated priors to represent the mass distribution, assuming both component masses are independently drawn from a common mass function. This approach enables us to capture complex features in the population without relying on rigid parametric forms. Motivated by predictions from binary stellar evolution, we focus on the presence of a mass gap in the range $40-120~ M_\odot$, attributed to the pair-instability supernova (PISN) and pulsational PISN (PPISN) processes. Using our GP-based model, we find for the first time, strong evidence for the onset of this mass gap, locating its lower edge at approximately $45-60 ~M_\odot$. We observe a suppression in the BBH merger rate when comparing the latest constraints against our GP model, by a factor of $10-60$ at $\sim60~M_\odot$, corresponding to the minimum of the mass gap. Additionally, we find evidence of a subpopulation of mergers populating the mass gap around $70 ~M_\odot$, which we argue is due to hierarchical mergers, as well as of a feature in the $40-50~ M_\odot$ range, albeit with low significance, which we attribute to the predicted PPISN build up. We discuss the astrophysical implications of this result in light of GW231123, a recently reported BBH merger with a total mass potentially above the PISN gap, suggesting the need for revised models of massive stellar evolution or alternative formation channels.</description>

      <title>Unified Gas Heating Constraints on Extended Dark Matter Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first unified constraints on a broad class of extended dark matter compact objects (EDCOs) from interstellar gas heating. These include axion stars, Q-balls, axion miniclusters, dark fermion stars and primordial black holes surrounded by dark matter halos, which arise in a wide range of theories beyond the Standard Model. As such massive objects traverse the interstellar medium, their gravitational influence generates wakes and, if sufficiently compact, drives accretion flows that heat gas in their vicinity. Our general framework extends standard dynamical friction treatments by incorporating finite-size effects, internal density profiles, gas penetration through objects, and criteria for accretion disk formation. We perform detailed numerical calculations of wake formation and gas heating and apply our results to the Leo T dwarf galaxy, establishing new constraints on the dark matter fraction in EDCOs heavier than a solar mass spanning several orders of magnitude in both mass and abundance.</description>

      <title>Scalar fields from nonlinear sigma models on black hole spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar fields with non-trivial kinetic term derived from a nonlinear sigma model are motivated by UV completions of gravity such as string theory. We discuss the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathrm{O}(3)$ sigma models with interacting potentials and simulate their full nonlinear dynamics on black hole spacetimes. We study the properties of the field as a function of the curvature of the sigma model with respect to the free massive scalar case. In the accretion process, the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ model behaves as a self-interacting field with attractive interaction, while the $\mathrm{O}(3)$ one exhibits a repulsive phenomenology. In the case of a binary black hole system, these models cause a positive or negative dephasing of the gravitational waveform, respectively, when compared to the non-interacting case and as long as the field's Compton wavelength is larger than the binary separation. We observe no bosenova emission, which suggests that nonlinearities tend to suppress this phenomenon. Our results highlight how the kinetic and potential terms are both relevant in determining the field dynamics.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a new transitional type of evolved massive stars with hard ionizing flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are the evolved descendants of the most massive stars and show emission-line dominated spectra formed in their powerful stellar winds. Marking the final evolution stage before core collapse, the standard picture of WR stars has been that they evolve through three well-defined spectral subtypes known as WN, WC, and WO. Here, we present a detailed analysis of five objects that defy this scheme, demonstrating that WR stars can also evolve directly from the WN to the WO stage. Our study reveals that this direct transition is connected to low metallicity and weaker winds. The WN/WO stars and their immediate WN precursors are hot and emit a high flux of photons capable of fully ionizing helium. The existence of these stages unveil that high mass stars which manage to shed off their outer hydrogen layers in a low-metallicity environment can spend a considerable fraction of their lifetime in a stage that is difficult to detect in integrated stellar populations, but at the same time yields hard ionizing flux. The identification of the WN to WO evolution path for massive stars has significant implications for understanding the chemical enrichment and ionizing feedback in star-forming galaxies, in particular at earlier cosmic times.</description>

      <title>Lightweight posterior construction for gravitational-wave catalogs with the Kolmogorov-Arnold network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural density estimation has seen widespread applications in the gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis, which enables real-time parameter estimation for compact binary coalescences and enhances rapid inference for subsequent analysis such as population inference. In this work, we explore the application of using the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to construct efficient and interpretable neural density estimators for lightweight posterior construction of GW catalogs. By replacing conventional activation functions with learnable splines, KAN achieves superior interpretability, higher accuracy, and greater parameter efficiency on related scientific tasks. Leveraging this feature, we propose a KAN-based neural density estimator, which ingests megabyte-scale GW posterior samples and compresses them into model weights of tens of kilobytes. Subsequently, analytic expressions requiring only several kilobytes can be further distilled from these neural network weights with minimal accuracy trade-off. In practice, GW posterior samples with fidelity can be regenerated rapidly using the model weights or analytic expressions for subsequent analysis. Our lightweight posterior construction strategy is expected to facilitate user-level data storage and transmission, paving a path for efficient analysis of numerous GW events in the next-generation GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Connecting The Hierarchically Merging Binary Black Hole Population To Their Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes with masses $\sim\,80-150\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ suggests that some proportion of black hole binary systems form hierarchically in dense astrophysical environments, as most stellar evolution models cannot explain the origin of these massive black holes through isolated binary evolution. A significant fraction of such mergers could occur in Active Galactic Nuclei disks (AGN), however connecting individual black hole mergers to host galaxies is a challenging endeavor due to large localization uncertainties. We assess the feasibility of determining the fraction of hierarchically merging black hole binaries by computing the angular cross-correlation between gravitational wave localization posteriors and galaxy catalog skymaps. We forecast when the clustering of gravitational wave sky localizations can be measured accurately enough to distinguish the AGN origin scenario from hierarchical mergers in galaxies that do not host AGN. We find that if the observed merging population is dominated by binaries formed dynamically in AGN, then this could be determined with $\mathcal{O}(5000)$ mergers detected at the sensitivity that is projected for the upcoming A\# gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Common Envelope Evolution of Ultralight Boson Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons can be excited around spinning black holes via black hole superradiance. These boson clouds may play an important role in the orbital evolution of binary black holes. In this work, we investigate the formation and evolution of common envelopes of ultralight boson clouds in comparable mass-ratio black hole binaries. We describe the cloud evolution using gravitational molecular eigenstates and analyze the possible level transitions during orbital decay, as well as the impact on orbital dynamics. We find that the cloud can generally lead to eccentricity growth. In particular, the eccentricity may vary significantly during level transition, leaving an eccentricity of ${\cal O}(0.1)$ within the detection band of ground-based gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>A Hidden Pulse: Uncovering a New Timing Signal in Cygnus X-1 with AstroSat</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of fast variability properties in X-ray binaries advances our understanding of the physical processes and geometric properties of the accretion flow around the compact object. In this work, we study the evolution of the timing properties of Cygnus X-1 with AstroSat/LAXPC, during the transition of the source from the hard to soft state in 2017. We use a novel frequency-segmented technique to fit simultaneously the cross spectra and parts of the power spectra and coherence function with a multi-Lorentzian model and predict the phase-lags and the complementary parts of the power spectra and coherence function. We study the evolution of the frequency and power of the main variability components that are present throughout all the states. In particular, we identify previously undetected variability components, one of which manifests as a narrow dip in the coherence function and a broad drop in the phase-lag spectrum at the same frequency. This dip in coherence, which we detected for the first time in Cygnus X-1 at energies above 3 keV, appears in a state in which the source shows high-amplitude radio variability and significant hard X-ray polarization. While the contribution of the compact jet in X-rays is debated in the literature, this study provides a new avenue for investigating jet properties as well as the geometry of the Comptonizing medium.</description>

Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes ($3$ $M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 150$ $M_\odot$) are the natural product of the evolution of heavy stars ($M_{\rm star} \gtrsim 20$ $M_\odot$). In our Galaxy, we expect $10^8$-$10^9$ stellar-mass black holes formed from the gravitational collapse of heavy stars, but currently we know fewer than 100 objects. We also know $\sim 100$ stellar-mass black holes in other galaxies, most of them discovered by gravitational wave observatories in the past 10 years. The detection of black holes is indeed extremely challenging and possible only in very special cases. This article is a short review on the physics and astrophysics of stellar-mass black holes, including Galactic and extragalactic black holes in X-ray binaries, black holes in astrometric binaries, isolated black holes, and black holes in compact binaries. The article also addresses some important open issues and introduces the idea of a possible interstellar mission to the closest black hole.</description>

      <title>HAWC, VERITAS, Fermi-LAT and XMM-Newton follow-up observations of the unidentified ultra-high-energy gamma-ray source LHAASO J2108+5157</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report observations of the ultra-high-energy gamma-ray source LHAASO J2108$+$5157, utilizing VERITAS, HAWC, Fermi-LAT, and XMM-Newton. VERITAS has collected $\sim$ 40 hours of data that we used to set ULs to the emission above 200 GeV. The HAWC data, collected over $\sim 2400$ days, reveal emission between 3 and 146 TeV, with a significance of $7.5~\sigma$, favoring an extended source model. The best-fit spectrum measured by HAWC is characterized by a simple power-law with a spectral index of $2.45\pm0.11_{stat}$. Fermi-LAT analysis finds a point source with a very soft spectrum in the LHAASO J2108+5157 region, consistent with the 4FGL-DR3 catalog results. The XMM-Newton analysis yields a null detection of the source in the 2 - 7 keV band. The broadband spectrum can be interpreted as a pulsar and a pulsar wind nebula system, where the GeV gamma-ray emission originates from an unidentified pulsar, and the X-ray and TeV emission is attributed to synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering of electrons accelerated within a pulsar wind nebula. In this leptonic scenario, our X-ray upper limit provides a stringent constraint on the magnetic field, which is $\lesssim 1.5\ \mu$G.</description>

      <title>The New Status Qvo? SN 2021qvo is Another 2003fg-like Type Ia Supernova with a Rising Light-Curve Bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, multiple Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been observed with "bumps" in their rising light curves shortly after explosion. Here, we present SN 2021qvo: a SN Ia that exhibits a clear early bump in photometry obtained by the Young Supernova Experiment. Photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2021qvo show that it has a broader light curve, higher peak luminosity, shallower Si II $\lambda$5972 pseudo-equivalent width, and lower ejecta velocities than normal SNe Ia, which are all consistent with the characteristics of the 2003fg-like (often called "super-Chandrasekhar") SN subtype. Including SN 2021qvo, just four known 2003fg-like SNe Ia have sufficient pre-peak data to reveal a rising light-curve bump, and all four have bump detections. Host-galaxy analysis reveals that SN 2021qvo exploded in a low-mass galaxy ${\rm log}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) = 7.83^{+0.17}_{-0.24}$, also consistent with other members of this class. We investigate the validity of the leading early-bump 2003fg-like SN Ia progenitor model, an interaction between the circumstellar material (CSM) and the SN ejecta, by modeling the early bump and subsequent light-curve evolution of SN 2021qvo with the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients. We find that the bump can be modeled with a best-fit CSM mass of $\log_{10}(M_\mathrm{CSM}/M_{\odot}) = -2.33^{+0.26}_{-0.15}$. SN 2021qvo adds to the small but growing number of 2003fg-like SNe Ia with rising light-curve bumps; as the number of these SNe Ia with CSM estimates continues to grow, population-level inferences about the CSM distribution will be able to constrain the progenitor scenario for these SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Characterising the short-orbital period X-ray transient Swift J1910.2-0546</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SwiftJ1910.2-0546 is a Galactic X-ray transient discovered during a bright outburst in 2012. We use time-series optical photometry and spectroscopy to estimate the orbital period, characterise the donor star, determine the interstellar extinction, distance, and system geometry, and constrain the component masses. Multi-site r-band and clear-filter light curves and WHT/ACAM spectra from the 2012 outburst are combined with time-series spectroscopy from GTC/OSIRIS and VLT/FORS2 in quiescence. Period searches are conducted using generalised Lomb-Scargle, phase-dispersion minimisation, and analysis-of-variance algorithms. Diffuse interstellar bands constrain E(B-V), while empirical correlations involving H$\alpha$ yield estimates of K2, q, and i. We detect a double-humped modulation with a period of $0.0941\pm0.0007$d ($2.26\pm0.02$h) during the outburst. Its morphology is consistent with an early superhump, suggesting that the true orbital period may be slightly shorter than 4.52h. The H$\alpha$ radial velocity curves do not yield a definitive orbital period. In quiescence, TiO bands indicate an M3-M3.5 donor contributing 70% of the red continuum. Diffuse interstellar bands give E(B-V)=$0.60\pm0.05$ and N_H=$(3.9\pm1.3)$x10$^{21}$cm$^{-2}$, placing the system at a distance of 2.8-4.0 kpc. The H$\alpha$ line width in quiescence (FWHM_0 =$990\pm45$km/s), via a FWHM-K_2 calibration, provides an estimate of K_2, while its double peaked profile gives q and i. Adopting the resulting K_2=$230\pm17$km/s and q=$0.032\pm0.010$, and two orbital period scenarios (2.25 and 4.50h), Monte Carlo sampling returns a compact object mass M_1=8-11M_sun and an inclination i=13-18 deg for plausible donor masses (M_2=0.25-0.35M_sun). We favour an orbital period of 4.5h. Further phase-resolved spectroscopy and photometry during quiescence are needed to better determine its fundamental parameters.</description>

      <title>A bi-effect model of muon deflections in air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress has shown that the geomagnetic field exerts a more significant impact than expected on the behavior of charged secondary particles in inclined air showers. In this study, we for the first time combine it with atmospheric effects to construct a bi-effect model, aiming to investigate the lateral distribution of particles on the ground plane. Despite the complex physical interactions during the development of air showers, a simple formula can describe the overall deflection of $\mu^{\pm}$ and accurately fit the deflection in simulated air showers, thereby validating the hypotheses about these effects in this study. Furthermore, we have obtained the relationship between model parameters and primary particle information for different experimental sites. This new model is highly successful and is promising to provide new insights for improving detector layout design and air shower reconstruction.</description>

      <title>PSR J1838-0655: X-Ray Observations with NICER and NuSTAR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the timing and spectral properties of PSR J1838-0655 using joint observations from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). By disentangling the pulsar's emission from its surrounding wind nebula across joint Chandra, NuSTAR, and NICER observations, we find the pulsar's broad-band X-ray spectrum (1.3--79\,keV) is best-described by a broken power-law model. The model features photon indices of $\Gamma_1 = 1.19 \pm 0.07$ and $\Gamma_2 = 1.47 \pm 0.02$ below and above a break energy of $E_{\rm b} = 7.7 \pm 0.8$\,keV. The resulting unabsorbed 2--10\,keV flux from the pulsar is $(9.5^{+0.4}_{-0.3}) \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$. Furthermore, timing analysis of NICER data spanning MJD 58250 to 60630 reveals a very large glitch occurring around MJD 59300, characterized by a frequency jump of $\Delta \nu = 29.367(7) \times 10^{-6}$ Hz, which can be well explained by the vortex creep model. Phase-resolved spectral analysis indicates a clear anti-correlation between the photon index and the pulse intensity, suggesting spectral hardening at the pulse peak.</description>

      <title>Gaussian process representation of dispersion measure noise in pulsar wideband datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ionized interstellar medium disperses pulsar radio signals, resulting in a stochastic time-variable delay known as the dispersion measure (DM) noise. In the wideband paradigm of pulsar timing, we measure a DM together with a time of arrival from a pulsar observation to handle frequency-dependent profile evolution, interstellar scintillation, and radio frequency interference more robustly, and to reduce data volumes. In this paper, we derive a method to incorporate arbitrary models of DM variation, including Gaussian process models, in pulsar timing and noise analysis and pulsar timing array analysis. This generalizes the existing method for handling DM noise in wideband datasets.</description>

      <title>Electron-Ion Equilibration in the Merging Galaxy Cluster Abell 665</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy cluster mergers drive powerful shock fronts that heat the Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM) and accelerate particles, redistributing the energy in a merger. Abell 665 is one of only a few clusters with such a powerful shock ($M \sim 3$) and provides a unique opportunity to study the thermalization timescale of the ICM, particularly the electron-ion equilibration timescale. Understanding this timescale is crucial for determining how energy from the merger is distributed between thermal and non-thermal particle populations. Using $\sim$200 ks of NuSTAR observations, we measure the temperature distribution across the shock to distinguish between two heating models: (1) an instant, collisionless model where ions and electrons are immediately heated at the shock front, and (2) a collisional model where electrons are initially adiabatically compressed at the shock and subsequently equilibrate with the ions over $\sim$100 Myr. Our measurements favor the delayed equilibration model, suggesting that electrons do not immediately reach thermal equilibrium with the ions at the shock front and instead equilibrate over $t_{eq} = (4.0 \pm 3.4) \times 10^8$ yrs. Additionally, our temperature measurements indicate that the Mach number may be lower than previously estimated ($M = 2.8 \pm 0.7$), suggesting that the shock strength has been overestimated in past studies. These results add to our understanding of the microphysics governing how thermal energy is distributed in diffuse plasmas like the ICM, with implications for galaxy cluster evolution, large scale structure formation, and cosmology.</description>
