      <title>Quantative bounds for high-dimensional non-linear functionals of Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive explicit quantitative Berry-Esseen bounds in the hyper-rectangle distance for high-dimensional, non-linear functionals of Gaussian processes, allowing for strong dependence between variables. Our main result shows that the convergence rate is sub-polynomial in dimension $d$ under a smoothness assumption. Based on this result, we derive explicit Berry-Esseen bounds for the method of moments, empirical characteristic functions, empirical moment generation functions, and functional limit theorems in the high-dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>The multi-level friendship paradox for sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Hazra, den Hollander and Parvaneh (2025) we analysed the friendship paradox for sparse random graphs. For four classes of random graphs we characterised the empirical distribution of the friendship biases between vertices and their neighbours at distance $1$, proving convergence as $n\to\infty$ to a limiting distribution, with $n$ the number of vertices, and identifying moments and tail exponents of the limiting distribution. In the present paper we look at the multi-level friendship bias between vertices and their neighbours at distance $k \in \mathbb{N}$ obtained via a $k$-step exploration according to a backtracking or a non-backtracking random walk. We identify the limit of empirical distribution of the multi-level friendship biases as $n\to\infty$ and/or $k\to\infty$. We show that for non-backtracking exploration the two limits commute for a large class of sparse random graphs, including those that locally converge to a rooted Galton-Watson tree. In particular, we show that the same limit arises when $k$ depends on $n$, i.e., $k=k_n$, provided $\lim_{n\to\infty} k_n = \infty$ under some mild conditions. We exhibit cases where the two limits do not commute and show the relevance of the mixing time of the exploration.</description>

      <title>Sufficient Conditions for the Energy Balance for the Stochastic Incompressible Euler Equations with Additive Noise in two Space Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider vanishing viscosity approximations to solutions of the stochastic incompressible Euler equations in two space dimensions with additive noise. We identify sufficient and necessary conditions under which martingale solutions of the stochastic Euler equations satisfy an exact energy balance in mean. We find that the tightness of the laws of the approximating sequence of solutions of the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations in $L^2([0,T]\times D)$ is equivalent to the limiting martingale solution satisfying an energy balance in mean. Numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>On convex order and supermodular order without finite mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many results on the convex order in the literature were stated for random variables with finite mean. For instance, a fundamental result in dependence modeling is that the sum of a pair of random random variables is upper bounded in convex order by that of its comonotonic version and lower bounded by that of its counter-monotonic version, and all existing proofs of this result require the random variables' expectations to be finite. We show that the above result remains true even when discarding the finite-mean assumption, and obtain several other results on the comparison of infinite-mean random variables via the convex order. To our surprise, we find two deceivingly similar definitions of the convex order, both of which exist widely in the literature, and they are not equivalent for random variables with infinite mean. This subtle discrepancy in definitions also applies to the supermodular order, and it gives rise to some incorrect statements, often found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of a branching diffusion solver for nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic branching algorithms provide a useful alternative to grid-based schemes for the numerical solution of partial differential equations, particularly in high-dimensional settings. However, they require a strict control of the integrability of random functionals of branching processes in order to ensure the non-explosion of solutions. In this paper, we study the stability of a functional branching representation of PDE solutions by deriving sufficient criteria for the integrability of the multiplicative weighted progeny of stochastic branching processes. We also prove the uniqueness of mild solutions under uniform integrability assumptions on random functionals.</description>

      <title>An approximate solution of a case of perturbed Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on finding an approximate solution of a kind of Fokker-Planck equation with time-dependent perturbations. A formulation of the approximate solution of the equation is constructed, and then the existence of the formulation is proved. The related Hamiltonian dynamical system explains the estimations. Our work provides a more comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of systems described by this Fokker-Planck equation and the corresponding stochastic differential equation.</description>

      <title>Connectivity for square percolation and coarse cubical rigidity in random right-angled Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random right-angled Coxeter groups, $W_{\Gamma}$, whose presentation graph $\Gamma$ is taken to be an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph, i.e., $\Gamma\sim \mathcal{G}_{n,p}$. We use techniques from probabilistic combinatorics to establish several new results about the geometry of these random groups.
  We resolve a conjecture of Susse and determine the connectivity threshold for square percolation on the random graph $\Gamma \sim \mathcal{G}_{n,p}$. We use this result to determine a large range of $p$ for which the random right-angled Coxeter group $W_{\Gamma}$ has a unique cubical coarse median structure. Until recent work of Fioravanti, Levcovitz and Sageev, there were no non-hyperbolic examples of groups with cubical coarse rigidity; our present results show the property is in fact typically satisfied by a random RACG for a wide range of the parameter $p$, including $p=1/2$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for first-passage percolation on logarithmic subgraphs of $\mathbb{Z}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $a&gt;0$ and $b \geq 0$, let $\mathbb{G}_{a,b}$ be the subgraph of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ induced by the vertices between the first coordinate axis and the graph of the function $f = f_{a,b}(u) = a \log (1+u) + b \log(1+\log(1+u))$, $u \geq 0$. It is known that for $a&gt;0$, the critical value for Bernoulli percolation on $\mathbb{G}_f = \mathbb{G}_{a,b}$ is strictly between $1/2$ and $1$, and that if $b&gt;2a$ then the percolation phase transition is discontinuous. We study first-passage percolation (FPP) on $\mathbb{G}_{a,b}$ with i.i.d.~edge-weights $(\tau_e)$ satisfying $p = \mathbb{P}(\tau_e=0) \in [1/2,1)$ and the ``gap condition'' $\mathbb{P}(\tau_e \leq \delta) = p$ for some $\delta&gt;0$. We find the rate of growth of the expected passage time in $\mathbb{G}_f$ from the origin to the line $x=n$, and show that, while when $p=1/2$ it is of order $n/(a \log n)$, when $p&gt;1/2$ it can be of order (a) $n^{c_1}/(\log n)^{c_2}$, (b) $(\log n)^{c_3}$, (c) $\log \log n$, or (d) constant, depending on the relationship between $a,b,$ and $p$. For more general functions $f$, we prove a central limit theorem for the passage time and show that its variance grows at the same rate as the mean. As a consequence of our methods, we improve the percolation transition result by showing that the phase transition on $\mathbb{G}_{a,b}$ is discontinuous if and only if $b &gt; a$, and improve "sponge crossing dimensions" asymptotics from the '80s on subcritical percolation crossing probabilities for tall thin rectangles.</description>

      <title>$N$-Player Stochastic Differential Games with Regime Switching and Mean Field Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate $N$-player stochastic differential games with regime switching, where the player dynamics are modulated by a finite-state Markov chain. We analyze the associated Nash system, which consists of a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations, and establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to this system, thereby proving the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we examine the mean field game problem under the same regime-switching framework. We derive a connection between the Nash equilibrium of the MFG and forward-backward stochastic differential equation with jumps, and demonstrate the unique solvability of this equation. Finally, we explore the propagation of chaos and show that the optimal control obtained from the MFG serves as an approximate Nash equilibrium for the $N$-player problem.</description>

      <title>Global law of conjugate kernel random matrices with heavy-tailed weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic spectral behavior of the conjugate kernel random matrix $YY^\top$, where $Y= f(WX)$ arises from a two-layer neural network model. We consider the setting where $W$ and $X$ are both random rectangular matrices with i.i.d. entries, where the entries of $W$ follow a heavy-tailed distribution, while those of $X$ have light tails. Our assumptions on $W$ include a broad class of heavy-tailed distributions, such as symmetric $\alpha$-stable laws with $\alpha \in (0,2)$ and sparse matrices with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ nonzero entries per row. The activation function $f$, applied entrywise, is nonlinear, smooth, and odd. By computing the eigenvalue distribution of $YY^\top$ through its moments, we show that heavy-tailed weights induce strong correlations between the entries of $Y$, leading to richer and fundamentally different spectral behavior compared to models with light-tailed weights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Batch normalization is one of the most important regularization techniques for neural networks, significantly improving training by centering the layers of the neural network. There have been several attempts to provide a theoretical justification for batch ormalization. Santurkar and Tsipras (2018) [How does batch normalization help optimization? Advances in neural information rocessing systems, 31] claim that batch normalization improves initialization. We provide a counterexample showing that this claim s not true, i.e., batch normalization does not improve initialization.</description>

      <title>Generalized Decision Focused Learning under Imprecise Uncertainty--Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision Focused Learning has emerged as a critical paradigm for integrating machine learning with downstream optimisation. Despite its promise, existing methodologies predominantly rely on probabilistic models and focus narrowly on task objectives, overlooking the nuanced challenges posed by epistemic uncertainty, non-probabilistic modelling approaches, and the integration of uncertainty into optimisation constraints. This paper bridges these gaps by introducing innovative frameworks: (i) a non-probabilistic lens for epistemic uncertainty representation, leveraging intervals (the least informative uncertainty model), Contamination (hybrid model), and probability boxes (the most informative uncertainty model); (ii) methodologies to incorporate uncertainty into constraints, expanding Decision-Focused Learning's utility in constrained environments; (iii) the adoption of Imprecise Decision Theory for ambiguity-rich decision-making contexts; and (iv) strategies for addressing sparse data challenges. Empirical evaluations on benchmark optimisation problems demonstrate the efficacy of these approaches in improving decision quality and robustness and dealing with said gaps.</description>

      <title>HEROS-GAN: Honed-Energy Regularized and Optimal Supervised GAN for Enhancing Accuracy and Range of Low-Cost Accelerometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-cost accelerometers play a crucial role in modern society due to their advantages of small size, ease of integration, wearability, and mass production, making them widely applicable in automotive systems, aerospace, and wearable technology. However, this widely used sensor suffers from severe accuracy and range limitations. To this end, we propose a honed-energy regularized and optimal supervised GAN (HEROS-GAN), which transforms low-cost sensor signals into high-cost equivalents, thereby overcoming the precision and range limitations of low-cost accelerometers. Due to the lack of frame-level paired low-cost and high-cost signals for training, we propose an Optimal Transport Supervision (OTS), which leverages optimal transport theory to explore potential consistency between unpaired data, thereby maximizing supervisory information. Moreover, we propose a Modulated Laplace Energy (MLE), which injects appropriate energy into the generator to encourage it to break range limitations, enhance local changes, and enrich signal details. Given the absence of a dedicated dataset, we specifically establish a Low-cost Accelerometer Signal Enhancement Dataset (LASED) containing tens of thousands of samples, which is the first dataset serving to improve the accuracy and range of accelerometers and is released in Github. Experimental results demonstrate that a GAN combined with either OTS or MLE alone can surpass the previous signal enhancement SOTA methods by an order of magnitude. Integrating both OTS and MLE, the HEROS-GAN achieves remarkable results, which doubles the accelerometer range while reducing signal noise by two orders of magnitude, establishing a benchmark in the accelerometer signal processing.</description>

      <title>Mixing Any Cocktail with Limited Ingredients: On the Structure of Payoff Sets in Multi-Objective MDPs and its Impact on Randomised Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider multi-dimensional payoff functions in Markov decision processes, and ask whether a given expected payoff vector can be achieved or not. In general, pure strategies (i.e., not resorting to randomisation) do not suffice for this problem.
  We study the structure of the set of expected payoff vectors of all strategies given a multi-dimensional payoff function and its consequences regarding randomisation requirements for strategies. In particular, we prove that for any payoff for which the expectation is well-defined under all strategies, it is sufficient to mix (i.e., randomly select a pure strategy at the start of a play and committing to it for the rest of the play) finitely many pure strategies to approximate any expected payoff vector up to any precision. Furthermore, for any payoff for which the expected payoff is finite under all strategies, any expected payoff can be obtained exactly by mixing finitely many strategies.</description>

      <title>History of Archimedean and non-Archimedean approaches to uniform processes: Uniformity, symmetry, regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply Nancy Cartwright's distinction between theories and basic models to explore the history of rival approaches to modeling a notion of chance for an ideal uniform physical process known as a fair spinner. This process admits both Archimedean and non-Archimedean models. Advocates of Archimedean models maintain that the fair spinner should satisfy hypotheses such as invariance with respect to rotations by an arbitrary real angle, and assume that the optimal mathematical tool in this context is the Lebesgue measure. Others argue that invariance with respect to all real rotations does not constitute an essential feature of the underlying physical process, and could be relaxed in favor of regularity. We show that, working in ZFC, no subset of the commonly assumed hypotheses determines a unique model, suggesting that physically based intuitions alone are insufficient to pin down a unique mathematical model. We provide a rebuttal of recent criticisms of non-Archimedean models by Parker and Pruss.</description>

      <title>Testing Thresholds and Spectral Properties of High-Dimensional Random Toroidal Graphs via Edgeworth-Style Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study high-dimensional random geometric graphs (RGGs) of edge-density $p$ with vertices uniformly distributed on the $d$-dimensional torus and edges inserted between sufficiently close vertices with respect to an $L_q$-norm. We focus on distinguishing an RGG from an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi (ER) graph if both models have edge probability $p$. So far, most results considered either spherical RGGs with $L_2$-distance or toroidal RGGs under $L_\infty$-distance. However, for general $L_q$-distances, many questions remain open, especially if $p$ is allowed to depend on $n$. The main reason for this is that RGGs under $L_q$-distances can not easily be represented as the logical AND of their 1-dimensional counterparts, as for $L_\infty$ geometries. To overcome this, we devise a novel technique for quantifying the dependence between edges based on modified Edgeworth expansions.
  Our technique yields the first tight algorithmic upper bounds for distinguishing toroidal RGGs under general $L_q$ norms from ER-graphs for fixed $p$ and $q$. We achieve this by showing that signed triangles can distinguish the two models when $d\ll n^3p^3$ for the whole regime of $c/n&lt;p&lt;1$. Additionally, our technique yields an improved information-theoretic lower bound for this task, showing that the two distributions converge whenever $d=\tilde{\Omega}(n^3p^2)$, which is just as strong as the currently best known lower bound for spherical RGGs in case of general $p$ from Liu et al. [STOC'22]. Finally, our expansions allow us to tightly characterize the spectral properties of toroidal RGGs both under $L_q$-distances for fixed $1\le q&lt;\infty$, and $L_\infty$-distance. Our results partially resolve a conjecture of Bangachev and Bresler [COLT'24] and prove that the distance metric, rather than the underlying space, is responsible for the observed differences in the behavior of spherical and toroidal RGGs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a short proof for the exponential equivalence between misanthrope processes in contact with weak reservoirs and those with impermeable boundaries. As a consequence, we can derive both the hydrodynamic limit and the large deviations of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) in contact with weak reservoirs. This extends a recent result which proved the hydrodynamic behaviour of a vanishing viscocity approximation of the TASEP in contact with weak reservoirs. Further applications to a class of asymmetric exclusion processes with long jumps are discussed.</description>

      <title>Geometry and factorization of multivariate Markov chains with applications to the swapping algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12589v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the factorizability and geometry of transition matrices of multivariate Markov chains. Specifically, we demonstrate that the induced chains on factors of a product space can be regarded as information projections with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This perspective yields Han-Shearer type inequalities and submodularity of the entropy rate of Markov chains, as well as applications in the context of large deviations and mixing time comparison. As a concrete algorithmic application, we introduce a projection sampler based on the swapping algorithm, which resamples the highest-temperature coordinate at stationarity at each step. We prove that such practice accelerates the mixing time by multiplicative factors related to the number of temperatures and the dimension of the underlying state space when compared with the original swapping algorithm.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of the generalized Derrida-Retaux recursive model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the max-type recursive model introduced by Hu and Shi (J. Stat. Phys., 2018), which generalizes the model of Derrida and Retaux (J. Stat. Phys., 2014). The class of geometric-type marginal distributions are preserved by the model with geometric offspring distribution. We give some long-time asymptotic expansions of the parameters of the marginal distribution. From the expansions, we derive the asymptotics of the sustainability probability, marginal distribution, first moment and probability generating function.</description>

      <title>First-order Sobolev spaces, self-similar energies and energy measures on the Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06232v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and investigate $(1, p)$-Sobolev space, $p$-energy, and the corresponding $p$-energy measures on the planar Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet for all $p \in (1, \infty)$. Our method is based on the idea of Kusuoka and Zhou [Probab. Theory Related Fields $\textbf{93}$ (1992), no. 2, 169--196], where Brownian motion (the case $p = 2$) on self-similar sets including the planar Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet were constructed. Similar to this earlier work, we use a sequence of discrete graph approximations and the corresponding discrete $p$-energies to define the Sobolev space and $p$-energies. However, we need a new approach to ensure that our $(1, p)$-Sobolev space has a dense set of continuous functions when $p$ is less than the Ahlfors regular conformal dimension. The new ingredients are the use of Loewner type estimates on combinatorial modulus to obtain Poincar\'e inequality and elliptic Harnack inequality on a sequence of approximating graphs. An important feature of our Sobolev space is the self-similarity of our $p$-energy, which allows us to define corresponding $p$-energy measures on the planar Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet. We show that our Sobolev space can also be viewed as a Korevaar-Schoen type space. We apply our results to the attainment problem for Ahlfors regular conformal dimension of the Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet. In particular, we show that if the Ahlfors regular conformal dimension, say $\dim_{\mathrm{ARC}}$, is attained, then any optimal measure which attains $\dim_{\mathrm{ARC}}$ should be comparable with the $\dim_{\mathrm{ARC}}$-energy measure of some function in our $(1, \dim_{\mathrm{ARC}})$-Sobolev space up to a multiplicative constant. In this case, we also prove that the Newton-Sobolev space corresponding to any optimal measure and metric can be identified as our self-similar $(1, \dim_{\mathrm{ARC}})$-Sobolev space.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Regularized Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization with Jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the trade-off between exploitation and exploration in reinforcement learning, we study a continuous-time entropy-regularized mean variance portfolio selection problem in the presence of jumps. We propose an exploratory SDE for the wealth process associated with multiple risky assets which exhibit L\'evy jumps. In contrast to the existing literature, we study the limiting behavior of the natural discrete-time formulation of the wealth process associated to a randomized control in order to derive the continuous-time dynamics. We then show that an optimal distributional control of the continuous-time entropy-regularized exploratory mean-variance problem is Gaussian. The respective optimal wealth process solves a linear SDE whose representation is explicitly obtained.</description>

      <title>Impossibility results for equating the Youden Index with average scoring rules and Tjur $R^2$-like metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05391v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Youden index fas well as measures evaluating predicted probabilities for the maximum-likelihood estimate of a logistic regression model with predictor the classifier. We give impossibility results showing that the Youden index can not equal any average of a real scoring rule nor any metric averaging over binary outcomes (0s and 1s) for any continuous real-valued scoring rule. This shows the obstructions of such potential equivalences and highlights the distinct roles these metrics play in diagnostic assessment.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility of the characteristic polynomials of random tridiagonal matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conditionally on the Riemann hypothesis for certain Dedekind zeta functions, we show that the characteristic polynomial of a class of random tridiagonal matrices of large dimension is irreducible, with probability exponentially close to one; moreover, its Galois group over the rational numbers is either the symmetric or the alternating group. This is the counterpart of the results of Breuillard--Varj\'u (for polynomials with independent coefficients), and with those of Eberhard and Ferber--Jain--Sah--Sawhney (for full random matrices). We also analyse a related class of random tridiagonal matrices for which the Galois group is much smaller.</description>
