      <title>Quantitatively Connecting Experimental Time-Temperature-Superposition-Breakdown of Polymers near the Glass Transition to Dynamic Heterogeneity via the Heterogeneous Rouse Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymers near the glass transition temperature Tg often exhibit a breakdown of time-temperature-superposition (TTS), with chain relaxation times and viscosity exhibiting a weaker temperature dependence than segmental relaxation times. The origin of this onset of thermorheological complexity has remained unsettled and a matter of debate. Here we extend the Heterogeneous Rouse Model (HRM), which generalizes the Rouse model to account for dynamic heterogeneity, to make predictions for the relaxation modulus G(t) and complex modulus G*($\omega$) of unentangled polymers near Tg. The HRM predicts that G(t) and G*($\omega$) exhibit enhanced effective scaling exponents in the Rouse regime in the presence of dynamic heterogeneity, with a more rapid decay from the glassy plateau emerging as the system becomes more dynamically heterogeneous on cooling. This behavior is predicted to emerge from a strand-length dependence of the moment of the segmental mobility distribution probed by chain dynamics. We show that the HRM predictions are in good accord with experimental complex modulus data for polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate), and poly(2-vinyl pyridine). The HRM also predicts the onset of distinct temperature dependences among chain scale quantities such as terminal relaxation time and viscosity in our experimental systems, apparently resolving one of the most significant standing objections to a heterogeneity-based origin of TTS-breakdown. The HRM thus provides a generalized theory of the chain-scale linear rheological response of unentangled polymers near Tg, accounting for the origin of TTS-breakdown at a molecular mechanistic level. It also points towards a new strategy of inferring the dynamic heterogeneity of glass-forming polymeric systems based on the temperature-evolution of modified scaling in the Rouse regime.</description>

      <title>Mermaid Cereal: Interactions and Pattern Formation in a Macroscopic Magnetocapillary SALR System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When particles are deposited at a fluid interface they tend to aggregate by capillary attraction to minimize the overall potential energy of the system. In this work, we embed floating millimetric disks with permanent magnets to introduce a competing repulsion effect and study their pattern formation in equilibrium. The pairwise energy landscape of two disks is described by a short-range attraction and long-range repulsion (SALR) interaction potential, previously documented in a number of microscopic systems. Such competing interactions enable a variety of pairwise equilibrium states, including the possibility of a local minimum energy corresponding to a finite disk spacing. Two-dimensional (2D) experiments and simulations in confined geometries demonstrate that as the areal packing fraction is increased, the dilute repulsion-dominated lattice state becomes unstable to the spontaneous formation of localized clusters, which eventually merge into a system-spanning striped pattern. Finally, we demonstrate that the equilibrium pattern can be externally manipulated by the application of a supplemental vertical magnetic force that remotely enhances the effective capillary attraction.</description>

      <title>The generalised Mooney space for modelling the response of rubber-like materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft materials such as rubbers, silicones, gels and biological tissues have a nonlinear response to large deformations, a phenomenon which in principle can be captured by hyperelastic models. The suitability of a candidate hyperelastic strain energy function is then determined by comparing its predicted response to the data gleaned from tests and adjusting the material parameters to get a good fit, an exercise which can be deceptive because of nonlinearity. Here we propose to generalise the approach of Rivlin and Saunders [Phil Trans A 243 (1951) 251-288] who, instead of reporting the data as stress against stretch, manipulated these measures to create the 'Mooney plot', where the Mooney-Rivlin model is expected to produce a linear fit. We show that extending this idea to other models and modes of deformation (tension, shear, torsion, etc.) is advantageous, not only (a) for the fitting procedure, but also to (b) delineate trends in the deformation which are not obvious from the raw data (and may be interpreted in terms of micro-, meso-, and macro-structures) and (c) obtain a bounded condition number \k{appa} over the whole range of deformation; a robustness which is lacking in other plots and spaces.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous assembly of condensate networks during the demixing of structured fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid-liquid phase separation, whereby two liquids spontaneously demix, is ubiquitous in industrial, environmental, and biological processes. While isotropic fluids are known to condense into spherical droplets in the binodal region, these dynamics are poorly understood for structured fluids. Here, we report the novel observation of condensate networks, which spontaneously assemble during the demixing of a mesogen from a solvent. Condensing mesogens form rapidly-elongating filaments, rather than spheres, to relieve distortion of a simultaneously-forming internal smectic mesophase. As filaments densify, they collapse into bulged discs, lowering the elastic free energy. Additional distortion is relieved by retraction of filaments into the bulged discs, which are straightened under tension to form a ramified network. Understanding and controlling these dynamics may provide new avenues to direct pattern formation or template materials.</description>

      <title>Self-limiting stacks of curvature-frustrated colloidal plates: Roles of intra-particle versus inter-particle deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In geometrically frustrated assemblies local inter-subunit misfits propagate to intra-assembly strain gradients, giving rise to anomalous self-limiting assembly thermodynamics. Here, we use theory and coarse-grained simulation to study a recently developed class of ``curvamer'' particles, flexible shell-like particles that exhibit self-limiting assembly due to the build up of curvature deformation in cohesive stacks. To address a generic, yet poorly understood aspect of frustrated assembly, we introduce a model of curvamer assembly that incorporates both {\it intra-particle} shape deformation as well as compliance of {\it inter-particle} cohesive gaps, an effect we can attribute to a {\it finite range of attraction} between particles. We show that the ratio of intra-particle (bending elasticity) to inter-particle stiffness not only controls the regimes of self-limitation but also the nature of frustration propagation through curvamer stacks. We find a transition from uniformly-bound, curvature-focusing stacks at small size to gap-opened, uniformly curved stacks at large size is controlled by a dimensionless measure of inter- versus intra-curvamer stiffness. The finite range of inter-particle attraction determines range of cohesion in stacks are self-limiting, a prediction which is in strong agreement with numerical studies of our coarse-grained colloidal model. These predictions provide critical guidance for experimental realizations of frustrated particle systems designed to exhibit self-limitation at especially large multi-particle scales.</description>

      <title>Minimal cyclic behavior in sheared amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although jammed packings of soft spheres exist in potential-energy landscapes with a vast number of minima, when subjected to cyclic shear they may revisit the same configurations repeatedly. Simple hysteretic spin models, in which particle rearrangements are represented by spin flips, capture many features of this periodic behavior. Yet it has been unclear to what extent individual rearrangements can be described by such binary objects. Using a particularly sensitive algorithm, we identify rearrangements in simulated jammed packings. We select pairs of rearrangements that undo one another to create periodic cyclic behavior, explore the statistics of these pairs, and show that their internal structure is more complex than a spin analogy would indicate. This offers insight into both the collective nature of rearrangement events themselves and how complex systems such as amorphous solids can reach a limit cycle with relative ease.</description>

      <title>Global self$-$similarity of dense granular flow in hopper: the role of hopper width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of hopper width on the dense granular flow in a two-dimensional hopper is investigated by experiments and simulations. The flow rate remains constant for larger hopper width, while a slight decrease of hopper width results in a significant increase in the flow rate for smaller hopper width. Both Beverloo's and Janda's formula are found to describe relation between the flow rate and outlet size well. The flow properties exhibit a local self$-$similarity supporting the arguments of the Beverloo's and Janda's hypotheses. Importantly, global self$-$similarity is observed, indicating a flow state transition between the mass flow in the regions far form the outlet and the funnel flow in the regions around the outlet. A reduction in silo width leads to a significant increase of grain velocity and a decrease in the transition height, resulting in an increase of flow rate. The results, including flow rate, grain velocity, and transition height, can be described in an exponential formula with respect to the silo width.</description>

      <title>Jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in amorphous materials sheared by cyclic quasistatic deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jamming is an athermal transition between flowing and rigid states in amorphous systems such as granular matter, colloidal suspensions, complex fluids and cells. The jamming transition seems to display mixed aspects of a first-order transition, evidenced by a discontinuity in the coordination number, and a second-order transition, indicated by power-law scalings and diverging lengths. Here we demonstrate that jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in cyclically sheared systems with quasistatic deformations. Particle models are simulated in two and three dimensions, which undergo reversible-irreversible transitions under cyclic shear. The ensemble of configurations, with partially crystallized and fragile states excluded, is generated in the irreversible phase, where the system is stationary and particles are diffusive. Detailed scaling analyses are performed on the distribution of coordination numbers. The fluctuation of the jamming density in finite-sized systems has important consequences on the finite-size effects of various quantities, resulting in a square relationship between disconnected and connected susceptibilities, a key signature of first-order transitions with quenched disorder. This study puts the jamming transition into the category of a broad class of transitions in disordered systems, including the first-order transition in the random-field Ising model, brittle yielding of amorphous materials, and melting of ultra-stable glasses.</description>

      <title>Identification of local structures in water from supercooled to ambient conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of water thermodynamics have long been tied to the identification of two distinct families of local structures, whose competition could explain the origin of the many thermodynamic anomalies and of the hypothesized liquid-liquid critical point in water. Despite the many successes and insights gained, the structural indicators proposed throughout the years were not able to unequivocally identify these two families over a wide range of conditions. We show that a recently introduced indicator, $\Psi$, which exploits information on the HB network connectivity, can reliably identify these two distinct local environments over a wide range of thermodynamic conditions (188 to 300 K and 0 to 13 kbar), and that close to the liquid-liquid critical point the spatial correlations of density fluctuations are identical to those of the $\Psi$ indicator. Our results strongly support the idea that water thermodynamic properties arise from the competition between two distinct and identifiable local environments.</description>

      <title>Calorimetric evidence for the existence of an intermediate phase between the ferroelectric nematic phase and the nematic phase in the liquid crystal RM734</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea that rod-like molecules possessing an electric dipole moment could exhibit a ferroelectric nematic phase was suggested more than a century ago. However, only recently such a phase has been reported for two quite different liquid crystals: RM734 (4-[(4-nitrophenoxy)carbonyl)]phenyl 2,4-dimethoxybenzoate) and DIO (2.3',4',5'-tetrafluoro[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl 2.6-difluoro-4-(5-propyl-1,3-dioxan-2-yl) benzoate). For RM734 a direct ferroelectric nematic (NF) to classical nematic N transition was reported, whereas for DIO an intermediate phase Nx was discovered between the NF and the N phases. Here we present high-resolution calorimetric evidence that an intermediate Nx phase also exists in RM734 along a narrow temperature range between the NF and the N phases.</description>

      <title>Polar Nematic Phases with Enantiotropic Ferro- and Antiferroelectric Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of a new ferroelectric nematic (NF) liquid crystalline phase became of utmost interest for the liquid crystal (LC) and the whole soft and condensed matter fields. Contrary to the previously known ferroelectric LC materials, whose ferroelectric characteristics were much weaker, new polar nematics exhibit properties comparable to solid ferroelectrics. This discovery brought about tremendous efforts to further explore compounds showing these phases, and fascinating physical properties have been reported. Herein, we present the first synthesized compounds with the enantiotropic ferro- (NF) and antiferroelectric (NX) nematic phases. The enantiotropic nature and an unprecedentedly broad temperature range of NF and NX phases are confirmed by various experimental techniques: polarized-light optical microscopy (POM) observations, different scanning calorimetry (DSC), dielectric spectroscopy, second harmonic generation (SHG), and molecular modeling. The presented achievements in designing achiral compounds that exhibit enantiotropic polar nematic phases with ferro- and antiferroelectric properties significantly contribute to the development of multicomponent mixtures with a broad temperature range of NF and NX phases down to room temperature. Furthermore, this accomplishment considerably enhances the general understanding of the structural correlations that promote polar nematic liquid crystal phases with high thermodynamic stability. Finally, this work may benefit various applications in photonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scaling behavior of Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes in the ordered phase of the Vicsek model, introducing a phenomenological equation of motion (EOM) incorporating a previously overlooked non-linear term. This term arises from the interaction between velocity fields and density fluctuations, leading to new scaling behaviors. We derive exact scaling exponents in two dimensions, which reproduce the isotropic scaling behavior reported in a prior numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Effective extensional-torsional elasticity and dynamics of helical filaments under distributed loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study slender, helical elastic rods subject to distributed forces and moments. Focussing on the case when the helix axis remains straight, we employ the method of multiple scales to systematically derive an 'effective-column' theory from the Kirchhoff rod equations: the helical filament is described as a naturally-straight rod (aligned with the helix axis) for which the extensional and torsional deformations are coupled. Importantly, our analysis is asymptotically exact in the limit of a 'highly-coiled' filament (i.e., when the helical wavelength is much smaller than the characteristic lengthscale over which the filament bends due to external loading) and is able to account for large, unsteady displacements. In the small-deformation limit, we exactly recover the coupled wave equations used to describe the free vibrations of helical coil springs, thereby justifying previous effective-column approximations in which linearised stiffness coefficients are assumed to apply locally and dynamically. We then illustrate our theory with two loading scenarios: (I) a heavy helical rod deforming under its own weight; and (II) the dynamics of axial rotation (twirling) in viscous fluid, which may be considered as a simple model for a bacteria flagellar filament. More broadly, our analysis provides a framework to develop reduced models of helical rods in a wide variety of physical and biological settings, and yields analytical insight into their elastic instabilities. In particular, our analysis indicates that tensile instabilities are a generic phenomenon when helical rods are subject to a combination of distributed forces and moments.</description>

      <title>A genetic algorithm for the response of twisted nematic liquid crystals to an applied field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When an external field is applied across a liquid-crystal cell, the twist and tilt distributions cannot be calculated analytically and must be extracted numerically. In the standard approach, the Euler-Lagrange equations are derived from the minimization of the free energy of the system and then solved via finite-difference methods, often implemented in commercial software. These tools iterate from initial solutions that are compatible with the boundary conditions, providing limited to no flexibility for customization. Here, we present a genetic algorithm that outputs fast and accurate solutions to the integral form of the equations. In our approach, the evolutionary routine is sequentially applied at each position within the bulk of the cell, thus overcoming the necessity of assuming trial solutions. The predictions of our routine strongly support the experimental observations on different instances of spatially varying twisted nematic liquid-crystal cells, patterned with different topologies on the two alignment layers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how two finite-amplitude, transverse, plane body waves may be superposed to propagate in a deformed hyperelastic incompressible solid. We find that the equations of motion reduce to a well-determined system of partial differential equations, making the motion controllable for all solids. We find that in deformed Mooney-Rivlin materials, they may travel along any direction and be polarised along any transverse direction, an extension of a result by Boulanger and Hayes [Quart. J. Mech. Appl. Math. 45 (1992) 575]. Furthermore, their motion is governed by a linear system of partial differential equations, making the Mooney-Rivlin special in that respect. We select another model to show that for other materials, the equations are nonlinear. We use asymptotic equations to reveal the onset of nonlinearity for the waves, paying particular attention to how close the propagation direction is to the principal axes of pre-deformation.</description>

Abstract: We study the statistical properties of the variation of the kinetic energy of a spherical Brownian particle that freely moves in an incompressible fluid at constant temperature. Based on the underdamped version of the generalized Langevin equation that includes the inertia of both the particle and the displaced fluid, we derive an analytical expression for the probability density function of such a kinetic energy variation during an arbitrary time interval, which exactly amounts to the energy exchanged with the fluid in absence of external forces. We also determine all the moments of this probability distribution, which can be fully expressed in terms of a function that is proportional to the velocity autocorrelation function of the particle. The derived expressions are verified by means of numerical simulations of the stochastic motion of a particle in a viscous liquid with hydrodynamic backflow for representative values of the time-scales of the system. Furthermore, we also investigate the effect of viscoelasticity on the statistics of the kinetic energy variation of the particle, which reveals the existence of three distinct regimes of the energy exchange process depending on the values of the viscoelastic parameters of the fluid.</description>

      <title>Cell sorting by active forces in a phase-field model of cell monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell sorting, the segregation of cells with different properties into distinct domains, is a key phenomenon in biological processes such as embryogenesis. We use a phase-field model of a confluent cell layer to study the role of activity in cell sorting. We find that a mixture of cells with extensile or contractile dipolar activity, and which are identical apart from their activity, quickly sort into small, elongated patches which then grow slowly in time. We interpret the sorting as driven by the different diffusivity of the extensile and contractile cells, mirroring the ordering of Brownian particles connected to different hot and cold thermostats. We check that the free energy is not changed by either partial or complete sorting, thus confirming that activity can be responsible for the ordering even in the absence of thermodynamic mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Color-switching hydrogels as integrated microfluidic pressure sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precisely measuring pressure in microfluidic flows is essential for flow control, fluid characterization, and monitoring, but faces specific challenges such as \RE{achieving} sufficient resolution, non-invasiveness, or ease of use. Here, we demonstrate a fully integrated multiplexed optofluidic pressure sensor, entirely decoupled from the flow path, that enables local pressure measurements along any microfluidic channel without altering its flow geometry. The sensor itself relies on the compression of a soft mechano-actuated hydrogel, changing color in response to a pressure change. The hydrogel is separated from the fluid circulating in the channel by a thin membrane, allowing for the unrestricted use of different types of fluids. Imaging the gel through the transparent PDMS with a color camera provides a direct, easy, and contact-free determination of the fluid pressure at the sensing location for pressures as small as \SI{20}{\milli\bar} with a resolution of around \SI{10}{\milli\bar}. The sensitivity and accessible pressure range can be tuned via the mechanical properties \RE{of the sensing unit}. The photonic gel can also be used to acquire 2D pressure or deformation maps, taking advantage of the fast response time and fine spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Oriented artificial nanofibers and laser induced periodic surface structures as substrates for Schwann cells alignment</title>

Abstract: People with injuries to the peripheral nervous system, due to its poor functional regeneration, suffer from paralysis of the facial muscles, fingers and hands, or toes and feet, often for the rest of their lives. Therefore, to improve patients' quality of life, there is an urgent need for conduits that effectively support the healing of large defects in nerve pathways through specific guidance of nerve cells. This paper describes two specific methods for achieving directed growth of Schwann cells, a type of glial cells that can support the regeneration of the nerve pathway by guiding the neuronal axons in the direction of their alignment. One method implies the exposure of a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) foil to a KrF* laser beam, that renders a nanorippled surface topography. The other method uses aligned polyamide-6 (PA-6) nanofibers produced via electrospinning on a very fast rotating structured collector, which enables easy nanofiber detachment, without additional effort. Schwann cells growth on these substrates was inspected after one week of cultivation by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM). For both methods we show that Schwann cells grow in a certain direction, predetermined by nanoripples and nanofibers orientation. In contrast, cells cultivated onto unstructured surfaces or randomly oriented nanofibers, show an omnidirectional growth behavior.</description>

      <title>Shaping active matter from crystalline solids to active turbulence</title>

Abstract: Active matter drives its constituent agents to move autonomously by harnessing free energy, leading to diverse emergent states with relevance to both biological processes and inanimate functionalities. Achieving maximum reconfigurability of active materials with minimal control remains a desirable yet challenging goal. Here, we employ large-scale, agent-resolved simulations to demonstrate that modulating the activity of a wet phoretic medium alone can govern its solid-liquid-gas phase transitions and, subsequently, laminar-turbulent transitions in fluid phases, thereby shaping its emergent pattern. These two progressively emerging transitions, hitherto unreported, bring us closer to perceiving the parallels between active matter and traditional matter. Our work reproduces and reconciles seemingly conflicting experimental observations on chemically active systems, presenting a unified landscape of phoretic collective dynamics. These findings enhance the understanding of long-range, many-body interactions among phoretic agents, offer new insights into their non-equilibrium collective behaviors, and provide potential guidelines for designing reconfigurable materials.</description>

      <title>Clustering of chemically propelled nanomotors in chemically active environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic nanomotors powered by chemical reactions have been designed to act as vehicles for active cargo transport, drug delivery as well as a variety of other uses. Collections of such motors, acting in consort, can self-assemble to form swarms or clusters, providing opportunities for applications on various length scales. While such collective behavior has been studied when the motors move in a chemically inactive fluid environment, when the medium in which they move is a chemical network that supports complex spatial and temporal patterns, through simulation and theoretical analysis we show that collective behavior changes. Spatial patterns in the environment can guide and control motor collective states, and interactions of the motors with their environment can give rise to distinctive spatiotemporal motor patterns. The results are illustrated by studies of the motor dynamics in systems that support Turing patterns and spiral waves. This work is relevant for potential applications that involve many active nanomotors moving in complex chemical or biological environments.</description>

      <title>Reentrant condensation of sparsely charged polyelectrolytes induced by diluted multivalent salts: Interplay between electrostatic and non-electrostatic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the reentrant condensation of sparsely charged polyelectrolytes in dilute solutions of small multivalent ions, whose phase-transition mechanism remains under debate. Motivated by recent simulation results reported by the Caltech group on phase behaviors of polyelectrolyte in aqueous solutions of multivalent salts (DOIs: 10.1021/acs.macromol.3c02437 and 10.48550/arXiv.2311.11404), we propose a simple mean-field model by recasting the concept of cosolute-assisted "physical crosslinking" effect, which can predict the essential features of the reentrant condensation including the phase diagram of sparsely charged polyelectrolyte. The model unveils that the strong adsorption between the ionic monomers and multivalent ions can be at the origin of the peculiar phenomenon that rather low concentrations of multivalent salts trigger both collapse and re-entry transitions. The analytical solution of the model indicates that a minimum of coupling energy due to sharing multivalent salt ions between ionic monomers is essential for a phase transition to occur, which can explain the enigmatic observation that the sparsely charged polyelectrolytes can only show phase transition in a dilute solution of salts with selective multivalency. Our analytical calculations also show that the incompatibility of the uncharged moieties of the polyelectrolytes with solvent (water) is critical to regulate phase behaviors of sparsely charged polyelectrolytes in aqueous solutions. This is in agreement with recent experimental investigations on solution properties of amphiphilic proteins. We envisage that this work will shed light on the understanding of reentrant condensation in biological processes where the multivalent ions bound to biopolymers (such as RNAs and proteins) plays an essential role, which remains unclear and being debated.</description>

      <title>Saturation and multifractality of Lagrangian and Eulerian scaling exponents in 3D isotropic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inertial range scaling exponents for both Lagrangian and Eulerian structure functions are obtained from direct numerical simulations of isotropic turbulence in triply periodic domains at Taylor-scale Reynolds number up to 1300. We reaffirm that transverse Eulerian scaling exponents saturate at $\approx 2.1$ for moment orders $p \ge 10$, significantly differing from the longitudinal exponents (which are predicted to saturate at $\approx 7.3$ for $p \ge 30$ from a recent theory). The Lagrangian scaling exponents likewise saturate at $\approx 2$ for $p \ge 8$. The saturation of Lagrangian exponents and transverse Eulerian exponents is related by the same multifractal spectrum by utilizing the well known frozen hypothesis to relate spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, this spectrum is different from the known spectra for Eulerian longitudinal exponents, suggesting that that Lagrangian intermittency is characterized solely by transverse Eulerian intermittency. We discuss possible implication of this outlook when extending multifractal predictions to the dissipation range, especially for Lagrangian acceleration.</description>
