      <title>A generalization of the hexastix arrangement to higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexastix is an arrangement of non-overlapping infinite hexagonal prisms in four different directions that cover $\frac{3}{4}$ of space. We consider a possible generalization to $n$ dimensions, based on the permutohedral lattice $A^*_n$. The central lines of the generalized prisms are going to be oriented in $n+1$ different directions (parallel to the shortest non-zero vectors of $A^*_n$). The projection of the lines oriented in any direction along that direction to a hyperplane perpendicular to it is required to be a translation of the corresponding projection of $A^*_n$, and the minimal distance between lines oriented in any two given directions should be maximal. It is shown that this is possible if $n$ is a prime power. Also, the proportion of $n$-space that is covered is calculated for $n \in \{4, 5\}$, and an alternative generalization is briefly considered.</description>

      <title>Finite Vertex-colored Ultrahomogeneous Oriented Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relational structure R is ultrahomogeneous if every isomorphism of finite induced substructures of R extends to an automorphism of R. We classify the ultrahomogeneous finite binary relational structures with one asymmetric binary relation and arbitrarily many unary relations. In other words, we classify the finite vertex-colored oriented ultrahomogeneous graphs. The classification comprises several general methods with which directed graphs can be combined or extended to create new ultrahomogeneous graphs. Together with explicitly given exceptions, we obtain exactly all vertex-colored oriented ultrahomogeneous graphs this way. Our main technique is a technical tool that characterizes precisely under which conditions two binary relational structures with disjoint unary relations can be combined to form a larger ultrahomogeneous structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a sufficient condition on a positive integer $m$ for every stratum of a given real toric hyperplane arrangement to contain a rational point of denominator $m$. As a consequence, we give a sufficient condition on $m$ for the degree $m$ Frobenius pushforward of the structure sheaf on a smooth toric variety to contain all possible summands in the Picard group.</description>

      <title>On the spectral radius of unbalanced signed bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A signed graph is one that features two types of edges: positive and negative. Balanced signed graphs are those in which all cycles contain an even number of positive edges. In the adjacency matrix of a signed graph, entries can be $0$, $-1$, or $1$, depending on whether $ij$ represents no edge, a negative edge, or a positive edge, respectively. The index of the adjacency matrix of a signed graph $\dot{G}$ is less or equal to the index of the adjacency matrix of its underlying graph $G$, i.e., $\lambda_1(\dot{G}) \le \lambda_1(G)$. Indeed, if $\dot{G}$ is balanced, then $\lambda_1(\dot{G})=\lambda_1(G)$. This inequality becomes strict when $\dot{G}$ is an unbalanced signed graph. Recently, Brunetti and Stani\'c found the whole list of unbalanced signed graphs on $n$ vertices with maximum (resp. minimum) spectral radius. To our knowledge, there has been little research on this problem when unbalanced signed graphs are confined to specific graph classes. In this article, we demonstrate that there is only one unbalanced signed bipartite graph on $n$ vertices with maximum spectral radius, up to an operation on the signed edges known as switching. Additionally, we investigate unbalanced signed complete bipartite graphs on $n$ vertices with a bounded number of edges and maximum spectral radius, where the negative edges induce a tree.</description>

      <title>Singularly cospectral circulant graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two graphs having the same spectrum are said to be cospectral. Two graphs such that the absolute values of their nonzero eigenvalues coincide are singularly cospectral graphs. Cospectrality implies singular cospectrality, but the converse may be false. In this paper, we present sufficient conditions for two circulant graphs, with an even number of vertices, to be noncospectral singularly cospectral graphs. In this analysis, we study when a pair of these graphs have the same or distinct inertia. In addition, we show that two singularly cospectral circulant graphs with an odd prime number of vertices are isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Some $q$-supercongruences for multiple basic hypergeometric series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In terms of several summation and transformation formulas for basic hypergeometric series, two forms of the Chinese remainder theorem for coprime polynomials, the creative microscoping method introduced by Guo and Zudilin, Guo and Li's lemma, and El Bachraoui's lemma, we establish some $q$-supercongruences for multiple basic hypergeometric series modulo the fifth and sixth powers of a cyclotomic polynomial. In detail, we generalize Guo and Li's two $q$-supercongruences for double basic hypergeometric series, which are related to $q$-analogues of Van Hamme's (C.2) supercongruence and Long's supercongruence, respectively. In addition, we also present two conclusions for double and triple hypergeometric series associated with Van Hamme's (D.2) supercongruence.</description>

      <title>On the Min-Max Star Partitioning Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel star partitioning problem for simple connected graphs $G=(V,E)$. The goal is to find a partition of the edges into stars that minimizes the maximum number of stars a node is contained in while simultaneously satisfying node-specific capacities. We design and analyze an efficient polynomial time algorithm with a runtime of $\mathcal{O}(|E|^2)$ that determines an optimal partition. Moreover, we explicitly provide a closed form of an optimal value for some graph classes. We generalize our algorithm to find even an optimal star partition of linear hypergraphs, multigraphs, and graphs with self-loop. We use flow techniques to design an algorithm for the star partitioning problem with an improved runtime of $\mathcal{O}(\log(\Delta) \cdot |E| \cdot \min\{|V|^{\frac{2}{3}},|E|^{\frac{1}{2}}\})$, where $\Delta$ is maximum node degree in $G$. In contrast to the unweighted setting, we show that a node-weighted decision variant of this problem is \texttt{strongly NP-complete} even without capacity constraints. Furthermore, we provide an extensive comparison to the problem of minimizing the minimum indegree satisfying node capacity constraints.</description>

      <title>Partition of Abelian groups into zero-sum sets by complete mappings and its application to the existence of a magic rectangle set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete mapping of a group $\Gamma$ is a bijection $\varphi\colon \Gamma\to \Gamma$ for which the mapping $x \mapsto x+\varphi(x)$ is a bijection. In this paper we consider the existence of a complete mapping $\varphi$ of $\Gamma$ and a partition $S_1,S_2,\ldots S_t$ of elements of $\Gamma$, such that $\sum_{s\in S_i}s=\sum_{s\in S_i}\varphi(s)=0$ for every $i$, $1 \leq i \leq t$.
  A $\Gamma$-magic rectangle set $MRS_{\Gamma}(a, b; c)$ of order $abc$ is a collection of $c$ arrays $(a\times b)$ whose entries are elements of group $\Gamma$ of order $abc$, each appearing once, with all row sums in every rectangle equal to a constant $\omega\in \Gamma$ and all column sums in every rectangle equal to a constant $\delta \in \Gamma$.
  While a complete characterization of MRS$_\Gamma(a,b;c)$ exists for cases where $\{a,b\}\not=\{2k+1,2^{\alpha}\}$, the scenario where $\{a,b\}=\{2k+1,2^{\alpha}\}$ remains unsolved for $\alpha&gt;1$. Using the partition of $\Gamma$ into zero-sum sets by complete mappings, we give some sufficient conditions that a $\Gamma$-magic rectangle set MRS$_{\Gamma}(2k+1, 2^{\alpha};c)$ exists.</description>

      <title>The Parametric Matroid $\ell$-Interdiction Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the parametric matroid $\ell$-interdiction problem, where $\ell\in\mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}$ is a fixed number of elements allowed to be interdicted. Each element of the matroid's ground set is assigned a weight that depends linearly on a real parameter from a given interval. The goal is to compute, for each possible parameter value, a set of $\ell$-most vital elements with corresponding objective value the deletion of which causes a maximum increase of the weight of a minimal basis. We show that such a set, which of course depends on the parameter, can only change polynomially often if the parameter varies. We develop several exact algorithms to solve the problem that have polynomial running times if an independence test can be performed in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Clique structure and other network properties of the tensor product of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the number of cliques of given size and the size of the largest clique in tensor product $G \times H$ of two Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $G$ and $H$. Then an extended clustering coefficient is introduced and is studied for $G \times H$. Restriction to the standard clustering coefficient has a direct relation to the local efficiency of the graph, and the results are also interpreted in terms of the efficiency. As a last statistic of interest, the number of isolated vertices is analyzed for $G \times H$. The paper is concluded with a discussion of the modular product of random graphs, and the relation to the maximum common subgraph problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the work of Fr\"oberg (1990) and Eagon and Reiner (1998), Bayer et al. recently introduced two new graph complexes: total cut complexes and cut complexes. In this article, we investigate these complexes specifically for (rectangular) grid graphs, focusing on $2 \times n$ and $3 \times n$ cases. We extend and refine the work of Bayer et al., proving and strengthening several of their conjectures, thereby enhancing the understanding of the topological and combinatorial properties of these graph complexes.</description>

Abstract: The balancing index of a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is the least positive sum of coefficients in an integer linear combination of permuted copies of $f$ which produces a symmetric polynomial.

      <title>Gamma vectors as inverted Chebyshev expansions, type A to B transformations, and connections to algebraic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a reciprocal/palindromic polynomial of even degree, we show that the gamma vector is essentially given by an inverted Chebyshev polynomial basis expansion. As an immediate consequence, we characterize real-rootedness of a linear combination of Chebyshev polynomials in terms of real-rootedness of that of the reciprocal polynomial built out of an inverted scaled tuple of the coefficients with one fixed and the rest divided by 2. It can be taken as a counterpart to a recent result of Bel-Afia--Meroni--Telen on hyperbolicity of Chebyshev curves with respect to the origin. Apart from this, the inverted Chebyshev expansion also yields connections between intrinsic properties of the gamma vector construction and the geometric combinatorics of simplicial complexes and posets.
  We find this by applying work of Hetyei on Tchebyshev subdivisions and Tchebyshev posets. In particular, we find that the gamma vector transformation is closely related to $f$-vectors of simplicial complexes resulting from successive edge subdivisions that transform the type A Coxeter complex to the type B Coxeter complex. Lifting to this to the level of $ce$-indices (a modification of $cd$-indices), we show that the gamma vector inverted Chebyshev polynomial expansion lifts to a sum of $ce$-indices of cross polytope triangulations which can be computed using descent statistics involving edge labelings of maximal chains. While there are many examples in the literature where gamma positivity involving descent statistics, it is interesting to note that we have this without initial structural assumptions on the input polynomial apart from being reciprocal/palindromic. Finally, we note that all of these can be repeated with Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind after taking derivatives and that this gives connections to Hopf algebras and quasisymmetric functions.</description>

      <title>A logical limit law for the sequential model of preferential attachment graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a sequence of random graphs, the limit law we refer to is the existence of a limiting probability of any graph property that can be expressed in terms of predicate logic. A zero-one limit law is shown by Shelah and Spencer for Erd\"{o}s-Renyi graphs given that the connection rate has an irrational exponent. We show a limit law for preferential attachment graphs which admit a P\'{o}lya urn representation. The two extreme cases of the parametric model, the uniform attachment graph and the sequential Barab\'{a}si-Albert model, are covered separately as they exhibit qualitative differences regarding the distribution of cycles of bounded length in the graph.</description>

      <title>Probability graphons and P-variables: two equivalent viewpoints for dense weighted graph limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop further the graph limit theory for dense weighted graph sequences. In particular, we consider probability graphons, which have recently appeared in graph limit theory as continuum representations of weighted graphs, and we introduce P-variables, which also appear in the context of the Aldous-Hoover theorem for exchangeable infinite random arrays, as an alternative continuum representation for weighted graphs. In particular, we explain how P-variables are related to probability graphons in a similar way in which random variables are related to probability measures. We define a metric for P-variables (inspired by action convergence in the graph limit theory of sparse graph sequences) and show that convergence of P-variables in this metric is equivalent to probability graphons convergence. We exploit this equivalence to translate several results from the theory of probability graphons to P-variables. In addition, we prove several properties of P-variables convergence, thus showing new properties also for probability graphons convergence and demonstrating the power of the connection between probability graphons and P-variables. Furthermore, we show how P-variables convergence can be easily modified and generalised to cover other combinatorial structures such as bipartite graphs and hypergraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two equally long, uniformly random binary strings, the expected length of their longest common subsequence (LCS) is asymptotically proportional to the strings' length. Finding the proportionality coefficient $\gamma$, i.e. the limit of the normalised LCS length for two random binary strings of length $n \to \infty$, is a very natural problem, first posed by Chv\'atal and Sankoff in 1975, and as yet unresolved. This problem has relevance to diverse fields ranging from combinatorics and algorithm analysis to coding theory and computational biology. Using methods of statistical mechanics, as well as some existing results on the combinatorial structure of LCS, we link constant $\gamma$ to the parameters of a certain stochastic particle process, which we use to obtain a new estimate for $\gamma$.</description>

Abstract: The analogue of Hadwiger's conjecture for the immersion relation states that every graph $G$ contains an immersion of $K_{\chi(G)}$. For graphs with independence number 2, this is equivalent to stating that every such $n$-vertex graph contains an immersion of $K_{\lceil n/2 \rceil}$. We show that every $n$-vertex graph with independence number 2 contains every complete bipartite graph on $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ vertices as an immersion.</description>

More strongly, we prove that for two distinct edges $e$ and $f$ sharing a common end, it has a Hamiltonian cycle using $e$ and avoiding $f$ unless it has at most two vertices or it is a cycle of length at most four. We also prove that if the basis graph is not a hypercube graph, then each vertex belongs to cycles of every length $\ell\ge 3$, and each edge belongs to cycles of every length $\ell \ge 4$. For the last theorem, we provide two proofs, one of which uses the result of Naddef (1984) on polytopes and the result of Chepoi (2007) on basis graphs of even delta-matroids, and the other is a direct proof using various properties of even delta-matroids. Our theorems generalize the analogous results for matroids by Holzmann and Harary (1972) and Bondy and Ingleton (1976).</description>

      <title>On the maximum second eigenvalue of outerplanar graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a fixed positive integer $k$ and a graph $G$, let $\lambda_k(G)$ denote the $k$-th largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of $G$. In 2017, Tait and Tobin proved that the maximum $\lambda_1(G)$ among all outerplanar graphs on $n$ vertices is achieved by the fan graph $K_1\vee P_{n-1}$. In this paper, we consider a similar problem of determining the maximum $\lambda_2$ among all connected outerplanar graphs on $n$ vertices. For $n$ even and sufficiently large, we prove that the maximum $\lambda_2$ is uniquely achieved by the graph $(K_1\vee P_{n/2-1})\!\!-\!\!(K_1\vee P_{n/2-1})$, which is obtained by connecting two disjoint copies of $(K_1\vee P_{n/2-1})$ through a new edge joining their smallest degree vertices. When $n$ is odd and sufficiently large, the extremal graphs are not unique. The extremal graphs are those graphs $G$ that contain a cut vertex $u$ such that $G\setminus \{u\}$ is isomorphic to $2(K_1\vee P_{n/2-1})$. We also determine the maximum $\lambda_2$ among all 2-connected outerplanar graphs and asymptotically determine the maximum of $\lambda_k(G)$ among all connected outerplanar graphs for any fixed $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given integers $n &gt; k &gt; 0$, and a set of integers $L \subset [0, k-1]$, an \emph{$L$-system} is a family of sets $\mathcal{F} \subset \binom{[n]}{k}$ such that $|F \cap F'| \in L$ for distinct $F, F'\in \mathcal{F}$. $L$-systems correspond to independent sets in a certain generalized Johnson graph $G(n, k, L)$, so that the maximum size of an $L$-system is equivalent to finding the independence number of the graph $G(n, k, L)$. The \emph{Lov\'asz number} $\vartheta(G)$ is a semidefinite programming approximation of the independence number $\alpha$ of a graph $G$.
  In this paper, we determine the leading order term of $\vartheta(G(n, k, L))$ of any generalized Johnson graph with $k$ and $L$ fixed and $n\rightarrow \infty$. As an application of this theorem, we give an explicit construction of a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with a large gap between the Lov\'asz number and the Shannon capacity $c(G)$. Specifically, we prove that for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, for infinitely many $n$ there is a generalized Johnson graph $G$ on $n$ vertices which has ratio $\vartheta(G)/c(G) = \Omega(n^{1-\epsilon})$, which improves on all known constructions. The graph $G$ \textit{a fortiori} also has ratio $\vartheta(G)/\alpha(G) = \Omega(n^{1-\epsilon})$, which greatly improves on the best known explicit construction.</description>

      <title>Paired coalition in graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10842v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \noindent A paired coalition in a graph $G=(V,E)$ consists of two disjoint sets of vertices $V_1$ and $V_2$, neither of which is a paired dominating set but whose union $V_1 \cup V_2$ is a paired dominating set. A paired coalition partition (abbreviated $pc$-partition) in a graph $G$ is a vertex partition $\pi= \lbrace V_1,V_2,\dots ,V_k \rbrace$ such that each set $V_i$ of $\pi$ is not a paired dominating set but forms a paired coalition with another set $V_j \in \pi$. The paired coalition graph $PCG(G,\pi) $ of the graph $G$ and the $pc$-partition $\pi$ of $G$, is the graph whose vertices correspond one-to-one with the sets of $\pi$, and two vertices $V_i$ and $V_j$ are adjacent in $PCG(G,\pi) $ if and only if their corresponding sets $V_i$ and $V_j$ form a paired coalition in $G$. In this paper, we initiate the study of paired coalition partitions and paired coalition graphs. In particular, we determine the paired coalition number of paths and cycles, obtain some results on paired coalition partitions in trees and characterize pair coalition graphs of paths, cycles and trees. We also characterize triangle-free graphs $G$ with $PC(G)=n$ and unicyclic graphs $G$ with $PC(G)=n-2$.</description>

Abstract: In [On $IP^{\star}$sets and central sets, Combinatorica, 14 (1994) 269-277], N. Hindman and V.Bergelson proved additive $IP^{\star}$-sets contain finite sums and finite products of a single sequence. An analogous study was made by A. Sisto in [Exponential triples, Electronics Journal of Combinatorics, 18 (2011), no. 147], where he proved that multiplicative $IP^{\star}$-sets contain exponential $IP$ of type $I$ and finite sums of a single sequence as well as exponential $IP$ of type $II$ and finite products of another single sequence,
  using the algebra in the Stone-\v{C}ech Compactification of discrete semigroups. In this article, we will provide a combinatorial proof of the result of A. Sisto.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a set F of finite tournaments, the F-free orientation problem is the problem of orienting a given finite undirected graph in such a way that the resulting oriented graph does not contain any member of F. Using the theory of smooth approximations, we give a new shorter proof of the complexity dichotomy for such problems obtained recently by Bodirsky and Guzm\'{a}n-Pro. In fact, our approach yields a complexity dichotomy for a considerably larger class of computational problems where one is given an undirected graph along with additional local constraints on the allowed orientations. Moreover, the border between tractable and hard problems is described by a decidable algebraic condition.</description>

      <title>New Strongly Regular Graphs Found via Local Search for Partial Difference Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly regular graphs (SRGs) are highly symmetric combinatorial objects, with connections to many areas of mathematics including finite fields, finite geometries, and number theory. One can construct an SRG via the Cayley Graph of a regular partial difference set (PDS). Local search is a common class of search algorithm that iteratively adjusts a state to (locally) minimize an error function. In this work, we use local search to find PDSs. We found PDSs with 62 different parameter values in 1254 nonisomorphic groups of orders at most 147. Many of these PDSs replicate known results. In two cases, (144,52,16,20) and (147,66,25,33), the PDSs found give the first known construction of SRGs with these parameters. In some other cases, the SRG was already known but a PDS in that group was unknown. This work also corroborates the existence of (64,18,2,6) PDSs in precisely 73 groups of order 64.</description>

      <title>The finite products of shifted primes and Moreira's Theorem</title>

Abstract: Let $r\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}=\bigcup_{i=1}^{r}C_{i}$. Do there exist $x,y\in\mathbb{N}$ and $i\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,r\right\}$ such that $\left\{x,y,xy,x+y\right\}\subseteq C_{i}$? This is still an unanswered question asked by N. Hindman. Joel Moreira in [J. Moreira, Monochromatic sums and products in N, Annals of Mathematics 185 (2017) 1069-1090] established a partial answer to this question and proved that for infinitely many $x,y\in\mathbb{N}$, $\left\{x,xy,x+y\right\}\subseteq C_{i}$ for some $i\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,r\right\}$, which is called Moreira's Theorem. Recently, H. Hindman and D. Strauss established a refinement of Moreira's Theorem and proved that for infinitely many $y$, $\left\{x\in\mathbb{N}:\left\{x,xy,x+y\right\}\subseteq C_{i}\right\}$ is a piecewise syndetic set. In this article, we will prove infinitely many $y\in FP\left(\mathbb{P}-1\right)$ and $FP\left(\mathbb{P}+1\right)$ such that $\left\{x\in\mathbb{N}:\left\{xy,x+f(y):f\in F\right\}\subseteq C_{i}\right\}$ is piecewise syndetic, where $F$ is a finite subset of $x\mathbb{Z}\left[x\right]$. $\mathbb{P}$ is the set of prime numbers in $\mathbb{N}$ and $FP\left(\mathbb{P}-1\right)$ is the set of all finite products of distinct elements of $\mathbb{P}-1$.</description>

The distributions of the simple random walks on the two Cayley graphs Cay(G, S1) and Cay(G, S2) are the same at an arbitrary specified moment of time, under a permutation of the vertices. 2. The Spectra of Cay(G, Si) is decomposed into a disjoint union of two subsets A and Bi of the equal size, which satisfies B1 = -B2.</description>

      <title>Generic Reed-Solomon Codes Achieve List-decoding Capacity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Brakensiek, Gopi and Makam introduced higher order MDS codes as a generalization of MDS codes. An order-$\ell$ MDS code, denoted by $\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$, has the property that any $\ell$ subspaces formed from columns of its generator matrix intersect as minimally as possible. An independent work by Roth defined a different notion of higher order MDS codes as those achieving a generalized singleton bound for list-decoding. In this work, we show that these two notions of higher order MDS codes are (nearly) equivalent.
  We also show that generic Reed-Solomon codes are $\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$ for all $\ell$, relying crucially on the GM-MDS theorem which shows that generator matrices of generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve any possible zero pattern. As a corollary, this implies that generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve list decoding capacity. More concretely, we show that, with high probability, a random Reed-Solomon code of rate $R$ over an exponentially large field is list decodable from radius $1-R-\epsilon$ with list size at most $\frac{1-R-\epsilon}{\epsilon}$, resolving a conjecture of Shangguan and Tamo.</description>

Abstract: In a graph, the switching operation reverses adjacencies between a subset of vertices and the others. For a hereditary graph class $\mathcal{G}$, we are concerned with the maximum subclass and the minimum superclass of $\mathcal{G}$ that are closed under switching. We characterize the maximum subclass for many important classes $\mathcal{G}$, and prove that it is finite when $\mathcal{G}$ is minor-closed and omits at least one graph. For several graph classes, we develop polynomial-time algorithms to recognize the minimum superclass. We also show that the recognition of the superclass is NP-complete for $H$-free graphs when $H$ is a sufficiently long path or cycle, and it cannot be solved in subexponential time assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of tropical vector bundle on a tropical toric variety which is a tropical analogue of a torus equivariant vector bundle on a toric variety. Alternatively it can be called a toric matroid bundle. We define equivariant $K$-theory and characteristic classes of these bundles. As a particular case, we show that any matroid comes with tautological tropical toric vector bundles over the permutahedral toric variety and the corresponding equivariant $K$-classes and Chern classes recover the tautological classes of matroids constructed in the recent work of Berger-Eur-Spink-Tseng. In analogy with toric vector bundles, we define sheaf of sections and Euler characteristic as well as positivity notions such as global generation, ampleness and nefness for tropical toric vector bundles. Moreover, we prove a vanishing of higher cohomologies result. Finally, we study the splitting of our tropical toric vector bundles and, in particular, an analogue of Grothendieck's theorem on splitting of vector bundles on projective line.</description>

      <title>Ramsey Theorems for Trees and a General 'Private Learning Implies Online Learning' Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work continues to investigate the link between differentially private (DP) and online learning. Alon, Livni, Malliaris, and Moran (2019) showed that for binary concept classes, DP learnability of a given class implies that it has a finite Littlestone dimension (equivalently, that it is online learnable). Their proof relies on a model-theoretic result by Hodges (1997), which demonstrates that any binary concept class with a large Littlestone dimension contains a large subclass of thresholds. In a follow-up work, Jung, Kim, and Tewari (2020) extended this proof to multiclass PAC learning with a bounded number of labels. Unfortunately, Hodges's result does not apply in other natural settings such as multiclass PAC learning with an unbounded label space, and PAC learning of partial concept classes.
  This naturally raises the question of whether DP learnability continues to imply online learnability in more general scenarios: indeed, Alon, Hanneke, Holzman, and Moran (2021) explicitly leave it as an open question in the context of partial concept classes, and the same question is open in the general multiclass setting. In this work, we give a positive answer to these questions showing that for general classification tasks, DP learnability implies online learnability. Our proof reasons directly about Littlestone trees, without relying on thresholds. We achieve this by establishing several Ramsey-type theorems for trees, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Regularity Lemma for Semi-Algebraic Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the polynomial method of Guth and Katz to establish stronger and {\it more efficient} regularity and density theorems for such $k$-uniform hypergraphs $H=(P,E)$, where $P$ is a finite point set in ${\mathbb R}^d$, and the edge set $E$ is determined by a semi-algebraic relation of bounded description complexity. In particular, for any $0&lt;\epsilon\leq 1$ we show that one can construct in $O\left(n\log (1/\epsilon)\right)$ time, an equitable partition $P=U_1\uplus \ldots\uplus U_K$ into $K=O(1/\epsilon^{d+1+\delta})$ subsets, for any $0&lt;\delta$, so that all but $\epsilon$-fraction of the $k$-tuples $U_{i_1},\ldots,U_{i_k}$ are {\it homogeneous}: we have that either $U_{i_1}\times\ldots\times U_{i_k}\subseteq E$ or $(U_{i_1}\times\ldots\times U_{i_k})\cap E=\emptyset$. If the points of $P$ can be perturbed in a general position, the bound improves to $O(1/\epsilon^{d+1})$, and the partition is attained via a {\it single partitioning polynomial} (albeit, at expense of a possible increase in worst-case running time). In contrast to the previous such regularity lemmas which were established by Fox, Gromov, Lafforgue, Naor, and Pach and, subsequently, Fox, Pach and Suk, our partition of $P$ does not depend on the edge set $E$ provided its semi-algebraic description complexity does not exceed a certain constant. As a by-product, we show that in any $k$-partite $k$-uniform hypergraph $(P_1\uplus\ldots\uplus P_k,E)$ of bounded semi-algebraic description complexity in ${\mathbb R}^d$ and with $|E|\geq \epsilon \prod_{i=1}^k|P_i|$ edges, one can find, in expected time $O\left(\sum_{i=1}^k\left(|P_i|+1/\epsilon)\right)\log (1/\epsilon)\right)$, subsets $Q_i\subseteq P_i$ of cardinality $|Q_i|\geq |P_i|/\epsilon^{d+1+\delta}$, so that $Q_1\times\ldots\times Q_k\subseteq E$.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the determinant of the bilinear form in middle degree of the generic artinian reduction of the Stanley-Reisner ring of an odd-dimensional simplicial sphere. This proves the odd multiplicity conjecture of Papadakis and Petrotou and implies that this determinant is a complete invariant of the simplicial sphere. We extend this result to odd-dimensional connected oriented simplicial homology manifolds, and we conjecture a generalization to the Hodge-Riemann forms of any connected oriented simplicial homology manifold. We show that our conjecture follows from the strong Lefschetz property for certain quotients of the Stanley-Reisner rings.</description>
