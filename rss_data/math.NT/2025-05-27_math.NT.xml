      <title>Low-lying zeros in families of Maass form L-functions: an extended density theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the one-level density of low-lying zeros in the family of Maass form $L$-functions of prime level $N$ tending to infinity. Generalizing the influential work of Iwaniec, Luo and Sarnak to this context, Alpoge et al. have proven the Katz-Sarnak prediction for test functions whose Fourier transform is supported in $(-\frac32,\frac32)$. In this paper, we extend the unconditional admissible support to $(-\frac{15}8,\frac{15}8)$. The key tools in our approach are analytic estimates for integrals appearing in the Kutznetsov trace formula, as well as a reduction to bounds on Dirichlet polynomials, which eventually are obtained from the large sieve and the fourth moment bound for Dirichlet $L$-functions. Assuming the Grand Density Conjecture, we extend the admissible support to $(-2,2)$. In addition, we show that the same techniques also allow for an unconditional improvement of the admissible support in the corresponding family of $L$-functions attached to holomorphic forms.</description>

      <title>Beyond endoscopy for $\mathsf{GL}_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with ramification: Poisson summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the beginning of this century, Langlands introduced a strategy known as \emph{Beyond Endoscopy} to attack the principle of functoriality. Altu\u{g} studied $\mathsf{GL}_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ in the unramified setting. The first step involves isolating specific representations, especially the residual part of the spectral side, in the elliptic part of the geometric side of the trace formula. We generalize this step to the case with ramification at $S=\{\infty,q_1,\dots,q_r\}$ with $2\in S$, thereby fully resolving the problem of isolating these representations over $\mathbb{Q}$ which remained unresolved for over a decade. Such a formula that isolates the specific representations is derived by modifying Altu\u{g}'s approach. We use the approximate functional equation to ensure the validity of the Poisson summation formula. Then, we compute the residues of specific functions to isolate the desired representations.</description>

      <title>On properness of moduli stacks of $D^{\times}$-shtukas over ramified legs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a maximal order $D$ of a central division algebra over a global function field $F$, we prove an explicit sufficient condition for moduli stacks of $D^\times$-shtukas to be proper over a finite field in terms of the local invariants of $D$ and bounds. Our proof is a refinement of E.~Lau's result (Duke Math. J. 140 (2007)), which showed the properness of the leg morphism (or characteristic morphism) away from the ramification locus of $D$. We also establish non-emptiness of Newton and Kottwitz--Rapoport strata for moduli stacks of $B^\times$-shtukas, where $B$ is a maximal order of a central simple algebra over $F$.</description>

      <title>Three integers whose sum, product and the sum of the products of the integers, taken two at a time, are perfect squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euler had considered the problem of finding three integers whose sum, product, and also the sum of the products of the integers, taken two at a time, are all perfect squares. Euler's methods of solving the problem lead to parametric solutions in terms of polynomials of high degrees and his numerical solutions consisted of very large integers. We obtain, by a new method, several parametric solutions given by polynomials of much smaller degrees and thus we get a number of numerically small solutions of the problem.</description>

      <title>S-unit equations in modules and linear-exponential Diophantine equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19141v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a positive integer, and $\mathcal{M}$ be a finitely presented module over the Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}_{/T}[X_1^{\pm}, \ldots, X_N^{\pm}]$. We consider S-unit equations over $\mathcal{M}$: these are equations of the form $x_1 m_1 + \cdots + x_K m_K = m_0$, where the variables $x_1, \ldots, x_K$ range over the set of monomials (with coefficient 1) of $\mathbb{Z}_{/T}[X_1^{\pm}, \ldots, X_N^{\pm}]$. When $T$ is a power of a prime number $p$, we show that the solution set of an S-unit equation over $\mathcal{M}$ is effectively $p$-normal in the sense of Derksen and Masser (2015), generalizing their result on S-unit equations in fields of prime characteristic. When $T$ is an arbitrary positive integer, we show that deciding whether an S-unit equation over $\mathcal{M}$ admits a solution is Turing equivalent to solving a system of linear-exponential Diophantine equations, whose base contains the prime divisors of $T$. Combined with a recent result of Karimov, Luca, Nieuwveld, Ouaknine and Worrell (2025), this yields decidability when $T$ has at most two distinct prime divisors. This also shows that proving either decidability or undecidability in the case of arbitrary $T$ would entail major breakthroughs in number theory.
  We mention some potential applications of our results, such as deciding Submonoid Membership in wreath products of the form $\mathbb{Z}_{/p^a q^b} \wr \mathbb{Z}^d$, as well as progressing towards solving the Skolem problem in rings whose additive group is torsion. More connections in these directions will be explored in follow up papers.</description>

      <title>A comparison problem for abelian surfaces and descent for symplectic orbital integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To answer a question about the distribution of products of elliptic curves in isogeny classes of abelian surfaces defined over finite fields, we compute specific orbital integrals in the group $\mathrm{GSp}_4$. More precisely, we compute integrals over the orbits of elements in the subgroup $\mathrm{GL}_2\times_{\det} \mathrm{GL}_2$. As a first step towards a complete solution of the problem, this article contains explicit computations for arbitrary orbital integrals of spherical functions over this subgroup, and also compute orbital integrals over $\mathrm{GSp}_4$ in a large number of cases.</description>

      <title>A relation to a remainder terms in an asymptotic formula for the associated Euler totient function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H.L.Montgomery proved a relation for error terms in asymptotic formulas for the Euler totient function. J.Kaczorowski defined the associated Euler totient function which generalizes and obtained an asymptotic formula for it. In this paper, we prove a relation on error terms similar to H.L.Montgomery's result for a certain special case of the associated Euler totient function.</description>

      <title>Mazur's growth number conjecture and congruences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Greenberg-Vatsal and Emerton-Pollack-Weston, I investigate the extent to which Mazur's conjecture on the growth of Selmer ranks in $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of an imaginary quadratic field persists under $p$-congruences between Galois representations. As a first step, I establish Mazur's conjecture for certain triples $(E, K, p)$ under explicit hypotheses. Building on this, I prove analogous results for Greenberg Selmer groups attached to modular forms that are congruent mod $p$ to $E$, including all specializations arising from Hida families of fixed tame level. In particular, I show that the Mordell-Weil ranks in non-anticyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of $K$ remain bounded for elliptic curves $E'$ such that $E[p]$ and $E'[p]$ are isomorphic as Galois modules.</description>

      <title>A Short Character Sum in $\mathbb{F}_{p^3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a new bound for short character sums in finite fields, particularly over two-dimensional grids in $\mathbb{F}_{p^3}$ and higher-dimensional lattices in $\mathbb{F}_{p^d}$, extending an earlier work of Mei-Chu Chang on Burgess inequality in \(\mathbb{F}_{p^2}\). In particular, we show that for intervals of size $p^{3/8+\varepsilon}$, the sum $\sum_{x, y} \chi(x + \omega y)$, with $\omega \in \mathbb{F}_{p^3} \setminus \mathbb{F}_p$, exhibits nontrivial cancellation uniformly in $\omega$. This is further generalized to codimension-one sublattices in $\mathbb{F}_{p^d}$, and applied to obtain an alternative estimate for character sums on binary cubic forms.</description>

      <title>An analog to the Goldbach problem and the twin prime problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the best approaches to the Goldbach conjectures is the Chen's theorem, showing that every large enough even integer can be represented by a sum of a prime and a $2$-almost prime. In this article, we consider a thinner set than the set of $2$-almost primes, which is $$ \mathbb{P}^{(c)}=(\lfloor p^c \rfloor)_{p\in \mathbb{P}}\quad (c&gt;0,c\notin \mathbb{N}), $$ where $\mathbb{P}$ is the set of prime numbers and $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ is the floor function. We prove that for all $c \in (0,\frac{13}{15})$, any large enough integer $N$ can be represented as
  $$
  N=\lfloor p^c\rfloor+q,
  $$ where $p$ and $q$ are primes. Moreover, for almost all $c \in (0, M)$ and large enough $N$ where $M \ll \log N/ \log\log N$, we also prove that $N \in \mathbb{P}^{(c)} + \mathbb{P}$.
  It is well known that the twin prime conjecture can be approached by a similar way to the Goldbach conjecture with a different form of the Chen's theorem. We also prove similar results due to the set $\mathbb{P}^{(c)}$ with both an unconditional case and an average case based on the Lebesgue measure, which also improve a theorem by Balog.</description>

      <title>From crank to congruences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the arithmetic properties of the difference between the number of partitions of a positive integer $n$ with even crank and those with odd crank, denoted $C(n)=c_e(n)-c_o(n)$. Inspired by Ramanujan's classical congruences for the partition function $p(n)$, we establish a Ramanujan-type congruence for $C(n)$, proving that $C(5n+4) \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$. Further, we study the generating function $\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty a(n)\, q^n = \frac{(-q; q)^2_\infty}{(q; q)_\infty}$, which arises naturally in this context, and provide multiple combinatorial interpretations for the sequence $a(n)$. We then offer a complete characterization of the values $a(n) \mod 2^m$ for $m = 1, 2, 3, 4$, highlighting their connection to generalized pentagonal numbers. Using computational methods and modular forms, we also derive new identities and congruences, including $a(7n+2) \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$, expanding the scope of partition congruences in arithmetic progressions. These results build upon classical techniques and recent computational advances, revealing deep combinatorial and modular structure within partition functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the 8-rank of class groups of hyperelliptic function fields and show that such 8-ranks are governed by splitting conditions in so-called governing fields. A similar result was proven for quadratic number fields by Stevenhagen, who used a theory of R\'edei symbols and R\'edei reciprocity to do so. We introduce a version of the R\'edei reciprocity law for function fields and use this to show existence of governing fields.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number and $K$ a finite unramified extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Building on recent work of Breuil, Herzig, Hu, Morra and Schraen, we study the smooth mod $p$ representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(K)$ appearing in a tower of mod $p$ Hecke eigenspaces of the cohomology of Shimura curves, under mild genericity assumptions but notably no multiplicity one assumption at tame level, and prove that these representations are of finite length, thereby extending a previous result of the aforementioned authors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry forward the work started by the author and Bhagwat in [1] and develop the Theory of root clusters further in this article. We establish the Inverse root capacity problem for number fields which is a generalization of Inverse cluster size problem for number fields proved in [1]. We give a field theoretic formulation for the concept of minimal generating sets of splitting fields which was introduced by the author and Vanchinathan in [4] and establish the existence of field extensions over number fields for given degree and given cardinality of minimal generating set of Galois closure dividing the degree. We improve on the inverse problems proved in [1] and this article by proving that there exist arbitrarily large finite families of pairwise non-isomorphic extensions having additional properties that satisfy the given conditions.</description>

Abstract: Here we consider the set $\Sigma_S$ of roots of power series whose coefficients lie in a given set $S$ and how such sets of roots vary as the set $S$ varies. We give an estimate of the depth that complex roots can reach into the disc, offer some criterion for the set of roots to be connected or disconnected, and show that for two finite symmetric sets $S$ and $T$ of integers containing $1$, if $\Sigma_S = \Sigma_T$ then all of their elements between $1$ and $2\sqrt{\max(S)}+1$ must agree.</description>

      <title>Effective resistance in planar graphs and continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G=(V,E)$ and edge $e\in E$, the effective resistance is defined as a ratio $\frac{\tau(G/e)}{\tau(G)}$, where $\tau(G)$ denotes the number of spanning trees in $G$. We resolve the inverse problem for the effective resistance for planar graphs. Namely, we determine (up to a constant) the smallest size of a simple planar graph with a given effective resistance. The results are motivated and closely related to our previous work arXiv:2411.18782 on Sedl\'a\v{c}ek's inverse problem for the number of spanning trees.</description>

Abstract: We prove a Lindel\"{o}f-on-average upper bound for the second moment of the $L$-functions associated to a level 1 holomorphic cusp form, twisted along a coset of subgroup of the characters modulo $q^{2/3}$ (where $q = p^3$ for some odd prime $p$). This result should be seen as a $q$-aspect analogue of Anton Good's (1982) result on upper bounds of the second moment of cusp forms in short intervals. The results generalize easily to higher prime powers as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the set of origami constructible numbers is larger than the classical straight-edge and compass constructible numbers. However, the Huzita-Justin-Hatori origami constructible numbers remain algebraic so that the transcendental number $\pi$ can only be approximated using a finite number of straight line folds. Using these methods we give a convergent sequence for folding $\pi$ as well as other methods to approximate $\pi$. Folding along curved creases, however, allows for the construction of transcendental numbers. We here give a method to construct $\pi$ exactly by folding along a parabola, and we discuss generalizations for folding other transcendental numbers such as $\Gamma(1/4)$.</description>

      <title>Primes and Bivariate Polynomials without Constant Terms: A Recursive Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the computational problem of determining whether a bivariate polynomial with non-negative coefficients and no constant term can attain a prime value. While classical conjectures such as Bouniakowsky's provide necessary conditions for univariate prime-representing polynomials, we introduce a new recursive algorithm that efficiently certifies when a bivariate polynomial form can produce no prime values at all.
  Our method is elementary and constructive, based on analyzing gcd-divisibility patterns arising from recursive substitutions into the polynomial. The obstruction criterion obtained leads to an efficient and elementary algorithm that certifies when a polynomial form cannot produce any prime values. The result is stronger than what is implied by the negation of Bouniakowsky's condition and applies to a wide class of polynomials, including transformations of univariate forms. We provide illustrative examples, analyze the complexity of the method, and discuss its connections to existing conjectures and possible generalizations.</description>

      <title>The entries of the Sinkhorn limit of an $m \times n$ matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a variety of computational tools to obtain a degree-$\binom{m + n - 2}{m - 1}$ polynomial equation conjecturally satisfied by the top-left entry of the Sinkhorn limit of a positive $m \times n$ matrix. The degree of this equation has a combinatorial interpretation as the number of minors of an $(m - 1) \times (n - 1)$ matrix, and the coefficients involve a determinant formula that reflects new combinatorial structure on sets of minor specifications. The tools we use include Gr\"obner bases, which produce equations for small matrices; the PSLQ algorithm, which produces equations for larger matrices as part of an interpolation effort that required 1.5 years of CPU time; and ChatGPT o3-mini-high, which identified the signs of the off-diagonal entries in the determinant formula.</description>

      <title>The Chowla conjecture and Landau-Siegel zeroes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k\geq 2$ be an integer and let $\lambda$ be the Liouville function. Given $k$ non-negative distinct integers $h_1,\ldots,h_k$, the Chowla conjecture claims that $\sum_{n\leq x}\lambda(n+h_1)\cdots \lambda(n+h_k)=o(x)$ as $x\to\infty$. An unconditional answer to this conjecture is yet to be found, and in this paper, we take a conditional approach towards it. More precisely, we establish a non-trivial bound for the sums $\sum_{n\leq x}\lambda(n+h_1)\cdots \lambda(n+h_k)$ under the existence of a Landau-Siegel zero for $x$ in an interval that depends on the modulus of the character whose Dirichlet series corresponds to the Landau-Siegel zero. Our work constitutes an improvement over the previous related results of Germ\'{a}n and K\'{a}tai, Chinis, and Tao and Ter\"av\"ainen.</description>

      <title>Determinants of Mahler measures and special values of $L$-functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Mahler measures of two well-studied families of bivariate polynomials, namely $P_t=x+x^{-1}+y+y^{-1}+\sqrt{t}$ and $Q_t=x^3+y^3+1-\sqrt[3]{t}xy$, where $t$ is a complex parameter. In the cases when the zero loci of these polynomials define CM elliptic curves over number fields, we derive general formulas for their Mahler measures in terms of $L$-values of cusp forms. For each family, we also classify all possible values of $t$ in number fields of degree not exceeding $4$ for which the corresponding elliptic curves have complex multiplication. Finally, for all such values of $t$ in totally real number fields of degree $n=2$ and $n=4$, corresponding to elliptic curves $\mathcal{F}_t$ (resp. $\mathcal{C}_t$), we prove that determinants of $n\times n$ matrices whose entries are Mahler measures corresponding to their Galois conjugates are non-zero rational multiples of $L^{(n)}(\mathcal{F}_t,0)$ (resp. $L^{(n)}(\mathcal{C}_t,0)$).</description>

      <title>The inverse stability of Artin-Schreier polynomials over finite fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number and $q$ a power of $p$. Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be the finite field with $q$ elements. For a positive integer $n$ and a polynomial $\varphi(X)\in\mathbb{F}_q[X]$, let $d_{n,\varphi}(X)$ denote the denominator of the $n$th iterate of $\frac{1}{\varphi(X)}$. The polynomial $\varphi(X)$ is said to be inversely stable over $\mathbb{F}_q$ if all polynomials $d_{n,\varphi}(X)$ are irreducible polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and distinct. In this paper, we characterize a class of inversely stable polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_q$. More precisely, for $\varphi(X)=X^{p^t}+aX+b\in\mathbb{F}_q[X]$ with $t$ being a positive integer, we provide a sufficient and necessary condition for $\varphi(X)$ to be inversely stable over $\mathbb{F}_q$.</description>

      <title>Learning Fricke signs from Maass form Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a data-scientific investigation of Maass forms. We find that averaging the Fourier coefficients of Maass forms with the same Fricke sign reveals patterns analogous to the recently discovered "murmuration" phenomenon, and that these patterns become more pronounced when parity is incorporated as an additional feature. Approximately 43% of the forms in our dataset have an unknown Fricke sign. For the remaining forms, we employ Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to machine learn their Fricke sign, achieving 96% (resp. 94%) accuracy for forms with even (resp. odd) parity. We apply the trained LDA model to forms with unknown Fricke signs to make predictions. The average values based on the predicted Fricke signs are computed and compared to those for forms with known signs to verify the reasonableness of the predictions. Additionally, a subset of these predictions is evaluated against heuristic guesses provided by Hejhal's algorithm, showing a match approximately 95% of the time. We also use neural networks to obtain results comparable to those from the LDA model.</description>

      <title>On families of strongly divisible modules of rank 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime, and $\mathbf{Q}_{p^f}$ the unramified extension of $\mathbf{Q}_p$ of degree $f$. In this paper, we reduce the problem of constructing strongly divisible modules for $2$-dimensional semi-stable non-crystalline representations of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbf{Q}}_p/\mathbf{Q}_{p^f})$ with Hodge--Tate weights in the Fontaine--Laffaille range to solving systems of linear equations and inequalities. We also determine the Breuil modules corresponding to the mod-$p$ reduction of the strongly divisible modules. We expect our method to produce at least one Galois-stable lattice in each such representation for general $f$. Moreover, when the mod-$p$ reduction is an extension of distinct characters, we further expect our method to provide the two non-homothetic lattices. As applications, we show that our approach recovers previously known results for $f=1$ and determine the mod-$p$ reduction of the semi-stable representations with some small Hodge--Tate weights when $f=2$.</description>

      <title>A new result on the divisor problem in arithmetic progressions modulo a prime power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an asymptotic formula for the divisor function $\tau(k)$ in an arithmetic progression $k\equiv a(\bmod \ q)$, uniformly for $q\leq X^{\Delta_{n,l}}$ with $(q,a)=1$. The parameter $\Delta_{n,l}$ is defined as $$ \Delta_{n,l}=\frac{1-\frac{3}{2^{2^l+2l-3}}}{1-\frac{1}{n2^{l-1}}}. $$ Specifically, by setting $l=2$, we achieve $\Delta_{n,l}&gt;3/4+5/32$, which surpasses the result obtained by Liu, Shparlinski, and Zhang (2018). Meanwhile, this has also improved upon the result of Wu and Xi (2021). Notably, Hooley, Linnik, and Selberg (1950's) independently established that the asymptotic formula holds for $q\leq X^{2/3-\varepsilon}$. Irving (2015) was the first to surpass the $2/3-$barrier for certain special moduli. We break the classical $3/4-$barrier in the case of prime power moduli and extend the range of $q$. Our main ingredients borrow from Mangerel's (2021) adaptation of Mili\'{c}evi\'{c} and Zhang's methodology in dealing with a specific class of weighted Kloosterman sums, rather than adopting Korobov's technique employed by Liu, Shparlinski, and Zhang (2018).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the second moment of cubic Dirichlet L-functions at the central point $s=1/2$ over the rational function field $\mathbb{F}_q(T)$, where $q$ is a power of an odd prime satisfying $q \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$. Our result extends prior work of David, Florea and Lalin, who obtained an asymptotic formula for the first moment. Our approach relies on analytic techniques (Perron's formula, approximate functional equation, etc), adapted to the function field context. A key step in the construction is to relate second moment to certain averages of Gauss sums, which are estimated in loc. cit. using results of Kubota and Hoffstein.</description>

      <title>Pairwise Rational Points on a Parabola</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.03249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a solution to the following open problem in Number Theory and Geometry: How many points can you find on the (half) parabola $y=x^2$, $x&gt;0$, so that the distance between any pair of them is rational? This problem sounds like a geometry problem, but it is likely to require techniques in number theory. That's because, to determine if the distance between (a,b) and (s,t) is rational, you need to test whether $(a-s)^2$ + $(b-t)^2$ is the square of a rational number...and such questions typically fall into the realm of number theory. Of course, since this is an open problem, no-one can claim to know just what field the problem lies in, since no-one knows the solution. I believe it is not even known if there are more than 5 points on the parabola which satisfy the condition. It is certainly not known if there is an infinite family with pairwise rational distances. We can quickly see that there are three such points in the following way: Pick two rational numbers, say 1/5 and 3/5, and let those be the distances between the pairs of points AB and BC. If you fix those distances and slide the points up the parabola, the distance AC will gradually increase, bounded above by 4/5. Since the rational numbers are dense in the reals, there will be many placements of the points so that AC is a rational distance. It is not too hard to show that if you have N points on the parabola with rational distances between them, then you can find N points on the parabola with integer distances between them.
  This problem is publicly posted on the DIMACS mathematical research website in order to search for solutions. This paper demonstrates that an infinite number of families each containing an arbitrarily large number of such pairwise rational points on the parabola can be found. A constructive algorithm for doing so is outlined in the paper.</description>

      <title>On Mochizuki's idea of Anabelomorphy and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.01890v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I coined the term anabelomorphy (pronounced as anabel-o-morphy) as a concise way of expressing Mochizuki's idea of "anabelian way of changing ground field, rings etc." which was he has introduced in his work on his Inter-Universal Teichmuller Theory. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of this idea by studying its ramifications in the more familiar arithmetic contexts such as the theory of Galois representations, automorphic forms and related areas and establish a number of results which are of independent arithmetic interest. I also introduce the notion of anabelomorphically connected number fields in which two number fields are related by the existence of topological isomorphism between the local Galois groups at a finite list of primes of both the number fields and prove some results illustrating arithmetic consequences of this notion. The Introduction provides a detailed discussion and summary of all the results proved in this paper.</description>

      <title>Determining skew left braces of size np</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the twofold semidirect product of two skew left braces, in which both the additive and multiplicative groups are semidirect products of the corresponding groups of the given skew left braces. We consider an odd prime $p$ and an integer $n$ satisfying $p\nmid n$, $p\nmid|\mathrm{Aut}(E)|$ for every group $E$ of order $n$ and such that each group of order $np$ has a unique $p$-Sylow subgroup. Under these conditions, we prove that any skew left brace of size $np$ is either a twofold semidirect product of the trivial brace of size $p$ and a skew left brace of size $n$ or a companion skew left brace of that one. We develop an algorithm to obtain all skew left braces of size $np$ from the skew left braces of size $n$ and provide a formula to count them. We use this result to describe all skew left braces of size $12p$ for $p\geq 7$, which proves a conjecture of V.G. Bardakov, M.V. Neshchadim and M.K. Yadav.</description>

      <title>Deformations and Lifts of Calabi-Yau Varieties in Characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study deformations of Calabi-Yau varieties in characteristic $p$ using techniques from derived algebraic geometry. We prove a mixed characteristic analogue of the Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theorem (which states that Calabi-Yau varieties in characteristic $0$ are unobstructed), and we show that ordinary Calabi-Yau varieties admit canonical lifts to characteristic $0$, generalising the Serre-Tate theorem on ordinary abelian varieties.</description>

      <title>Siegel modular forms arising from higher Chow cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the infinitesimal invariant of a higher Chow cycle of type (2,3-g) on a generic abelian variety of dimension g&lt;4 gives rise to a meromorphic Siegel modular form of (virtual) weight Sym^{4}det^{-1} with bounded singularity, and that this construction is functorial with respect to rank 1 degeneration, namely the K-theory elevator for the cycle corresponds to the Siegel operator for the modular form.</description>
