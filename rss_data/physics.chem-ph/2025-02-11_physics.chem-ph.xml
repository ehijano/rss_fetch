      <title>Teacher-student training improves accuracy and efficiency of machine learning inter-atomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are revolutionizing the field of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Recent MLIPs have tended towards more complex architectures trained on larger datasets. The resulting increase in computational and memory costs may prohibit the application of these MLIPs to perform large-scale MD simulations. Here, we present a teacher-student training framework in which the latent knowledge from the teacher (atomic energies) is used to augment the students' training. We show that the light-weight student MLIPs have faster MD speeds at a fraction of the memory footprint compared to the teacher models. Remarkably, the student models can even surpass the accuracy of the teachers, even though both are trained on the same quantum chemistry dataset. Our work highlights a practical method for MLIPs to reduce the resources required for large-scale MD simulations.</description>

      <title>Quadrupolar NMR Relaxation as a Local Probe of Collective Dynamics in Aqueous Alcaline and Alcaline-Earth Chlorides Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) provides valuable insights into the local environment of many nuclei, the unambiguous interpretation of the signal in terms of microscopic dynamics is often difficult, particularly when the quadrupolar relaxation mechanism comes into play. Here, we investigate the quadrupolar NMR relaxation of cations and anions in aqueous alcaline and alcaline-earth chlorides solutions, across a broad range of salt concentrations. Using a combination of DFT calculations and classical molecular dynamics simulations, we compute the electric field gradient (EFG) fluctuations over the relevant time scales. Predicted NMR relaxation rates are in good agreement with experiments from the literature. As previously reported for NaCl, we find that the increase in relaxation rate with salt concentration is primarily driven by the slowing of EFG fluctuations, while changes in the static variance of the EFG play a minor role. We highlight some specific features for smaller and divalent cations compared to the other monovalent ones. Additionally, we assess the relevance of the Stokes-Einstein-Debye model, frequently used to analyze NMR relaxation experiments, for these aqueous electrolytes, and highlight the link between the collective dynamics of the liquid underlying the EFG fluctuations at the ion positions and the stress fluctuations. Our results generalize observations for Na$^+$ in aqueous NaCl solutions, showing that models assuming a viscous model of the solvent dynamics are insufficient to describe EFG fluctuations in these systems and illustrate the relevance of molecular simulations to interpret NMR relaxation experiments in terms of microscopic dynamics.</description>

      <title>OpenMM-MiMiC Interface for Efficient and Flexible Multiscale Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MiMiC is a flexible and efficient framework for multiscale simulations in which different subsystems are treated by individual client programs. In this work, we present a new interface with OpenMM to be used as an MM client program and we demonstrate its efficiency for QM/MM MD simulations. Apart from its high performance, especially on GPUs, and a wide selection of features, OpenMM is a highly-flexible and easily-extensible program, ideal for the development of novel multiscale methods. Thanks to the open-ended design of MiMiC, the OpenMM-MiMiC interface will automatically support any new QM client program interfaced with MiMiC for QM/MM and, with minimal changes needed, new multiscale methods implemented, opening up new research directions beyond electrostatic embedding QM/MM.</description>

      <title>The Ridge Integration Method and its Application to Molecular Sieving, Demonstrated for Gas Purification via Graphdiyne Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eyring theory provides a convenient approximation to the rate of a chemical reaction, as it uses only local information evaluated near extremal points of a given potential energy surface. However, in cases of pronounced anharmonicity and particularly low-lying vibrational frequencies, deviations from the correct reaction rate can become substantial. Molecular Dynamics simulations, on the other hand, are very costly at higher levels of theory, and of limited use since molecular reactions are `rare' events and hence statistically less accessible. In this article, we present an alternative description for problems of gas separation and storage via two-dimensional materials such as porous graphene or flat metal-organic frameworks. Taking geometric advantage of the typical problem setting, our method is based on a statistical analysis of molecular trajectories near the so-called `ridge', a hypersurface which divides the reaction volume into a reactant and a product side. It allows for more realistic predictions of permeabilities and selectivities, e.g. derived from density functional theory, but without the considerable costs of a full molecular dynamics simulation on the corresponding Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface. We test our method on the example of methane separation from nitrogen and carbon dioxide via a graphdiyne membrane.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of self-powered photodetector materials based on Ni-doped ZnO/p-Si heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, Ni-doped ZnO films were grown on a p-type silicon substrate via spray pyrolysis. The Ni dopant concentrations were varied by adjusting the weight ratio between Zinc Acetate Dehydrate (ZAD) and Nickel Chloride Hexahydrate (NCH), resulting in the ZnO, ZnO:Ni1%, and ZnO:Ni3% samples. Field-effect scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images revealed that Ni doping significantly reduced the nanostructure size from 326 nm (ZnO) to 146 nm (ZnO:Ni3%). Similarly, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis also shows the decrease of the crystallite size with increasing Ni doping, from 44 nm (ZnO) to 35 nm (ZnO:Ni3%). Current-voltage (I-V) measurements were conducted at a bias voltage of 0 and 5 V to examine electrical and self-powered photodetection properties. All samples demonstrate self-powered photodetector performance. At the bias of 0 V, the undoped ZnO exhibited a higher photo-to-dark-current ratio (162) as compared to ZnO:Ni1% (18) and ZnO:Ni3% (16). The ZnO:Ni3% samples displayed faster rise (0.4 s) and fall times (1.7 s) as compared to the pure ZnO (10.8 s for rise time and 9.1 s for fall time), highlighting their potential for applications requiring rapid photoresponse. The findings provide valuable insights into optimizing the performance of ZnO-based photodetectors through controlled Ni doping, enabling advancements in self-powered photodetection technology for energy-efficient optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Mixed Quantum-Classical Dynamics Yields Anharmonic Rabi Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a mixed quantum-classical (MQC) approach to the quantum Rabi model, involving a classical optical field coupled self-consistently to a quantum two-level system. Under the rotating wave approximation, we analytically show this approach to yield persistent yet anharmonic Rabi oscillations, governed by an undamped and unforced Duffing equation. We consider the single-quantum limit, where we find such anharmonic Rabi oscillations to closely follow full-quantum results once zero-point energy is approximately enforced when initializing the optical field coordinate. Our findings provide guidance in the application of MQC dynamics to classes of problems involving small quantum numbers and far away from decoherence.</description>

      <title>A Universal Transformer-Based Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Framework for Protein Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel, universal, Transformer-based coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) framework for simulating protein dynamics. Our trained model generalizes to all protein systems, regardless of sequence length or number of chains. First, we extend a tree-structured protein representation to accommodate multi-chain proteins, demonstrating sub-angstrom-level accuracy in reconstructing a 169-amino-acid protein structure. Then, representing collective variables as language-like sequences, we use a Transformer network as a propagator for stochastic differential equations, generating MD trajectories over 10,000 times faster than all-atom MD simulations. This single trained model accurately simulates both single-chain and two-chain proteins, and the generated trajectories closely resemble all-atom MD trajectories in their RMSD profiles. With sufficient training data, we anticipate that our model can achieve universality across all proteins, offering a ~10,000x acceleration of MD simulations with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Known Unknowns: Out-of-Distribution Property Prediction in Materials and Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovery of high-performance materials and molecules requires identifying extremes with property values that fall outside the known distribution. Therefore, the ability to extrapolate to out-of-distribution (OOD) property values is critical for both solid-state materials and molecular design. Our objective is to train predictor models that extrapolate zero-shot to higher ranges than in the training data, given the chemical compositions of solids or molecular graphs and their property values. We propose using a transductive approach to OOD property prediction, achieving improvements in prediction accuracy. In particular, the True Positive Rate (TPR) of OOD classification of materials and molecules improved by 3x and 2.5x, respectively, and precision improved by 2x and 1.5x compared to non-transductive baselines. Our method leverages analogical input-target relations in the training and test sets, enabling generalization beyond the training target support, and can be applied to any other material and molecular tasks.</description>

      <title>Formation of ultracold triatomic molecules by electric microwave association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theoretical model is proposed for the formation of ultracold ground-state triatomic molecules in weakly bound energy levels. The process is driven by the electric component of a microwave field, which induces the association of an ultracold atom colliding with an ultracold diatomic molecule. This model is exemplified using $^{39}$K atoms and $^{23}$Na$^{39}$K molecules, both in their ground states, a scenario of experimental relevance. The model assumes that the dynamics of the association are dominated by the long-range van der Waals interaction between $^{39}$K and $^{23}$Na$^{39}$K. The electric microwave association mechanism relies on the intrinsic electric dipole moment of $^{23}$Na$^{39}$K, which drives transitions between its lowest rotational levels ( $j$=0 and $j$=1). The energies of the uppermost triatomic energy levels are computed by numerically solving coupled Schr\"odinger equations using the Mapped Fourier Grid Hamiltonian method. Measurable association rates are derived within the framework of a perturbative approach. This method of electric microwave association provides an alternative to atom-molecule association via magnetic Feshbach resonances for forming ultracold, deeply bound triatomic molecules, and is applicable to a wide range of polar diatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Crystal Structure Prediction from Powder X-Ray Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) is a prevalent technique in materials characterization. While the analysis of PXRD often requires extensive human manual intervention, and most automated method only achieved at coarse-grained level. The more difficult and important task of fine-grained crystal structure prediction from PXRD remains unaddressed. This study introduces XtalNet, the first equivariant deep generative model for end-to-end crystal structure prediction from PXRD. Unlike previous crystal structure prediction methods that rely solely on composition, XtalNet leverages PXRD as an additional condition, eliminating ambiguity and enabling the generation of complex organic structures with up to 400 atoms in the unit cell. XtalNet comprises two modules: a Contrastive PXRD-Crystal Pretraining (CPCP) module that aligns PXRD space with crystal structure space, and a Conditional Crystal Structure Generation (CCSG) module that generates candidate crystal structures conditioned on PXRD patterns. Evaluation on two MOF datasets (hMOF-100 and hMOF-400) demonstrates XtalNet's effectiveness. XtalNet achieves a top-10 Match Rate of 90.2% and 79% for hMOF-100 and hMOF-400 in conditional crystal structure prediction task, respectively. XtalNet enables the direct prediction of crystal structures from experimental measurements, eliminating the need for manual intervention and external databases. This opens up new possibilities for automated crystal structure determination and the accelerated discovery of novel materials.</description>

      <title>Decoherence dynamics in molecular qubits: Exponential, Gaussian and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we examine how the structure of system-bath interactions can determine commonly encountered temporal decoherence patterns, such as Gaussian and exponential decay, in molecular and other qubits coupled to a thermal bosonic bath. The analysis, based on a pure dephasing picture that admits analytical treatment, shows that decoherence, in general, is neither purely Gaussian nor exponential but rather the exponential of oscillatory functions, with periods determined by the bath's frequencies. For initially unentangled qubit-bath states Gaussian decay is always present at early times. It becomes increasingly dominant with increasing temperature, qubit-bath interaction strength, and bath correlation time. Initial system-bath entanglement that arises due to displacement in the position of the bath states preserves the Gaussian decay. By contrast, strict exponential decay arises only in very specific models that we isolate. Still, it becomes dominant for times longer than the bath correlation time or for early times when there is initial entanglement due to momentum displacement of the bath states. For molecular electronic decoherence, the long-time exponential regime plays a limited role as it emerges after most coherence is lost. Thus, the Gaussian decay provides a more suitable (albeit imperfect) model of such decoherence. Further, we discuss the connection between electronic decoherence dynamics and electronic spectroscopic lineshape theory, where Gaussian spectral peaks correspond to Gaussian coherence decay and Lorentzian peaks correspond to exponential coherence decay. We find that Gaussian spectral peaks, usually associated with inhomogeneous broadening, can emerge from the entangling unitary system-bath dynamics even when there is no inhomogeneity in the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Retro-Rank-In: A Ranking-Based Approach for Inorganic Materials Synthesis Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis strategically plans the synthesis of a chemical target compound from simpler, readily available precursor compounds. This process is critical for synthesizing novel inorganic materials, yet traditional methods in inorganic chemistry continue to rely on trial-and-error experimentation. Emerging machine-learning approaches struggle to generalize to entirely new reactions due to their reliance on known precursors, as they frame retrosynthesis as a multi-label classification task. To address these limitations, we propose Retro-Rank-In, a novel framework that reformulates the retrosynthesis problem by embedding target and precursor materials into a shared latent space and learning a pairwise ranker on a bipartite graph of inorganic compounds. We evaluate Retro-Rank-In's generalizability on challenging retrosynthesis dataset splits designed to mitigate data duplicates and overlaps. For instance, for Cr2AlB2, it correctly predicts the verified precursor pair CrB + Al despite never seeing them in training, a capability absent in prior work. Extensive experiments show that Retro-Rank-In sets a new state-of-the-art, particularly in out-of-distribution generalization and candidate set ranking, offering a powerful tool for accelerating inorganic material synthesis.</description>

      <title>Meta-Generalized-Gradient Approximation made Magnetic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGAs) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. Among the MGGAs, the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed Approximation (SCAN) greatly improves upon GGAs from the lower rung. But the over magnetized solutions of SCAN make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. Here, we provide a solution that satisfies the most pressing {\em desiderata} for density functional approximations for ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and non-collinear states. The approach is available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.</description>

Abstract: Predicting molecular ground-state conformation (i.e., energy-minimized conformation) is crucial for many chemical applications such as molecular docking and property prediction. Classic energy-based simulation is time-consuming when solving this problem while existing learning-based methods have advantages in computational efficiency but sacrifice accuracy and interpretability. In this work, we propose a novel and effective method to bridge the energy-based simulation and the learning-based strategy, which designs and learns a Wasserstein gradient flow-driven SE(3)-Transformer, called WGFormer, for molecular ground-state conformation prediction. Specifically, our method tackles this task within an auto-encoding framework, which encodes low-quality conformations by the proposed WGFormer and decodes corresponding ground-state conformations by an MLP. The architecture of WGFormer corresponds to Wasserstein gradient flows -- it optimizes molecular conformations by minimizing an energy function defined on the latent mixture models of atoms, thereby significantly improving performance and interpretability. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art competitors, providing a new and insightful paradigm to predict molecular ground-state conformation.</description>

      <title>KinetiX: A performance portable code generator for chemical kinetics and transport properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present KinetiX, a software toolkit to generate computationally efficient fuel-specific routines for the chemical source term, thermodynamic and mixture-averaged transport properties for use in combustion simulation codes. The C++ routines are designed for high-performance execution on both CPU and GPU architectures. On CPUs, chemical kinetics computations are optimized by eliminating redundant operations and using data alignment and loops with trivial access patterns that enable auto-vectorization, reducing the latency of complex mathematical operations. On GPUs, performance is improved by loop unrolling, reducing the number of costly exponential evaluations and limiting the number of live variables for better register usage. The accuracy of the generated routines is checked against reference values computed using Cantera and the maximum relative errors are below $10^{-7}$. We evaluate the performance of the kernels on some of the latest CPU and GPU architectures from AMD and NVIDIA, i.e., AMD EPYC 9653, AMD MI250X, and NVIDIA H100. The routines generated by KinetiX outperform the general-purpose Cantera library, achieving speedups of up to 2.4x for species production rates and 3.2x for mixture-averaged transport properties on CPUs. Compared to the routines generated by PelePhysics (CEPTR), KinetiX achieves speedups of up to 2.6x on CPUs and 1.7x on GPUs for the species production rates kernel on a single-threaded basis.</description>

      <title>Instrumental distortions in quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control methods, such as gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE), are used for precise manipulation of quantum states. Many of those methods were pioneered in magnetic resonance spectroscopy where instrumental distortions are often negligible. However, that is not the case elsewhere: the usual jumble of cables, resonators, modulators, splitters, amplifiers, and filters can and do distort control signals. Those distortions may be non-linear, their inverse functions may be ill-defined and unstable; they may even vary from one day to the next, and across the sample.
  Here we introduce the response-aware gradient ascent pulse engineering (RAW-GRAPE) framework, which accounts for any cascade of differentiable distortions within the GRAPE optimisation loop, does not require filter function inversion, and produces control sequences that are resilient to user-specified distortion cascades with user-specified parameter ensembles.
  The framework is implemented into the optimal control module supplied with versions 2.10 and later of the open-source Spinach library; the user needs to provide function handles returning the actions by the distortions and, optionally, parameter ensembles for those actions.</description>
