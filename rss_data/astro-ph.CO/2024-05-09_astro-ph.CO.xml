      <title>Component Separation method for CMB using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this project is to recover the CMB anisotropies maps in temperature and polarized intensity by means of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) which, after appropiate training, can remove the foregrounds from Planck and QUIJOTE data. The results are then compared with those obtained by COMMANDER, based on Bayesian parametric component separation. The CNN successfully recovered the CMB signal for both All Sky and Partial Sky maps showing frequency dependant results, being optimum for central frequencies where there is less contamination by foregrounds emissions such as galactic synchrotron and thermal dust emissions. Recovered maps in temperature are consistent with those obtained by Planck Collaboration, while polarized intensity has been recovered as a new observable. The polarized intensity maps recovered from QUIJOTE experiment are novel and of potential interest to the scientific community for the detection of primordial gravitational waves. The way forward will be to recover the maps at higher NSIDE and make them available to the scientific community.</description>

      <title>The KALEIDOSCOPE survey : A new strong and weak gravitational lensing view of the massive galaxy cluster MACS J1423.8+2404</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined strong and weak gravitational-lensing analysis of the massive galaxy cluster MACS J1423.8+2404 ($z=0.545$, MACS J1423 hereafter), one of the most dynamically relaxed and massive cool-core clusters discovered in the MAssive Cluster Survey at $z&gt;0.5$. We combine high-resolution imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the F606W, F814W, and F160W pass-bands with spectroscopic observations taken as part of the KALEIDOSCOPE survey with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer mounted on the Very Large Telescope. Our strong lensing analysis of the mass distribution in the cluster core is constrained by four multiple-image systems (17 individual images) within redshift range $1.779&lt;z&lt;2.840$. Our weak-lensing analysis of the cluster outskirts, confined to the HST field of view, is based on a background galaxy catalogue with a density of 57 gal.arcmin$^{-2}$. We measure a projected mass of M($\textrm{R}&lt;200$ kpc) = (1.6 $\pm$ 0.05) $\times$ 10$^{14}$ M$_{\rm\odot}$ from our strong-lensing model, and a projected mass of M($\textrm{R}&lt;640$ kpc) = (6.6 $\pm$ 0.6) $\times$ 10$^{14}$ M$_{\rm\odot}$ when combining with our the weak-lensing constraints. Our analysis of the cluster mass distribution yields no evidence of substructures, confirming the dynamically relaxed state of MACS J1423. Our work sets the stage for future analysis of MACS J1423 in the upcoming Canadian Near Infrared Imager and Stiltless Spectrograph Unbiased Cluster Survey for the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>UltraDark.jl: A Julia package for simulation of cosmological scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UltraDark.jl is a Julia package for the simulation of cosmological scalar fields. Scalar fields are proposed solutions to two of the fundamental questions in cosmology: the nature of dark matter and the universe's initial conditions. Modeling their dynamics requires solving the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations, which is analytically challenging. This makes simulations essential to understanding the dynamics of cosmological scalar fields. UltraDark.jl is an open, performant and user friendly option for solving these equations numerically.</description>

      <title>Predictions for the abundance and clustering of H$\alpha$ emitting galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the surface density and clustering bias of H$\alpha$ emitting galaxies for the Euclid and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope redshift surveys using a new calibration of the GALFORM galaxy formation model. We generate 3000 GALFORM models to train an ensemble of deep learning algorithms to create an emulator. We then use this emulator in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) parameter search of an eleven-dimensional parameter space, to find a best-fitting model to a calibration dataset that includes local luminosity function data, and, for the first time, higher redshift data, namely the number counts of H$\alpha$ emitters. We discover tensions when exploring fits for the observational data when applying a heuristic weighting scheme in the MCMC framework. We find improved fits to the H$\alpha$ number counts while maintaining appropriate predictions for the local universe luminosity function. For a flux limited Euclid-like survey to a depth of 2$\times$10$^{-16}$ erg$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ for sources in the redshift range 0.9 &lt; $z$ &lt; 1.8, we estimate 2962-4331 H$\alpha$ emission-line sources deg$^{-2}$. For a Nancy Grace Roman survey, with a flux limit of 1$\times$10$^{-16}$ erg$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a redshift range 1.0 &lt; $z$ &lt; 2.0, we predict 6786-10322 H$\alpha$ emission-line sources deg$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Searching for Parity Violation in SDSS DR16 Lyman-{\alpha} Forest Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The four-point correlation function is the lowest order correlation function for scalar fields that can be used to probe statistical parity invariance in an isotropic universe. There are intriguing claims of detection of parity violation in the 4-point function of BOSS galaxy clustering data. We apply the same estimator to the public SDSS Data Release 16 Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data. Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data probes a different redshift range and is sensitive to a different density regime using a completely different technique. A detection would therefore be a strong indication of new physics. We identify accurate covariance matrix as a crucial impediment to performing this measurement accurately, consistent with existing literature on galaxy 4-point function. We discuss several approaches to estimating the covariance matrix, several of which produce spurious detection. Using a robust, but very suboptimal, covariance matrix derived from subsample bootstrapping, we find no evidence for parity violation.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian space remapping and the angular momentum reconstruction from cosmic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large scale structure provides valuable information of the primordial perturbations that encode the secrets of the origin of the Universe. It is an essential step to map between observables and their initial coordinates, called Lagrangian space, from which primordial perturbations transfer their information to structures via linear theory. By using numerical simulations and state-of-the-art reconstruction techniques, we report the accuracy of estimating the Lagrangian coordinates of galaxies and galaxy clusters, represented by dark matter halos in various ranges of mass, and study the accuracy of this remapping on the angular momentum (spin) reconstruction. Our work shows that galaxy groups and clusters, represented by halos with mass $\gtrsim 10^{13}M_\odot$, can be accurately remapped to Lagrangian space, and their spin reconstruction errors are dominated by the reconstructed initial gravitational potential. For all mass ranges, the errors of Lagrangian remapping, as well as redshift space distortions, play subdominant roles in estimating their angular momenta. This study explains the low correlation level between observed galaxy spins and reconstructed cosmic initial conditions and illustrates the potential of using angular momenta of cosmic structures to improve the reconstruction of primordial perturbations.</description>

      <title>Investigating the accelerated expansion of the Universe through updated constraints on viable $f(R)$ models within the Palatini formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed accelerated expansion of the Universe at present epoch can be explained by some of the $f(R)$ models without invoking the existence of dark energy or any other such exotic component in cosmic fluid. The $f(R)$ models in Palatini formalism is relatively less explored in recent times with respect to their counterpart in metric formalism. We study seven $f(R)$ models in Palatini formalism: Hu-Sawicki (two cases), Starobinsky, exponential, Tsujikawa, $f(R) = R -\beta /R^ n$, and $f(R)= R + \alpha \ln(R) - \beta$. Following standard statistical procedure and utilizing data sets: type Ia supernovae data, cosmic chronometer observations, baryonic acoustic oscillations data, data from H \textsc{ii} starburst galaxies, local measurements of the \emph{Hubble} parameter ($H_{0}$), and distance priors of cosmic microwave background radiation data, we obtain constraints on the model parameters. When compared with the standard `lambda-cold dark matter model', for many data set combinations, the support for $f(R)$ models is significant. We obtain the relevant quantities for characterizing the accelerated expansion of the Universe, and these quantities are consistent with those obtained in a model-independent way by others. The curve of effective/total equation-of-state parameter, obtained from parameter constraints, clearly shows correct phases of the expansion history: the radiation-dominated epochs and the matter-dominated epochs, of the past, and the current accelerated expansion epoch eventually evolving to de-Sitter phase in the distant future. Overall, our results advocate in favour of pursuing $f(R)$ models in Palatini formalism as a potential alternative for explaining accelerated expansion of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Dark photon constraints from CMB temperature anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resonant conversion, within the inter-galactic medium, of regular photons into dark photons amplifies the anisotropy observed in the CMB, thereby imposing stringent constraints on the existence of light dark photons. In this study, we investigate the impact of light dark photons, with masses in the range $3\times 10^{-15} ~\rm{eV} &lt; m_{A'} &lt; 3\times 10^{-12}~\rm{eV}$ on the power spectrum of temperature anisotropies within the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation utilizing the state-of-the-art large-volume FLAMINGO cosmological simulations. Our results show that using full Planck data, one can expect the existing constraints on the dark photon mixing parameter in this mass range to improve by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show why the threshold for primordial black hole formation is universal (independent from the shape of the perturbation) when expressed in terms of the volume averaged compaction function. The proof is rooted in the self-similarity of the gravitational collapse phenomenon at criticality.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-HMC: Parameter Inference with Diffusion Model driven Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion generative models have excelled at diverse image generation and reconstruction tasks across fields. A less explored avenue is their application to discriminative tasks involving regression or classification problems. The cornerstone of modern cosmology is the ability to generate predictions for observed astrophysical fields from theory and constrain physical models from observations using these predictions. This work uses a single diffusion generative model to address these interlinked objectives -- as a surrogate model or emulator for cold dark matter density fields conditional on input cosmological parameters, and as a parameter inference model that solves the inverse problem of constraining the cosmological parameters of an input field. The model is able to emulate fields with summary statistics consistent with those of the simulated target distribution. We then leverage the approximate likelihood of the diffusion generative model to derive tight constraints on cosmology by using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method to sample the posterior on cosmological parameters for a given test image. Finally, we demonstrate that this parameter inference approach is more robust to the addition of noise than baseline parameter inference networks.</description>

      <title>Torsion-rotational transitions in methanol as a probe of fundamental physical constants -- electron and proton masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the using of torsion-rotational transitions in the CH3OH and (13)CH3OH molecules to evaluate possible variations of the physical constant mu=m_e/m_p - the electron-to-proton mass ratio - from spectral observations of emission lines detected in the microwave range towards the dense molecular cloud Orion-KL. An estimate of the upper limit on the relative changes in mu is obtained by two independent ways - with (13)CH3OH lines and with the combination of (13)CH3OH and CH3OH lines. The calculated upper limit Delta mu/mu &lt; 1.1*10^{-8} (1 sigma) is in line with the most stringent constraints on the variability of fundamental physical constants established by other astrophysical methods.</description>

      <title>Relic Neutrino Background from Cosmic-Ray Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the flux of relic neutrino background (R$\nu$B) up-scattered by ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays (CRs) in clusters that act as CR-reservoirs. The long trapping times of UHECRs make this flux larger than that of R$\nu$B up-scattered by UHECRs on their way to Earth, which we also compute. We find that IceCube excludes R$\nu$B weighted overdensities larger than $10^{10}$ in clusters, and that PUEO, RNO-G, GRAND and IceCube-Gen2 will test values down to $10^{8}$. Our treatment incorporates the momentum transfer dependence of the neutrino-nucleus cross section, deep inelastic scattering, a mixed UHECR composition, and flavour information on the up-scattered R$\nu$B fluxes for both cases of neutrino mass spectrum with normal and inverted ordering, providing new handles to possibly disentangle the up-scattered R$\nu$B from cosmogenic neutrinos.</description>

      <title>A Dissipative Dark Cosmology: From Early Matter Dominance to Delayed Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel mechanism for producing dark compact objects and black holes through a dark sector, where all the dark matter can be dissipative. Heavy dark sector particles with masses above $10^4$ GeV can come to dominate the Universe and yield an early matter-dominated era before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Density perturbations in this epoch can grow and collapse into tiny dark matter halos, which cool via self interactions. The typical halo size is set by the Hubble length once perturbations begin growing, offering a straightforward prediction of the halo size and evolution depending on ones choice of dark matter model. Once these primordial halos have formed, a thermal phase transition can then shift the Universe back into radiation domination and standard cosmology. These halos can continue to collapse after BBN, resulting in the late-time formation of fragmented dark compact objects and sub-solar mass primordial black holes. We find that these compact objects can constitute a sizable fraction of all of dark matter. The resulting fragments can have masses between $10^{20}$ g to $10^{32}$ g, with radii ranging from $10^{-2}$ m to $10^5$ m, while the black holes can have masses between $10^{8}$ g to $10^{34}$ g. Furthermore, a unique feature of this model is the late-time formation of black holes which can evaporate away today. We compare where these objects lie with respect to current primordial black hole and MACHO constraints.</description>

      <title>Stochastic star formation and the abundance of $z&gt;10$ UV-bright galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a well-motivated galaxy formation framework to predict stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR), and ultraviolet (UV) luminosities of galaxy populations at redshifts $z\in 5-16$, taking into account stochasticity of SFR in a controlled manner. We demonstrate that the model can match observational estimates of UV luminosity functions (LFs) at $5&lt;z&lt;10$ with a modest level of SFR stochasticity, resulting in the scatter of absolute UV luminosity at a given halo mass of $\sigma_{M_{\rm UV}}\approx 0.75$. To match the observed UV LFs at $z\approx 11-13$ and $z\approx 16$ the SFR stochasticity should increase so that $\sigma_{M_{\rm UV}}\approx 1-1.3$ and $\approx 2$, respectively. Model galaxies at $z\approx 11-13$ have stellar masses and SFRs in good agreement with existing measurements. The median fraction of the baryon budget that was converted into stars, $f_\star$, is only $f_\star\approx 0.005-0.05$, but a small fraction of galaxies at $z=16$ have $f_\star&gt;1$ indicating that SFR stochasticity cannot be higher. We discuss several testable consequences of the increased SFR stochasticity at $z&gt;10$. The increase of SFR stochasticity with increasing $z$, for example, prevents steepening of UV LF and even results in some flattening of UV LF at $z\gtrsim 13$. The median stellar ages of model galaxies at $z\approx 11-16$ are predicted to decrease from $\approx 20-30$ Myr for $M_{\rm UV}\gtrsim -21$ galaxies to $\approx 5-10$ Myr for brighter ones. Likewise, the scatter in median stellar age is predicted to decrease with increasing luminosity. The scatter in the ratio of star formation rates averaged over 10 and 100 Myr should increase with redshift. Fluctuations of ionizing flux should increase at $z&gt;10$ resulting in the increasing scatter in the line fluxes and their ratios for the lines sensitive to ionization parameter.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Forward Modeling of Galaxy Catalogs with Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the accuracy and calibration of the redshift posteriors produced by photometric redshift (photo-z) estimators is vital for enabling precision cosmology and extragalactic astrophysics with modern wide-field photometric surveys. Evaluating photo-z posteriors on a per-galaxy basis is difficult, however, as real galaxies have a true redshift but not a true redshift posterior. We introduce PZFlow, a Python package for the probabilistic forward modeling of galaxy catalogs with normalizing flows. For catalogs simulated with PZFlow, there is a natural notion of "true" redshift posteriors that can be used for photo-z validation. We use PZFlow to simulate a photometric galaxy catalog where each galaxy has a redshift, noisy photometry, shape information, and a true redshift posterior. We also demonstrate the use of an ensemble of normalizing flows for photo-z estimation.

      <title>Time Delay Anomalies of Fuzzy Gravitational Lenses</title>

Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter is a promising alternative to the standard cold dark matter. It has quite recently been noticed, that they can not only successfully explain the large-scale structure in the Universe, but can also solve problems of position and flux anomalies in galaxy strong lensing systems. In this paper we focus on the perturbation of time delays in strong lensing systems caused by fuzzy dark matter, thus making an important extension of previous works. We select a specific system HS 0810+2554 for the study of time delay anomalies. Then, based on the nature of the fuzzy dark matter fluctuations, we obtain theoretical relationship between the magnitude of the perturbation caused by fuzzy dark matter, its content in the galaxy, and its de Broglie wavelength $\lambda _{\mathrm{dB}}$. It turns out that, the perturbation of strong lensing time delays due to fuzzy dark matter quantified as standard deviation is $\sigma_{\Delta t} \propto \lambda _{\mathrm{dB}}^{1.5}$. We also verify our results through simulations. Relatively strong fuzzy dark matter fluctuations in a lensing galaxy make it possible to to destroy the topological structure of the lens system and change the arrival order between the saddle point and the minimum point in the time delays surface. Finally, we stress the unique opportunity for studying properties of fuzzy dark matter created by possible precise time delay measurements from strongly lensed transients like fast radio bursts, supernovae or gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Multiplets as Dark Matter candidates: A brief review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I provide a thorough review of the theoretical and experimental status of ElectroWeak multiplets as Dark Matter candidates, serving as the prototype of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) Dark Matter. Specifically, the examination includes both real SU(2) representations with zero hypercharge and complex ones with $Y\neq 0$. For the first time, all calculable thermal masses for scalar and fermionic WIMPs are computed, incorporating significant non-perturbative non-relativistic effects such as Sommerfeld enhancement and the formation of WIMP bound states. WIMP masses of few hundred TeV are shown to be compatible both with $s$-wave unitarity of the annihilation cross-section, and perturbativity. Additionally, a strategy is outlined for probing these scenarios in the next generation of experiments.</description>

      <title>Cosmological inference from within the peculiar local universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2003.10420v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of 'peculiar' velocities due to the formation of cosmic structure marks a point of discord between the real Universe and the usually assumed Friedmann-Lema\'{i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric which accomodates only the smooth Hubble expansion on large scales. In the standard $\Lambda$CDM model framework, Type Ia supernovae data are routinely "corrected" for the peculiar velocities of both the observer and the supernova host galaxies relative to the cosmic rest frame, in order to infer evidence for acceleration of the expansion rate from their Hubble diagram. However observations indicate a strong, coherent local bulk flow that continues outward without decaying out to a redshift $z \gtrsim 0.1$, contrary to the $\Lambda$CDM expectation. By querying the halo catalogue of the Dark Sky Hubble-volume N-body simulation, we find that an observer placed in an unusual environment like our local Universe should see correlations between supernovae in the JLA catalogue that are 2-8 times stronger than seen by a typical or Copernican observer. This accounts for our finding that peculiar velocity corrections have a large impact on the value of the Cosmological Constant inferred from supernova data. We also demonstrate that local Universe-like observers will infer a downward biased value of the clustering parameter $S_8$ from comparing the density and velocity fields. More realistic modelling of the peculiar local Universe is thus essential for correctly interpreting cosmological data.</description>

      <title>New physics from the polarised light of the cosmic microwave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.13919v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmology requires new physics beyond the Standard Model of elementary particles and fields. What is the fundamental physics behind dark matter and dark energy? What generated the initial fluctuations in the early Universe? Polarised light of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) may hold the key to answers. In this article, we discuss two new developments in this research area. First, if the physics behind dark matter and dark energy violates parity symmetry, their coupling to photons rotates the plane of linear polarisation as the CMB photons travel more than 13 billion years. This effect is known as `cosmic birefringence': space filled with dark matter and dark energy behaves as if it were a birefringent material, like a crystal. A tantalising hint for such a signal has been found with the statistical significance of $3\sigma$. Next, the period of accelerated expansion in the very early Universe, called `cosmic inflation', produced a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GW). What generated GW? The leading idea is vacuum fluctuations in spacetime, but matter fields could also produce a significant amplitude of primordial GW. Finding its origin using CMB polarisation opens a new window into the physics behind inflation. These new scientific targets may influence how data from future CMB experiments are collected, calibrated, and analysed.</description>

      <title>The Host Galaxies of High Velocity Type Ia Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been ample evidence that Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) with high Si 2 velocities near peak brightness are distinguished from SNe Ia of lower velocities and may indeed represent a separate progenitor system. These SNe Ia can contaminate the population of normal events used for cosmological analyses, creating unwanted biases in the final analyses. Given that many current and future surveys using SNe Ia as cosmological probes will not have the resources to take a spectrum of all the events, likely only getting host redshifts long after the SNe Ia have faded, we need to turn to methods that could separate these populations based purely on photometry or host properties. Here, we present a study of a sample of well observed, nearby SNe Ia and their hosts to determine if there are significant enough differences between these populations that can be discerned only from the stellar population properties of their hosts. Our results indicate that the global host properties, including star formation, stellar mass, stellar population age, and dust attenuation, of high velocity SNe Ia do not differ significantly from those of lower velocities. However, we do find that high velocity SNe Ia are more concentrated toward the center of their hosts, suggesting that their local environments may indeed differ. Future work requires strengthening photometric probes of high velocity SNe Ia and their local environments to distinguish these events and determine if they originate from a separate progenitor.</description>

      <title>Methodological refinement of the submillimeter galaxy magnification bias. Paper 0: cross-correlation function measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement of the cross-correlation function is crucial to assess magnification bias in galaxy surveys. Previous works used mini-tile subsampling, but accurately determining the integral constraint (IC) correction for unbiased estimation is challenging due to various factors. We present a new methodology for estimating the cross-correlation function, utilizing full field area and reducing statistical uncertainty. Covariance matrices were estimated by dividing each field into at least five patches using a k-mean clustering algorithm. Robustness was assessed by comparing spectroscopic and photometric lens samples, yielding compatible results. Cross-correlation and auto-correlation analyses in the GAMA fields revealed a stronger signal in GAMA15, likely due to rare large-scale structure combinations. Our findings highlight the robustness of the new methodology and suggest sample-specific effects. Subsequent papers in this series will explore other aspects of magnification bias and address potential biases from the GAMA15 signal on cosmological parameter constraints.</description>

      <title>Methodological refinement of the submillimeter galaxy magnification bias. I. Cosmological analysis with a single redshift bin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this work, the second in a three-paper series, is to test the impact of a methodological improvement in measuring the magnification bias signal on a sample of submillimeter galaxies and its implications for constraining cosmological parameters. The analysis considers the angular cross-correlation function between a foreground sample of GAMA galaxies ($0.2&lt;z&lt;0.8$) and a background sample of H-ATLAS submillimeter galaxies ($1.2&lt;z&lt;4.0$). A refined methodology, discussed extensively in Paper I, is used. By interpreting the weak lensing signal within the halo model and employing an MCMC algorithm, the posterior distribution of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and cosmological parameters is obtained for a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The analysis incorporates the foreground angular auto-correlation function to account for galaxy clustering. The results demonstrate a remarkable improvement in uncertainties for both HOD and cosmological parameters compared to previous studies. However, when using the cross-correlation data alone, the estimation of $\sigma_8$ depends on prior knowledge of $\beta$, the logarithmic slope of the background number counts. Assuming a physically motivated prior distribution for $\beta$, mean values of $\Omega_m=0.18^{+0.03}{-0.03}$ and $\sigma_8=1.04^{+0.11}{-0.07}$ are obtained. These results may however be subject to an inherent bias in the data due to anomalous behavior observed in the G15 field. After excluding the G15 region, the mean values shift to $\Omega_m=0.30^{+0.05}{-0.06}$ and $\sigma_8=0.92^{+0.07}{-0.07}$. This becomes more apparent when adding the clustering of the foreground sample, but the dependence on $\beta$ information disappears, mitigating the aforementioned issue. Excluding the G15 region, the joint analysis yields mean values of $\Omega_m=0.36^{+0.03}{-0.07}$, $\sigma_8=0.90^{+0.03}{-0.03}$, and $h=0.76^{+0.14}_{-0.14}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the operating principle and the first observing run of a novel kind of direct detector for axions and axion-like particles in the galactic halo. Sensitive to the polarisation rotation of linearly polarised laser light induced by an axion field, our experiment is the first detector of its kind collecting scientific data. We discuss our current peak sensitivity of $1.51\times 10^{-10}$ $\text{GeV}^{-1}$ (95 % confidence level) to the axion-photon coupling strength in the axion mass range of $1.97$-$2.01$ $\text{neV}$ which is, for instance, motivated by supersymmetric grand-unified theories. We also report on effects that arise in our high-finesse in-vacuum cavity at an unprecedented optical continuous-wave intensity of $4.7$ $\text{MW/cm}^2$. Our detector already belongs to the most sensitive direct searches within its measurement band, and our results pave the way towards surpassing the current sensitivity limits in the mass range from $10^{-8}$ $\text{eV}$ down to $10^{-16}$ $\text{eV}$ via quantum-enhanced laser interferometry.</description>

      <title>Accuracy requirements on intrinsic alignments for Stage-IV cosmic shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of cosmological weak lensing studies, intrinsic alignments (IAs) are one the most complicated astrophysical systematic to model, given the poor understanding of the physical processes that cause them. A number of modelling frameworks for IAs have been proposed in the literature, both purely phenomenological or grounded on a perturbative treatment of symmetry-based arguments. However, the accuracy with which any of these approaches is able to describe the impact of IAs on cosmic shear data, particularly on the comparatively small scales ($k\simeq 1\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$) to which this observable is sensitive, is not clear. Here we quantify the level of disagreement between the true underlying intrinsic alignments and the theoretical model used to describe them that can be allowed in the context of cosmic shear analyses with future Stage-IV surveys. We consider various models describing this "IA residual", covering both physics-based approaches, as well as completely agnostic prescriptions. The same qualitative results are recovered in all cases explored: for a Stage-IV cosmic shear survey, a mis-modelling of the IA contribution at the $\sim10\%$ level produces shifts of $\lesssim0.5\sigma$ on the final cosmological parameter constraints. Current and future IA models should therefore aim to achieve this level of accuracy, a prospect that is not unfeasible for models with sufficient flexibility.</description>

      <title>Optical Photometric Indicators of Galaxy Cluster Relaxation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most dynamically relaxed clusters of galaxies play a special role in cosmological studies as well as astrophysical studies of the intracluster medium (ICM) and active galactic nucleus feedback. While high spatial resolution imaging of the morphology of the ICM has long been the gold standard for establishing a cluster's dynamical state, such data are not available from current or planned surveys, and thus require separate, pointed follow-up observations. With optical and/or near-IR photometric imaging, and red-sequence cluster finding results from those data, expected to be ubiquitously available for clusters discovered in upcoming optical and mm-wavelength surveys, it is worth asking how effectively photometric data alone can identify relaxed cluster candidates, before investing in, e.g., high-resolution X-ray observations. Here we assess the ability of several simple photometric measurements, based on the redMaPPer cluster finder run on Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, to reproduce X-ray classifications of dynamical state for an X-ray selected sample of massive clusters. We find that two simple metrics contrasting the Bright Central Galaxy (BCG) to other cluster members can identify a complete sample of relaxed clusters with a purity of ~40 per cent in our data set. Including minimal ICM information in the form of a center position increases the purity to ~60 per cent. However, all three metrics depend critically on correctly identifying the BCG, which is presently a challenge for optical red-sequence cluster finders.</description>

      <title>The Noonday Argument: Fine-Graining, Indexicals, and the Nature of Copernican Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.07738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Typicality arguments attempt to use the Copernican Principle to draw conclusions about the cosmos and presently unknown conscious beings within it, including extraterrestrial intelligences (ETI). The most notorious is the Doomsday Argument, which purports to constrain humanity's future from its current lifespan alone. These arguments rest on a likelihood calculation that penalizes models in proportion to the number of distinguishable observers. I argue that such reasoning leads to solipsism, the belief that one is the only being in the world, and is therefore unacceptable. Using variants of the "Sleeping Beauty" thought experiment as a guide, I present a framework for evaluating observations in a large cosmos: Weighted Fine Graining (WFG). WFG requires the construction of specific models of physical outcomes and observations. Valid typicality arguments then emerge from the combinatorial properties of third-person physical microhypotheses. Indexical (observer-relative) facts do not directly constrain physical theories, but instead weight different provisional evaluations of credence. As indexical knowledge changes, the weights shift. I show that the self-applied Doomsday Argument fails in WFG, even though it can work for an external observer. I argue that the Copernican Principle does not let us apply self-observations to constrain ETIs.</description>

Abstract: We show that next generation Cosmic Microwave Background experiments will be capable of the first ever measurement of the inflaton coupling to other particles, opening a new window to probe the connection between cosmic inflation and particle physics. For our analysis we introduce a simple analytic method to estimate the sensitivity of future CMB observations to the reheating temperature and the inflaton coupling. This sensitivity is based on the impact that the reheating phase after cosmic inflation has on the redshifting of cosmic perturbations. Applying our method to LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 we find that, within a given model of inflation, these missions have the potential to impose both an upper and a lower bound on the inflaton coupling. Further improvement can be achieved if CMB data is combined with optical and 21cm surveys. Our results demonstrate the potential of future observations to constrain microphysical parameters that can provide an important clue to understand how a given model of inflation may be embedded in a more fundamental theory of nature.</description>

      <title>Fast radio burst energy function in the presence of $\rm DM_{host}$ variation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been found in great numbers, but the physical mechanism of these sources is still a mystery. The redshift evolutions of the FRB energy distribution function and the volumetric rate shed light on the origin of FRBs. However, such estimations rely on the dispersion measurement (DM)-redshift ($z$) relationship. A few FRBs that have been detected recently show large excess DMs beyond the expectation from the cosmological and Milky Way contributions, which indicates large spread of DMs from their host galaxies. In this work, we adopt two lognormal-distributed ${\rm DM}_{\rm host}$ models and estimate the energy function using the non-repeating FRBs selected from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)/FRB Catalog 1. By comparing the lognormal-distributed ${\rm DM}_{\rm host}$ models to a constant ${\rm DM}_{\rm host}$ model, the FRB energy function results are consistent within the measurement uncertainty. We also estimate the volumetric rate of the non-repeating FRBs in three different redshift bins. The volumetric rate shows that the trend is consistent with the stellar-mass density redshift evolution. Since the lognormal-distributed ${\rm DM}_{\rm host}$ model increases the measurement errors, the inference of FRBs tracking the stellar-mass density is nonetheless undermined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate scalar field theories coupled non-conformally to gravity in a manifestly frame-independent fashion. Physical quantities such as the $S$ matrix should be invariant under field redefinitions, and hence can be represented by the geometry of the target space. This elegant geometric formulation, however, is obscured when considering the coupling to gravity because of the redundancy associated with the Weyl transformation. The well-known example is the Higgs inflation, where the target space of the Higgs fields is flat in the Jordan frame but is curved in the Einstein frame. Furthermore, one can even show that any geometry of O$(N)$ nonlinear $\sigma$ models can be flattened by an appropriate Weyl transformation. In this Letter, we extend the notion of the target space by including the conformal mode of the metric, and show that the extended geometry provides a compact formulation that is manifestly Weyl-transformation/field-redefinition invariant. We identify the cutoff scale with the inverse of square root of the extended target space curvature and confirm that it coincides with that obtained from two-to-two scattering amplitudes based on our formalism.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) resulting from extremely large amplitudes of initial fluctuations in a radiation-dominated universe. We find that, for a sufficiently large initial amplitude, the configuration of trapping horizons shows characteristic structure due to the existence of bifurcating trapping horizons. We call this structure of the trapping horizons "Type II PBH", while the structure without a bifurcating trapping horizon "Type I PBH", which is typically generated from a relatively small amplitude of the initial fluctuation. In Ref.[1], in the dust-dominated universe, the Type II PBH can be realized by the Type II initial fluctuation, which is characterized by a non-monotonic areal radius as a function of the radial coordinate (throat structure) in contrast with the standard case with a monotonic areal radius (Type I fluctuation). Our research reveals that a type II fluctuation does not necessarily result in a type II PBH in the case of the radiation fluid. We also find that for the initial amplitude well above the threshold value, the resulting PBH mass may either increase or decrease with the initial amplitude depending on its specific profile rather than its fluctuation type.</description>

      <title>Dark matter and space-time symmetry restoration</title>

Abstract: We examine local physics in the presence of global variables: variables associated with the whole of the spacelike surfaces of a foliation. These could be the (pseudo-)constants of nature and their conjugate times, but our statements are more general. Interactions between the local and the global (for example, dependence of the local action on global times dual to constants) degrades full space-time diffeomorphism invariance down to spatial diffeomorphism invariance, and so an extra degree of freedom appears. When these presumably primordial global interactions switch off, the local action recovers full invariance and so the usual two gravitons, but a legacy matter component is left over, bearing the extra degree of freedom. Under the assumption that the preferred foliation is geodesic, this component behaves like dark matter, except that 3 of its 4 local degrees of freedom are frozen, forcing its rest frame to coincide with the preferred foliation. The non-frozen degree of freedom (the number density of the effective fluid) is the survivor of the extra "graviton" present in the initial theory, and keeps memory of all the past global interactions that took place in a given location in the preferred foliation. Such "painted-on" dark matter is best distinguished from the conventional one in situations where the preferred frame would be preposterous if all 4 degrees of freedom of dark matter were available. We provide one example: an outflowing halo of legacy matter with exact escape speed at each point and a very specific profile, surrounding a condensed structure made of normal matter.</description>
