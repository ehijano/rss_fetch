      <title>Consensus ranking by quantum annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consensus ranking is a technique used to derive a single ranking that best represents the preferences of multiple individuals or systems. It aims to aggregate different rankings into one that minimizes overall disagreement or distance from each of the individual rankings. Kemeny ranking aggregation, in particular, is a widely used method in decision-making and social choice, with applications ranging from search engines to music recommendation systems. It seeks to determine a consensus ranking of a set of candidates based on the preferences of a group of individuals. However, existing quantum annealing algorithms face challenges in efficiently processing large datasets with many candidates. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the performance of quantum annealing for Kemeny rank aggregation. Our approach identifies the pairwise preference matrix that represents the solution list and subsequently reconstructs the ranking using classical methods. This method already yields better results than existing approaches. Furthermore, we present a range of enhancements that significantly improve the proposed method's performance, thereby increasing the number of candidates that can be effectively handled. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of our approach by comparing its performance and execution time with that of KwikSort, a well-known approximate algorithm.</description>

      <title>Modular Compilation for Quantum Chiplet Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum computing technology continues to mature, industry is adopting modular quantum architectures to keep quantum scaling on the projected path and meet performance targets. However, the complexity of chiplet-based quantum devices, coupled with their growing size, presents an imminent scalability challenge for quantum compilation. Contemporary compilation methods are not well-suited to chiplet architectures. In particular, existing qubit allocation methods are often unable to contend with inter-chiplet links, which don't necessary support a universal basis gate set. Furthermore, existing methods of logical-to-physical qubit placement, swap insertion (routing), unitary synthesis, and/or optimization are typically not designed for qubit links of wildly varying levels of duration or fidelity. In this work, we propose SEQC, a complete and parallelized compilation pipeline optimized for chiplet-based quantum computers, including several novel methods for qubit placement, qubit routing, and circuit optimization. SEQC attains up to a 36% increase in circuit fidelity, accompanied by execution time improvements of up to 1.92x. Additionally, owning to its ability to parallelize compilation, SEQC achieves consistent solve time improvements of 2-4x over a chiplet-aware Qiskit baseline.</description>

      <title>Efficient Shape Reconfiguration by Hybrid Programmable Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shape formation is one of the most thoroughly studied problems in most algorithmic models of programmable matter. However, few existing shape formation algorithms utilize similarities between an initial configuration and a desired target shape. In the hybrid model, an active agent with the computational capabilities of a deterministic finite automaton can form shapes by lifting and placing passive tiles on the triangular lattice. We study the shape reconfiguration problem where the agent needs to move all tiles in an input shape to so-called target nodes, which are distinguishable from other nodes by the agent. We present a worst-case optimal $O(mn)$ algorithm for simply connected target shapes and an $O(n^4)$ algorithm for a large class of target shapes that may contain holes, where $m$ is the initial number of unoccupied target nodes and $n$ is the total number of tiles.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Security for Ambient-Powered Programmable Reflections with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ambient Internet-of-Things (AIoT) form a new class of emerging technology that promises to deliver pervasive wireless connectivity to previously disconnected devices and products, assisting dependent industries (for example, supply chain, clothing, remote surveillance, climate monitoring, and sensors) to obtain granular real-time service visibility. Such ultra-low complexity and power consumption devices, that are either battery-less or have the capability for limited energy storage, can provide data feeds about the condition of any aspect (e.g., an environment or an item) that is being monitored, enabling proactive or reactive control by any application server. Although the security of data involving AIoT devices is critical for key decisions of any dependent operational system, the implementation of resource intensive cryptographic algorithms and other security mechanisms becomes nearly infeasible, or very challenging, due to the device energy and computational limitations. In this article, we present a lightweight security solution that enables confidentiality, integrity, and privacy protection in wireless links including AIoT. We consider, as a case study, an ambient-powered Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) that harvests energy from its incident radio waves to realize programmable reflective beamforming, enabling the communication between a Base Station (BS) and end-user terminals. The proposed lightweight security solution is applied to the control channel between the BS and the RIS controller which is responsible for the metasurface's dynamic management and phase configuration optimization.</description>
