      <title>Semi-Gridless Variational Bayes Channel Estimation in XL-MIMO: Near-Field Modeling and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large antenna arrays and high-frequency operation are two key technologies that advance performance metrics such as higher data rates, lower latency, and wider coverage in sixth-generation communications. However, the adoption of these technologies fundamentally changes the characteristics of wavefronts, forcing communication systems to operate in the near-field region. The transition from planar far-field communications to spherical near-field propagation necessitates novel channel estimation algorithms to fully exploit the unique features of spherical wavefronts for advanced transceiver design. To this end, we propose a novel semi-gridless channel estimation approach based on a variational Bayesian (VB) inference framework. Specifically, we reformulate the near-field channel model for both uniform linear arrays and uniform planar arrays into separate direction-of-arrival (DoAs) and distance components. Building on these new representations, we employ a gridless approach for DoAs estimation using a von Mises distribution, and a coarse-to-fine grid search for distance estimation. We then develop a semi-gridless variational Bayesian (SG-VB) algorithm with efficient update rules that enables accurate channel reconstruction. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SG-VB algorithm, demonstrating enhanced near-field channel reconstruction accuracy and superior estimation performance for both DoAs and distance components embedded in near-field channels.</description>

      <title>Delay-Synchronous Wideband Channel Sounding Using Off-The-Shelf Multi-Antenna WiFi Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that WiFi devices enable sensing of environments and targets through their channel state information. However, the same devices have not been used for delay-synchronous channel sounding due to challenges related to the stability of synchronization and lack of reference power levels. Due to factors such as uncertainty in symbol reception timing, impulse responses are discontinuous across acquisitions. The present paper addresses the challenges to perform delay-synchronous channel sounding using off-the-shelf multiple-antenna IEEE 802.11ax WiFi devices, referred to as SoundiFi. Stable delay synchronization and power level reference are realized by remoting the antennas with coaxial cables and devoting one of the antennas as a reference channel, with which the gain and delay of other simultaneous channels are defined. Indoor experiments confirmed that the impulse response becomes continuous across successive acquisitions and provide the absolute delay. The impulse response has a noise level at -115 dB, indicating the maximum path gain value that can be measured with the devices. The impulse response also revealed the existence of long-delayed multipaths up to 132 m propagation distance in a reverberant 30-m-long corridor.</description>

      <title>Pinching Antennas for Multiple Access in Multigroup Multicast Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to design multiple access (MA) schemes to improve the max-min fairness (MMF) for pinching antennas (PAs)-based multigroup multicast communications, where PA placement and resource allocation are jointly optimized. Specifically, three MA schemes are considered to facilitate the multicast transmission: i) treating interference as noise (TIN), ii) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and iii) time-division multiple access (TDMA) with two PA reconfiguration protocols, namely pinching switching (PS) and pinching multiplexing (PM). i) For TIN, a closed-form solution is derived for optimal power allocation, while a sequential element-wise optimization (SEO) is developed for the PA placement. ii) For NOMA, a recursive power allocation framework incorporating a bisection search is developed, and a hierarchical objective evaluation (HOE) mechanism is incorporated to simplify the SEO process for PA location update. iii) For TDMA, the PS protocol allows the PA locations to be optimized separately using the SEO method, after which the time-power allocation is solved as a convex problem with a global optimum. Under the PM protocol, the PA locations are jointly optimized with the time-power resources through a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-based analytical solution. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the pinching-antenna system (PASS) architecture significantly outperforms traditional fixed-antenna systems. ii) TDMA-PS achieves superior performance by fully leveraging the flexible PA reconfiguration and benefiting from interference-free transmission, whereas TIN serves as a practical lower-bound solution due to its simplicity despite its limited performance. iii) NOMA consistently outperforms TDMA-PM and, in high transmit power regimes with heterogeneous multicast group distributions, can even surpass the performance achieved by TDMA-PS.</description>

      <title>Score-Based Conditional Flow Models for MIMO Receiver Design with Superimposed Pilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is vital for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, superimposed pilots (SIP), which reduce overhead, introduce severe pilot contamination and data interference, complicating joint channel estimation and data detection. This paper proposes a conditional flow matching receiver (CFM-Rx), an unsupervised generative framework that learns directly from received signals, eliminating the need for labeled data and improving adaptability across diverse system settings. By leveraging flow-based generative modeling, CFM-Rx enables deterministic, low-latency inference and exploits model invertibility to capture the bidirectional nature of signal propagation. This framework unifies flow matching with score-based diffusion modeling via a moment-consistent ordinary differential equation (ODE), replacing stochastic differential equation (SDE) sampling with a deterministic and efficient process. Furthermore, it integrates receiver-side priors to ensure stable, data-consistent inference. Extensive simulation results across various MIMO configurations demonstrate that CFM-Rx consistently outperforms conventional estimators and state-of-the-art data-driven receivers, achieving notable gains in channel estimation accuracy and symbol detection robustness, particularly under severe pilot contamination.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Low-Overhead Beam Alignment for mmWave Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave massive multiple-input multiple-output systems employ highly directional beamforming to overcome severe path loss, and their performance critically depends on accurate beam alignment. Conventional codebook-based methods offer low training overhead but suffer from limited angular resolution and sensitivity to hardware impairments. To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning-enhanced super-resolution beam alignment framework with three key components. First, we design the Quaternary Search-based Super-Resolution (QSSR) algorithm, which leverages the monotonic power ratio property between two discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook beams to achieve super-resolution angle estimation without increasing measurement complexity relative to binary search. Second, we develop QSSR-Net, a gated recurrent unit-based neural network that exploits sequential multi-layer beam measurements to capture angular dependencies, thereby improving estimation accuracy, robustness to noise, and generalization across diverse propagation environments. Third, to mitigate the adverse effects of hardware impairments such as antenna position and phase errors, we propose a parametric self-calibration method that requires no additional hardware overhead and adapts compensation parameters in real time. Simulation results show that the proposed framework consistently outperforms binary search and even exhaustive search at high signal-to-noise ratios, achieving substantial performance gains while maintaining low overhead.</description>

      <title>Dual-Hop Joint Visible Light and Backscatter Communication Relaying under Finite Blocklength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a dual-hop joint visible light communication (VLC) and backscatter communication (BC) relaying framework under the finite blocklength (FBL) constraint, aiming at energy-neutral Ambient Internet of Things (A-IoT) deployments. In the proposed system, indoor LED access points are used to simultaneously provide illumination and transmit information over light to a backscatter device (BD), which harvests optical energy and backscatters the received messages to user equipments (UEs) equipped with radio frequency (RF) front ends. This forwarding of the information from VLC to RF channels is implemented without the need for carrier synthesizers and power amplifiers at the IoT node. By modeling the end-to-end communication link with short-packet IoT traffic and realistic levels of interference between adjacent VLC coverage areas, we analyze the outage performance and achievable data rate of the proposed system. Simulation results demonstrate that key factors, such as placement and orientation of the BD, as well as the selected code rate of the system affect reliability and data rate that can be achieved for communication purposes. The insights gained from this study pave the way for ambient power-enabled IoT solutions and future hybrid VLC/RF network designs.</description>

      <title>Availability of Aerial Heterogeneous Networks for Reliable Emergency Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate network availability (NA) in aerial heterogeneous networks (AHetNets) for effective emergency rescue, where diverse delay-constrained communication services must be provided to user equipments (UEs) with varying mobility. The heterogeneity in delay constraints and UE mobility introduces resource allocation conflicts and imbalances, which undermine communication reliability and challenge NA. Although unified resource allocation (URA) can mitigate these issues, it remains unclear whether NA can be sustained under such diverse conditions. To address this, we derive expressions for the lower bound (LB) on NA in AHetNets under URA. Our analysis reveals that extended heterogeneity significantly degrades the LB due to resource limitations-even when the heterogeneity stems from additional services under less stringent delay constraints (LSDC) or from UEs with lower mobility. To overcome this degradation, we formulate and solve a joint optimization problem for the number of UEs sharing time-frequency resources ($K$) and pilot length ($\xi$), aiming to enhance the LB by improving spatial, frequency, and temporal resource efficiency. Simulation results validate our analysis and demonstrate that jointly optimizing $K$ and $\xi$ enables AHetNets to achieve the target NA under greater heterogeneity, outperforming existing resource allocation policies.</description>

      <title>Cross-Pilot Superposition for Fractional Parameter Estimation in DoA-Aided OTFS Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, a novel superimposed pilot scheme is proposed for channel estimation in multi-antenna orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) receivers. Under the assumption of a large uniform linear array (ULA) size at the receiver, the multipath components are separated directly in the angular domain. It is then shown that the proposed superimposed pilot scheme enables the computation of integrated delay and Doppler profiles by averaging the received delay-Doppler matrix across the Doppler and delay axes, respectively. This procedure helps reduce data-to-pilot interference through data averaging. Moreover, it is demonstrated that fractional delays and Dopplers of the multipath components can be estimated by correlating the integrated delay and Doppler profiles with the corresponding delay/Doppler terms. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing OTFS superimposed pilot schemes, achieving a lower bit error rate (BER) while exhibiting a trade-off between peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and communication performance.</description>

      <title>Leaky Coaxial Cable based Generalized Pinching-Antenna Systems with Dual-Port Feeding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By leveraging the distributed leakage radiation of leaky coaxial cables (LCXs), the concept of pinching antennas can be generalized from the conventional high-frequency waveguide based architectures to cable based structures in lower-frequency scenarios. This paper investigates an LCX based generalized pinching-antenna system with dual-port feeding. By enabling bidirectional excitation along each cable, the proposed design significantly enhances spatial degrees of freedom. A comprehensive channel model is developed to characterize intra-cable attenuation, bidirectional phase progression, slot based radiation, and wireless propagation. Based on this model, both analog and hybrid beamforming frameworks are studied with the objective of maximizing the minimum achievable data rate. For analog transmission, slot activation, port selection, and power allocation are jointly optimized using matching theory, coalitional games, and bisection based power control. For hybrid transmission, zero-forcing (ZF) digital precoding is incorporated to eliminate inter-user interference, thereby simplifying slot activation and enabling closed-form optimal power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that dual-port feeding provides notable performance gains over single-port LCX systems and fixed-antenna benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of the proposed beamforming and resource allocation designs under various transmit power levels and cable parameters.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Human Body-coupled Electric Field Interference in Unshielded Ultra-Low Field MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portable ultra-low field MRI (ULF-MRI) systems operated in unshielded environments are susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI). Subject presence in the imaging region will lead to substantial noise increases, yet the dominant coupling mechanism remains insufficiently characterized. We develop a lumped-parameter circuit model of the coupled environment-body-receiver system. The model indicates that ambient time-varying electric fields induce a body common-mode potential, which is converted into differential-mode noise through capacitive imbalance between the head and the receive-coil terminals, yielding strong dependence on subject position and geometry. Circuit analysis, simulations, and controlled experiments support the model, with predicted imbalance consistent with measured noise variations. Guided by this mechanism, we implement a capacitive low-impedance bypass to clamp the body potential, achieving an approximately 3.5-fold SNR improvement on a 50 mT prototype. The proposed model offers a compact circuit-based tool for analyzing and mitigating human body-coupled electric-field interference in portable ULF-MRI.</description>

      <title>A sliding-window approach for latent restoring force modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restoring force surface (RFS) methods offer an attractive nonparametric framework for identifying nonlinear restoring forces directly from data, but their reliance on complete kinematic measurements at each degree of freedom limits scalability to multidimensional systems. The aim of this paper is to overcome these measurement limitations by proposing an identification framework with relaxed sensing requirements that exploits periodic multisine excitation. Starting from an initial linear model, a sliding-window feedback approach reconstructs latent states and nonlinear restoring forces nonparametrically, enabling identification of the nonlinear component through linear-in-parameters regression instead of highly non-convex optimization. Validation on synthetic and experimental datasets demonstrates high simulation accuracy and reliable recovery of physical parameters under partial sensing and noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Analyzing URA Geometry for Enhanced Near-Field Beamfocusing and Spatial Degrees of Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the deployment of large antenna arrays at high-frequency bands, future wireless communication systems are likely to operate in the radiative near-field. Unlike far-field beam steering, near-field beams can be focused on a spatial region with a finite depth, enabling spatial multiplexing in the range dimension. Moreover, in the line-of-sight MIMO near-field, multiple spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) are accessible, akin to a scattering- rich environment. In this paper, we derive the beamdepth for a generalized uniform rectangular array (URA) and investigate how the array geometry influences near-field beamdepth and its limits. We define the effective beamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD), to present a near-field boundary with respect to beamfocusing and spatial multiplexing gains for the generalized URA. Our results demonstrate that under a fixed element count constraint, the array geometry has a strong impact on beamdepth, whereas this effect diminishes under a fixed aperture length constraint. Moreover, compared to uniform square arrays, elongated configurations such as uniform linear arrays (ULAs) yield narrower beamdepth and extend the effective near-field region defined by the EBRD. Building on these insights, we design a polar codebook for compressed-sensing-based channel estimation that leverages our findings. Simulation results show that the proposed polar codebook achieves a 2 dB NMSE improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we present an analytical expression to quantify the effective spatial DoF in the near-field, revealing that they are also constrained by the EBRD. Notably, the maximum spatial DoF is achieved with a ULA configuration, outperforming a square URA in this regard.</description>

      <title>Spatial Degrees of Freedom in Near Field MIMO: Experimental Validation of Beamspace Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional far-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels are limited to a single spatial degree of freedom (DoF) under a line-of-sight (LoS) condition. In contrast, the radiative near field (NF) supports multiple spatial DoF, enabled by spherical wavefronts and the reduced spatial footprint at short ranges. While recent research indicates that the effective DoF (EDoF) increases in NF, experimental validation and clear identification of the transition distances remain limited. In this letter, we develop an intuitive framework for characterizing the EDoF of a ULA-based MIMO system and derive two complementary analytical expressions: a closed-form formulation that relates the EDoF to the physical transmit beamwidth and receive aperture, and a discrete formulation based on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) domain angular decomposition of the NF spherical wavefront, which is well suited for experimental evaluation. We further introduce the effective MIMO Rayleigh distance (EMRD) and the maximum spatial multiplexing distance (MSMD), which mark the distances where the EDoF reduces to one and attains its maximum, respectively. Experimental measurements using widely spaced phased arrays closely match the theoretical EDoF trends and validate the proposed distance metrics.</description>

      <title>Sparse Array Design for Near-Field MU-MIMO: Reconfigurable Array Thinning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless networks, deploying thousands of antenna elements, may operate in the radiative near-field (NF), enabling spatial multiplexing across both angle and range domains. Sparse arrays have the potential to achieve comparable performance with fewer antenna elements. However, fixed sparse array designs are generally suboptimal under dynamic user distributions, while movable antenna architectures rely on mechanically reconfigurable elements, introducing latency and increased hardware complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a reconfigurable array thinning approach that selectively activates a subset of antennas to form a flexible sparse array design without physical repositioning. We first analyze grating lobes for uniform sparse arrays in the angle and range domains, showing their absence along the range dimension. Based on the analysis, we develop two particle swarm optimization-based strategies: a grating-lobe-based thinned array (GTA) for grating- lobe suppression and a sum-rate-based thinned array (STA) for multiuser sum-rate maximization. Simulation results demonstrate that GTA outperforms conventional uniform sparse arrays, while STA achieves performance comparable to movable antennas, thereby offering a practical and efficient array deployment strategy without the associated mechanical complexity.</description>

      <title>Transmission Delay Minimization for NOMA-Based F-RANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based low-delay service framework is proposed for fog radio access networks (F-RANs). Fog access points (FAPs) leverage NOMA for local delivery of cached content, while the cloud access point employs NOMA to simultaneously push content to FAPs and directly serve users. Based on this model, a delay minimization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing user association, cache placement, and power allocation. To address this non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed, which decomposes the original problem into two subproblems, namely joint user association and cache placement, and power allocation. In particular, a low-complexity algorithm is designed to optimizing the user association and cache placement strategy using the McCormick envelope theory and Lagrangian partial relaxation. The power allocation is optimized by invoking the successive convex approximation. Simulation results reveal that: 1) the proposed AO-based algorithm effectively balances between the achieved performance and computational efficiency, and 2) the proposed NOMA-based F-RANs framework significantly outperforms orthogonal multiple access-based F-RANs systems in terms of average transmission delay in different scenarios.</description>

      <title>An index of effective number of variables for uncertainty and reliability analysis in model selection problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An index of an effective number of variables (ENV) is introduced for model selection in nested models. This is the case, for instance, when we have to decide the order of a polynomial function or the number of bases in a nonlinear regression, choose the number of clusters in a clustering problem, or the number of features in a variable selection application (to name few examples). It is inspired by the idea of the maximum area under the curve (AUC). The interpretation of the ENV index is identical to the effective sample size (ESS) indices concerning a set of samples. The ENV index improves {drawbacks of} the elbow detectors described in the literature and introduces different confidence measures of the proposed solution. These novel measures can be also employed jointly with the use of different information criteria, such as the well-known AIC and BIC, or any other model selection procedures. Comparisons with classical and recent schemes are provided in different experiments involving real datasets. Related Matlab code is given.</description>

      <title>A Knowledge-Driven Approach to Music Segmentation, Music Source Separation and Cinematic Audio Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a knowledge-driven, model-based approach to segmenting audio into single-category and mixed-category chunks with applications to source separation. "Knowledge" here denotes information associated with the data, such as music scores. "Model" here refers to tool that can be used for audio segmentation and recognition, such as hidden Markov models. In contrast to conventional learning that often relies on annotated data with given segment categories and their corresponding boundaries to guide the learning process, the proposed framework does not depend on any pre-segmented training data and learns directly from the input audio and its related knowledge sources to build all necessary models autonomously. Evaluation on simulation data shows that score-guided learning achieves very good music segmentation and separation results. Tested on movie track data for cinematic audio source separation also shows that utilizing sound category knowledge achieves better separation results than those obtained with data-driven techniques without using such information.</description>

      <title>From Specialist to Large Models: A Paradigm Evolution Towards Semantic-Aware MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) network is expected to deploy larger multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) arrays to support massive connectivity, which will increase overhead and latency at the physical layer. Meanwhile, emerging 6G demands such as immersive communications and environmental sensing pose challenges to traditional signal processing. To address these issues, we propose the ``semantic-aware MIMO'' paradigm, which leverages specialist models and large models to perceive, utilize, and fuse the inherent semantics of channels and sources for improved performance. Moreover, for representative MIMO physical-layer tasks, e.g., random access activity detection, channel feedback, and precoding, we design specialist models that exploit channel and source semantics for better performance. Additionally, in view of the more diversified functions of 6G MIMO, we further explore large models as a scalable solution for multi-task semantic-aware MIMO and review recent advances along with their advantages and limitations. Finally, we discuss the challenges, insights, and prospects of the evolution of specialist models and large models empowered semantic-aware MIMO paradigms.</description>

      <title>Pilot-Free Optimal Control over Wireless Networks: A Control-Aided Channel Prediction Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recurring theme in optimal controller design for wireless networked control systems (WNCS) is the reliance on real-time channel state information (CSI). However, acquiring accurate CSI a priori is notoriously challenging due to the time-varying nature of wireless channels. In this work, we propose a pilot-free framework for optimal control over wireless channels in which control commands are generated from plant states together with control-aided channel prediction. For linear plants operating over an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) architecture, channel prediction is performed via a Kalman filter (KF), and the optimal control policy is derived from the Bellman principle. To alleviate the curse of dimensionality in computing the optimal control policy, we approximate the solution using a coupled algebraic Riccati equation (CARE), which can be computed efficiently via a stochastic approximation (SA) algorithm. Rigorous performance guarantees are established by proving the stability of both the channel predictor and the closed-loop system under the resulting control policy, providing sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a stabilizing approximate CARE solution, and establishing convergence of the SA-based control algorithm. The framework is further extended to nonlinear plants under general wireless architectures by combining a KalmanNet-based predictor with a Markov-modulated deep deterministic policy gradient (MM-DDPG) controller. Numerical results show that the proposed pilot-free approach outperforms benchmark schemes in both control performance and channel prediction accuracy for linear and nonlinear scenarios.</description>

      <title>A time-to-digital converter with steady calibration through single-photon detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-to-Digital Converters (TDCs) are a crucial tool in a wide array of fields, in particular for quantum communication, where time taggers performance can severely affect the quality of the entire application. Nowadays, FPGA-based TDCs present a viable alternative to ASIC ones, once the non-linear behavior due to the intrinsic nature of the device is properly mitigated. To compensate for said nonlinearities, a calibration procedure is required, which should be maintained throughout its runtime. Here we present the design and the demonstration of a TDC that is FPGA-based showing a residual FWHM jitter of 27 ps, that is scalable for multichannel operation. The target application in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is discussed with a calibration method based on the exploitation of single-photon detection that does not require stopping the data acquisition or using any estimation methods, thus increasing accuracy and removing data loss. The calibration was tested in a relevant environment, investigating the behavior of the device between 5 {\deg}C and 80 {\deg}C. Moreover, our design is capable of continuously streaming up to 12 Mevents/s for up to ~1 week without the TDC overflowing making it ready for a real-life scenario deployment.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Sample Size in Reconstructing Noisy Graph Signals: A Theoretical Characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing a signal on a graph from noisy observations of a subset of the vertices is a fundamental problem in the field of graph signal processing. This paper investigates how sample size affects reconstruction error in the presence of noise via an in-depth theoretical analysis of the two most common reconstruction methods in the literature, least-squares reconstruction (LS) and graph-Laplacian regularised reconstruction (GLR). Our theorems show that at sufficiently low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), under these reconstruction methods we may simultaneously decrease sample size and decrease average reconstruction error. We further show that at sufficiently low SNRs, for LS reconstruction we have a $\Lambda$-shaped error curve and for GLR reconstruction, a sample size of $ O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the total number of vertices, results in lower reconstruction error than near full observation. We present thresholds on the SNRs, $\tau$ and $\tau_{GLR}$, below which the error is non-monotonic, and illustrate these theoretical results with experiments across multiple random graph models, sampling schemes and SNRs. These results demonstrate that any decision in sample-size choice has to be made in light of the noise levels in the data.</description>

      <title>Improving Convergence for Semi-Federated Learning: An Energy-Efficient Approach by Manipulating Over-the-Air Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid learning framework that combines federated and split learning, termed semi-federated learning (SemiFL), in which over-the-air computation is utilized for gradient aggregation. A key idea is to strategically adjust the learning rate by manipulating over-the-air distortion for improving SemiFL's convergence. Specifically, we intentionally amplify amplitude distortion to increase the learning rate in the non-stable region, thereby accelerating convergence and reducing communication energy consumption. In the stable region, we suppress noise perturbation to maintain a small learning rate for improving SemiFL's final convergence. Theoretical results demonstrate the antagonistic effects of over-the-air distortion in different regions, under both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data settings. Then, we formulate two energy consumption minimization problems, one for each region, which implements a two-region mean square error threshold configuration scheme. Accordingly, we propose two resource allocation algorithms with closed-form solutions. Simulation results show that under different network and data distribution conditions, strategically manipulating over-the-air distortion can efficiently adjust the learning rate to improve SemiFL's convergence. Moreover, energy consumption can be reduced by using the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram~(ECG), a key bioelectrical time-series signal, is crucial for assessing cardiac health and diagnosing various diseases. Given its time-series format, ECG data is often incorporated into pre-training datasets for large-scale time-series model training. However, existing studies often overlook its unique characteristics and specialized downstream applications, which differ significantly from other time-series data, leading to an incomplete understanding of its properties. In this paper, we present an in-depth investigation of ECG signals and establish a comprehensive benchmark, which includes (1) categorizing its downstream applications into four distinct evaluation tasks, (2) identifying limitations in traditional evaluation metrics for ECG analysis, and introducing a novel metric; (3) benchmarking state-of-the-art time-series models and proposing a new architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed benchmark is comprehensive and robust. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed metric and model architecture, which establish a solid foundation for advancing research in ECG signal analysis.</description>

      <title>Comparing Implicit Neural Representations and B-Splines for Continuous Function Fitting from Sparse Samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous signal representations are naturally suited for inverse problems, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography, because the measurements depend on an underlying physically continuous signal. While classical methods rely on predefined analytical bases like B-splines, implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative that use coordinate-based networks to parameterize continuous functions with implicitly defined bases. Despite their empirical success, direct comparisons of their intrinsic representation capabilities with conventional models remain limited. This preliminary empirical study compares a positional-encoded INR with a cubic B-spline model for continuous function fitting from sparse random samples, isolating the representation capacity difference by only using coefficient-domain Tikhonov regularization. Results demonstrate that, under oracle hyperparameter selection, the INR achieves a lower normalized root-mean-squared error, yielding sharper edge transitions and fewer oscillatory artifacts than the oracle-tuned B-spline model. Additionally, we show that a practical bilevel optimization framework for INR hyperparameter selection based on measurement data split effectively approximates oracle performance. These findings empirically support the superior representation capacity of INRs for sparse data fitting.</description>

      <title>Synapse-Inspired Energy Networks: A Neuromorphic Approach to Microgrid Protection without Communication Links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional protection systems for microgrids, which rely on high fault currents and continuous communication, struggle to keep up with the changing dynamics and cybersecurity concerns of decentralized networks. In this study, we introduce a novel biologically inspired protection system based on neuromorphic principles, where each distributed energy resource (DER) functions as a simple neuron. These neurons process local changes in voltage, current signals, and converting them into spike patterns that represent the severity of disturbances. Just as neurons communicate via synapses in biological systems, we exploit transmission cables to coordinate between DERs, enabling them to share information and respond to faults collectively. Fault detection and circuit breaker activation are driven by a First-To-Spike (FTTS) mechanism, similar to the concept of traveling wave protection, but without needing GPS synchronization or communication links. A key innovation is the ability to use the timing of spikes to locally determine the nature of a fault, offering an intelligent, adaptive response to disturbances. Performance shows tripping latency of 10-58 ms, surpassing conventional relays and even traveling-wave methods (60 ms), while maintaining detection accuracy above 98% and spatial selectivity over 97%, enabling real-time, communication-free, scalable protection for plug-and-play microgrids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network device and system health management is the foundation of modern network operations and maintenance. Traditional health management methods, relying on expert identification or simple rule-based algorithms, struggle to cope with the heterogeneous networks (HNs) environment. Moreover, current state-of-the-art distributed fault diagnosis methods, which utilize specific machine learning techniques, lack multi-scale adaptivity for heterogeneous device information, resulting in unsatisfactory diagnostic accuracy for HNs. In this paper, we develop an LLM-assisted end-to-end intelligent network health management framework. The framework first proposes a multi-scale data scaling method based on unsupervised learning to address the multi-scale data problem in HNs. Secondly, we combine the semantic rule tree with the attention mechanism to propose a Multi-Scale Semanticized Anomaly Detection Model (MSADM) that generates network semantic information while detecting anomalies. Finally, we embed a chain-of-thought-based large-scale language model downstream to adaptively analyze the fault diagnosis results and create an analysis report containing detailed fault information and optimization strategies. We compare our scheme with other fault diagnosis models and demonstrate that it performs well on several metrics of network fault diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Nash Equilibria with Black-Box Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern open and softwarized systems -- such as O-RAN telecom networks and cloud computing platforms -- host independently developed applications with distinct, and potentially conflicting, objectives. Coordinating the behavior of such applications to ensure stable system operation poses significant challenges, especially when each application's utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. In this paper, we consider a centralized optimization framework in which a system controller suggests joint configurations to multiple strategic players, representing different applications, with the goal of aligning their incentives toward a stable outcome. This interaction is modeled as a learned optimization with an equilibrium constraint in which the central optimizer learns the utility functions through sequential, multi-fidelity evaluations with the goal of identifying a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE). To address this challenge, we propose MF-UCB-PNE, a novel multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization strategy that leverages a budget-constrained sampling process to approximate PNE solutions. MF-UCB-PNE systematically balances exploration across low-cost approximations with high-fidelity exploitation steps, enabling efficient convergence to incentive-compatible configurations. We provide theoretical and empirical insights into the trade-offs between query cost and equilibrium accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of MF-UCB-PNE in identifying effective equilibrium solutions under limited cost budgets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00129v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate downhole depth measurement is essential for oil and gas well operations, directly influencing reservoir contact, production efficiency, and operational safety. Collar correlation using a casing collar locator (CCL) is fundamental for precise depth calibration. While neural network has achieved significant progress in collar recognition, preprocessing methods for such applications remain underdeveloped. Moreover, the limited availability of real well data poses substantial challenges for training neural network models that require extensive datasets. This paper presents a system integrated into a downhole toolstring for CCL log acquisition to facilitate dataset construction. Comprehensive preprocessing methods for data augmentation are proposed, and their effectiveness is evaluated using baseline neural network models. Through systematic experimentation across diverse configurations, the contribution of each augmentation method is analyzed. Results demonstrate that standardization, label distribution smoothing, and random cropping are fundamental prerequisites for model training, while label smoothing regularization, time scaling, and multiple sampling significantly enhance model generalization capabilities. Incorporating the proposed augmentation methods into the two baseline models results in maximum F1 score improvements of 0.027 and 0.024 for the TAN and MAN models, respectively. Furthermore, applying these techniques yields F1 score gains of up to 0.045 for the TAN model and 0.057 for the MAN model compared to prior studies. Performance evaluation on real CCL waveforms confirms the effectiveness and practical applicability of our approach. This work addresses the existing gaps in data augmentation methodologies for training casing collar recognition models under CCL data-limited conditions, and provides a technical foundation for the future automation of downhole operations.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides a fundamental characterization of the discrete ambiguity functions (AFs) of random communication waveforms under arbitrary orthonormal modulation with random constellation symbols, which serve as a key metric for evaluating the delay-Doppler sensing performance in future ISAC applications. A unified analytical framework is developed for two types of AFs, namely the discrete periodic AF (DP-AF) and the fast-slow time AF (FST-AF), where the latter may be seen as a small-Doppler approximation of the DP-AF. By analyzing the expectation of squared AFs, we derive exact closed-form expressions for both the expected sidelobe level (ESL) and the expected integrated sidelobe level (EISL) under the DP-AF and FST-AF formulations. For the DP-AF, we prove that the normalized EISL is identical for all orthogonal waveforms. To gain structural insights, we introduce a matrix representation based on the finite Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, where each delay-Doppler shift corresponds to a WH operator acting on the ISAC signal. This WH-group viewpoint yields sharp geometric constraints on the lowest sidelobes: The minimum ESL can only occur along a one-dimensional cut or over a set of widely dispersed delay-Doppler bins. Consequently, no waveform can attain the minimum ESL over any compact two-dimensional region, leading to a no-optimality (no-go) result under the DP-AF framework. For the FST-AF, the closed-form ESL and EISL expressions reveal a constellation-dependent regime governed by its kurtosis: The OFDM modulation achieves the minimum ESL for sub-Gaussian constellations, whereas the OTFS waveform becomes optimal for super-Gaussian constellations. Finally, four representative waveforms, namely, SC, OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM, are examined under both frameworks, and all theoretical results are verified through numerical examples.</description>
