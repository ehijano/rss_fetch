      <title>Toward early-type eclipsing binaries as extragalactic milestones: IV. Physical properties of three detached O/B-type systems in the LMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete set of physical parameters for three early-type eclipsing binary systems in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC): OGLE LMC-ECL-17660, OGLE LMC-ECL-18794, and HV 2274, together with the orbital solutions. The first and third systems comprise B-type stars, while the second has O-type components and exhibits a total eclipse. We performed a complex analysis that included modeling light and radial velocity curves, O-C analysis, and additional non-LTE spectroscopic analysis for the O-type system. We found that OGLE LMC-ECL-17660 is at least a triple and, tentatively, a quadruple. A significant non-linear period decrease was determined for HV 2274. Its origin is unclear, possibly due to a faint, low-mass companion on a wide orbit. The analyzed components have masses ranging from 11.7 M$_\odot$ to 22.1 M$_\odot$, radii from 7.0 R$_\odot$ to 14.2 R$_\odot$, and temperatures between 22500 K and 36000 K. For HV 2274, the precision of our masses and radii is about six times higher than in previous studies. The position of the components of all six systems analyzed in this series on the mass-luminosity and mass-radius diagrams indicates they are evolutionarily advanced on the main sequence. Our sample contributes significantly to the knowledge of physical parameters of early-type stars in the mass range of 11 M$_\odot$ to 23 M$_\odot$. A new mass-luminosity relation for O and B-type stars in the LMC is provided. Additionally, we used the measured apsidal motion of the systems to compare the observational and theoretical internal structure constant.</description>

      <title>Tidal Synchronization of TESS Eclipsing Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal synchronization plays a fundamental role in the evolution of binary star systems. However, key details such as the timescale of synchronization, efficiency of tidal dissipation, final rotational period, and dependence on stellar mass are not well constrained. We present a catalog of rotation periods, orbital periods, and eccentricities from eclipsing binaries (EBs) that can be used to study the role of tides in the rotational evolution of low-mass dwarf (FGKM spectral type) binaries. This study presents the largest catalog of EB orbital and rotational periods (Porb and Prot) measured from the Transiting Exoplanet Satellite Survey (TESS). We first classify 4584 light curves from the TESS Eclipsing Binary Catalog according to out-of-eclipse stellar variability type: starspot modulation, ellipsoidal variability, non-periodic variability, and "other" variability (e.g. pulsations). We then manually validate each light curve classification, resulting in a sample of 1039 candidates with 584 high confidence EBs that exhibit detectable star-spot modulation. From there, we measure and compare the rotation period of each starspot-modulated EB using three methods: Lomb-Scargle periodograms, autocorrelation function, and phase dispersion minimization. We find that our period distributions are consistent with previous work that used a sample of 816 starspot EBs from Kepler to identify two populations: a synchronous population (with Porb \approx Prot) and a subsynchronous population (with 8Porb \approx 7Prot). Using Bayesian model comparison, we find that a bimodal distribution is a significantly better fit than a unimodal distribution for Kepler and TESS samples, both individually or combined, confirming that the subsynchronous population is statistically significant.</description>

      <title>VLTI/GRAVITY enables the determination of the first dynamical masses of a classical Be + stripped and bloated pre-subdwarf binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HR~6819 is the first post-mass transfer binary system composed of a classical Be star and a bloated pre-subdwarf stripped star directly confirmed by interferometry. While the Be star is already spun up to near-critical rotation and possesses a self-ejected viscous Keplerian disk, the stripped star is found in a short-lived evolutionary stage, in which it retains the spectral appearance of a B-type main-sequence star while contracting into a faint subdwarf OB-type star. In order to understand the evolution of intermediate-mass interacting binaries, the fundamental parameters of cornerstone objects such as HR~6819 need to be known. We aim to obtain orbital parameters and model-independent dynamical masses of this binary system to quantitatively characterize this rarely observed evolutionary stage. We analyzed a time series of 12 interferometric near-IR $K$-band observations from VLTI/GRAVITY with the help of the geometrical model-fitting tool PMOIRED. We included recently published radial velocities based on FEROS high-resolution spectroscopy for the binary orbital solution. With the GRAVITY data, we obtained the astrometric orbit, relative fluxes of the components, and parameters of the circumstellar disk of the Be star; we also detected helium line signatures from the stripped star. Using the published radial velocities enabled us to obtain the dynamical masses of the components as well as the dynamical parallax. The Be star is the slightly brighter component in the $K$ band and is almost 16 times as massive as the bloated stripped star, with the individual dynamical masses being $4.24\pm0.31 {\rm M}_{\odot}$ for the Be star and $0.270\pm0.056 {\rm M}_{\odot}$ for the stripped star. The orbit is slightly eccentric, with $e=0.0289\pm0.0058$, and the semimajor axis of the orbit is $0.3800\pm0.0093$ AU. (Abstract continues but does not fit here)</description>

      <title>The Effects of Magneto-Convection on Short Period Cataclysmic Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of the current problems related to the evolution of cataclysmic variables revolve around the magnetic nature of the main sequence secondary. It is known that magnetic fields alter the structure of low mass stars. In particular, they inhibit convection, leading to inflated radii. Here we present a simple model to demonstrate the impact of magneto-convection on the evolution of short period cataclysmic variables. We find that the inclusion of magneto-convection leads to larger secondaries, longer orbital periods and smaller mass-loss rates. When including magnetic effects, the minimum orbital period is increased by 14 minutes, indicating that this could help alleviate the period minimum problem in cataclysmic variable evolution. We also examine the effect of the white dwarf mass on the minimum period. While increasing the white dwarf mass does increase the minimum period, it is not substantial. Therefore it is unlikely that the period minimum problem can be solved with a larger white dwarf mass or with mass growth of white dwarf.</description>

      <title>JWST photometry and astrometry of 47 Tucanae. Discontinuity in the stellar sequence at the star/brown dwarf transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using JWST Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) images of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (or NGC 104), taken at two epochs just 7 months apart, we derived proper-motion membership down to $m_{\rm F322W2} \sim 27$. We identified an intriguing feature at the very low-mass end of the main sequence, around $\sim$ 0.08 solar masses, at magnitudes $m_{\rm F322W2} \sim 24$ and $m_{\rm F150W2} \sim 25$. This feature, dubbed "kink", is characterized by a prominent discontinuity in the slope of the main sequence. A similar discontinuity is seen in theoretical isochrones with oxygen-poor chemistries, related to the rapid onset of CH$_4$ absorption. We therefore hypothesize that the cluster hosts disproportionately more oxygen-poor stars near the bottom of the main sequence compared to the upper main sequence and the red giant branch. Our results show no strong or conclusive evidence of a rise in the brown dwarf luminosity function at faint magnitudes, in contrast to previous findings likely affected by faint red background galaxies. In our analysis, we accounted for this contamination by using proper motion membership.</description>

      <title>ALMA observations of CO isotopologues towards six obscured post-AGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low- and intermediate-mass stars evolve through the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), when an efficient mass-loss process removes a significant fraction of their initial mass. A substantial increase in the mass-loss rate at the end of the AGB is observed for at least some stars for unknown reasons. This creates post-AGB objects that are completely enshrouded in thick dusty envelopes and might be associated with binary interactions. We observed the $J=2-1$ line of $^{13}$CO, C$^{17}$O, and C$^{18}$O with the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array (ALMA) towards six obscured post-AGB stars (four C-rich and two O-rich sources) to constrain the properties of their circumstellar envelopes, recent mass-loss histories, and initial mass of the central stars. Based on the inferred $^{17}$O/$^{18}$O isotopic ratios, we find all stars to have relatively low initial masses ($&lt; 2~M_\odot$) contrary to suggestions in the literature of higher masses for some sources. We infer a mass for HD~187885 $\sim 1.15~M_\odot$, which is relatively low for a carbon star. For all but one source (GLMP~950), we observe kinematic components with velocities $\gtrsim 30$~km~s$^{-1}$, which are faster than typical AGB wind expansion velocities. For most sources, these higher-velocity outflows display point-symmetric morphologies. The case of Hen~3-1475 is particularly spectacular, with the high-velocity molecular outflow interleaved with the high-velocity outflow of ionised gas observed at optical wavelengths. Based on the size of the emission regions of the slow components of the outflows, we derive typical kinematic ages associated with the C$^{18}$O~$J=2-1$ emission $\lesssim 1500$~years and obtain relatively high associated mass-loss rates ($\gtrsim10^{-4}~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$). The sources with known spectral types are found to have evolved faster than expected based on stellar evolutionary models.</description>

      <title>NGTS-EB-7, an eccentric, long-period, low-mass eclipsing binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04523v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being the most common types of stars in the Galaxy, the physical properties of late M dwarfs are often poorly constrained. A trend of radius inflation compared to evolutionary models has been observed for earlier type M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries, possibly caused by magnetic activity. It is currently unclear whether this trend also extends to later type M dwarfs below theconvective boundary. This makes the discovery of lower-mass, fully convective, M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries valuable for testing evolutionary models especially in longer-period binaries where tidal interaction between the primary and secondary is negligible. With this context, we present the discovery of the NGTS-EB-7 AB system, an eclipsing binary containing a late M dwarf secondary and an evolved G-type primary star. The secondary star has a radius of $0.125 \pm 0.006 R_\odot$ , a mass of $0.096 \pm 0.004 M_\odot$ and follows a highly eccentric $(e=0.71436 \pm 0.00085)$ orbit every $193.35875 \pm 0.00034$ days. This makes NGTS-EB-7 AB the third longest-period eclipsing binary system with a secondary smaller than $200 M_J$ with the mass and radius constrained to better than $5 \%$. In addition, NGTS-EB-7 is situated near the centre of the proposed LOPS2 southern field of the upcoming PLATO mission, allowing for detection of the secondary eclipse and measurement of the companion`s temperature. With its long-period and well-constrained physical properties - NGTS-EB-7 B will make a valuable addition to the sample of M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries and help in determining accurate empirical mass/radius relations for later M dwarf stars.</description>

      <title>The distribution of misalignment angles in multipolar planetary nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the projected angle on the plane of the sky between adjacent symmetry axes of tens of multipolar planetary nebulae and find that the distribution of these misalignment angles implies a random three-dimensional angle distribution limited to &lt;60 degrees. We identify a symmetry axis as a line connecting two opposite lobes (bubbles) or clumps. We build a cumulative distribution function of the projected angles (alpha) and find that an entirely random distribution of the three-dimensional angles (delta) between adjacent symmetry axes, namely, uncorrelated directions, does not fit the observed one. A good fit to the observed distribution is a limited random distribution of the three-dimensional angle between adjacent symmetry axes, i.e., random distribution in the range of 20&lt;delta&lt;60 degrees. We assume that a pair of jets along the angular momentum axis of an accretion disk around the companion shape each symmetry axis. The limited random distribution might result from two sources of angular momentum to the accretion disks with comparable magnitude: one with a fixed direction and one with a stochastic direction variation. We discuss a scenario where the fixed-axis angular momentum source is the binary orbital angular momentum, while the stochastic source of angular momentum is due to the vigorous envelope convection of the mass-losing giant progenitor.</description>

      <title>A study of the frequency and characteristics of stellar companions and Jupiter-like planets in nearby open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of companions of solar-type stars in nearby young moving groups (NYMGs) show that they split into two groups: stellar and brown dwarf companions (mass ratio $q&gt;0.05$) and Jupiter-like (JL) planets ($q&lt;0.02$). The frequency of JL planets in NYMGs appears to be higher than that obtained from radial velocity (RV) surveys. We extended the search for companions to three nearby clusters of intermediate age: Hyades, Coma Berenices, and Ursa Major. They are older and formed in more massive events than the NYMGs. The sample of host stars is complete for the core of the clusters, while we considered only a fraction of the tidal tails. We used the same methods considered for the members of NYMGs. We obtained a fairly complete sample of stellar companions and detected six massive JL planets. We found a lower frequency of equal-mass companions than in the NYMGs; this might be related to how binaries form in these environments. We also observed a concentration of stellar binaries in the cores of Ursa Major and Coma Berenices; we attribute this to the selective loss of low-mass systems. The observed scarcity of wide companions in Hyades can be due to the destruction of binaries in close encounters. The frequency of JL planets is lower than in the NYMGs but similar to that obtained from RV surveys. This extends the correlation with age and mass previously found for NYMGs. Results of this study alone do not indicate whether age or mass are the factors driving the observed correlation. A comparison of the frequencies of free-floating planets from microlenses and in young associations favours mass as the main driving parameter. Once the initial cluster mass function is considered, the frequency of JL planets in NYMGs is consistent with the results obtained using RVs.</description>

      <title>Expanding the parameter space of 2002es-like type Ia supernovae: on the underluminous ASASSN-20jq / SN 2020qxp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the peculiar Type Ia supernova ASASSN-20jq/SN 2020qxp. It is a low-luminosity object with a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B=-17.1\pm0.5$ mag. Despite its low luminosity, its post-peak light-curve decline rate ($\Delta m_{15}(B)=1.35\pm0.09$ mag) and color-stretch parameter (sBV&gt;0.82) are similar to normal SNe Ia, making it an outlier in the luminosity-width and luminosity-color-stretch relations. Early light curves suggest a "bump" during the first 1.4 days of explosion. ASASSN-20jq synthesized a low radioactive $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.09\pm0.01M_\odot$. Near-maximum light spectra reveal strong Si II absorption lines, indicating a cooler photosphere than normal SNe Ia, but lack Ti II absorption lines. Unusually strong O I $\lambda$7773 and Ca II near-infrared triplet absorption features are present. Nebular spectra show a strong, narrow forbidden [Ca II] $\lambda\lambda$7291,7324 doublet emission, rarely seen in SNe Ia except in some Type Iax events. Marginal detection of [O I] $\lambda\lambda$6300,6364 doublet emission, which is extremely rare, is observed. Both [Ca II] and [O I] lines are redshifted by $\sim2000$ km/s. A strong [Fe II] $\lambda$7155 emission line with a tilted-top profile, identical to the [Fe II] $\lambda$16433 profile, is also observed. These asymmetric [Fe II] profiles and redshifted [Ca II] and [O I] emissions suggest a high central density white dwarf progenitor undergoing an off-center delayed-detonation explosion mechanism, producing roughly equal amounts of $^{56}$Ni in deflagration and detonation phases. This distinguishes ASASSN-20jq from normal and subluminous SNe Ia. ASASSN-20jq's light curve and spectra do not align with any single SNe Ia subclass but show similarities to 2002es-like objects. Thus, we add it as an extreme candidate within the heterogeneous parameter space of 2002es-like SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Classics: On the Statistics of Dust Formation in Novae</title>

Abstract: While nova eruptions produce some of the most common and dramatic dust formation episodes among astrophysical transients, the demographics of dust-forming novae remain poorly understood. Here, we present a statistical study of dust formation in 40 novae with high-quality optical/IR light curves, quantitatively distinguishing dust-forming from non-dust-forming novae while exploring the properties of the dust events. We find that 50-70% of novae produce dust, significantly higher than previous estimates. Dust-forming novae can be separated from those that do not show dust formation by using the largest redward ($V-K$) colour change from peak visible brightness; ($V-J$) or ($V-H$) offer useful but less sensitive constraints. This makes optical+IR photometry a powerful tool to quantify dust formation in novae. We find that novae detected in GeV $\gamma$-rays by \emph{Fermi}-LAT appear to form dust more often than novae not detected by \emph{Fermi}, implying a possible connection between $\gamma$-ray producing shocks and dust production. We also find that novae that evolve very quickly ($t_2 &lt; 10$ days) are much less likely to form dust, in agreement with previous findings. We confirm a correlation between $t_2$ and the time of the onset of dust formation (which occurs $\sim$1 week--3 months after maximum light), but conclude that it is primarily an observational artifact driven by dust formation determining when a nova drops 2 mag below peak. The significant fraction of novae that form dust make them ideal laboratories in our Galactic backyard to tackle the puzzle of dust formation around explosive transients.</description>

      <title>Searching the non-accreting white dwarf population in eROSITA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: eROSITA is the soft X-ray instrument aboard the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) satellite that is most sensitive in the energy range between 0.2 and 2.3 keV. Between December 2019 and December 2021, eROSITA completed four all-sky surveys producing all-sky X-ray source lists and sky maps of unprecedented depth. In the energy range between 0.2 keV and 1 keV, we detected about 38,000 sources with a hardness ratio below -0.94, covering a small sample of known white dwarfs found with eROSITA in the dataset to which the German eROSITA consortium has rights (half sky). 264 of these soft sources have a probability of more than 90 % to be a white dwarf. This is more than the 175 white dwarfs ROSAT found in the whole sky. Here we present the results of a pilot study to increase the sensitivity of eROSITA for soft sources by extending the detection threshold down to 0.1 keV. First tests with dedicated sky regions are promising.</description>

      <title>The Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments: CASCADE. IV. Unveiling the hidden structures in DR18</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cygnus-X complex is a massive, nearby (1.4 kpc) star-forming region with several OB associations. As part of the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE) program, we carried out 3.6 millimeter (mm) continuum and spectral line high-resolution observations ($\sim$ 3 - 4$''$) toward DR18, covering several molecular species with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) and the Institut de Radioastronomie Millim\'etrique (IRAM) 30m telescope. In addition, multi-wavelength archival datasets were used to provide a comprehensive analysis of the region. A comparison of the 3.6mm and 6 cm continuum emission confirms that a B2 star (DR18-05) shapes the cometary HII region in the DR18 cavity, with ionized gas escaping toward the OB2 association. On the other hand, the extended 3.6mm and 6 cm continuum emission are likely to trace photoevaporating ionized gas from ultraviolet radiation from the Cyg OB2 association, not from DR18-05. The shell structure around DR18-05 indicates photodissociation regions (PDRs) formed by the expanding HII region and photo-erosion from DR18-05 and OB2 stars. We also identified 18 compact cores with N$_2$H$^+$ emission, half of which are gravitationally bound and mostly located in colder regions behind the PDRs. The SiO emission is found only in PDRs, with narrow-line widths ( 0.8 - 2.0 km s$^{-1}$) and lower abundances (X(SiO) $\sim$ 5$\times$10$^{-11}$ - 1$\times$10$^{-10}$). Comparing with the UV irradiated shock models, we suggest that the SiO emission partially encompassing the HII region arises from the molecular gas region, marginally compressed by low-velocity shocks with $\sim$ 5 km s$^{-1}$, irradiated by external UV radiation (G$_{\rm 0} \sim 10^{2} - 10^{3}$), as they traverse through a medium with $n_{\rm H} \sim 10^{4}$ to 10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear coupling between magnetar QPOs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the tails of magnetar giant $\gamma$-ray flares have long been interpreted as normal oscillation modes of these stars. However, most studies modelling QPOs have neglected some key features in the analyses of the signals, namely that QPOs appear to be detectable only intermittently and exhibit drifts in their frequencies. These are typical characteristics of nonlinear mode coupling, where, at leading order, the modes couple and evolve collectively as triplets. Using a representative triplet of modes we solve the system's nonlinear equations of motion analytically and argue that the coupling is likely axial-axial-polar in nature, with the observed intermittence and frequency drifts providing a way to infer details of the magnetar's internal magnetic-field geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides an update on the coronal mass ejection (CME) catalog maintained at the CDAW Data Center, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME_list). This is version 2 (v2) of the Catalog that has been made as the default version as of May 1, 2024. The new features of the Catalog v2 are (i) online measurement tool, (ii) combination JavaScript movies from the STEREO and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) missions, and (iii) insertion of newly identified CMEs for the period 1996 to 2004. The CME identification was revisited resulting in a set of $\sim$3000 new CMEs added to the Catalog. A vast majority of these CMEs are weak and narrow. The resulting statistical properties of CMEs are not significantly different from those reported using version 1.</description>

      <title>Implications of the abundance of halo coronal mass ejections for the strength of solar cycle 25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assess the relative strength of solar cycle (SC) 25 with respect to SCs 23 and 24 based on the abundance of halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We make use of the halo CME database (https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME_list/halo/halo.html) to compare the halo CME abundance during the first four years in each of SCs 23 to 25. The main result is that in several aspects such as the abundance, occurrence rate, source locations, and halo heights, halo CMEs are similar between SCs 24 and 25 but different from SC 23. This result follows from the fact that weaker cycles have low heliospheric total pressure, whose backreaction on CMEs allows them to expand more and hence enhancing the chance of becoming a halo. The solar cycle variation of halo CME properties is consistent with the precursor-based cycle prediction methods that indicate SC 25 is similar to or only slightly stronger than SC 24.</description>

      <title>Photometric White Dwarf Rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a census of photometrically detected rotation periods for white dwarf (WD) stars. We analyzed the light curves of 9285 WD stars observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite up to Sector 69. Using Fourier transform analyses and the TESS_localize software, we detected variability periods for 318 WD stars. The 115 high-probability likely single WDs in our sample have a median rotational period of 3.9 hr and a median absolute deviation of 3.5 hr. Our distribution is significantly different from the distribution of the rotational period from asteroseismology, which exhibits a longer median period of 24.2 hr and a median absolute deviation of 12.1 hr. In addition, we reported nonpulsating periods for three known pulsating WDs with rotational periods previously determined by asteroseismology: NGC 1501, TIC 7675859, and G226-29. We also calculated evolutionary models including six angular momentum transfer mechanisms from the literature throughout evolution in an attempt to reproduce our findings. Our models indicate that the temperature-period relation of most observational data is best fitted by models with low metallicity, probably indicating problems with the computations of angular momentum loss during the high-mass-loss phase. Our models also generate internal magnetic fields through the Tayler-Spruit dynamo.</description>

      <title>SIP-IFVM: Efficient time-accurate magnetohydrodynamic model of the corona and coronal mass ejections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient and time-accurate three-dimensional (3D) single-fluid MHD solar coronal model and employ it to simulate CME evolution and propagation. Based on a quasi-steady-state implicit MHD coronal model, we developed an efficient time-accurate coronal model that can be used to speed up the CME simulation by selecting a large time-step size. We have called it the Solar Interplanetary Phenomena-Implicit Finite Volume Method (SIP-IFVM) coronal model. A pseudo-time marching method was implemented to improve temporal accuracy. A regularised Biot-Savart Laws (RBSL) flux rope, whose axis can be designed into an arbitrary shape, was inserted into the background corona to trigger the CME event. We performed a CME simulation on the background corona of Carrington rotation (CR) 2219 and evaluated the impact of time-step sizes on simulation results. Our study demonstrates that this model is able to simulate the CME evolution and propagation process from the solar surface to $20\; R_s$ in less than 0.5 hours (192 CPU cores, $\sim$ 1 M cells). Compared to the explicit counterpart, this implicit coronal model is not only faster, but it also has improved numerical stability. We also conducted an ad hoc simulation with initial magnetic fields artificially increased. It shows that this model can effectively deal with time-dependent low-$\beta$ problems ($\beta&lt;10^{-4}$). Additionally, an Orszag-Tang MHD vortex flow simulation demonstrates that the pseudo-time-marching method used in this coronal model can simulate small-scale unsteady-state flows. The simulation results show that this MHD coronal model is very efficient and numerically stable. It is a promising approach to simulating time-varying events in the solar corona with low plasma $\beta$ in a timely and accurate manner.</description>

      <title>The Y Dwarf Population with HST: unlocking the secrets of our coolest neighbours -- II. Parallaxes and Proper Motions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present astrometric results from a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) campaign aimed at determining precise distances for cold Y-type brown dwarfs. Combining observations from a dedicated HST/WFC3 program with archival data, we derive astrometric solutions for 15 nearby Y dwarfs, by linking the high-precision relative astrometry from Hubble to the high-accuracy Gaia DR3 absolute reference system, using stars present in both to anchor the two frames of reference. We reach uncertainties on parallaxes below the 1-mas level for half of the sample, and down to 3 mas for two thirds of the targets, or relative precisions &lt;1% in most cases and 2-5x improvements over previous measurements. For the remaining targets, we achieved slightly lower precisions on parallaxes (5-12 mas, 5-10%), correlated with the lower signal-to-noise of the faintest targets. The precision reached in our derived proper motions is around 0.1-0.4 mas/yr for most targets, and up to 1-2 mas/yr for less precise cases. Our estimated parallaxes and proper motions are generally in good agreement with literature values, and consistent to 1-2 sigma with recent Spitzer-derived parallaxes in most cases. These new astrometric solutions provide important validation of these objects' distances and sky motions, especially given the large disparities seen in previous estimates. Our results demonstrate the power of HST combined with Gaia to measure highly-precise absolute astrometry for faint brown dwarfs, and highlights the limitations reached for the reddest and coldest objects, for which JWST will certainly provide a favourable platform to improve these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a line list for the abundance analysis of F and G type stars across the 4080-9675 A wavelength range. A systematic search employing lower excitation potentials, accurate log gf values, and an updated multiplet table led to the identification of 592 lines across 33 species (25 elements), including C, O, Mg (ionized), Al, P, S, Cu, Zr (neutral), and La. To determine the uncertainties in log gf values, we assessed solar abundance using a very high-resolution (R=1000000) disk-integrated solar spectrum. These lines were confirmed to be blend-free in the solar spectrum. The line list was further validated by analyzing the metal-poor star HD 218209 (G6V), which is notable for its well-documented and reliable abundance in literature. The abundances were obtained using the equivalent width (EW) method and further refined by applying the spectrum synthesis method. A comparative analysis with the Gaia ESO line list v.6, provided by the Gaia ESO collaboration, revealed additional neutral and ionized Fe lines. This extensively refined line list will facilitate precise stellar parameter determinations and accurate abundance analyses of spectra within the PolarBASE spectral library.</description>

      <title>Geometric correction for wind accretion in binary systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion model is widely used to describe how a compact object accretes material from a companion's stellar wind in binary systems. However, its standard implementation becomes inaccurate when the wind velocity ($v_\mathrm{w}$) is comparable to or less than the orbital velocity ($v_\mathrm{o}$), predicting non-physical accretion efficiencies above unity. This limits its applicability to systems with low wind-to-orbital velocity ratios ($w= v_\mathrm{w} / v_\mathrm{o} \leq 1$), such as symbiotic systems. We revisit the implementation of the BHL model and introduce a geometric correction factor that accounts for the varying orientation of the accretion cylinder relative to the wind direction. This correction ensures physically plausible accretion efficiencies ($\eta \leq 1$) for all $w$ in circular orbits. Our new implementation naturally predicts the flattening of the accretion efficiency observed in numerical simulations for $w &lt; 1$, without the need for ad hoc adjustments. We also peer into the implications of our prescription for the less-explored case of eccentric orbits, highlighting the key role of the geometric correction factor in shaping the accretion process. We compare our predictions with numerical simulations, finding good agreement for a wide range of parameters. Applications to the symbiotic star R~Aqr and the X-ray binary LS 5039 are presented. This improved implementation offers a more accurate description of wind accretion in binary systems, with implications for stellar evolution, population synthesis, and observational data interpretation.</description>

      <title>The S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey: Photometric Re-calibration with the BEst STar Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an independent validation and comprehensive re-calibration of S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey (USS) DR1 12-band photometry using about 30,000--70,000 standard stars from the BEst STar (BEST) database. We identify spatial variation of zero-point offsets, up to 30--40\,mmag for blue filters ($u$, $J0378$, $J0395$) and 10\,mmag for others, predominantly due to the higher uncertainties of the technique employed in the original USS calibration. Moreover, we detect large- and medium-scale CCD position-dependent systematic errors, up to 50\,mmag, primarily caused by different aperture and flat-field corrections. We then re-calibrate the USS DR1 photometry by correcting the systematic shifts for each tile using second-order two-dimensional polynomial fitting combined with a numerical stellar flat-field correction method. The re-calibrated results from the XPSP and the SCR standards are consistent within 6\,mmag in the USS zero-points, demonstrating both the typical precision of re-calibrated USS photometry and a sixfold improvement in USS zero-point precision. Further validation using SDSS and Pan-STARRS1, as well as LAMOST DR10 and Gaia photometry, also confirms this precision for the re-calibrated USS photometry. Our results clearly demonstrate the capability and the efficiency of the BEST database in improving calibration precision to the milli-magnitude level for wide-field photometric surveys. The re-calibrated USS DR1 photometry is publicly available: doi: 10.12149/101503 (https://nadc.china-vo.org/res/r101504/).</description>
