      <title>Fuzzy Model Identification and Self Learning with Smooth Compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a smooth model identification and self-learning strategy for dynamic systems taking into account possible parameter variations and uncertainties. We have tried to solve the problem such that the model follows the changes and variations in the system on a continuous and smooth surface. Running the model to adaptively gain the optimum values of the parameters on a smooth surface would facilitate further improvements in the application of other derivative based optimization control algorithms such as MPC or robust control algorithms to achieve a combined modeling-control scheme. Compared to the earlier works on the smooth fuzzy modeling structures, we could reach a desired trade-off between the model optimality and the computational load. The proposed method has been evaluated on a test problem as well as the non-linear dynamic of a chemical process.</description>

      <title>Integrated Strategy for Urban Traffic Optimization: Prediction, Adaptive Signal Control, and Distributed Communication via Messaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces an integrated approach to optimizing urban traffic by combining predictive modeling of vehicle flow, adaptive traffic signal control, and a modular integration architecture through distributed messaging. Using real-time data from various sensors, the system anticipates traffic fluctuations and dynamically adjusts signal phase durations to minimize delays and improve traffic flow. This proactive adjustment, supported by algorithms inspired by simulated annealing and reinforcement learning, also enhances energy efficiency, reduces pollutant emissions, and responds effectively to unexpected events (adverse weather, accidents, or temporary gatherings). Preliminary simulations conducted in a realistic urban environment demonstrate a significant reduction in average waiting times. Future developments include incorporating data from connected vehicles, integrating new modes of transport, and continuously refining predictive models to address the growing challenges of urban mobility.</description>

      <title>SMTL: A Stratified Logic for Expressive Multi-Level Temporal Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present \textbf{\underline{S}}tratified \textbf{\underline{M}}etric \textbf{\underline{T}}emporal \textbf{\underline{L}}ogic (SMTL), a novel formalism for specifying and verifying properties of complex cyber-physical systems that exhibit behaviors across multiple temporal and abstraction scales. SMTL extends existing temporal logics by incorporating a stratification operator, enabling the association of temporal properties with specific abstraction levels. This allows for the natural expression of multi-scale requirements while maintaining formal reasoning about inter-level relationships. We formalize the syntax and semantics of SMTL, proving that it strictly subsumes metric temporal logic (MTL) and offers enhanced expressiveness by capturing properties unattainable in existing logics. Numerical simulations comparing agents operating under MTL and SMTL specifications show that SMTL enhances agent coordination and safety, reducing collision rates without substantial computational overhead or compromising path efficiency. These findings underscore SMTL's potential as a valuable tool for designing and verifying complex multi-agent systems operating across diverse temporal and abstraction scales.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Generalized Dynamic Games with Coupled Chance Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing multi-agent systems with safety constraints and uncertain dynamics is a challenging problem. This paper studies a stochastic dynamic non-cooperative game with coupling safety chance constraints. The uncertainty is assumed to satisfy a concentration of measure property. Firstly, due to the non-convexity of chance constraints, a convex under-approximation of chance constraints is given using constraints on the expectation. Then, the conditions for the existence of the stochastic generalized Nash equilibrium (SGNE) of the under-approximated game are investigated, and the relation between the $\varepsilon-$SGNE of the original game and the under-approximated one is derived. A sampling-based algorithm is proposed for the SGNE seeking of the under-approximated game that does not require knowing the distribution of the uncertainty nor the analytical computation of expectations. Finally, under some assumptions on the game's pseudo-gradient mapping, the almost sure convergence of the algorithm to SGNE is proven. A numerical study is carried out on demand-side management in microgrids with shared battery to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>On Symmetries in Analytic Input-Output Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many notions of symmetry for state space models. They play a role in understanding when systems are time reversible, provide a system theoretic interpretation of thermodynamics, and have applications in certain stabilization and optimal control problems. The earliest form of symmetry for analytic input-output systems is due to Fliess who introduced systems described by an exchangeable generating series. In this case, one is able to write the output as a memoryless analytic function of the integral of each input. The first goal of this paper is to describe two new types of symmetry for such Chen--Fliess input-output systems, namely, coefficient reversible symmetry and palindromic symmetry. Each concept is then related to the notion of an exchangeable series. The second goal of the paper is to provide an in-depth analysis of Chen--Fliess input-output systems whose generating series are linear time-varying, palindromic, and have generating series coefficients growing at a maximal rate while ensuring some type of convergence. It is shown that such series have an infinite Hankel rank and Lie rank, have a certain infinite dimensional state space realization, and a description of their relative degree and zero dynamics is given.</description>

      <title>Multi-Satellite Beam Hopping and Power Allocation Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellite communication systems, effectively utilizing beam hopping (BH) technology is crucial for addressing uneven traffic demands. However, optimizing beam scheduling and resource allocation in multi-NGSO BH scenarios remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a multi-NGSO BH algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize beam illumination patterns and power allocation. By leveraging three degrees of freedom (i.e., time, space, and power), the algorithm aims to optimize the long-term throughput and the long-term cumulative average delay (LTCAD). The solution is based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) with a hybrid action space combining discrete and continuous actions. Using two policy networks with a shared base layer, the proposed algorithm jointly optimizes beam scheduling and power allocation. One network selects beam illumination patterns in the discrete action space, while the other manages power allocation in the continuous space. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces LTCAD while maintaining high throughput in time-varying traffic scenarios. Compared to the four benchmark methods, it improves network throughput by up to $8.9\%$ and reduces LTCAD by up to $69.2\%$</description>

      <title>Low RCS High-Gain Broadband Substrate Integrated Waveguide Antenna Based on Elliptical Polarization Conversion Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designed an elliptical polarization conversion metasurface (PCM) for Ka-band applications, alongside a high-gain substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) antenna. The PCM elements are integrated into the antenna design in a chessboard array configuration, with the goal of achieving effective reduction in the antenna's radar cross section (RCS). Both the PCM elements and antenna structure exhibit a simple design. The top layer of the metasurface (MS) elements employs an elliptical pattern symmetric along the diagonal, enabling efficient conversion of linearly polarized waves. The antenna component, on the other hand, consists of a broadband dipole antenna fed by SIW slot coupling. Verified through simulations, the polarization conversion bandwidth of this PCM unit reaches 80.38% where polarization conversion ratio (PCR) exceeds 90% (25.3-59.3GHz), demonstrating exceptional conversion performance. When the dipole antenna is combined with the PCM, its -10dB impedance bandwidth reaches to 15.09% (33.7-39.2GHz), with a maximum realized gain of 9.1dBi. Notably, the antenna loaded with the chessboard PCM structure effectively disperses the energy of scattered echoes around, significantly reducing the concentration of scattered energy in the direction of the incident wave, thereby achieving an effective reduction in RCS.</description>

      <title>Back to Base: Towards Hands-Off Learning via Safe Resets with Reach-Avoid Safety Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing controllers that accomplish tasks while guaranteeing safety constraints remains a significant challenge. We often want an agent to perform well in a nominal task, such as environment exploration, while ensuring it can avoid unsafe states and return to a desired target by a specific time. In particular we are motivated by the setting of safe, efficient, hands-off training for reinforcement learning in the real world. By enabling a robot to safely and autonomously reset to a desired region (e.g., charging stations) without human intervention, we can enhance efficiency and facilitate training. Safety filters, such as those based on control barrier functions, decouple safety from nominal control objectives and rigorously guarantee safety. Despite their success, constructing these functions for general nonlinear systems with control constraints and system uncertainties remains an open problem. This paper introduces a safety filter obtained from the value function associated with the reach-avoid problem. The proposed safety filter minimally modifies the nominal controller while avoiding unsafe regions and guiding the system back to the desired target set. By preserving policy performance while allowing safe resetting, we enable efficient hands-off reinforcement learning and advance the feasibility of safe training for real world robots. We demonstrate our approach using a modified version of soft actor-critic to safely train a swing-up task on a modified cartpole stabilization problem.</description>

      <title>A Novel First-Principles Model of Injection-Locked Oscillator Phase Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper documents the development of a novel time-domain model of injection-locked oscillator phase-noise response. The methodology follows a first-principle approach and applies to all circuit topologies, coupling configurations, parameter dependencies etc. The corresponding numerical algorithm is readily integrated into all major commercial simulation software suites. The model advances current state-of-the-art pertaining to analytical modelling of this class of circuits. Using this novel analytical framework, several important new insights are revealed which, in-turn, translate into useful design rules for synthesis of injection-locked oscillator circuits with optimal noise performance.</description>

      <title>Multi-Transmission Node DER Aggregation: Chance-Constrained Unit Commitment with Bounded Hetero-Dimensional Mixture Model for Uncertain Distribution Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To facilitate the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into the wholesale market while maintaining the tractability of associated market operation tools such as unit commitment (UC), existing DER aggregation (DERA) studies usually consider that each DERA is presented on a single node of the transmission network. Nevertheless, the increasing scale and geographical distribution of DERs spur the emergence of DERAs covering multiple transmission nodes, posing new challenges in modeling such multi-transmission-node DERAs (M-DERAs). Indeed, assessing the aggregated impact of an M-DERA on power flows is a non-trivial task, because the sensitivities of each transmission line to DERs at different transmission nodes are not identical. Inspired by the distribution factor (DF) based shift factor (SF) aggregation strategy in industry practice, this paper proposes a novel DF-based chance-constrained UC (CCUC) model to determine system optimal operation plans with M-DERAs. DFs, treated as uncertain parameters to describe possible responses of DERs against aggregated dispatch instructions from regional transmission organizations, are modeled via a bounded hetero-dimensional mixture model (BHMM) by leveraging historical DF records distributed on multiple hyperplanes in a bounded space. With this, power flow limits are modeled as chance constraints in CCUC, which is reformulated into a scenarios-based stochastic form and solved by Benders decomposition. The proposed method is tested on an IEEE 24-bus system to illustrate its effectiveness in managing M-DERA integration while ensuring operational economics and mitigating the overloading of transmission lines.</description>

      <title>Gaming on Coincident Peak Shaving: Equilibrium and Strategic Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coincident peak demand charges are imposed by power system operators or electric utilities when the overall system demand, aggregated across multiple consumers, reaches its peak. These charges incentivize consumers to reduce their demand during peak periods, a practice known as coincident peak shaving. In this paper, we analyze the coincident peak shaving problem through the lens of game theory, developing a theoretical model to examine the impact of strategic consumer behavior on system efficiency. We demonstrate that the game structure exhibits varying characteristics - concave, quasi-concave/discontinuous, or non-concave/discontinuous - depending on the extent of consumers demand-shifting capabilities. For a two-agent, two-period setting, we derive closed-form Nash equilibrium solutions under each condition and generalize our findings to cases with multiple agents. We prove the stability of the equilibrium points and present an algorithm for computing equilibrium outcomes across all game scenarios. We also show that the peak-shaving effectiveness of the game model matches that of the centralized peak-shaving model but with increased levels of anarchy. In the cases of quasi-concave and non-concave game conditions, we analytically demonstrate in the two-agent setting that anarchy increases with consumers flexibility and inequity, as measured by their marginal shifting costs, and we also analyze the influence of the number of agents on anarchy. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Ray-Tracing Channel Modeling for LEO Satellite-to-Ground Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the vision of global coverage for sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication systems, the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite-to-ground channel model for urban scenarios has emerged as highly important for the system design. In this paper, we propose an LEO satellite-to-ground channel model through shooting and bouncing rays (SBR) algorithm to analyze the channel characteristics. The orbit of LEO is modeled by the simplified general perturbations 4 (SGP4), and an accurate celestial model is applied to calculate the Doppler shift of multipath in a transmission time window of LEO satellite-to-ground communications. Channel characteristics of LEO satellite-to-ground communications such as the root-mean-square (RMS) delay spread, the Doppler shift, and the received power at different times are obtained. The simulation results show that the received power is only significantly noticeable in the transmission time window when the satellite is close to the receiver. Proposed model validates the effectiveness of ray-tracing in actual LEO satellite-to-ground communication scenarios and extends the calculation of the Doppler shift.</description>

      <title>A Volumetric Approach to Privacy of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02893v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information-theoretic metrics, such as mutual information, have been widely used to evaluate privacy leakage in dynamic systems. However, these approaches are typically limited to stochastic systems and face computational challenges. In this paper, we introduce a novel volumetric framework for analyzing privacy in systems affected by unknown but bounded noise. Our model considers a dynamic system comprising public and private states, where an observation set of the public state is released. An adversary utilizes the observed public state to infer an uncertainty set of the private state, referred to as the inference attack. We define the evolution dynamics of these inference attacks and quantify the privacy level of the private state using the volume of its uncertainty sets. For linear scalar systems, we derive an explicit formulation of the uncertainty set. For multi-dimensional linear systems, we develop an approximate computation method leveraging interval analysis. We investigate the properties of the proposed volumetric privacy measure and demonstrate that it is bounded by the information gain derived from the observation set. Furthermore, we propose an optimization approach to designing privacy filter using randomization and linear programming based on the proposed privacy measure. The effectiveness of the optimal privacy filter design is evaluated through a production-inventory case study, illustrating its robustness against the inference attack.</description>

      <title>Finite-Sample Learning Control for LQR Over Unknown Lossy Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem over an unknown Bernoulli packet drop channel. The unknown packet drop probability is estimated using finite samples, then the estimated probability is used to design a formally equivalent optimal controller. If the estimation error is too large, the estimated controller cannot mean-square stabilize the system. For n-dimensional systems, the upper bound on the estimation error is provided to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system. And we present an analytical expression for the gap between the performance of the estimated controller and the optimal performance. Next, we derive the upper bound on sample complexity for the stabilizability of the estimated controller. The tailored results with less conservatism are delivered for scalar systems and n-dimensional systems with invertible input matrix. Furthermore, a sufficient condition that does not depend on unknown channel information is provided to determine whether the estimated controller stabilizes the system with a certain probability. Finally, Numerical examples are used to demonstrate our results.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Model-Aided Power System Dynamic State Estimation and Reconstruction with Unknown Control Inputs or Data Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and robust dynamic state estimation (DSE) is essential for accurately capturing the internal dynamic processes of power systems, and it serves as the foundation for reliably implementing real-time dynamic modeling, monitoring, and control applications. Nonetheless, on one hand, traditional DSE methods based on Kalman filtering or particle filtering have high accuracy requirements for system parameters, control inputs, phasor measurement unit (PMU) data, and centralized DSE communication. Consequently, these methods often face accuracy bottlenecks when dealing with structural or system process errors, unknown control vectors, PMU anomalies, and communication contingencies. On the other hand, deep learning-aided DSE, while parameter-free, often suffers from generalization issues under unforeseen operating conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an effective approach that leverages deep generative models from AI-generated content (AIGC) to assist DSE. The proposed approach employs an encoder-decoder architecture to estimate unknown control input variables, a robust encoder to mitigate the impact of bad PMU data, and latent diffusion model to address communication issues in centralized DSE. Additionally, a lightweight adaptor is designed to quickly adjust the latent vector distribution. Extensive experimental results on the IEEE 39-bus system and the NPCC 140-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in addressing DSE modeling imperfection, measurement uncertainties, communication contingencies, and unknown distribution challenges, while also proving its ability to reduce data storage and communication resource requirements.</description>

      <title>AC-aware Optimization Framework for Under-Frequency Load Shedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) prevents system collapse during large disturbances. Increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and reduced system inertia makes it challenging to design a static UFLS scheme, which relies on preset frequency thresholds and load shed fractions to meet design criteria across all possible operating conditions. Due to non-linearity and traceability issues, previous adaptive UFLS schemes use simplified tractable frequency models that overlook AC network effects such as voltage-dependent load/generation. This paper leverages model order reduction techniques to obtain a higher fidelity low-order model of system frequency dynamics that captures AC network effects while incorporating turbine governor action and their associated limits. The model is then used in a new AC-aware predictive optimization framework to adapt UFLS setpoints periodically based on current operating conditions while minimizing load shed. Validated on a 1,648-bus system with PSS/E simulations, the proposed method meets design criteria under various operating conditions and disturbance scenarios. Furthermore, the framework outperforms conventional static UFLS schemes and adaptive UFLS schemes based on simplified dynamic models.</description>

      <title>Enabling Efficient Optimal Control of Reconfigurable Battery Systems by Unifying System Modeling and Narrowing Search Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable battery systems (RBSs) are emerging as a promising solution to improving fault tolerance, charge and thermal balance, energy delivery, etc. To optimize these performance metrics, high-dimensional nonlinear integer programming problems need to be formulated and solved. During this process, it is necessary to address multiple challenges stemming from nonlinear battery characteristics, discrete switch states, dynamic system configurations, as well as the curse of dimensionality inherent in large-scale systems. Thus, we propose a unified modeling framework to accommodate various potential configurations of an RBS and even to cover different RBS designs, significantly facilitating the topology design and optimization problem formulation for RBSs. Moreover, to solve the formulated RBS problems, the search space is tailored to encompass only feasible SSVs, thereby ensuring safe system operation while substantially curtailing search efforts. These proposed methods, focusing on unifying the system modeling and narrowing the search space, lay a solid foundation for effectively formulating and efficiently solving RBS optimal control problems. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods are demonstrated by simulation and experimental tests.</description>

      <title>Convergence in On-line Learning of Static and Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper derives new conditions for global convergence of the adaptive moment generation algorithm when applied for on-line, or equivalently, recursive supervised learning of static and dynamic nonlinear systems. The paper also proposes a difference equation based nonlinear dynamic model, that enforces {\em structure} and results in a new type of recurrent neural network. The convergence analysis applies averaging using Ljung's associated differential equation method. It is first proved that the asymptotic update behaviour of the adaptive moment generation algorithm is equivalent to a scaled stochastic gradient update for the standard hyper-parameter setting, or equivalent to a sign-sign update strategy in case the internal filtering of the algorithm is turned off. The analysis is concluded by proving global convergence to the set of parameters that gives a correct input-output description of the true system. The two hyper-parameter settings are evaluated with a Monte-Carlo analysis when the adaptive moment generation algorithm is applied for learning of nonlinear automotive cruise control dynamics. This validates the correct operation of the structured recurrent neural network and confirms the expected reduced convergence speed for the sign-sign update case.</description>

      <title>Benefit evaluation of V2X-enhanced braking in view obstructed crossing use cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a crash between two vehicles is imminent, an Automatic Emergency Brake (AEB) is activated to avoid or mitigate the accident. However, the trigger mechanism of the AEB relies on the vehicle's onboard sensors, such as radar and cameras, that require a line of sight to detect the crash opponent. If the line of sight is impaired, for example by bad weather or an obstruction, the AEB cannot be activated in time to avoid the crash. To deal with these cases, a 2-stage braking system is proposed, where the first stage consists of a partial brake that is triggered by Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. The second stage is composed of the standard AEB that is triggered exclusively by an onboard sensor detection. The performance of this V2X-enhanced 2-stage braking system is analysed in obstructed crossing use cases and the results are compared against the use of an AEB-only system. The benefit is quantitatively assessed by determination of the crash avoidance rate and, if the crash cannot be avoided, by estimation of the crash severity mitigation.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Control Synthesis for Stochastic Systems with Safety and Reach-Avoid Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of synthesizing distributionally robust control policies for stochastic systems under safety and reach-avoid specifications. Using a game-theoretical framework, we consider the setting where the probability distribution of the disturbance at each time step is selected from an ambiguity set defined by the Wasserstein distance. The goal is to synthesize a distributionally robust control policy that ensures the satisfaction probability exceeds a specified threshold under any distribution within the ambiguity set. First, for both safety and reach-avoid specifications, we establish the existence of optimal policies by leveraging the dynamic programming principles. Then we demonstrate how the associated optimization problem can be efficiently solved using the dual representation of Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization. Furthermore, for safety specifications in particular, we introduce a novel concept of distributionally robust control barrier certificates and show how these enable the efficient synthesis of controllers through sum-of-squares programming techniques. Finally, our experimental results reveal that incorporating distributional robustness during the synthesis phase significantly improves the satisfaction probability during online execution, even with limited statistical knowledge of the disturbance distribution.</description>

      <title>KANS: Knowledge Discovery Graph Attention Network for Soft Sensing in Multivariate Industrial Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft sensing of hard-to-measure variables is often crucial in industrial processes. Current practices rely heavily on conventional modeling techniques that show success in improving accuracy. However, they overlook the non-linear nature, dynamics characteristics, and non-Euclidean dependencies between complex process variables. To tackle these challenges, we present a framework known as a Knowledge discovery graph Attention Network for effective Soft sensing (KANS). Unlike the existing deep learning soft sensor models, KANS can discover the intrinsic correlations and irregular relationships between the multivariate industrial processes without a predefined topology. First, an unsupervised graph structure learning method is introduced, incorporating the cosine similarity between different sensor embedding to capture the correlations between sensors. Next, we present a graph attention-based representation learning that can compute the multivariate data parallelly to enhance the model in learning complex sensor nodes and edges. To fully explore KANS, knowledge discovery analysis has also been conducted to demonstrate the interpretability of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that KANS significantly outperforms all the baselines and state-of-the-art methods in soft sensing performance. Furthermore, the analysis shows that KANS can find sensors closely related to different process variables without domain knowledge, significantly improving soft sensing accuracy.</description>

      <title>SMDP-Based Dynamic Batching for Improving Responsiveness and Energy Efficiency of Batch Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For servers incorporating parallel computing resources, batching is a pivotal technique for providing efficient and economical services at scale. Parallel computing resources exhibit heightened computational and energy efficiency when operating with larger batch sizes. However, in the realm of online services, the adoption of a larger batch size may lead to longer response times. This paper aims to provide a dynamic batching scheme that delicately balances latency and efficiency. The system is modeled as a batch service queue with size-dependent service times. Then, the design of dynamic batching is formulated as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) problem, with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of average response time and average power consumption. A method is proposed to derive an approximate optimal SMDP solution, representing the chosen dynamic batching policy. By introducing an abstract cost to reflect the impact of "tail" states, the space complexity and the time complexity of the procedure can decrease by 63.5% and 98%, respectively. Numerical results showcase the superiority of SMDP-based batching policies across various parameter setups. Additionally, the proposed scheme exhibits noteworthy flexibility in balancing power consumption and latency.</description>

      <title>Encircling General 2-D Boundaries by Mobile Robots with Collision Avoidance: A Vector Field Guided Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to automatically encircle boundaries with mobile robots is crucial for tasks such as border tracking and object enclosing. Previous research has primarily focused on regular boundaries, often assuming that their geometric equations are known in advance, which is not often the case in practice. In this paper, we investigate a more general case and propose an algorithm that addresses geometric irregularities of boundaries without requiring prior knowledge of their analytical expressions. To achieve this, we develop a Fourier-based curve fitting method for boundary approximation using sampled points, enabling parametric characterization of general 2-D boundaries. This approach allows star-shaped boundaries to be fitted into polar-angle-based parametric curves, while boundaries of other shapes are handled through decomposition. Then, we design a vector field (VF) to achieve the encirclement of the parameterized boundary, wherein a polar radius error is introduced to measure the robot's ``distance'' to the boundary. The controller is finally synthesized using a control barrier function and quadratic programming to mediate some potentially conflicting specifications: boundary encirclement, obstacle avoidance, and limited actuation. In this manner, the VF-guided reference control not only guides the boundary encircling action, but can also be minimally modified to satisfy obstacle avoidance and input saturation constraints. Simulations and experiments are presented to verify the performance of our new method, which can be applied to mobile robots to perform practical tasks such as cleaning chemical spills and environment monitoring.</description>

      <title>Towards a constructive framework for control theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a framework for control theory based on constructive analysis to account for discrepancy between mathematical results and their implementation in a computer, also referred to as computational uncertainty. In control engineering, the latter is usually either neglected or considered submerged into some other type of uncertainty, such as system noise, and addressed within robust control. However, even robust control methods may be compromised when the mathematical objects involved in the respective algorithms fail to exist in exact form and subsequently fail to satisfy the required properties. For instance, in general stabilization using a control Lyapunov function, computational uncertainty may distort stability certificates or even destabilize the system despite robustness of the stabilization routine with regards to system, actuator and measurement noise. In fact, battling numerical problems in practical implementation of controllers is common among control engineers. Such observations indicate that computational uncertainty should indeed be addressed explicitly in controller synthesis and system analysis. The major contribution here is a fairly general framework for proof techniques in analysis and synthesis of control systems based on constructive analysis which explicitly states that every computation be doable only up to a finite precision thus accounting for computational uncertainty. A series of previous works is overviewed, including constructive system stability and stabilization, approximate optimal controls, eigenvalue problems, Caratheodory trajectories, measurable selectors. Additionally, a new constructive version of the Danskin's theorem, which is crucial in adversarial defense, is presented.</description>

      <title>JammingSnake: A follow-the-leader continuum robot with variable stiffness based on fiber jamming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Follow-the-leader (FTL) motion is essential for continuum robots operating in fragile and confined environments. It allows the robot to exert minimal force on its surroundings, reducing the risk of damage. This paper presents a novel design of a snake-like robot capable of achieving FTL motion by integrating fiber jamming modules (FJMs). The proposed robot can dynamically adjust its stiffness during propagation and interaction with the environment. An algorithm is developed to independently control the tendon and FJM insertion movements, allowing the robot to maintain its shape while minimizing the forces exerted on surrounding structures. To validate the proposed design, comparative tests were conducted between a traditional tendon-driven robot and the novel design under different configurations. The results demonstrate that our design relies significantly less on contact with the surroundings to maintain its shape. This highlights its potential for safer and more effective operations in delicate environments, such as minimally invasive surgery (MIS) or industrial in-situ inspection.</description>

      <title>Fastest Mixing Reversible Markov Chain: Clique Lifted Graphs and Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov chains are one of the well-known tools for modeling and analyzing stochastic systems. At the same time, they are used for constructing random walks that can achieve a given stationary distribution. This paper is concerned with determining the transition probabilities that optimize the mixing time of the reversible Markov chains towards a given equilibrium distribution. This problem is referred to as the Fastest Mixing Reversible Markov Chain (FMRMC) problem. It is shown that for a given base graph and its clique lifted graph, the FMRMC problem over the clique lifted graph is reducible to the FMRMC problem over the base graph, while the optimal mixing times on both graphs are identical. Based on this result and the solution of the semidefinite programming formulation of the FMRMC problem, the problem has been addressed over a wide variety of topologies with the same base graph. Second, the general form of the FMRMC problem is addressed on stand-alone topologies as well as subgraphs of an arbitrary graph. For subgraphs, it is shown that the optimal transition probabilities over edges of the subgraph can be determined independent of rest of the topology.</description>

Abstract: Electrooculography (EOG) is an electrophysiological signal that determines the human eye orientation and is therefore widely used in Human Tracking Interfaces (HCI). The purpose of this project is to develop a communication method for quadriplegic patients using EOG signals aimed at text and voice generation. The system consists of 3D eye movement tracking embedded using a custom-built prototype to measure the eyeball's left-right and up-down movements. The ESP32 board, which has a set of parameters to convert the data into content displayed on LCDs and MP3 players, is used to capture and process the signal. helps people by facilitating more natural and efficient symptom expression. The blink system will be able to incorporate face masks and more eye tests as it continues to develop. Even if it might work, more research and clinical trials are needed to evaluate the system's usefulness and ensure that it performs as planned in real-world scenarios. With this project, assistive technology will make significant progress and improve the lives of many who suffer from severe motor impairments.</description>

      <title>LoRaConnect: Unlocking HTTP Potential on LoRa Backbones for Remote Areas and Ad-Hoc Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimal infrastructure requirements of LoRa make it suitable for deployments in remote and disaster-stricken areas. Concomitantly, the modern era is witnessing the proliferation of web applications in all aspects of human life, including IoT and other network services. Contemporary IoT and network solutions heavily rely on web applications to render services. However, despite the recent research and development pivoted around LoRa, there is still a lack of studies focusing on web application access over LoRa networks. Specifically, technical challenges like payload size limitation, low data rate, and contentions in multi-user setups limit the applicability of LoRa for web applications. Hence, we propose LoRaWeb, which enables web access over LoRa networks. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which the client devices connect and access the web pages using a web browser. LoRa backbone of the network handles the web page transmission from the requester and receiver devices. LoRaWeb implements a synchronization procedure to address the aforementioned challenges for effective message exchange between requesters and responders. The system implements a caching mechanism to reduce latency and contention. Additionally, it implements a message-slicing mechanism in the application layer to overcome the hardware limitations on the message length. The actual hardware-based implementation results indicate seamless deployment, and the results indicate an average access time of ~$0.95 S$ for a $1.5 KB$ and ~$6 S$ for a $10 KB$ size web page.</description>

      <title>UDMC: Unified Decision-Making and Control Framework for Urban Autonomous Driving with Motion Prediction of Traffic Participants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current autonomous driving systems often struggle to balance decision-making and motion control while ensuring safety and traffic rule compliance, especially in complex urban environments. Existing methods may fall short due to separate handling of these functionalities, leading to inefficiencies and safety compromises. To address these challenges, we introduce UDMC, an interpretable and unified Level 4 autonomous driving framework. UDMC integrates decision-making and motion control into a single optimal control problem (OCP), considering the dynamic interactions with surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, road lanes, and traffic signals. By employing innovative potential functions to model traffic participants and regulations, and incorporating a specialized motion prediction module, our framework enhances on-road safety and rule adherence. The integrated design allows for real-time execution of flexible maneuvers suited to diverse driving scenarios. High-fidelity simulations conducted in CARLA exemplify the framework's computational efficiency, robustness, and safety, resulting in superior driving performance when compared against various baseline models. Our open-source project is available at https://github.com/henryhcliu/udmc_carla.git.</description>

      <title>Energy Optimization of Multi-task DNN Inference in MEC-assisted XR Devices: A Lyapunov-Guided Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended reality (XR), blending virtual and real worlds, is a key application of future networks. While AI advancements enhance XR capabilities, they also impose significant computational and energy challenges on lightweight XR devices. In this paper, we developed a distributed queue model for multi-task DNN inference, addressing issues of resource competition and queue coupling. In response to the challenges posed by the high energy consumption and limited resources of XR devices, we designed a dual time-scale joint optimization strategy for model partitioning and resource allocation, formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. This strategy aims to minimize the total energy consumption of XR devices while ensuring queue stability and adhering to computational and communication resource constraints. To tackle this problem, we devised a Lyapunov-guided Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, named LyaPPO. Numerical results demonstrate that the LyaPPO algorithm outperforms the baselines, achieving energy conservation of 24.79% to 46.14% under varying resource capacities. Specifically, the proposed algorithm reduces the energy consumption of XR devices by 24.29% to 56.62% compared to baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>Markov Decision Processes for Satellite Maneuver Planning and Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized, online planning approach for scalable maneuver planning for large constellations. While decentralized, rule-based strategies have facilitated efficient scaling, optimal decision-making algorithms for satellite maneuvers remain underexplored. As commercial satellite constellations grow, there are benefits of online maneuver planning, such as using real-time trajectory predictions to improve state knowledge, thereby reducing maneuver frequency and conserving fuel. We address this gap in the research by treating the satellite maneuver planning problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). This approach enables the generation of optimal maneuver policies online with low computational cost. This formulation is applied to the low Earth orbit collision avoidance problem, considering the problem of an active spacecraft deciding to maneuver to avoid a non-maneuverable object. We test the policies we generate in a simulated low Earth orbit environment, and compare the results to traditional rule-based collision avoidance techniques.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Sharing in Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks: Frameworks, Approaches, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To accommodate the increasing communication needs in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), wireless users in remote areas may require access to more spectrum than is currently allocated. Terrestrial networks (TNs), such as cellular networks, are deployed in specific areas, but many underused licensed spectrum bands remain in remote areas. Therefore, bringing NTNs to a shared spectrum with TNs can improve network capacity under reasonable interference management. However, in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), the comprehensive coverage of a satellite and the unbalanced communication resources of STINs make it challenging to effectively manage mutual interference between NTN and TN. This article presents the fundamentals and prospects of spectrum sharing (SS) in STINs by introducing four SS frameworks, their potential application scenarios, and technical challenges. Furthermore, advanced SS approaches related to interference management in STINs and performance metrics of SS in STINs are introduced. Moreover, a preliminary performance evaluation showcases the potential for sharing the spectrum between NTN and TN. Finally, future research opportunities for SS in STINs are discussed.</description>

      <title>Local Reactive Control for Mobile Manipulators with Whole-Body Safety in Complex Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile manipulators typically encounter significant challenges in navigating narrow, cluttered environments due to their high-dimensional state spaces and complex kinematics. While reactive methods excel in dynamic settings, they struggle to efficiently incorporate complex, coupled constraints across the entire state space. In this work, we present a novel local reactive controller that reformulates the time-domain single-step problem into a multi-step optimization problem in the spatial domain, leveraging the propagation of a serial kinematic chain. This transformation facilitates the formulation of customized, decoupled link-specific constraints, which is further solved efficiently with augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP). Our approach naturally absorbs spatial kinematic propagation in the forward pass and processes all link-specific constraints simultaneously during the backward pass, enhancing both constraint management and computational efficiency. Notably, in this framework, we formulate collision avoidance constraints for each link using accurate geometric models with extracted free regions, and this improves the maneuverability of the mobile manipulator in narrow, cluttered spaces. Experimental results showcase significant improvements in safety, efficiency, and task completion rates. These findings underscore the robustness of the proposed method, particularly in narrow, cluttered environments where conventional approaches could falter.

      <title>Constrained Multi-Modal Density Control of Linear Systems via Covariance Steering Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate finite-horizon optimal density steering problems for discrete-time stochastic linear dynamical systems whose state probability densities can be represented as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Our goal is to compute optimal controllers that can ensure that the terminal state distribution will match the desired distribution exactly (hard-constrained version) or closely (soft-constrained version) where in the latter case we employ a Wasserstein like metric that can measure the distance between different GMMs. Our approach relies on a class of randomized control policies which allow us to reformulate the proposed density steering problems as finite-dimensional optimization problems, and in particular, linear and bilinear programs. Additionally, we explore more general density steering problems based on the approximation of general distributions by GMMs and characterize bounds for the error between the terminal distribution under our policy and the approximated GMM terminal state distribution. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through non-trivial numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Sharing in 6G Space-Ground Integrated Networks: A Ground Protection Zone-Based Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-ground integrated network (SGIN) has been envisioned as a competitive solution for large scale and wide coverage of future wireless networks. By integrating both the non-terrestrial network (NTN) and the terrestrial network (TN), SGIN can provide high speed and omnipresent wireless network access for the users using the predefined licensed spectrums. Considering the scarcity of the spectrum resource and the low spectrum efficiency of the SGIN, we enable the NTN and TN to share the spectrum to improve overall system performance, i.e., weighted-sum area data rate (WS-ADR). However, mutual interference between NTN and TN is often inevitable and thus causes SGIN performance degradation. In this work, we consider a ground protection zone for the TN base stations, in which the NTN users are only allowed to use the NTN reserved spectrum to mitigate the NTN and TN mutual interference. We analytically derive the coverage probability and area data rate (ADR) of the typical users and study the performance under various protection zone sizes and spectrum allocation parameter settings. Simulation and numerical results demonstrate that the WS-ADR could be maximized by selecting the appropriate radius of protection zone and bandwidth allocation factor in the SGIN.</description>

      <title>Joint Secrecy Rate Achieving and Authentication Enhancement via Tag-based Encoding in Chaotic UAV Communication Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Secure communication is crucial in many emerging systems enabled by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks. To protect legitimate communication in a chaotic UAV environment, where both eavesdropping and jamming become straightforward from multiple adversaries with line-of-sight signal propagation, a new reliable and integrated physical layer security mechanism is proposed in this paper for a massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) UAV system. Particularly, a physical layer fingerprint, also called a tag, is first embedded into each message for authentication purpose. We then propose to reuse the tag additionally as a reference to encode each message to ensure secrecy for confidentiality enhancement at a low cost. Specifically, we create a new dual-reference symmetric tag generation mechanism by inputting an encoding-insensitive feature of plaintext along with the key into a hash function. At a legitimate receiver, an expected tag, reliable for decoding, can be symmetrically regenerated based on the received ciphertext, and authentication can be performed by comparing the regenerated reference tag to the received tag. However, an illegitimate receiver can only receive the fuzzy tag which can not be used to decode the received message. Additionally, we introduce artificial noise (AN) to degrade eavesdropping to further decrease message leakage. To verify the efficiency of our proposed tag-based encoding (TBE) scheme, we formulate two optimization problems including ergodic sum secrecy rate maximization and authentication fail probability minimization. The power allocation solutions are derived by difference-of-convex (DC) programming and the Lagrange method, respectively. The simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed TBE approach compared to the prior AN-aided tag embedding scheme.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multirotor Drone Efficiency: Exploring Minimum Energy Consumption Rate of Forward Flight under Varying Payload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle is a prevailing type of aircraft with wide real-world applications. Energy efficiency is a critical aspect of its performance, determining the range and duration of the missions that can be performed. In this study, we show both analytically and numerically that the optimum of a key energy efficiency index in forward flight, namely energy per meter traveled per unit mass, is a constant under different vehicle mass (including payload). Note that this relationship is only true under the optimal forward velocity that minimizes the energy consumption (under different mass), but not under arbitrary velocity. The study is based on a previously developed model capturing the first-principle energy dynamics of the multirotor, and a key step is to prove that the pitch angle under optimal velocity is a constant. By employing both analytical derivation and validation studies, the research provides critical insights into the optimization of multirotor energy efficiency, and facilitate the development of flight control strategies to extend mission duration and range.</description>

Abstract: Assembly is a key industrial process to achieve finished goods. Driven by market demographics and technological advancements, industrial assembly has evolved through several phases i.e. craftmanship, bench assembly, assembly lines and flexible assembly cells. Due to the complexity and variety of assembly tasks, besides significant advancement of automation technologies in other manufacturing activities, humans are still considered vital for assembly operations. The rationalization of manufacturing automation has considerably remained away from assembly systems. The advancement in assembly has only been in terms of better scheduling of work tasks and avoiding of wastes. With smart manufacturing technologies such as collaborative robots, additive manufacturing, and digital twins, the opportunities have arisen for the next reshaping of assembly systems. The new paradigm promises a higher degree of automation yet remaining flexible. This may result into a new manufacturing paradigm driven by the advancement of new technologies, new customer expectations and by establishing new kinds of manufacturing systems. This study explores the future collaborative assembly cells, presents a generic framework to develop them and the basic building blocks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Smooth Control via Nonsingular Fast Terminal Sliding Mode for Distributed Space Telescope Demonstration Mission by CubeSat Formation Flying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04718v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode-based adaptive smooth control methodology for a distributed space telescope demonstration mission. The distributed space telescope has a flexible focal length that corresponds to the relative position in the formation flying concept. The limited specification of a CubeSat generally restricts the performance of actuators, most critically the degrees of freedom of controlled motion. This investigation leads to the development of an adaptive smooth control methodology via nonsingular fast terminal sliding modes. The adaptive smooth control algorithm that was developed for a single-input single-output system is adopted and extended to the relative orbit and attitude control systems of the distributed space telescope. The software simulation is conducted under a real mission, which means the real CubeSat structures, hardware specifications, and operational constraints. The proposed algorithm possesses only seven parameters that can be easily adjusted considering their physical meanings. Furthermore, the pre-designated error bounds are analytically derived, which enhances the applicability of the algorithm to real missions. The simulation compares the efficiency of the adaptive smooth nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller with the linear quadratic regulator and proportional derivative algorithms. The results verify that the adaptive smooth nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control algorithm shows better control performance in the perspective of the alignment time and the fuel consumption for the distributed space telescope demonstration mission.</description>

      <title>Inverse Optimal Control for Linear Quadratic Tracking with Unknown Target States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the inverse optimal control for the linear quadratic tracking problem with a fixed but unknown target state, which aims to estimate the possible triplets comprising the target state, the state weight matrix, and the input weight matrix from observed optimal control input and the corresponding state trajectories. Sufficient conditions have been provided for the unique determination of both the linear quadratic cost function as well as the target state. A computationally efficient and numerically reliable parameter identification algorithm is proposed by equating optimal control strategies with a system of linear equations, and the associated relative error upper bound is derived in terms of data volume and signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the proposed inverse optimal control algorithm is applied for the joint cluster coordination and intent identification of a multi-agent system. By incorporating the structural constraint of the Laplace matrix, the relative error upper bound can be reduced accordingly. Finally, the algorithm's efficiency and accuracy are validated by a vehicle-on-a-lever example and a multi-agent formation control example.</description>

      <title>Robust Backstepping Control of a Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Under Colored Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05022v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in software and hardware technologies have facilitated the production of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Nowadays, people actively use quadrotor UAVs in essential missions such as search and rescue, counter-terrorism, firefighting, surveillance, and cargo transportation. While performing these tasks, quadrotors must operate in noisy environments. Therefore, a robust controller design that can control the altitude and attitude of the quadrotor in noisy environments is of great importance. Many researchers have focused only on white Gaussian noise in their studies, whereas researchers need to consider the effects of all colored noises during the operation of the quadrotor. This study aims to design a robust controller that is resistant to all colored noises. Firstly, a nonlinear quadrotor model was created with MATLAB. Then, a backstepping controller resistant to colored noises was designed. The designed backstepping controller was tested under Gaussian white, pink, brown, blue, and purple noises. PID and Lyapunov-based controller designs were also carried out, and their time responses (rise time, overshoot, settling time) were compared with those of the backstepping controller. In the simulations, time was in seconds, altitude was in meters, and roll, pitch, and yaw references were in radians. Rise and settling time values were in seconds, and overshoot value was in percent. When the obtained values are examined, simulations prove that the proposed backstepping controller has the least overshoot and the shortest settling time under all noise types.</description>

      <title>Sequential drone routing for data assimilation on a 2D airborne contaminant dispersion problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combined use of data from different sources can be critical in emergencies, where accurate models are needed to make real-time decisions, but high-fidelity representations and detailed information are simply unavailable. This study presents a data assimilation framework based on an ensemble Kalman filter that sequentially exploits and improves an advection-diffusion model in a case study concerning an airborne contaminant dispersion problem over a complex two-dimensional domain. An autonomous aerial drone is used to sequentially observe the actual contaminant concentration in a small fraction of the domain, orders of magnitude smaller than the total domain area. Such observations are synchronized with the data assimilation framework, iteratively adjusting the simulation. The path of the drone is sequentially optimized by balancing exploration and exploitation according to the available knowledge at each decision time. Starting from an erroneous initial model based on approximated assumptions that represent the limited initial knowledge available during emergency scenarios, results show how the proposed framework sequentially improves its belief about the dispersion dynamics, thus providing a reliable contaminant concentration map.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Sinusoidal Input Describing Functions for Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Reset Control with Application to Mechatronics Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reset control enhances the performance of high-precision mechatronics systems. This paper introduces a generalized reset feedback control structure that integrates a single reset-state reset controller, a shaping filter for tuning reset actions, and linear compensators arranged in series and parallel configurations with the reset controller. This structure offers greater tuning flexibility to optimize reset control performance. However, frequency-domain analysis for such systems remains underdeveloped. To address this gap, this study makes three key contributions: (1) developing Higher-Order Sinusoidal Input Describing Functions (HOSIDFs) for open-loop reset control systems; (2) deriving HOSIDFs for closed-loop reset control systems and establishing a connection with open-loop analysis; and (3) creating a MATLAB-based App to implement these methods, providing mechatronics engineers with a practical tool for reset control system design and analysis. The accuracy of the proposed methods is validated through simulations and experiments. Finally, the utility of the proposed methods is demonstrated through case studies that analyze and compare the performance of three controllers: a PID controller, a reset controller, and a shaped reset controller on a precision motion stage. Both analytical and experimental results demonstrate that the shaped reset controller provides higher tracking precision while reducing actuation forces, outperforming both the reset and PID controllers. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed frequency-domain methods in analyzing and optimizing the performance of reset-controlled mechatronics systems.</description>

      <title>Integrated Learning and Optimization for Congestion Management and Profit Maximization in Real-Time Electricity Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop novel integrated learning and optimization (ILO) methodologies to solve economic dispatch (ED) and DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) problems for better economic operation. The optimization problem for ED is formulated with load being an unknown parameter while DCOPF consists of load and power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) matrix as unknown parameters. PTDF represents the incremental variations of real power on transmission lines which occur due to real power transfers between two regions. These values represent a linearized approximation of power flows over the transmission lines. We develop novel ILO formulations to solve post-hoc penalties in electricity market and line congestion problems using ED and DCOPF optimization formulations. Our proposed methodologies capture the real-time electricity market and line congestion behavior to train the regret function which eventually train unknown loads at different buses and line PTDF matrix to achieve the afore-mentioned post-hoc goals. The proposed methodology is compared to sequential learning and optimization (SLO) which train load and PTDF forecasts for accuracy rather than economic operation. Our experimentation prove the superiority of ILO in minimizing the post-hoc penalties in electricity markets and minimizing the line congestion thereby improving the economic operation with noticeable amount.</description>

      <title>Tactile-based Exploration, Mapping and Navigation with Collision-Resilient Aerial Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17217v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces XPLORER, a passive deformable UAV with a spring-augmented chassis and proprioceptive state awareness, designed to endure collisions and maintain smooth contact. We develop a fast-converging external force estimation algorithm for XPLORER that leverages onboard sensors and proprioceptive data for contact and collision detection. Using this force information, we propose four motion primitives, including three novel tactile-based primitives: tactile-traversal, tactile-turning, and ricocheting-to aid XPLORER in navigating unknown environments. These primitives are synthesized autonomously in real-time to enable efficient exploration and navigation by leveraging collisions and contacts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting the potential of passive deformable UAVs for contact-rich real-world tasks such as non-destructive inspection, surveillance and mapping, and pursuit/evasion.</description>

      <title>Automated Security Response through Online Learning with Adaptive Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12499v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study automated security response for an IT infrastructure and formulate the interaction between an attacker and a defender as a partially observed, non-stationary game. We relax the standard assumption that the game model is correctly specified and consider that each player has a probabilistic conjecture about the model, which may be misspecified in the sense that the true model has probability 0. This formulation allows us to capture uncertainty and misconception about the infrastructure and the intents of the players. To learn effective game strategies online, we design Conjectural Online Learning (COL), a novel method where a player iteratively adapts its conjecture using Bayesian learning and updates its strategy through rollout. We prove that the conjectures converge to best fits, and we provide a bound on the performance improvement that rollout enables with a conjectured model. To characterize the steady state of the game, we propose a variant of the Berk-Nash equilibrium. We present COL through an advanced persistent threat use case. Testbed evaluations show that COL produces effective security strategies that adapt to a changing environment. We also find that COL enables faster convergence than current reinforcement learning techniques.</description>

      <title>SemiEpi: Self-driving, Closed-loop Multi-Step Growth of Semiconductor Heterostructures Guided by Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The semiconductor industry has prioritized automating repetitive tasks through closed-loop, self-driving experimentation, accelerating the optimization of complex multi-step processes. The emergence of machine learning (ML) has ushered in self-driving processes with minimal human intervention. This work introduces SemiEpi, a self-driving platform designed to execute molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of semiconductor heterostructures through multi-step processes, in-situ monitoring, and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard reactor, parameter initialization, and multiple ML models, SemiEpi identifies optimal initial conditions and proposes experiments for multi-step heterostructure growth, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes. SemiEpi initializes material growth parameters tailored to specific material characteristics, and fine-tuned control over the growth process is then achieved through ML optimization. We optimize the growth for InAs quantum dots (QDs) heterostructures to showcase the power of SemiEpi, achieving a QD density of 5E10/cm2, 1.6-fold increased photoluminescence (PL) intensity and reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29.13 meV. This work highlights the potential of closed-loop, ML-guided systems to address challenges in multi-step growth. Our method is critical to achieve repeatable materials growth using commercially scalable tools. Furthermore, our strategy facilitates developing a hardware-independent process and enhancing process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.</description>
