      <title>Chaos and noise in evolutionary game dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary game theory has traditionally employed deterministic models to describe population dynamics. These models, due to their inherent nonlinearities, can exhibit deterministic chaos, where population fluctuations follow complex, aperiodic patterns. Recently, the focus has shifted towards stochastic models, quantifying fixation probabilities and analysing systems with constants of motion. Yet, the role of stochastic effects in systems with chaotic dynamics remains largely unexplored within evolutionary game theory. This study addresses how demographic noise -- arising from probabilistic birth and death events -- impacts chaotic dynamics in finite populations. We show that despite stochasticity, large populations retain a signature of chaotic dynamics, as evidenced by comparing a chaotic deterministic system with its stochastic counterpart. More concretely, the strange attractor observed in the deterministic model is qualitatively recovered in the stochastic model, where the term deterministic chaos loses its meaning. We employ tools from nonlinear dynamics to quantify how the population size influences the dynamics. We observe that for small populations, stochasticity dominates, overshadowing deterministic selection effects. However, as population size increases, the dynamics increasingly reflect the underlying chaotic structure. This resilience to demographic noise can be essential for maintaining diversity in populations, even in non-equilibrium dynamics. Overall, our results broaden our understanding of population dynamics, and revisit the boundaries between chaos and noise, showing how they maintain structure when considering finite populations in systems that are chaotic in the deterministic limit.</description>

      <title>Safety and Security Risk Mitigation in Satellite Missions via Attack-Fault-Defense Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems, such as self-driving cars or digitized electrical grids, often involve complex interactions between security, safety, and defense. Proper risk management strategies must account for these three critical domains and their interaction because the failure to address one domain can exacerbate risks in the others, leading to cascading effects that compromise the overall system resilience. This work presents a case study from Ascentio Technologies, a mission-critical system company in Argentina specializing in aerospace, where the interplay between safety, security, and defenses is critical for ensuring the resilience and reliability of their systems. The main focus will be on the Ground Segment for the satellite project currently developed by the company. Analyzing safety, security, and defense mechanisms together in the Ground Segment of a satellite project is crucial because these domains are deeply interconnected--for instance, a security breach could disable critical safety functions, or a safety failure could create opportunities for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities, amplifying the risks to the entire system. This paper showcases the application of the Attack-Fault-Defense Tree (AFDT) framework, which integrates attack trees, fault trees, and defense mechanisms into a unified model. AFDT provides an intuitive visual language that facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration, enabling experts from various fields to better assess system vulnerabilities and defenses. By applying AFDT to the Ground Segment of the satellite project, we demonstrate how qualitative analyses can be performed to identify weaknesses and enhance the overall system's security and safety. This case highlights the importance of jointly analyzing attacks, faults, and defenses to improve resilience in complex cyber-physical environments.</description>

      <title>A Parametric Model for Near-Optimal Online Synthesis with Robust Reach-Avoid Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: To obtain explainable guarantees in the online synthesis of optimal controllers for high-integrity cyber-physical systems, we re-investigate the use of exhaustive search as an alternative to reinforcement learning. Approach: We model an application scenario as a hybrid game automaton, enabling the synthesis of robustly correct and near-optimal controllers online without prior training. For modal synthesis, we employ discretised games solved via scope-adaptive and step-pre-shielded discrete dynamic programming. Evaluation: In a simulation-based experiment, we apply our approach to an autonomous aerial vehicle scenario. Contribution: We propose a parametric system model and a parametric online synthesis.</description>

      <title>Learning in Conjectural Stackelberg Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the formalism of Conjectural Variations games to Stackelberg games involving multiple leaders and a single follower. To solve these nonconvex games, a common assumption is that the leaders compute their strategies having perfect knowledge of the follower's best response. However, in practice, the leaders may have little to no knowledge about the other players' reactions. To deal with this lack of knowledge, we assume that each leader can form conjectures about the other players' best responses, and update its strategy relying on these conjectures. Our contributions are twofold: (i) On the theoretical side, we introduce the concept of Conjectural Stackelberg Equilibrium -- keeping our formalism conjecture agnostic -- with Stackelberg Equilibrium being a refinement of it. (ii) On the algorithmic side, we introduce a two-stage algorithm with guarantees of convergence, which allows the leaders to first learn conjectures on a training data set, and then update their strategies. Theoretical results are illustrated numerically.</description>

      <title>Predicting human decisions with behavioral theories and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.06866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting human decisions under risk and uncertainty remains a fundamental challenge across disciplines. Existing models often struggle even in highly stylized tasks like choice between lotteries. We introduce BEAST Gradient Boosting (BEAST-GB), a hybrid model integrating behavioral theory (BEAST) with machine learning. We first present CPC18, a competition for predicting risky choice, in which BEAST-GB won. Then, using two large datasets, we demonstrate BEAST-GB predicts more accurately than neural networks trained on extensive data and dozens of existing behavioral models. BEAST-GB also generalizes robustly across unseen experimental contexts, surpassing direct empirical generalization, and helps refine and improve the behavioral theory itself. Our analyses highlight the potential of anchoring predictions on behavioral theory even in data-rich settings and even when the theory alone falters. Our results underscore how integrating machine learning with theoretical frameworks, especially those-like BEAST-designed for prediction, can improve our ability to predict and understand human behavior.</description>

      <title>Connectedness in weighted consensus division of graphical cakes between two agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Austin's moving knife procedure was originally introduced to find a consensus division of a cake between two agents: each agent believes that they receive exactly half of the cake. Here, we adapt it to the case when the two agents have arbitrary entitlements of the cake and seek a weighted consensus division -- one where each agent believes that they received exactly the share that they are entitled to -- which also minimizes the number of connected components that each agent receives. First, we find a weighted consensus division of a circular cake, which gives exactly one connected piece to each agent: this gives an explicit protocol for the Stromquist-Woodall theorem for two agents. Next, by judiciously mapping a circle to a graph, we produce a weighted consensus division of a star graph cake that gives at most two connected pieces to each agent -- and show that this bound on the number of connected pieces is tight. For trees, each agent receives at most h+1 connected pieces, where h is the height of the tree, and for general (connected) graphical cakes each agent receives r+2 connected pieces, where r is the radius of the graph.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Decentralized Actor-Critic Algorithm in General-sum Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04613v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov games provide a powerful framework for modeling strategic multi-agent interactions in dynamic environments. Traditionally, convergence properties of decentralized learning algorithms in these settings have been established only for special cases, such as Markov zero-sum and potential games, which do not fully capture real-world interactions. In this paper, we address this gap by studying the asymptotic properties of learning algorithms in general-sum Markov games. In particular, we focus on a decentralized algorithm where each agent adopts an actor-critic learning dynamic with asynchronous step sizes. This decentralized approach enables agents to operate independently, without requiring knowledge of others' strategies or payoffs. We introduce the concept of a Markov Near-Potential Function (MNPF) and demonstrate that it serves as an approximate Lyapunov function for the policy updates in the decentralized learning dynamics, which allows us to characterize the convergent set of strategies. We further strengthen our result under specific regularity conditions and with finite Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Buyer-Initiated Auction Mechanism for Data Redemption in Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has raised privacy concerns over user data, leading to regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). With the essential toolbox provided by machine unlearning, AI service providers are now able to remove user data from their trained models as well as the training datasets, so as to comply with such regulations. However, extensive data redemption can be costly and degrade model accuracy. To balance the cost of unlearning and the privacy protection, we propose a buyer-initiated auction mechanism for data redemption, enabling the service provider to purchase data from willing users with appropriate compensation. This approach does not require the server to have any a priori knowledge about the users' privacy preference, and provides an efficient solution for maximizing the social welfare in the investigated problem.</description>
