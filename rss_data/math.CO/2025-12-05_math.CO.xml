      <title>Sharp thresholds, hitting times and the power of choice for random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a random geometric graph process where random points $(X_i)_{i \ge 1}$ are embedded consecutively in the $d$-dimensional unit torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, and every two points at distance at most $r$ form an edge. As $r\to 0$, we confirm that well-known hitting time results for $k$-connectivity (with $k\ge 1$ fixed) and Hamiltonicity in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph process also hold for the considered geometric analogue. Moreover, we exhibit a sort of probabilistic monotonicity for each of these properties.
  We also study a geometric analogue of the power of choice where, at each step, an agent is given two random points sampled independently and uniformly from $\mathbb{T}^d$ and must add exactly one of them to the already constructed point set. When the agent is allowed to make their choice with the knowledge of the entire sequence of random points (offline 2-choice), we show that they can construct a connected graph at the first time $t$ when none of the first $t$ pairs of proposed points contains two isolated vertices in the graph induced by $(X_i)_{i=1}^{2t}$, and maintain connectivity thereafter. We also derive analogous results for $k$-connectivity and Hamiltonicity. This shows that each of the said properties can be attained two times faster (time-wise) and with four times fewer points in the offline 2-choice process compared to the 1-choice process.
  In the online version where the agent only knows the process until the current time step, we show that $k$-connectivity and Hamiltonicity cannot be significantly accelerated (time-wise) but may be realised on two times fewer points compared to the 1-choice analogue.</description>

      <title>Exactly Colored Complete Subgraphs of Infinite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given integers $m\le c$ and an exact $c$-coloring of the edges of a complete countably infinite graph (i.e. a coloring that uses exactly $c$ colors), must there be an infinite subgraph that is exactly $m$-colored? Using the Infinite Ramsey Theorem It is easy to show that the statement is true if $m=1,2$ or $c$. Erickson conjectured that it is false in all other cases. Stacey and Weidl proved that for each $m\ge 3$ there is some large enough $C(m)$ such that the conjecture is true for all pairs $(c,m)$ with $c&gt;C(m)$. The main aim of this paper is to show that for all large enough $m$ the conjecture holds for all $c&gt;m$. This reduces the number of cases needed to fully verify the conjecture to a finite number.</description>

      <title>Covering Relations in the Poset of Combinatorial Neural Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A combinatorial neural code is a subset of the power set $2^{[n]}$ on $[n]=\{1,\dots, n\}$, in which each $1\leq i\leq n$ represents a neuron and each element (codeword) represents the co-firing event of some neurons. Consider a space $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$, simulating an animal's environment, and a collection $\mathcal{U}=\{U_1,\dots,U_n\}$ of open subsets of $X$. Each $U_i\subseteq X$ simulates a place field which is a specific region where a place cell $i$ is active. Then, the code of $\mathcal{U}$ in $X$ is defined as $\text{code}(\mathcal{U},X)=\left\{\sigma\subseteq[n]\bigg|\bigcap_{i\in\sigma} U_i\setminus\bigcup_{j\notin\sigma}U_j\neq\varnothing\right\}$. If a neural code $\mathcal{C}=\text{code}(\mathcal{U},X)$ for some $X$ and $\mathcal{U}$, we say $\mathcal{C}$ has a realization of open subsets of some space $X$. Although every combinatorial neural code obviously has a realization by some open subsets, determining whether it has a realization by some open convex subsets remains unsolved. Many studies attempted to tackle this decision problem, but only partial results were achieved. In fact, a previous study showed that the decision problem of convex neural codes is NP-hard. Furthermore, the authors of this study conjectured that every convex neural code can be realized as a minor of a neural code arising from a representable oriented matroid, which can lead to an equivalence between convex and polytope convex neural codes. Even though this conjecture has been confirmed in dimension two, its validity in higher dimensions is still unknown. To advance the investigation of this conjecture, we provide a complete characterization of the covering relations within the poset $\mathbf{P_{Code}}$ of neural codes.</description>

      <title>A note on degree conditions for Ramsey goodness of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For given graphs $G_{1}, G_{2}$ and $G$, let $G\rightarrow (G_{1}, G_{2})$ denote that each red-blue-coloring of $E(G)$ yields a red copy of $G_{1}$ or a blue copy of $G_{2}$. Arag{\~a}o, Marciano and Mendon{\c c}a [L. Arag{\~a}o, J. Pedro Marciano and W. Mendon{\c c}a, Degree conditions for Ramsey goodness of paths, {\it European Journal of Combinatorics}, {\bf 124} (2025), 104082] proved the following. Let $G$ be a graph on $N\geq (n- 1)(m- 1)+ 1$ vertices. If $\delta(G)\geq N- \lceil n/2\rceil$, then $G\rightarrow (P_{n}, K_{m})$, where $P_{n}$ is a tree on $n$ vertices. In this note, we generalize $P_{n}$ to any tree $T_{n}$ with $n$ vertices, and improve the lower bound of $\delta(G)$. We further improve the lower bound when $T_{n}\neq K_{1, n- 1}$, which partially confirms their conjecture.</description>

      <title>Unavoidable induced subgraphs forced by graphs with many vertices of prescribed properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a function $p : V(G)\to \mathbb N$ and an integer $k\ge 0$, define $p_k(G)$ as the number of vertices with $p(v)\ge k$. We say that $p_k(G)$ is bounded for all $\HH$-free graphs if there exists a constant $c=c(\HH)$ such that $p_k(G)&lt;c$ for all such graphs $G$. Here, a graph $G$ is said to be $\HH$-free if it contains no member of $\HH$ as an induced subgraph. When $p$ represents the degree of a vertex, Ramsey's theorem implies that $p_0(G)$ is bounded for every $\{K_n, E_n\}$-free graphs, where $K_n$ and $E_n$ denote the complete graph and the edgeless graph on $n$ vertices, respectively. The connected version of Ramsey's theorem says that $p_0(G)$ is bounded for all $\{K_n, P_n, K_{1,n}\}$-free connected graphs, where $P_n$ and $K_{1,n}$ are the $n$-vertex path and the star with $n$ leaves. In this paper, we extend the Ramsey's theorem to $p_2(G)$ where $p$ denotes the degree, the local independent number, the local component number, and sharp degree, that is, we characterize the forbidden family of graphs $\HH$ such that $p_2(G)$ is bounded for all (connected) $\HH$-free graphs. Moreover, we also characterize the forbidden family of graphs $\HH$ for which there is a constant $c=c(\HH)$ such that $p_c(G)$ is bounded for all $\HH$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Paths with two blocks in oriented graphs of large minimum semi-degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stein (2020) conjectured that for any positive integer $k$, every oriented graph of minimum semi-degree greater than $k/2$ contains every oriented path of length $k$. This conjecture is true for directed paths by a result from Jackson (JGT, 1981). In this paper, we establish the validity of Stein's conjecture specifically for any oriented path with two blocks, where, a block of an oriented path $P$ refers to a maximal directed subpath within $P$.</description>

      <title>Marton's Conjecture in Finite Fields of Odd Characteristic via a Polynomial Stability Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study small-doubling subsets of finite-dimensional vector spaces over finite fields of odd characteristic. Let $A \subset \mathbb{F}_p^n$ be non-empty with $|A+A| \le K|A|$. We prove that $A$ can be covered by at most $K^{O(1)}$ cosets of a subspace $H \le \mathbb{F}_p^n$ with $|H| \le K^{O(1)}|A|$, giving a polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa (PFR/Marton) theorem in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ for odd primes $p$. The key input is a polynomial stability lemma which yields a dichotomy: either the $L^4$ Fourier mass of $1_A$ concentrates on a span of dimension $\operatorname{poly}(K)$, or in a quotient of codimension $\operatorname{poly}(K)$ the doubling constant decreases by at least $K^{-C}$. Iterating the latter alternative and combining it with standard covering arguments gives the polynomial-structured conclusion. In conjunction with the characteristic-$2$ results of Green, Gowers, Manners, and Tao, our methods provide an alternative finite-field route to Marton-type Freiman--Ruzsa theorems across all characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of symmetric polynomials $\mathfrak{G}^{(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})}_{\lambda}$ arising from exactly solvable lattice models associated with the quantised loop algebra $\mathcal{U}_{q}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2}[z^\pm])$. The polynomials $\mathfrak{G}^{(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})}_{\lambda}$ unify $q$-Whittaker polynomials, inhomogeneous $q$-Whittaker polynomials, Grothendieck polynomials and their duals. Using Yang--Baxter equation, we derive Cauchy identities and combinatorial formulas for the transition coefficients.</description>

      <title>Total $2$-cut complexes of powers of cycle graphs and Cartesian products of certain graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive integer $k$, the \emph{ total $k$-cut complex} of a graph $G$, denoted as $\Delta_k^t(G)$, is the simplicial complex whose facets are $\sigma \subseteq V(G)$ such that $|\sigma| = |V(G)|-k$ and the induced subgraph $G[V(G) \setminus \sigma]$ does not contain any edge. These complexes were introduced by Bayer et al.\ in \cite{Bayer2024TotalCutcomplex} in connection with commutative algebra. In the same paper, they studied the homotopy types of these complexes for various families of graphs, including cycle graphs $C_n$, squared cycle graphs $C_n^2$, and Cartesian products of complete graphs and path graphs $K_m \square P_2$ and $K_2 \square P_n$. In this article, we extend the work of Bayer et al.\ for these families of graphs.  We focus on the complexes $\Delta_2^t(G)$ and determine the homotopy types of these complexes for three classes of graphs: (i) $p$-th powers of cycle graphs $C_n^p$ (ii) $K_m \square P_n$ and (iii) $K_m \square C_n$. Using discrete Morse theory, we show that these complexes are homotopy equivalent to wedges of spheres. We also give the number and dimension of spheres appearing in the homotopy type. Our result on powers of cycle graphs $C_n^p$ proves a conjecture of Shen et al.\ about the homotopy type of the complexes $\Delta_2^t(C_n^p)$.</description>

      <title>Metric dimension of Cartesian product of stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metric dimension of a graph is the minimum number of landmark vertices required so that every vertex can be uniquely identified by its distances to the landmarks. This parameter captures the fundamental tradeoff between compact information encoding and unambiguous identification in networked systems. In this work, we determine exact value for the metric dimension of the Cartesian product $K_{1,m} \square K_{1,n}$, also known as hub-and-spoke grids, across all values of $m$ and $n$. In addition, we present a constructive linear-time algorithm that builds a minimum resolving set, providing both theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility. We complement our results with visualization of parameter regimes that illustrate the design space. The findings establish design rules for minimizing landmark sensors and support applications in graph-based localization, monitoring networks, and intelligent information systems. Our results extend the theory of metric dimension and contribute efficient methods of direct relevance to information science and computational graph theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a new formula for umbral operators which provides three key insights. First, it clarifies a connection between umbral calculus and iteration theory. Second, it paves the way for a definition of fractional exponents of umbral operators. And lastly, its proof synthesizes a multitude of existing operational calculus results that demonstrates a new level of effectiveness in the field. We demonstrate its application through a new and natural extension of the Laguerre polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Erd\"os matrix $E$ is a bistochastic matrix whose sum of squares of entries (Frobenius norm squared) equals its maxtrace (maximum of all the $\sigma$-traces for permutations $\sigma$'s). We characterize all Erd\"os $E$ by the patterns of their zero entries; showing that each such skeleton has at most one $E$. We present an algorithm to find all $n\times n$ Erd\"os matrices, which finds them up to $n\leqslant 5$ quickly and also size $n=6$. We further show some presently known RCDS matrices to be Erd\"os.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C_{s,t}$ be the complete bipartite geometric graph, with $s$ and $t$ vertices on two distinct parallel lines respectively, and all $s t$ straight-line edges drawn between them. In this paper, we show that every complete bipartite simple topological graph, with parts of size $2(k-1)^4 + 1$ and $2^{k^{5k}}$, contains a topological subgraph weakly isomorphic to $C_{k,k}$. As a corollary, every $n$-vertex simple topological graph not containing a plane path of length $k$ has at most $O_k(n^{2 - 8/k^4})$ edges. When $k = 3$, we obtain a stronger bound by showing that every $n$-vertex simple topological graph not containing a plane path of length 3 has at most $O(n^{4/3})$ edges. We also prove that $x$-monotone simple topological graphs not containing a plane path of length 3 have at most a linear number of edges.</description>

      <title>Distribution of deformed Laplacian limit points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates limit points of the deformed Laplacian matrix, which merges the Laplacian and signless Laplacian matrices of a graph through a quadractic one-parameter family of matrices. First, we show that any value greater or equal to 1 is a deformed Laplacian limit point (for different values of the parameter $s$) using a simple family of trees. Second, we define $(T_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ the Shearer's sequence of caterpillars for $\lambda&gt;1$ and we present a convergence criterion based on Shearer's approach. Our main result is that for any fixed value $\lambda_0&gt;1$ there exists a unique value $0&lt;s^* &lt;\sqrt{\lambda_0} -1$ such that, and for any $s \in (0,s^*)$ the interval $[\lambda_0, \; +\infty)$ is entirely formed by $s$-deformed Laplacian limit points (for the same value of $s$). Finally, we provide some numerical data exploring the limit properties.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic products in random integer sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known consequence of Schur's theorem is that for $r\in \mathbb{N}$, if $n$ is sufficiently large, then any $r$-colouring of $[n]$ results in monochromatic $a,b,c\in [n]$ such that $ab=c$. In this paper we are interested in the threshold at which the binomial random set $[n]_p$ almost surely inherits this Ramsey-type property. In particular for $r=2$ colours, we show that this threshold lies between $n^{-1/9-o(1)}$ and $n^{-1/11}$. Whilst analogous questions for solutions to (sets of) linear equations are now well understood, our work suggests that both the behaviour of the thresholds and the proof methods needed to determine them differ substantially in the non-linear setting.</description>

      <title>The Clifford defect of a numerical semigroup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Clifford defect is a rational number associated to the Weierstrass semigroup at a given point of an algebraic curve. It describes the error-correcting capability of the so-called Modified Algorithm for decoding the corresponding one-point codes defined at the point. This defect also finds applications in other contexts involving one-point codes. We study the Clifford defect of some numerical semigroups arising from curves and give explicit formulas for them.</description>

      <title>Edge density and minimum degree thresholds for $H$-free graphs with unbounded chromatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chromatic threshold $\delta_\chi(H)$ of a graph $H$ is the infimum of $d&gt;0$ such that the chromatic number of every $n$-vertex $H$-free graph with minimum degree at least $dn$ is bounded in terms of $H$ and $d$. A breakthrough result of Allen, B\"ottcher, Griffiths, Kohayakawa, and Morris determined $\delta_\chi(H)$ for every graph $H$; in particular, if $\chi(H)=r\ge 3$, then $\delta_\chi(H) \in\{\frac{r-3}{r-2},~\frac{2 r-5}{2 r-3},~\frac{r-2}{r-1}\}$.
  In this paper we investigate the trade-off between minimum degree and edge density in the critical window around the chromatic threshold. For a fixed graph $H$ with $\chi(H)=r$, allowing a constant deficit below $\delta_\chi(H)$, we prove sharp (up to lower-order terms) upper bounds on the edge density of $n$-vertex $H$-free graphs whose chromatic number diverges. Equivalently, within this degree regime we show that a suitable global bound on the number of edges forces the chromatic number to remain bounded. Our results thus quantify how global edge density can compensate for a deficit in the local minimum-degree condition near $\delta_\chi(H)$; more specifically, we obtain explicit bounds in two of the three possible cases arising in the trichotomy of $\delta_\chi(H)$. Our extremal constructions -- based on Erd\H{o}s graphs and blowups of Borsuk--Hajnal graphs -- show that these bounds are best possible up to $o(n^2)$ terms.</description>

      <title>Permanental rank versus determinantal rank of random matrices over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by basic complexity and probability questions about permanents of random matrices over finite fields, and in particular, about properties separating the permanent and the determinant. Fix $q = p^m$ some power of an odd prime, and let $k \leq n$ both be growing. For a uniformly random $n \times k$ matrix $A$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$, we study the probability that all $k \times k$ submatrices of $A$ have zero permanent; namely that $A$ does not have full "permanental rank". When $k = n$, this is simply the probability that a random square matrix over $\mathbb{F}_q$ has zero permanent, which we do not understand. We believe that the probability in this case is $\frac{1}{q} + o(1)$, which would be in contrast to the case of the determinant, where the answer is $\frac{1}{q} + \Omega_q(1)$. Our main result is that when $k$ is $O(\sqrt{n})$, the probability that a random $n \times k$ matrix does not have full permanental rank is essentially the same as the probability that the matrix has a $0$ column, namely $(1 +o(1)) \frac{k}{q^n}$. In contrast, for determinantal (standard) rank the analogous probability is $\Theta(\frac{q^k}{q^n})$. At the core of our result are some basic linear algebraic properties of the permanent that distinguish it from the determinant.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers for continuous $N$-particle ensembles at fixed temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers of averaged empirical measures of $N$-particle ensembles, in terms of the asymptotics of their Bessel generating functions, in the fixed temperature regime. This settles an open problem posed by Benaych-Georges, Cuenca and Gorin. For one direction, we use the moment method through Dunkl operators, and for the other we employ a special case of the formula of Chapuy--Dolega for the generating function of infinite constellations. As applications, we prove that the LLN for $\theta$-sums and $\theta$-corners of random matrices are given by the free convolution and free projection, respectively, regardless of the value of inverse temperature parameter $\theta$. We also prove the LLN for a time-slice of the $\theta$-Dyson Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Generalized discrete Markov spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the special subset of the Markov-Lagrange spectrum (and the Markov spectrum) called the discrete Markov spectrum. The discrete Markov spectrum is defined in terms of the Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz.$ Using the tool called snake graphs, originating from cluster algebra theory, we first reconstruct proofs of its properties in a combinatorial framework and then extend it to the generalized setting. We then introduce the generalized discrete Markov spectrum, defined analogously via the generalized Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k_1 yz + k_2 zx + k_3 xy = (3 + k_1 + k_2 + k_3) xyz.$ We prove that this generalized spectrum is contained in the Markov-Lagrange spectrum and thus the Markov spectrum.</description>

Abstract: In this work we take a step towards characterising strongly flip-flat classes of graphs. Strong flip-flatness appears to be the analogue of uniform almost-wideness in the setting of dense classes of graphs. We prove that strongly flip-flat classes of graphs that are weakly sparse are indeed uniformly almost-wide.</description>

      <title>Dimension statistics of representations of finite groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses what the dimension data of irreducible representations of a finite group looks like in some specific cases, including unipotent and reductive groups over finite fields.
  The essence of our investigation is whether the dimension data of irreducible representations of a finite group can be ``geometerized'', to become equal to the cardinality of certain orbit spaces.
  The first part of this paper deals with nilpotent and reductive groups over finite fields, whereas the second part deals with the symmetric group $S_n$. The main conclusion that we want to bring out to contrast these two cases is that for reductive groups over finite fields, the dimension data is concentrated (in a statistical sense) in a neighborhood of the maximal dimension, whereas for the symmetric group, it is spread out.</description>

Abstract: We show that the separating systole of high genus triangulations is of logarithmic order (in the size of the triangulation). Our methods also allow us to show an enumerative result, i.e. the convergence of the "genus ratio" for high genus triangulations. This complements the convergence of the "size ratio" that was proven in previous work with Budzinski.</description>

      <title>Quasi-coincidence of cluster structures on positroid varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By work of a number of authors, beginning with Scott and culminating with Galashin and Lam, the coordinate rings of positroid varieties in the Grassmannian carry cluster algebra structures. In fact, they typically carry many such structures, the two best understood being the source-labelled and target-labelled structures, referring to how the initial cluster is computed from a Postnikov diagram or plabic graph. In this article, we show that these two cluster algebra structures quasi-coincide, meaning in particular that a cluster variable in one structure may be expressed in the other structure as the product of a cluster variable and a Laurent monomial in the frozen variables. This resolves a conjecture attributed to Muller and Speyer from 2017. The proof depends critically on categorification: of the relevant cluster algebra structures by the author, of perfect matchings and twists by the author with \c{C}anak\c{c}{\i} and King, and of quasi-equivalences of cluster algebras by Fraser and Keller. By similar techniques, we also show that Muller and Speyer's left twist map is a quasi-cluster equivalence from the target-labelled structure to the source-labelled structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12919v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The star chromatic number on a graph is the minimum number of colors in a proper vertex coloring forbidding any $P_4$ with two colors (bicolored). This problem was introduced by Gr\"unbaum (1973) together with the acyclic coloring of graphs, where bicolored cycles are avoided. In this paper, we study a generalization of this problem, by considering proper vertex coloring on graphs forbidding bicolored paths of a fixed length, which was initially discussed by Alon, McDiarmid, and Reed (1991). Here, we study this problem on products of two paths. We show that at least 4 colors are needed to properly color the product of paths, $P_m\square P_n$, avoiding a bicolored $P_k,$ unless $n&lt;k-2$ or $m&lt;k-2.$ With this result, the above question is settled for all $k$ on 2-dimensional grids.</description>

Abstract: In 1976, Cameron, Goethals, Seidel, and Shult classified all the graphs whose smallest eigenvalue is at least $-2$ by relating such graphs to root systems that appear in the classification of semisimple Lie algebras. In this paper, extending their beautiful theorem, we give a complete classification of all connected graphs whose smallest eigenvalue lies in $(-\lambda^*, -2)$, where $\lambda^* = \rho^{1/2} + \rho^{-1/2} \approx 2.01980$, and $\rho$ is the unique real root of $x^3 = x + 1$. Our result is the first classification of infinitely many connected graphs with their smallest eigenvalue in $(-\lambda, -2)$ for any constant $\lambda &gt; 2$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the power of nearly purely operational techniques in the study of umbral calculus. We present a concise reconstruction of the theory based on a systematic use of linear operators, with particular attention to umbral operators. We also give an in-depth study of the generating functions associated to umbral calculus, and show how these lead to short proofs of several advanced results, including the Lagrange-B\"urmann inversion theorem. Finally, we discuss pseudoinverses for delta operators and illustrate our methods with a variety of examples.</description>

      <title>Variants of Conway Checkers and k-nacci Jumping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conway Checkers is a game played with a checker placed in each square of the lower half of an infinite checkerboard. Pieces move by jumping over an adjacent checker, removing the checker jumped over. Conway showed that it is not possible to reach row 5 in finitely many moves by weighting each cell in the board by powers of the golden ratio such that no move increases the total weight. Other authors have considered the game played on many different boards, including generalising the standard game to higher dimensions. We work on a board of arbitrary dimension, where we allow a cell to hold multiple checkers and begin with m checkers on each cell. We derive an upper bound and a constructive lower bound on the height that can be reached, such that the upper bound almost never fails to be equal to the lower bound. We also consider the more general case where instead of jumping over 1 checker, each checker moves by jumping over k checkers, and again show the maximum height reachable lies within bounds that are almost always equal.</description>

      <title>Explicit Expressions for Iterates of Power Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present several formulas for both the discrete and fractional iterates of an invertible power series $f$, using a new unifying approach based on umbral calculus. Known formulas are extended, and their proofs simplified, while new expressions are introduced. In particular, by employing $q$-calculus identities, we eliminate the requirement for $f'(0)$ to equal $1$ and the resulting general expressions for the iterative logarithm are obtained as well.</description>

      <title>Enriched Cycle Structures and Roots of Permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a duality between $r$-regular permutations and $r$-cycle permutations, and a monotone property due to B\'ona-McLennan-White on the probability $p_r(n)$ for a random permutation of $\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$ to have an $r$-th root, where $r$ is a prime. For $r=2$, the duality relates permutations with odd cycles to permutations with even cycles. To handle the general case where $r\geq 2$, we define an $r$-enriched permutation as a permutation with $r$-singular cycles colored by one of the colors $1, 2, \ldots, r-1$. In this setup, we discover a bijection between $r$-regular permutations and enriched $r$-cycle permutations, which in turn yields a stronger version of an inequality of B\'ona-McLennan-White. This leads to a fully combinatorial understanding of the monotone property, thereby answering their question. When $r$ is a prime power $q^l$, we further show that $p_r(n)$ is monotone. In the case that $n+1 \not\equiv 0 \pmod q$, the equality $p_r(n)=p_r(n+1)$ has been established by Chernoff.</description>

      <title>Hunting a rabbit: complexity, approximability and some characterizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Hunters and Rabbit game, $k$ hunters attempt to shoot an invisible rabbit on a given graph $G$. In each round, the hunters select $k$ vertices to shoot at, while the rabbit moves along an edge of $G$. The hunters win if, at any point, the rabbit is shot. The hunting number of $G$, denoted $h(G)$, is the minimum integer $k$ such that $k$ hunters have a winning strategy regardless of the rabbit's moves.
  The computational complexity of determining $h(G)$ has been one of the longest-standing open questions about the game. Our first main contribution resolves this by proving that computing $h(G)$ is NP-hard, even for bipartite simple graphs. We further show that the problem remains NP-hard even when $h(G) = O(n^{\epsilon})$ or when $n - h(G) = O(n^{\epsilon})$, where $n$ is the order of $G$. In addition, we prove that it is NP-hard to approximate $h(G)$ additively within $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$.
  When a time limit $l$ is imposed on the hunting process, we show that computing $h(G)$ remains NP-hard for any $l \ge 2$ bounded by a polynomial in $n$. On the positive side, we present a polynomial-time $l$-factor approximation algorithm for computing the hunting number with time limit $l$, and we show that $h(G)$ can be computed in polynomial time for bipartite graphs when only two time slots are allowed ($l = 2$).
  Finally, we provide a forbidden-subgraph characterization of graphs with loops that satisfy $h(G) = 1$, extending a known characterization for simple graphs.</description>

      <title>Characteristic polynomial of generalized Ewens random permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the convergence of the characteristic polynomial for random permutation matrices sampled from the generalized Ewens distribution. Under this distribution, the measure of a given permutation depends only on its cycle structure, according to certain weights assigned to each cycle length. The proof is based on uniform control of the characteristic polynomial using results from the singularity analysis of generating functions, together with the convergence of traces to explicit random variables expressed via a Poisson family. The limit function is the exponential of a Poisson series which has already appeared in the case of uniform permutation matrices. It is the Poisson analog of the Gaussian Holomorphic Chaos, related to the limit of characteristic polynomials for other matrix models such as Circular Ensembles, i.i.d. matrices, and Gaussian elliptic matrices.</description>

      <title>A note on the Bj\"{o}rner--Kalai theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1988, Bj\"{o}rner and Kalai used combinatorial shadow functions to characterize the maximal Betti sequence for a given $f$-vector and the minimal $f$-vector for a given Betti sequence. Their description of the maximal Betti sequence was expressed through a set of inequalities. In this paper, we introduce an error function $\delta_k$ associated with the combinatorial shadow functions and use it to sharpen these inequalities into exact equalities. As a corollary, we obtain an equivalent form of Bj\"{o}rner and Kalai's characterization of all possible pairs $(f,\beta)$ that can occur as the $f$-vector and Betti sequence of a simplicial complex. Moreover, combining our results with a previous result of Bj\"{o}rner in 2011, we derive a new number-theoretic inequality concerning the count of odd square-free integers with a specified number of prime factors.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Maximal Matroid Degenerations and Irreducible Decompositions of Circuit Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matroid theory provides a unifying framework for studying dependence across combinatorics, geometry, and applications ranging from rigidity to statistics. In this work, we study circuit varieties of matroids, defined by their minimal dependencies, which play a central role in modeling determinantal varieties, rigidity problems, and conditional independence relations. We introduce an efficient computational strategy for decomposing the circuit variety of a given matroid $M$, based on an algorithm that identifies its maximal degenerations. These degenerations correspond to the largest matroids lying below $M$ in the weak order. Our framework yields explicit and computable decompositions of circuit varieties that were previously out of reach for symbolic or numerical algebra systems. We apply our strategy to several classical configurations, including the V\'amos matroid, the unique Steiner quadruple system $S(3,4,8)$, projective and affine planes, the dual of the Fano matroid, and the dual of the graphic matroid of $K_{3,3}$. In each case, we successfully compute the minimal irreducible decomposition of their circuit varieties.</description>

      <title>Convolutive sequences, I: Through the lens of integer partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the convolutive behavior of the counting function for partitions with designated summands in which all parts are odd, we consider coefficient sequences $(a_n)_{n\ge 0}$ of primitive eta-products that satisfy the generic convolutive property
  \begin{align*}
  \sum_{n\ge 0} a_{mn} q^n = \left(\sum_{n\ge 0} a_n q^n\right)^m
  \end{align*}
  for a specific positive integer $m$. Given the results of an exhaustive search of the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences for such sequences for $m$ up to $6$, we first focus on the case where $m=2$ with our attention mainly paid to the combinatorics of two $2$-convolutive sequences, featuring bijective proofs for both. For other $2$-convolutive sequences discovered in the OEIS, we apply generating function manipulations to show their convolutivity. We also give two examples of $3$-convolutive sequences. Finally, we discuss other convolutive series that are not eta-products.</description>

      <title>The 3-state Potts model on planar triangulations: explicit algebraic solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the $3$-state Potts generating function $T(\nu,w)$ of planar triangulations; that is, the bivariate series that counts planar triangulations with vertices coloured in $3$ colours, weighted by their size (number of vertices, recorded by the variable $w$) and by the number of monochromatic edges (variable $\nu$).
  This series was proved to be algebraic 15 years ago by Bernardi and the first author: this follows from its link with the solution of a discrete differential equation (DDE), and from general algebraicity results on such equations. However, despite recent progresses on the effective solution of DDEs, the exact value of $T(\nu,w)$ has remained unknown so far -- except in the case $\nu=0$, corresponding to proper colourings and solved by Tutte in the sixties. We determine here this exact value, proving that $T(\nu,w)$ satisfies a polynomial equation of degree $11$ in $T$ and genus $1$ in $w$ and $T$. We prove that the critical value of $\nu$ is $\nu_c=1+3/\sqrt{47}$, with a critical exponent $6/5$ in the series $T(\nu_c, \cdot)$, while the other values of $\nu$ yield the usual map exponent $3/2$.
  By duality of the planar Potts model, our results also characterize the 3-state Potts generating function of planar cubic maps, in which all vertices have degree $3$. In particular, the annihilating polynomial, still of degree $11$, that we obtain for properly 3-coloured cubic maps proves a conjecture by Bruno Salvy from 2009.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite set $X$ in a Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ is called Ramsey if for every $k$ there exists an integer $n$ such that whenever $\mathbb{R}^n$ is coloured with $k$ colours, there is a monochromatic copy of $X$. Graham conjectured that all spherical sets are Ramsey, but progress on this conjecture has been slow. A key result of K\v{r}\'{i}\v{z} is that all sets that embed in sets that are acted on transitively by a soluble group are Ramsey. We show that for nearly all known examples of Ramsey sets the converse is true, with only two possible exceptions.</description>

      <title>Switching Rook Polynomials of Collections of Cells: Palindromicity and Domino-Stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rook polynomial is a generating function that enumerates the number of ways to place rooks, with no two in the same row or column, on a collection of cells regarded as a pruned chessboard. In combinatorial commutative algebra, special attention is devoted to its variant, the switching rook polynomial, which is conjectured to coincide with the $h$-polynomial of the $K$-algebra associated with the given collection of cells. In this context, palindromicity plays a crucial role, as it reflects the algebraic property of Gorensteinness. In this paper, we introduce a new combinatorial property, called domino-stability, and we prove that the switching rook polynomial of a collection of cells $\mathcal{P}$ is palindromic if and only if $\mathcal{P}$ is domino-stable. Building upon this result, we derive new insights into the characterization of Gorenstein $K$-algebras arising from polyominoes or, more generally, from collections of cells.</description>

      <title>Independent sets and colorings of $K_{t,t,t}$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov conjectured in 1999 that every $F$-free graph of maximum degree at most $\Delta$ has chromatic number $O(\Delta / \log \Delta)$. This was previously known only for almost bipartite graphs, that is, for subgraphs of $K_{1,t,t}$ (verified by Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov themselves), while most recent results were concerned with improving the leading constant factor in the case where $F$ is almost bipartite. We prove this conjecture for all $3$-colorable graphs $F$, i.e. subgraphs of $K_{t,t,t}$, representing the first progress toward the conjecture since it was posed.
  A closely related conjecture of Ajtai, Erd\H{o}s, Koml\'os, and Szemer\'edi from 1981 asserts that for every graph $F$, every $n$-vertex $F$-free graph of average degree $d$ contains an independent set of size $\Omega(n \log d / d)$. We prove this conjecture in a strong form for all 3-colorable graphs $F$. More precisely, we show that every $n$-vertex $K_{t,t,t}$-free graph of average degree $d$ contains an independent set of size at least $(1 - o(1)) n \log d / d$, matching Shearer's celebrated bound for triangle-free graphs (the case $t = 1$) and thereby yielding a substantial strengthening of it. Our proof combines a new variant of the R\"odl nibble method for constructing independent sets with a Tur\'an-type result on $K_{t,t,t}$-free graphs.</description>

Abstract: We consider a non-exchangeable system of interacting quantum particles with mean-field type interactions, subject to continuous measurement on dense graphs. In the mean-field limit, we derive a graphon-based quantum filtering system, establish its well-posedness, and prove propagation of chaos for multi-class bosonic systems with blockwise interactions. We then discuss applications to quantum state preparation and quantum graphon games.</description>

We establish new infinite families of Ramanujan-type congruences, divisibility results, and positive-density prime sets for which $c_{k, r_1, r_2}(n)$ vanishes modulo a given prime.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove several results on the structure of maximal sets $S \subseteq [N]$ such that $S$ mod $p$ is contained in a short arithmetic progression, or the union of short progressions, where $p$ ranges over a subset of primes in an interval $[y,2y]$ with $(\log N)^{O(1)} &lt; y \leq N$. We also provide several constructions demonstrating the sharpness of our results. Furthermore, as an application, we provide several improvements on the larger sieve bound for $|S|$ when $S$ mod $p$ has strong additive structure, parallel to the work of Green--Harper and Shao for improvements on the large sieve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical studies of the Fibonacci sequence focus on its periodicity modulo $m$ (the Pisano periods) with canonical initialization. We investigate instead the complete periodic structure arising from all $m^2$ possible initializations in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. We discover perfect chiral symmetry between the Fibonacci recurrence $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and its parity transform $a_n = - a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and observe fractal self-similarity in the extension from prime to prime power moduli. Additionally, we classify prime moduli based on their quadratic reciprocity and demonstrate that periodic sequences exhibit weight preservation under modular extension. Furthermore, we define a minima distribution $P(n)$ governed by Lucas ratios, which satisfies the symmetric relation $P(n)=P(1-n)$. For cyclotomic recurrences, we propose explicit counting functions for the number of distinct periods with connections to necklace enumeration. These findings imply potential connections to Viswanath's random recurrence, modular forms and L-functions.</description>
