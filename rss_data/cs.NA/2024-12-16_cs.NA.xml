      <title>A $C^0$ interior penalty method for the stream function formulation of the surface Stokes problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a $C^0$ interior penalty method for the fourth-order stream function formulation of the surface Stokes problem. The scheme utilizes continuous, piecewise polynomial spaces defined on an approximate surface. We show that the resulting discretization is positive definite and derive error estimates in various norms in terms of the polynomial degree of the finite element space as well as the polynomial degree to define the geometry approximation. A notable feature of the scheme is that it does not explicitly depend on the Gauss curvature of the surface. This is achieved via a novel integration-by-parts formula for the surface biharmonic operator.</description>

      <title>Empirical sparse regression on quadratic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximating field variables and data vectors from sparse samples is a key challenge in computational science. Widely used methods such as gappy proper orthogonal decomposition and empirical interpolation rely on linear approximation spaces, limiting their effectiveness for data representing transport-dominated and wave-like dynamics. To address this limitation, we introduce quadratic manifold sparse regression, which trains quadratic manifolds with a sparse greedy method and computes approximations on the manifold through novel nonlinear projections of sparse samples. The nonlinear approximations obtained with quadratic manifold sparse regression achieve orders of magnitude higher accuracies than linear methods on data describing transport-dominated dynamics in numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Consistency enforcement for the iterative solution of weak Galerkin finite element approximation of Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite element discretization of Stokes problems can result in singular, inconsistent saddle point linear algebraic systems. This inconsistency can cause many iterative methods to fail to converge. In this work, we consider the lowest-order weak Galerkin finite element method to discretize Stokes flow problems and study a consistency enforcement by modifying the right-hand side of the resulting linear system. It is shown that the modification of the scheme does not affect the optimal-order convergence of the numerical solution. Moreover, inexact block diagonal and triangular Schur complement preconditioners and the minimal residual method (MINRES) and the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) are studied for the iterative solution of the modified scheme. Bounds for the eigenvalues and the residual of MINRES/GMRES are established. Those bounds show that the convergence of MINRES and GMRES is independent of the viscosity parameter and mesh size. The convergence of the modified scheme and effectiveness of the preconditioners are verified using numerical examples in two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>A unified convergence analysis framework of the energy-stable ETDRK3 schemes for the No-slope-selection thin film model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a unified framework for the space-time convergence analysis of the energy-stable third-order accurate exponential time differencing Runge-Kutta schemes. By employing Fourier pseudo-spectral discretization in space and the inner product technique, we derive a rigorous Fourier eigenvalue analysis, which provides a detailed optimal convergence rate and error estimate. The primary challenge is addressing the complex nonlinear terms in the NSS equation. Fortunately, this challenge could be resolved through careful eigenvalue bound estimates for various operators.</description>

      <title>Energy-Based Distortion-Balancing Parameterization for Open Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface parameterization is a fundamental concept in fields such as differential geometry and computer graphics. It involves mapping a surface in three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional parameter space. This process allows for the systematic representation and manipulation of surfaces of complicated shapes by simplifying them into a manageable planar domain. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm for computing the parameterization of simply connected open surfaces that achieves an optimal balance between angle and area distortions. We rigorously prove that the iteration in our algorithm converges globally, and numerical results demonstrate that the resulting mappings are bijective and effectively balance angular and area accuracy across various triangular meshes. Additionally, we present the practical usefulness of the proposed algorithm by applying it to represent surfaces as geometry images.</description>

      <title>Discrete harmonics for stream function-vorticity Stokes problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the bidimensional Stokes problem for incompressible fluids in stream function-vorticity. For this problem, the classical finite elements method of degree one converges only to order one-half  for the L2 norm of the vorticity. We propose to use harmonic functions to approach the vorticity along the boundary. Discrete harmonics are functions that are used in practice to derive a new numerical method. We prove that we obtain with this numerical scheme an error of order one for the L2 norm of the vorticity.</description>

      <title>Enhanced second-order Gauss-Seidel projection methods for the Landau-Lifshitz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of magnetization in ferromagnetic materials are modeled by the Landau-Lifshitz equation, which presents significant challenges due to its inherent nonlinearity and non-convex constraint. These complexities necessitate efficient numerical methods for micromagnetics simulations. The Gauss-Seidel Projection Method (GSPM), first introduced in 2001, is among the most efficient techniques currently available. However, existing GSPMs are limited to first-order accuracy. This paper introduces two novel second-order accurate GSPMs based on a combination of the biharmonic equation and the second-order backward differentiation formula, achieving computational complexity comparable to that of solving the scalar biharmonic equation implicitly. The first proposed method achieves unconditional stability through Gauss-Seidel updates, while the second method exhibits conditional stability with a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy constant of 0.25. Through consistency analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of these methods. Notably, the first method displays unconditional stability in micromagnetics simulations, even when the stray field is updated only once per time step.</description>

      <title>FISTA-Condat-Vu: Automatic Differentiation for Hyperparameter Learning in Variational Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by industrial computed tomography, we propose a memory efficient strategy to estimate the regularization hyperparameter of a non-smooth variational model. The approach is based on a combination of FISTA and Condat-Vu algorithms exploiting the convergence rate of the former and the low per-iteration complexity of the latter. The estimation is cast as a bilevel learning problem where a first-order method is obtained via reduced-memory automatic differentiation to compute the derivatives. The method is validated with experimental industrial tomographic data with the numerical implementation available.</description>

      <title>Comparative study on higher order compact RBF-FD formulas with Gaussian and Multiquadric radial functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generate Gaussian radial function based higher order compact RBF-FD formulas for some differential operators. Analytical expressions for weights associated to first and second derivative formulas (up to order 10) and 2D-Laplacian formulas (up to order 6) are derived. Then these weights are used to obtain analytical expression for local truncation errors. The weights are obtained by symbolic computation of a linear system in Mathematica. Often such linear systems are not directly amenable to symbolic computation. We make use of symmetry of formula stencil along with Taylor series expansions for performing the computation. In the flat limit, the formulas converge to their respective order polynomial based compact FD formulas. We validate the formulas with standard test functions and demonstrate improvement in approximation accuracy with respect to corresponding order multiquadric based compact RBF-FD formulas and compact FD schemes. We also compute optimal value of shape parameter for each formula.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of Multi-patch Discontinuous Galerkin Isogeometric Method for Full-potential Electronic Structure Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the multi-patch discontinuous Galerkin isogeometric (DG-IGA) approximations for full-potential electronic structure calculations. We decompose the physical domain into several subdomains, represent each part of the wavefunction separately using B-spline basis functions, possibly with different degrees, on varying mesh sizes, and then combine them by DG methods. We also provide a rigorous {\em a priori} error analysis of the DG-IGA approximations for linear eigenvalue problems. Furthermore, this work offers a unified analysis framework for the DG-IGA method applied to a class of elliptic eigenvalue problems. Finally, we present several numerical experiments to verify our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for full space-time splitting discretizations of semi-linear SPDEs -- with a focus on dG domain decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a fully discretized numerical scheme for parabolic stochastic partial differential equations with multiplicative noise. Our abstract framework can be applied to formulate a non-iterative domain decomposition approach. Such methods can help to parallelize the code and therefore lead to a more efficient implementation. The domain decomposition is integrated through the Douglas-Rachford splitting scheme, where one split operator acts on one part of the domain. For an efficient space discretization of the underlying equation, we chose the discontinuous Galerkin method as this suits the parallelization strategy well. For this fully discretized scheme, we provide a strong space-time convergence result. We conclude the manuscript with numerical experiments validating our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Deep Gaussian Process Priors for Bayesian Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In image reconstruction, an accurate quantification of uncertainty is of great importance for informed decision making. Here, the Bayesian approach to inverse problems can be used: the image is represented through a random function that incorporates prior information which is then updated through Bayes' formula. However, finding a prior is difficult, as images often exhibit non-stationary effects and multi-scale behaviour. Thus, usual Gaussian process priors are not suitable. Deep Gaussian processes, on the other hand, encode non-stationary behaviour in a natural way through their hierarchical structure. To apply Bayes' formula, one commonly employs a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. In the case of deep Gaussian processes, sampling is especially challenging in high dimensions: the associated covariance matrices are large, dense, and changing from sample to sample. A popular strategy towards decreasing computational complexity is to view Gaussian processes as the solutions to a fractional stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). In this work, we investigate efficient computational strategies to solve the fractional SPDEs occurring in deep Gaussian process sampling, as well as MCMC algorithms to sample from the posterior. Namely, we combine rational approximation and a determinant-free sampling approach to achieve sampling via the fractional SPDE. We test our techniques in standard Bayesian image reconstruction problems: upsampling, edge detection, and computed tomography. In these examples, we show that choosing a non-stationary prior such as the deep GP over a stationary GP can improve the reconstruction. Moreover, our approach enables us to compare results for a range of fractional and non-fractional regularity parameter values.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Multiresolution Image Sketching for Inverse Imaging Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A challenge in high-dimensional inverse problems is developing iterative solvers to find the accurate solution of regularized optimization problems with low computational cost. An important example is computed tomography (CT) where both image and data sizes are large and therefore the forward model is costly to evaluate. Since several years algorithms from stochastic optimization are used for tomographic image reconstruction with great success by subsampling the data. Here we propose a novel way how stochastic optimization can be used to speed up image reconstruction by means of image domain sketching such that at each iteration an image of different resolution is being used. Hence, we coin this algorithm ImaSk. By considering an associated saddle-point problem, we can formulate ImaSk as a gradient-based algorithm where the gradient is approximated in the same spirit as the stochastic average gradient am\'elior\'e (SAGA) and uses at each iteration one of these multiresolution operators at random. We prove that ImaSk is linearly converging for linear forward models with strongly convex regularization functions. Numerical simulations on CT show that ImaSk is effective and increasing the number of multiresolution operators reduces the computational time to reach the modeled solution.</description>

Abstract: We study the finite element approximation of problems involving the weighted $p$-Laplacian for $p \in (1,\infty)$ and weights belonging to the Muckenhoupt class $A_1$. In particular, we consider an equation and an obstacle problem for the weighted $p$-Laplacian and derive error estimates in both cases. The analysis is based on the language of weighted Orlicz and Orlicz--Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Latent feedback control of distributed systems in multiple scenarios through deep learning-based reduced order models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous monitoring and real-time control of high-dimensional distributed systems are often crucial in applications to ensure a desired physical behavior, without degrading stability and system performances. Traditional feedback control design that relies on full-order models, such as high-dimensional state-space representations or partial differential equations, fails to meet these requirements due to the delay in the control computation, which requires multiple expensive simulations of the physical system. The computational bottleneck is even more severe when considering parametrized systems, as new strategies have to be determined for every new scenario. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time closed-loop control strategy enhanced by nonlinear non-intrusive Deep Learning-based Reduced Order Models (DL-ROMs). Specifically, in the offline phase, (i) full-order state-control pairs are generated for different scenarios through the adjoint method, (ii) the essential features relevant for control design are extracted from the snapshots through a combination of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and deep autoencoders, and (iii) the low-dimensional policy bridging latent control and state spaces is approximated with a feedforward neural network. After data generation and neural networks training, the optimal control actions are retrieved in real-time for any observed state and scenario. In addition, the dynamics may be approximated through a cheap surrogate model in order to close the loop at the latent level, thus continuously controlling the system in real-time even when full-order state measurements are missing. The effectiveness of the proposed method, in terms of computational speed, accuracy, and robustness against noisy data, is finally assessed on two different high-dimensional optimal transport problems, one of which also involving an underlying fluid flow.</description>

      <title>The Stein-log-Sobolev inequality and the exponential rate of convergence for the continuous Stein variational gradient descent method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stein Variational Gradient Descent method is a variational inference method in statistics that has recently received a lot of attention. The method provides a deterministic approximation of the target distribution, by introducing a nonlocal interaction with a kernel. Despite the significant interest, the exponential rate of convergence for the continuous method has remained an open problem, due to the difficulty of establishing the related so-called Stein-log-Sobolev inequality. Here, we prove that the inequality is satisfied for each space dimension and every kernel whose Fourier transform has a quadratic decay at infinity and is locally bounded away from zero and infinity. Moreover, we construct weak solutions to the related PDE satisfying exponential rate of decay towards the equilibrium. The main novelty in our approach is to interpret the Stein-Fisher information, also called the squared Stein discrepancy, as a duality pairing between $H^{-1}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and $H^{1}(\mathbb{R}^d)$, which allows us to employ the Fourier transform. We also provide several examples of kernels for which the Stein-log-Sobolev inequality fails, partially showing the necessity of our assumptions.</description>

      <title>On the numerical signature of blow-up in hydrodynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02328v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenon of finite time blow-up in hydrodynamic partial differential equations is central in analysis and mathematical physics. While numerical studies have guided theoretical breakthroughs, it is challenging to determine if the observed computational results are genuine or mere numerical artifacts. Here we identify numerical signatures of blow-up. Our study is based on the complexified Euler equations in two dimensions, where instant blow-up is expected. Via a geometrically consistent spatiotemporal discretization, we perform several numerical experiments and verify their computational stability. We then identify a signature of blow-up based on the growth rates of the supremum norm of the vorticity with increasing spatial resolution. The study aims to be a guide for cross-checking the validity for future numerical experiments of suspected blow-up in equations where the analysis is not yet resolved.</description>

      <title>Weighted inhomogeneous regularization for inverse problems with indirect and incomplete measurement data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regularization is a critical technique for ensuring well-posedness in solving inverse problems with incomplete measurement data. Traditionally, the regularization term is designed based on prior knowledge of the unknown signal's characteristics, such as sparsity or smoothness. Inhomogeneous regularization, which incorporates a spatially varying exponent $p$ in the standard $\ell_p$-norm-based framework, has been used to recover signals with spatially varying features. This study introduces weighted inhomogeneous regularization, an extension of the standard approach incorporating a novel exponent design and spatially varying weights. The proposed exponent design mitigates misclassification when distinct characteristics are spatially close, while the weights address challenges in recovering regions with small-scale features that are inadequately captured by traditional $\ell_p$-norm regularization. Numerical experiments, including synthetic image reconstruction and the recovery of sea ice data from incomplete wave measurements, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Robust Blockwise Random Pivoting: Fast and Accurate Adaptive Interpolative Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16002v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interpolative decomposition (ID) aims to construct a low-rank approximation formed by a basis consisting of row/column skeletons in the original matrix and a corresponding interpolation matrix. This work explores fast and accurate ID algorithms from comprehensive perspectives for empirical performance, including accuracy in both skeleton selection and interpolation matrix construction, efficiency in terms of asymptotic complexity and hardware efficiency, as well as rank adaptiveness. While many algorithms have been developed to optimize some of these aspects, practical ID algorithms proficient in all aspects remain absent. To fill in the gap, we introduce robust blockwise random pivoting (RBRP) that is asymptotically fast, hardware-efficient, and rank-adaptive, providing accurate skeletons and interpolation matrices comparable to the best existing ID algorithms in practice. Through extensive numerical experiments on various synthetic and natural datasets, we demonstrate the appealing empirical performance of RBRP from the aforementioned perspectives, as well as the robustness of RBRP to adversarial inputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-rank tensor approximation error bounds are proposed for the case of noisy input data that depend on low-rank representation type, rank and the dimensionality of the tensor. The bounds show that high-dimensional low-rank structured approximations provide superior noise-filtering properties compared to matrices with the same rank and total element count.</description>

      <title>Parameter Selection by GCV and a $\chi^2$ test within Iterative Methods for $\ell_1$-regularized Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\ell_1$ regularization is used to preserve edges or enforce sparsity in a solution to an inverse problem. We investigate the Split Bregman and the Majorization-Minimization iterative methods that turn this non-smooth minimization problem into a sequence of steps that include solving an $\ell_2$-regularized minimization problem. We consider selecting the regularization parameter in the inner generalized Tikhonov regularization problems that occur at each iteration in these $\ell_1$ iterative methods. The generalized cross validation and $\chi^2$ degrees of freedom methods are extended to these inner problems. In particular, for the $\chi^2$ method this includes extending the $\chi^2$ result for problems in which the regularization operator has more rows than columns, and showing how to use the $A-$weighted generalized inverse to estimate prior information at each inner iteration. Numerical experiments for image deblurring problems demonstrate that it is more effective to select the regularization parameter automatically within the iterative schemes than to keep it fixed for all iterations. Moreover, an appropriate regularization parameter can be estimated in the early iterations and used fixed to convergence.</description>

      <title>Parametric finite element approximation of two-phase Navier--Stokes flow with viscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a parametric finite element approximation of two-phase Navier-Stokes flow with viscoelasticity. The free boundary problem is given by the viscoelastic Navier-Stokes equations in the two fluid phases, connected by jump conditions across the interface. The elasticity in the fluids is characterised using the Oldroyd-B model with possible stress diffusion. The model was originally introduced to approximate fluid-structure interaction problems between an incompressible Newtonian fluid and a hyperelastic neo-Hookean solid, which are possible limit cases of the model. We approximate a variational formulation of the model with an unfitted finite element method that uses piecewise linear parametric finite elements. The two-phase Navier-Stokes-Oldroyd-B system in the bulk regions is discretised in a way that guarantees unconditional solvability and stability for the coupled bulk-interface system. Good volume conservation properties for the two phases are observed in the case where the pressure approximation space is enriched with the help of an XFEM function. We show the applicability of our method with some numerical results.</description>

      <title>Lifting MGARD: construction of (pre)wavelets on the interval using polynomial predictors of arbitrary order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MGARD (MultiGrid Adaptive Reduction of Data) is an algorithm for compressing and refactoring scientific data, based on the theory of multigrid methods. The core algorithm is built around stable multilevel decompositions of conforming piecewise linear $C^0$ finite element spaces, enabling accurate error control in various norms and derived quantities of interest. In this work, we extend this construction to arbitrary order Lagrange finite elements $\mathbb{Q}_p$, $p \geq 0$, and propose a reformulation of the algorithm as a lifting scheme with polynomial predictors of arbitrary order. Additionally, a new formulation using a compactly supported wavelet basis is discussed, and an explicit construction of the proposed wavelet transform for uniform dyadic grids is described.</description>

      <title>A potential energy conserving finite element method for turbulent variable density flow: application to glacier-fjord circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a continuous Galerkin finite element discretization of the non-hydrostatic Boussinesq approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations, suitable for various applications such as coastal ocean dynamics and ice-ocean interactions, among others. In particular, we introduce a consistent modification of the gravity force term which enhances conservation properties for Galerkin methods without strictly enforcing the divergence-free condition. We show that this modification results in a sharp energy estimate, including both kinetic and potential energy. Additionally, we propose a new, symmetric, tensor-based viscosity operator that is especially suitable for modeling turbulence in stratified flow. The viscosity coefficients are constructed using a residual-based shock-capturing method and the method conserves angular momentum and dissipates kinetic energy. We validate our proposed method through numerical tests and use it to model the ocean circulation and basal melting beneath the ice tongue of the Ryder Glacier and the adjacent Sherard Osborn fjord in two dimensions on a fully unstructured mesh. Our results compare favorably with a standard numerical ocean model, showing better resolved turbulent flow features and reduced artificial diffusion.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks with good lattice points set for solve low regularity PDEs and high dimensional PDE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When dealing with a large number of points was required, the traditional uniform sampling approach for approximating integrals using the Monte Carlo method becomes inefficient. In this work, we leverage the good lattice point sets from number-theoretic methods for sampling purposes and develop a deep learning framework that integrates the good lattice point sets with Physics-Informed Neural Networks. This framework is designed to address low-regularity and high-dimensional problems. Furthermore, rigorous mathematical proofs are provided for our algorithm, demonstrating its validity. Lastly, in the experimental section, we employ numerical experiments involving the Poisson equation with low regularity, the two-dimensional inverse Helmholtz equation, and high-dimensional linear and nonlinear problems to illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm from a numerical perspective.</description>

      <title>Approximations of the Green's Function in Multiple Scattering Theory for Crystalline Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multiple scattering theory (MST) is a Green's function method that has been widely used in electronic structure calculations for crystalline disordered systems. The key property of the MST method is the scattering path matrix (SPM) that characterizes the Green's function within a local solution representation. This paper studies various approximations of the SPM, under the condition that an appropriate reference is used for perturbation. In particular, we justify the convergence of the SPM approximations with respect to the size of scattering region and the length of scattering path, which are the central numerical parameters to achieve a linear-scaling MST method. We present numerical experiments on several typical systems to support the theory.</description>
