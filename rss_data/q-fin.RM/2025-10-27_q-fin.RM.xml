      <title>Robust Yield Curve Estimation for Mortgage Bonds Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies. Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues, especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.</description>

      <title>Index insurance under demand and solvency constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Index insurance is often proposed to reduce protection gaps, especially for emerging risks. Unlike traditional insurance, it bases compensation on a measurable index, enabling faster payouts and lower claim management costs. This approach benefits both policyholders, through quick payments, and insurers, through reduced costs and better risk control due to reliable data and robust statistical estimates. An important difference with the concept of Cat Bonds is that the feasibility of such coverage relies on the possibility of mutualization. Mutualization, in turn, is achieved only if a sufficiently high number of policyholders agree to subscribe. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a model for the demand for index insurance and to provide conditions under which the solvency of the portfolio is achieved. From these conditions, we deduce a product that combines index and traditional indemnity insurance in order to benefit from the best of both approaches. We illustrate our results with a practical example involving the design of an index insurance product in the field of cyber insurance.</description>
