      <title>Toward Sustainable Subterranean mMTC: Space-Air-Ground-Underground Networks Powered by LoRaWAN and Wireless Energy Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), which enable real-time sensing and monitoring of underground resources by underground devices (UDs), hold great promise for delivering substantial social and economic benefits across various verticals. However, due to the harsh subterranean environment, scarce network resources, and restricted communication coverage, WUSNs face significant challenges in supporting sustainable massive machine-type communications (mMTC), particularly in remote, disaster-stricken, and hard-to-reach areas. To complement this, we conceptualize in this study a novel space-air-ground-underground integrated network (SAGUIN) architecture that seamlessly incorporates satellite systems, aerial platforms, terrestrial networks, and underground communications. On this basis, we integrate LoRaWAN and wireless energy transfer (WET) technologies into SAGUIN to enable sustainable subterranean mMTC. We begin by reviewing the relevant technical background and presenting the architecture and implementation challenges of SAGUIN. Then, we employ simulations to model a remote underground pipeline monitoring scenario to evaluate the feasibility and performance of SAGUIN based on LoRaWAN and WET technologies, focusing on the effects of parameters such as underground conditions, time allocation, LoRaWAN spread factor (SF) configurations, reporting periods, and harvested energy levels. Our results evidence that the proposed SAGUIN system, when combined with the derived time allocation strategy and an appropriate SF, can effectively extend the operational lifetime of UDs, thereby facilitating sustainable subterranean mMTC. Finally, we pinpoint key challenges and future research directions for SAGUIN.</description>

      <title>From 5G RAN Queue Dynamics to Playback: A Performance Analysis for QUIC Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of QUIC as a transport protocol has transformed content delivery by reducing latency, enhancing congestion control (CC), and enabling more efficient multiplexing. With the advent of 5G networks, which support ultra-low latency and high bandwidth, streaming high-resolution video at 4K and beyond has become increasingly viable. However, optimizing Quality of Experience (QoE) in mobile networks remains challenging due to the complex interactions among Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR) schemes at the application layer, CC algorithms at the transport layer, and Radio Link Control (RLC) queuing at the link layer in the 5G network. While prior studies have largely examined these components in isolation, this work presents a comprehensive analysis of the impact of modern active queue management (AQM) strategies, such as RED and L4S, on video streaming over diverse QUIC implementations--focusing particularly on their interaction with the RLC buffer in 5G environments and the interplay between CC algorithms and ABR schemes. Our findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of AQM strategies in improving video streaming QoE is intrinsically linked to their dynamic interaction with QUIC implementations, CC algorithms and ABR schemes-highlighting that isolated optimizations are insufficient. This intricate interdependence necessitates holistic, cross-layer adaptive mechanisms capable of real-time coordination between network, transport and application layers, which are crucial for fully leveraging the capabilities of 5G networks to deliver robust, adaptive, and high-quality video streaming.</description>

      <title>Toward Autonomous Digital Populations for Communication-Sensing-Computation Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future communication networks are expected to achieve deep integration of communication, sensing, and computation, forming a tightly coupled and autonomously operating infrastructure system. However, current reliance on centralized control, static design, and human intervention continues to constrain the multidimensional evolution of network functions and applications, limiting adaptability and resilience in large-scale, layered, and complex environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a nature-inspired architectural framework that leverages digital twin technology to organize connected devices at the edge into functional digital populations, while enabling the emergence of an evolvable digital ecosystem through multi-population integration at the cloud. We believe that this framework, which combines engineering methodologies with sociotechnical insights, lays the theoretical foundation for building next-generation communication networks with dynamic coordination, distributed decision-making, continuous adaptation, and evolutionary capabilities.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Performance Potential of Mega-Constellation Networks: An Exploration of Structure-Building Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The network structure design plays a vital role in the mega-constellation network (MSN) to coordinate massive network nodes to ensure the effectiveness and reliability of operations and services for future space wireless communications networks.
  One of the critical issues in MCN is how to design an optimal network control structure by configuring the most stable inter-satellite link (ISL) to achieve high available MCN within a limited average transmission delays.
  To address this problem, this paper introduces a novel MCN structure design paradigm: Structure = Motif + Lattice (SML), which decouples MCN design into local motifs design and global lattices design. Specifically, we formulate the High-Availability and Low-Latency Mega-Constellation Design (HALLMD) problem, aimed at maximizing ISL availability while minimizing the transmission latency. To solve HALLMD, we propose SMLOP, a heuristic algorithm that efficiently finds optimal network structures in polynomial time. Experimental validation on four public state-of-the-art constellations demonstrates significant improvements, including enhanced capacity by $5\sim 18\%$, increased throughput by $1\sim 12\%$, reduced path stretch by $12\sim 23\%$, and Round-Trip Time (RTT) by $8\sim 77\%$.</description>

      <title>Interface on demand: Towards AI native Control interfaces for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional standardized network interfaces face significant limitations, including vendor-specific incompatibilities, rigid design assumptions, and lack of adaptability for new functionalities. We propose a multi-agent framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate control interfaces on demand between network functions (NFs). This includes a matching agent, which aligns required control functionalities with NF capabilities, and a code-generation agent, which generates the necessary API server for interface realization. We validate our approach using simulated multi-vendor gNB and WLAN AP environments. The performance evaluations highlight the trade-offs between cost and latency across LLMs for interface generation tasks. Our work sets the foundation for AI-native dynamic control interface generation, paving the way for enhanced interoperability and adaptability in future mobile networks.</description>

      <title>Holo-Artisan: A Personalized Multi-User Holographic Experience for Virtual Museums on the Edge Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Holo-Artisan, a novel system architecture enabling immersive multi-user experiences in virtual museums through true holographic displays and personalized edge intelligence. In our design, local edge computing nodes process real-time user data -- including pose, facial expression, and voice -- for multiple visitors concurrently. Generative AI models then drive digital artworks (e.g., a volumetric Mona Lisa) to respond uniquely to each viewer. For instance, the Mona Lisa can return a smile to one visitor while engaging in a spoken Q\&amp;A with another, all in real time. A cloud-assisted collaboration platform composes these interactions in a shared scene using a universal scene description, and employs ray tracing to render high-fidelity, personalized views with a direct pipeline to glasses-free holographic displays. To preserve user privacy and continuously improve personalization, we integrate federated learning (FL) -- edge devices locally fine-tune AI models and share only model updates for aggregation. This edge-centric approach minimizes latency and bandwidth usage, ensuring a synchronized shared experience with individual customization. Through Holo-Artisan, static museum exhibits are transformed into dynamic, living artworks that engage each visitor in a personal dialogue, heralding a new paradigm of cultural heritage interaction.</description>

      <title>TrimCaching: Parameter-sharing Edge Caching for AI Model Downloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation mobile networks are expected to facilitate fast AI model downloading to end users. By caching models on edge servers, mobile networks can deliver models to end users with low latency, resulting in a paradigm of edge model caching. In this paper, we develop a novel model placement framework, called parameter-sharing model caching (TrimCaching). TrimCaching exploits the key observation that a wide range of AI models, such as convolutional neural networks or large language models, can share a significant proportion of parameter blocks containing reusable knowledge, thereby improving storage efficiency. To this end, we formulate a parameter-sharing model placement problem to maximize the cache hit ratio in multi-edge wireless networks by balancing the fundamental tradeoff between storage efficiency and service latency. We show that the formulated problem is a submodular maximization problem with submodular constraints, for which no polynomial-time approximation algorithm exists. To tackle this challenge, we study an important special case, where a small fixed number of parameter blocks are shared across models, which often holds in practice. In such a case, a polynomial-time algorithm with a $\left(1-\epsilon\right)/2$-approximation guarantee is developed. Subsequently, we address the original problem for the general case by developing a greedy algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TrimCaching framework significantly improves the cache hit ratio compared with state-of-the-art content caching without exploiting shared parameters in AI models.</description>

      <title>Agoran: An Agentic Open Marketplace for 6G RAN Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation mobile networks must reconcile the often-conflicting goals of multiple service owners. However, today's network slice controllers remain rigid, policy-bound, and unaware of the business context. We introduce Agoran Service and Resource Broker (SRB), an agentic marketplace that brings stakeholders directly into the operational loop. Inspired by the ancient Greek agora, Agoran distributes authority across three autonomous AI branches: a Legislative branch that answers compliance queries using retrieval-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs); an Executive branch that maintains real-time situational awareness through a watcher-updated vector database; and a Judicial branch that evaluates each agent message with a rule-based Trust Score, while arbitrating LLMs detect malicious behavior and apply real-time incentives to restore trust. Stakeholder-side Negotiation Agents and the SRB-side Mediator Agent negotiate feasible, Pareto-optimal offers produced by a multi-objective optimizer, reaching a consensus intent in a single round, which is then deployed to Open and AI RAN controllers. Deployed on a private 5G testbed and evaluated with realistic traces of vehicle mobility, Agoran achieved significant gains: (i) a 37% increase in throughput of eMBB slices, (ii) a 73% reduction in latency of URLLC slices, and concurrently (iii) an end-to-end 8.3% saving in PRB usage compared to a static baseline. An 1B-parameter Llama model, fine-tuned for five minutes on 100 GPT-4 dialogues, recovers approximately 80% of GPT-4.1's decision quality, while operating within 6 GiB of memory and converging in only 1.3 seconds. These results establish Agoran as a concrete, standards-aligned path toward ultra-flexible, stakeholder-centric 6G networks.

      <title>Routing in Quantum Networks with End-to-End Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the diverse array of physical systems available for quantum computing and the absence of a well-defined quantum internet protocol stack, the design and optimisation of quantum networking protocols remain largely unexplored. To address this, we introduce an approach that facilitates the establishment of paths capable of delivering end-to-end fidelity above a specified threshold, without requiring detailed knowledge of the quantum network properties. In this study, we define algorithms that are specific instances of this approach and evaluate them in comparison to Dijkstra shortest path algorithm and a fully knowledge-aware algorithm through simulations. Our results demonstrate that one of the proposed algorithms consistently outperforms the other methods in delivering paths above the fidelity threshold, across various network topologies and the number of source-destination pairs involved, while maintaining significant levels of fairness among the users and being robust to inaccurate estimations of the expected end-to-end fidelity.</description>
