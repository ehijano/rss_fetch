      <title>Weak-form modified sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying nonlinear dynamics and characterizing noise from data is critical across science and engineering for understanding and modeling the behavior of the systems accurately. The modified sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (mSINDy) has emerged as an effective framework for identifying systems embedded in heavy noise; however, further improvements can expand its capabilities and robustness. By integrating the weak SINDy (WSINDy) into mSINDy, we introduce the weak mSINDy (WmSINDy) to improve the system identification and noise modeling by harnessing the strengths of both approaches. The proposed algorithm simultaneously identifies parsimonious nonlinear dynamics and extracts noise probability distributions using automatic differentiation. We evaluate WmSINDy using several nonlinear systems and it demonstrates improved accuracy and noise characterization over baselines for systems embedded in relatively strong noise.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven, Energy-based Approach for Identifying Equations of Motion in Vibrating Structures Directly from Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the underlying equations of motion and parameter values for vibrating structures is of great concern in science and engineering. This work introduces a new data-driven approach called the energy-based dual-phase dynamics identification (EDDI) method for identifying the nonlinear dynamics of single-degree-of-freedom oscillators. The EDDI method leverages the energies of the system to identify the governing dynamics through the forces acting on the oscillator. The approach consists of two phases: a model-dissipative and model-stiffness identification. In the first phase, the fact that kinetic and mechanical energies are equivalent when the displacement is zero is leveraged to compute the energy dissipated and a corresponding model for the nonlinear damping of the system. In the second phase, the energy dissipated is used to compute the mechanical energy (ME), which is then used to obtain a reformulated Lagrangian. The conservative forces acting on the oscillator are then computed by taking the derivative the Lagrangian, then a model for the nonlinear stiffness is identified by solving a system of linear equations. The resulting governing equations are identified by including both the nonlinear damping and stiffness terms. A key novelty of the EDDI method is that the only thing required to perform the identification is free-response measurements and the mass of the oscillator. No prior understanding of the dynamics of the system is necessary to identify the underlying dynamics, such that the EDDI method is a truly data-driven method. The method is demonstrated using simulated and measured responses of nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom systems with a variety of nonlinear mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Frozen planet orbits for the $n$-electron atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We seek periodic trajectories of a system of multiple mutually repelling electrons on a half-line, with an attractive nucleus sitting at the origin. We adopt a variational viewpoint and study critical points of the associated Lagrange-action functional, by means of a modified Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory for manifolds with boundary. Additionally, when the charges of the electrons tend to zero, we show that frozen planet orbits converge to segments of a brake orbit for a Kepler-type problem, establishing a strong analogy with the Schubart orbits of the gravitational $n$-body problem.</description>

      <title>Equivariant optimisation for the gravitational $n$-body problem: a computational factory of symmetric orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present \emph{SymOrb.jl}, a software which combines group representation theory and variational methods to provide numerical solutions of singular dynamical systems of paramount relevance in Celestial Mechanics and other interacting particles models. Among all, it prepares for large-scale search of symmetric periodic orbits for the classical $n$-body problem and their classification, paving the way towards a computational validation of Poincar\'e conjecture about the density of periodic orbits. Through the accessible language of Julia, Symorb.jl offers a unified implementation of an earlier version. This paper provides theoretical and practical guidelines for the specific approach we adopt, complemented with examples.</description>

      <title>Key subgroups in the Polish group of all automorphisms of the rational circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending some results of a joint work with E. Glasner (2021) we continue to study the Polish group $G:=\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{Q}_0)$ of all circular order preserving permutations of $\mathbb{Q}_0$ with the pointwise topology, where $\mathbb{Q}_0$ is the rational discrete circle. We show, among others, that certain extremely amenable subgroups $H$ of $G:=\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{Q}_0)$ are inj-key but not co-minimal in $G$. This counterexample answers a question from a joint work with M. Shlossberg (2024) and inspired by a question proposed by V. Pestov about Polish groups $G$ with metrizable universal minimal $G$-flow $M(G)$. It is an open problem to study Pestov's question in its full generality.</description>

      <title>Regularity of non-autonomous self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-autonomous self-similar sets are a family of compact sets which are, in some sense, highly homogeneous in space but highly inhomogeneous in scale. The main purpose of this note is to clarify various regularity properties and separation conditions relevant for the fine local scaling properties of these sets. A simple application of our results is a precise formula for the Assouad dimension of non-autonomous self-similar sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfying a certain ``bounded neighbourhood'' condition, which generalizes earlier work of Li--Li--Miao--Xi and Olsen--Robinson--Sharples. We also see that the bounded neighbourhood assumption is, in few different senses, as general as possible.</description>

      <title>A concept of antifragility for dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper defines antifragility for dynamical systems as convexity of a newly introduced "logarithmic rate" of dynamical systems. It shows how to compute this rate for positive linear systems, and it interprets antifragility in terms of pulsed alternations of extreme strategies in comparison to average uniform strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of billiard-like system, ``bouncing outer billiards" which are 3-dimensional cousins of outer billiards of Neumann and Moser. We prove that bouncing outer billiard on a smooth convex body has at least four 1-parameter families of fixed points. We also fully describe dynamics of bouncing outer billiard on a line segment. Finally we carry out numerical experiments suggesting very complicated (non-ergodic) behavior for several shapes including the square and an ellipse.</description>

      <title>Measure and dimension theory of permeable sets and its applications to fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study {\it permeable} sets. These are sets \(\Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) which have the property that each two points \(x,y\in \mathbb{R}^d\) can be connected by a short path \(\gamma\) which has small (or even empty, apart from the end points of \(\gamma\)) intersection with \(\Theta\). We investigate relations between permeability and Lebesgue measure and establish theorems on the relation of permeability with several notions of dimension. It turns out that for most notions of dimension each subset of \(\mathbb{R}^d\) of dimension less than \(d-1\) is permeable. We use our permeability result on the Nagata dimension to characterize permeability properties of self-similar sets with certain finiteness properties.</description>

      <title>A kinetic derivation of spatial distributed models for tumor-immune system interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mathematical kinetic framework to investigate interactions between tumor cells and the immune system, focusing on the spatial dynamics of tumor progression and immune responses. We develop two kinetic models: one describes a conservative scenario where immune cells switch between active and passive states without proliferation, while the other incorporates immune cell proliferation and apoptosis. By considering specific assumptions about the microscopic processes, we derive macroscopic systems featuring linear diffusion, nonlinear cross-diffusion, and nonlinear self-diffusion. Our analysis provides insights into equilibrium configurations and stability, revealing clear correspondences among the macroscopic models derived from the same kinetic framework. Using dynamical systems theory, we examine the stability of equilibrium states and conduct numerical simulations to validate our findings. These results highlight the significance of spatial interactions in tumor-immune dynamics, paving the way for a structured exploration of therapeutic strategies and further investigations into immune responses in various pathological contexts.</description>

      <title>Strongly sofic monoids, sofic topological entropy, and surjunctivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the class of strongly sofic monoids. This class of monoids strictly contains the class of sofic groups and is a proper subclass of the class of sofic monoids. We define and investigate sofic topological entropy for actions of strongly sofic monoids on compact spaces. We show that sofic topological entropy is a topological conjugacy invariant for such actions and use this fact to prove that every strongly sofic monoid is surjunctive. This means that if $M$ is a strongly sofic monoid and $A$ is a finite alphabet set, then every injective cellular automaton $\tau \colon A^M \to A^M$ is surjective. As an application, we prove that the monoid algebra of a strongly sofic monoid with coefficients in an arbitrary field is always stably finite. Our results are extensions to strongly sofic monoids of two previously known properties of sofic groups. The first one is the celebrated Gromov-Weiss theorem asserting that every sofic group is surjunctive. The second is the Elek-Szab\'o theorem which says that group algebras of sofic groups satisfy Kaplansky's stable finiteness conjecture.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for model correction of dynamical systems with data scarcity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a deep learning framework for correcting existing dynamical system models utilizing only a scarce high-fidelity data set. In many practical situations, one has a low-fidelity model that can capture the dynamics reasonably well but lacks high resolution, due to the inherent limitation of the model and the complexity of the underlying physics. When high resolution data become available, it is natural to seek model correction to improve the resolution of the model predictions. We focus on the case when the amount of high-fidelity data is so small that most of the existing data driven modeling methods cannot be applied. In this paper, we address these challenges with a model-correction method which only requires a scarce high-fidelity data set. Our method first seeks a deep neural network (DNN) model to approximate the existing low-fidelity model. By using the scarce high-fidelity data, the method then corrects the DNN model via transfer learning (TL). After TL, an improved DNN model with high prediction accuracy to the underlying dynamics is obtained. One distinct feature of the propose method is that it does not assume a specific form of the model correction terms. Instead, it offers an inherent correction to the low-fidelity model via TL. A set of numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: In this work we introduce and explore a rescaled-theory of local stable and unstable sets for rescaled-expansive flows and its applications to topological entropy. We introduce a rescaled version of the local unstable sets and the unstable points. We find conditions for points of the phase space to exhibit non-trivial connected pieces of such unstable sets. We apply these results to the problem of proving positive topological entropy for rescaled-expansive flows with non-singular Lyapunov stable sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.12478v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Poincar\'{e}-Bendixson theorem is one of the most fundamental tools to capture the limit behaviors of orbits of flows. It was generalized and applied to various phenomena in dynamical systems, differential equations, foliations, group actions, translation lines, and semi-dynamical systems. On the other hand, though the no-slip boundary condition is a fundamental condition in differential equations and appears in various fluid phenomena, and Lakes of Wada attractors naturally occur in discrete and continuous real dynamical systems and complex dynamics, no generalizations of the Poincar\'{e}-Bendixson theorem can be applied to any differential equations with no-slip boundary condition on surfaces with boundary and flows with Lakes of Wada attractors. To analyze them, we generalize the Poincar\'{e}-Bendixson theorem into one for flows with arbitrarily many singular points on possibly non-compact surfaces by introducing some concepts to describe limit behaviors and using methods of foliation theory and general topology.</description>

Abstract: We study the fine scaling properties of sets satisfying various weak forms of invariance. For general attractors of possibly overlapping bi-Lipschitz iterated function systems, we establish that the Assouad dimension is given by the Hausdorff dimension of a tangent at some point in the attractor. Under the additional assumption of self-conformality, we moreover prove that this property holds for a subset of full Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>Efficient pseudometrics for data-driven comparisons of nonlinear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computationally efficient solutions for pseudometrics quantifying deviation from topological conjugacy between dynamical systems are presented. Deviation from conjugacy is quantified in a Pareto optimal sense that accounts for spectral properties of Koopman operators as well as trajectory geometry. Theoretical justification is provided for computing such pseudometrics in Koopman eigenfunction space rather than observable space. Furthermore, it is shown that theoretical consistency with topological conjugacy can be maintained when restricting the search for optimal transformations between systems to the unitary group. Therefore the pseudometrics are based on analytical solutions for unitary transformations in Koopman eigenfunction space. Geometric considerations for the deviation from conjugacy Pareto optimality problem are used to develop scalar pseudometrics that account for all possible optimal solutions given just two Pareto points. The approach is demonstrated on two example problems; the first being a simple benchmarking problem and the second an engineering example comparing the dynamics of morphological computation of biological nonlinear muscle actuators to simplified mad-made (including bioinspired) approaches. The benefits of considering operator and trajectory geometry based dissimilarity measures in a unified and consistent formalism is demonstrated. Overall, the deviation from conjugacy pseudometrics provide practical advantages in terms of efficiency and scalability, while maintaining theoretical consistency.</description>

      <title>Stable functions and F{\o}lner's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if $G$ is an amenable group and $A\subseteq G$ has positive upper Banach density, then there is an identity neighborhood $B$ in the Bohr topology on $G$ that is almost contained in $AA^{-1}$ in the sense that $B\backslash AA^{-1}$ has upper Banach density $0$. This generalizes the abelian case (due to F{\o}lner) and the countable case (due to Beiglb\"{o}ck, Bergelson, and Fish). The proof is indirectly based on local stable group theory in continuous logic. The main ingredients are Grothendieck's double-limit characterization of relatively weakly compact sets in spaces of continuous functions, along with results of Ellis and Nerurkar on the topological dynamics of weakly almost periodic flows.</description>

      <title>Factor maps for automorphism groups via Cayley diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.14604v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We leverage a correspondence between group actions and edge-labelled graphs in two ways. First, we give a unified presentation of several folklore results connecting weak containment, local-global convergence, and continuous model theory. Second, we investigate the difference between $\operatorname{Aut}(\operatorname{Cay}(\Gamma))$-fiid combinatorics and $\Gamma$-fiid combinatorics for various marked groups $\Gamma$. It's straightforward to see that these differences vanish when $\operatorname{Cay}(\Gamma)$ admits an $\operatorname{Aut}(\operatorname{Cay}(\Gamma))$-fiid Cayley diagram. We extend this to show that the approximate combinatorics are the same when $\operatorname{Cay}(\Gamma)$ admits an approximate fiid Cayley diagram, and we give several examples and nonexamples of groups whose Cayley graphs admit (approximate) fiid Cayley diagrams.
  In particular, we show that trees admit approximate Cayley diagrams for any group whose Cayley graph is a tree; Cayley graphs of torsion free nilpotent groups do not admit fiid Cayley diagrams; and there are groups with isomorphic Cayley graphs so that only one them admits even an approximate Cayley diagram (in fact our construction answers a question of Weilacher).</description>

      <title>Data assimilation for networks of coupled oscillators: Inferring unknown model parameters from partial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring the state and unknown parameters of a network of coupled oscillators, such as neurons in the brain, is of utmost importance. This task is made harder when only partial and noisy observations are available, which is a typical scenario in realistic high-dimensional systems. The general task of inference falls under data assimilation, and a commonly used assimilation method is the Ensemble Kalman Filter. Employing network-specific localization of the forecast covariance, an Ensemble Kalman Filter with state space augmentation is shown to yield highly accurate estimates of both the oscillator phases and unknown model parameters in the case where only a subset of oscillator phases are observed. In contrast, standard data assimilation methods yield poor results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for Kuramoto oscillators and for networks of theta neurons, using a variety of network topologies.</description>

      <title>Latent symmetry of graphs and stretch factors in Out(Fr)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every irreducible outer automorphism of the free group of rank r is topologically represented by an irreducible train track map $f$ on some graph $\Gamma$ of rank r. Moreover, $f$ can always be written as a composition of folds and a graph isomorphism. We give a lower bound on the stretch factor of an irreducible outer automorphism in terms of the number of folds of $f$ and the number of edges in $\Gamma$. In the case that $f$ is periodic on the vertex set of $\Gamma$, we show a precise notion of the latent symmetry of $\Gamma$ gives a lower bound on the number of folds required. We use this notion of latent symmetry to classify all possible irreducible single fold train track maps.</description>
