      <title>Quantum vertex algebra associated to quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we associate the quantum toroidal algebra $\mathcal{E}_N$ of type $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ with quantum vertex algebra through equivariant $\phi$-coordinated quasi modules. More precisely, for every $\ell\in \mathbb{C}$, by deforming the universal affine vertex algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}_\infty$, we construct an $\hbar$-adic quantum $\Z$-vertex algebra $V_{\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_{\infty},\hbar}(\ell,0)$. Then we prove that the category of restricted $\mathcal{E}_N$-modules of level $\ell$ is canonically isomorphic to that of equivariant $\phi$-coordinated quasi $V_{\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_{\infty},\hbar}(\ell,0)$-modules.</description>

      <title>Feature Importance and Explainability in Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many Machine Learning (ML) models are referred to as black box models, providing no real insights into why a prediction is made. Feature importance and explainability are important for increasing transparency and trust in ML models, particularly in settings such as healthcare and finance. With quantum computing's unique capabilities, such as leveraging quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition, which can be combined with ML techniques to create the field of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), and such techniques may be applied to QML models. This article explores feature importance and explainability insights in QML compared to Classical ML models. Utilizing the widely recognized Iris dataset, classical ML algorithms such as SVM and Random Forests, are compared against hybrid quantum counterparts, implemented via IBM's Qiskit platform: the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) and Quantum Support Vector Classifier (QSVC). This article aims to provide a comparison of the insights generated in ML by employing permutation and leave one out feature importance methods, alongside ALE (Accumulated Local Effects) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) explainers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Education for Computer Science Students: Bridging the Gap with Layered Learning and Intuitive Analogies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing presents a transformative potential for the world of computing. However, integrating this technology into the curriculum for computer science students who lack prior exposure to quantum mechanics and advanced mathematics remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a scaffolded learning approach aimed at equipping computer science students with essential quantum principles. By introducing foundational quantum concepts through relatable analogies and a layered learning approach based on classical computation, this approach seeks to bridge the gap between classical and quantum computing. This differs from previous approaches which build quantum computing fundamentals from the prerequisite of linear algebra and mathematics. The paper offers a considered set of intuitive analogies for foundation quantum concepts including entanglement, superposition, quantum data structures and quantum algorithms. These analogies coupled with a computing-based layered learning approach, lay the groundwork for a comprehensive teaching methodology tailored for undergraduate third level computer science students.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and delve into a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We also show that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model. We also introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra.</description>
