      <title>Leading-Order QCD Equation of State in Strong Magnetic Fields at Nonzero Baryon Chemical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present continuum-estimated $(2+1)$-flavor lattice QCD results for the leading-order Taylor expansion coefficients of the equation of state in strong magnetic fields and at nonzero baryon chemical potential. Simulations employ the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action with physical pion masses on lattices of temporal extent $N_\tau = 8,\,12$, covering $145 \lesssim T \lesssim 165~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $eB \lesssim 0.8~\mathrm{GeV}^2$, imposing strangeness neutrality with baseline results at electric charge to baryon number ratio $r = 0.4$. We determine the $T$--$eB$ dependence of $q_1$ and $s_1$ (electric charge and strangeness chemical potential ratios), pressure coefficient $P_2$, baryon number density coefficient $N_1^{\rm B}$, and energy-like coefficients $\Theta_2$ (trace anomaly), $\epsilon_2$ (energy density), and $\sigma_2$ (entropy density). Magnetic fields induce temperature-band crossings for $q_1$ and $P_2$ and non-monotonic structures in the energy-like coefficients, with $\Theta_2$ at strong fields possibly vanishing or turning negative at higher $T$, indicating dominance of the pressure term over the energy contribution. We also examine the $r$-dependence, finding that $r=0$ (charge-neutral matter) shows the most muted magnetic-field enhancement of $P_2$ despite larger $|q_1|$, providing a useful reference for neutron-star-like conditions. Comparisons with the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model show qualitative agreement at low $T$ and weak $eB$, with clear deviations near the crossover and at strong fields. These results provide useful input for constraining models and effective theories of QCD matter in strong magnetic fields at finite baryon density.</description>

      <title>Topological Strings in SU(3) Gauge Theory at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate string configurations in the deconfined phase of SU(3) gauge theory, which arise from the spontaneous breaking of the $Z_3$ center symmetry. These configurations form at the junctions of domain walls of the theory. The complex phase of the Polyakov loop changes by multiples of $2\pi$ on large spatial loops around the string, rendering them topologically stable. Using the Monte Carlo simulations of the partition function, we compute the free energy associated with these configurations. The simulations are performed on lattices with spatial dimensions $N_{x,y}=60, N_z=4$, and temporal extent $N_\tau=2$. Our results show that the free energy of the $Z_3-$strings is dominated by the domain walls. Further near the transition point, thermal fluctuations cause the decay of domain walls as well as the $Z_3$ strings into confined-deconfined interfaces.</description>

      <title>Real-time scattering and freeze-out dynamics in Rydberg-atom lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of gauge theories remains a fundamental challenge in high-energy physics. Indeed, most large scale experiments on gauge theories intrinsically rely on very far-from equilibrium dynamics, from heavy-ion to lepton and hadron collisions, which is in general extremely challenging to treat ab initio. Quantum simulation holds intriguing potential in tackling this problem and pioneering experiments have observed different characteristic features of gauge theories, such as string breaking and false vacuum decay. Here, using a programmable Rydberg atom array, we observe real-time scattering and freeze-out dynamics in a (1+1)-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory. Through spatiotemporal Hamiltonian engineering, we demonstrate dynamical confinement-deconfinement transitions, revealing string fragmentation and symmetry restoration during quenches. We track scattering processes with single-site resolution across a range of parameter regimes. Utilizing a double quench protocol, we observe dynamical freeze-out: upon quenching the Hamiltonian after scattering, despite the injection of an extensive energy, the system evolution -- in terms of both low-order correlations and entanglement -- freezes, effectively stabilizing a highly correlated equilibrium state -- a situation that reminisces that of collisions between heavy ions. Our work establishes a high-resolution approach for probing non-perturbative gauge dynamics, opening alternative pathways toward studying far-from-equilibrium phenomena in high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Impact of Primordial Magnetic Fields on the First-Order Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study how the primordial magnetic field affects the first-order electroweak phase transition in the early Universe. We observe that: 1) the phase transition process would be slowed down by the magnetic field; 2) the phenomenon of vortex structure of the Higgs condensation appears when the homogenesis hypermagentic field $g'B_Y^{ex}/m_W^2\gtrsim3.63$; and, 3) the helical hypermagnetic field can dramatically enhance the sphaleron rate and validate the generation of the baryon asymmetry through the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>Partial pressure and susceptibilities of charmed sector in the van der Waals hadron resonance gas model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the general susceptibilities in the charm sector by using the van der Waals hadron resonance gas model (VDWHRG). We argue that the ideal hadron resonance gas (HRG), which assumes no interactions between hadrons, and the excluded volume hadron resonance gas (EVHRG), which includes only repulsive interactions, fail to explain the lQCD data at very high temperatures. In contrast, the VDWHRG model, incorporating both attractive and repulsive interactions, extends the degree of agreement with lQCD up to nearly 180 MeV. We estimate the partial pressure in the charm sector and study charm susceptibility ratios in a baryon-rich environment, which is tricky for lattice quantum chromodynamics (lQCD) due to the fermion sign problem. Our study further solidifies the notion that the hadrons shouldn't be treated as non-interacting particles, especially when studying higher order fluctuations, but rather one should consider both attractive and repulsive interactions between the hadrons.</description>

      <title>Spin-taste representation of minimally doubled fermions from first principles: Karsten-Wilczek fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimally doubled fermions realize one pair of Dirac fermions on the lattice. Similarities to Kogut-Susskind fermions exist, namely, spin and taste degrees of freedom become intertwined, and a peculiar non-singlet chiral symmetry and ultralocality are maintained. However, charge conjugation, some space-time reflection symmetries and isotropy are broken by the cutoff. We address the most simple variant, Karsten-Wilczek fermions, in its parallel and in its perpendicular version. We derive the correct spin-taste representation from first principles. The spin-taste representation on the quark level permits construction of local or extended hadron interpolating operators for any spin-taste combination, albeit with contamination by parity partners and taste-symmetry breaking. We classify all interpolating operator for mesons and diquarks, and give examples for baryons. We also discuss the appropriate discretizations for taste-singlet or taste-isovector mass or chemical potential terms. We explain the counterterms in the spin-taste framework, and derive generic constraints on the parametric form and cutoff effects from the KW determinant and hadronic correlation functions. We derive how and why non-perturbative tuning schemes for the counterterms work, and obtain analytic, assumption-free, non-perturbative predictions for taste-symmetry breaking and other hadronic properties from first principles. In particular, we identify the origin and nature of two different types of taste-symmetry breaking cutoff effects. The few available numerical results for KW fermions validate these predictions.</description>

      <title>The Mass of the Baryon Junction: a lattice computation in 2 +1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of baryonic flux tubes in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory in (2 + 1) dimensions. A recent next-to-leading-order derivation within the Effective String theory framework has, for the first time, made explicit the correction proportional to the baryon-junction mass $M$, up to order $1/R^2$ (where $R$ id the length of thr confining string), opening the possibility of its non-perturbative determination. One of the main goals of this paper is, through high-precision simulations of the three-point Polyakov loop correlator, to measure for the first time the baryon-junction mass. By isolating the predicted $1/R^2$ term in the open strin channel, we obtain the value $M/\sqrt{\sigma}=0.1355(36)$, similar to the phenomenological value which is used to describe a hadron. In addition, studying th high temperature behaviourof the baryon, we present a new test of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for the SU(3) theory in three dimensions. Focussing on the high temperature regime just below the deconfinement transition, we compare our lattice results for Polyakov loop correlators with the quantitative prediction obtained by applying conformal perturbation theory to the three states Potts model in two dimension, and find excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>The allowed baryon to baryon-meson strong transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the kinematically allowed baryon to baryon-meson strong transitions in all the light and heavy sectors. We consider only the ground state on-shell particles in the baryonic and mesonic channels. In the case of mesons, only the well-established pseudoscslar and vector nonets are involved. For the baryons, we consider the ground state spin 1/2 and 3/2 baryons. Using all the restrictions and conservation laws, a \texttt{mathematica}/ \texttt{python} code selects the allowed strong channels among many possible transitions. Using the strong coupling constants defining these transitions, we estimate the strong width and beaching fraction at each channel, that may help ongoing experimental and theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Mechanical properties of proton using flavor-decomposed gravitational form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanical properties of the proton by extracting its flavor-decomposed gravitational form factors (GFFs) using Light-Cone QCD sum rules (LCSR). These form factors encode critical information about the internal dynamics and spatial distribution of energy, momentum, and internal forces within the proton. The flavor decomposition of the quark sector indicates the role of each flavor in the proton's pressure and shear force distributions. Our results show that the up quark contributes more significantly compared to the down quark in the three conserved proton GFFs, as well as in the energy and shear force distributions. Additionally, we define the non-conserved form factor $\bar{c}^q (t)$, which takes part in the distributions of energy and pressure; the latter is essential for maintaining proton stability. Furthermore, we determine the proton's mass and mechanical radii, providing valuable insight into its internal structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Accurate Gauge-Invariant Tensor Network Simulations for Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory in (2+1)D: ground state and real-time dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel tensor network method to achieve accurate and efficient simulations of Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in (2+1)D for both ground state and real-time dynamics. The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which already simplifies existing algorithms for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining with variational Monte Carlo (VMC), enabling efficient computations for (2+1)D LGTs. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate ground state simulation of pure $Z_2$, $Z_3$ and $Z_4$ gauge theory, odd-$Z_2$ gauge theories, and $Z_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32 \times 32$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it allows for accurate simulations of real-time dynamics up to long-time, exemplified by the dynamics of elementary excitations of the deconfined $Z_2$ gauge field on a $10\times10$ lattice. This is also the first example of using VMC to simulate the real-time dynamics of PEPS, whose impact may extend beyond gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the most recent experimental data and lattice QCD calculations of $\pi\pi$ scattering lengths, while employing dispersive representations of the amplitude based on Roy equations, we compute the subthreshold parameters of this process. We use Monte Carlo sampling to numerically model the probability distribution of the results based on all uncertainties in the inputs. We also investigate the dependence of the results on a theoretical correlation between the $\pi\pi$ scattering lengths $a^0_0$ and $a^2_0$, which was previously established in the framework of two-flavour chiral perturbation theory.</description>
