      <title>One-Spike SNN: Single-Spike Phase Coding with Base Manipulation for ANN-to-SNN Conversion Loss Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As spiking neural networks (SNNs) are event-driven, energy efficiency is higher than conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). Since SNN delivers data through discrete spikes, it is difficult to use gradient methods for training, limiting its accuracy. To keep the accuracy of SNNs similar to ANN counterparts, pre-trained ANNs are converted to SNNs (ANN-to-SNN conversion). During the conversion, encoding activations of ANNs to a set of spikes in SNNs is crucial for minimizing the conversion loss. In this work, we propose a single-spike phase coding as an encoding scheme that minimizes the number of spikes to transfer data between SNN layers. To minimize the encoding error due to single-spike approximation in phase coding, threshold shift and base manipulation are proposed. Without any additional retraining or architectural constraints on ANNs, the proposed conversion method does not lose inference accuracy (0.58% on average) verified on three convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with CIFAR and ImageNet datasets.In addition, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are converted to SNNs successfully with an average accuracy loss of 0.90%.Most importantly, the energy efficiency of our SNN improves by 4.6~17.3 X compared to the ANN baseline.</description>

      <title>Gated Chemical Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Gated Chemical Units (GCUs), a new type of gated recurrent cells which provide fresh insights into the commonly-used gated recurrent units, and bridge their gap to biologically-plausible neural models. We systematically derive GCUs from Electrical Equivalent Circuits (EECs), a widely adopted ordinary-differential-equations model in neuroscience for biological neurons with both electrical and chemical synapses. We focus on saturated EECs, as they are more stable, and chemical synapses, as they are more expressive. To define GCUs, we introduce a new kind of gate, we call a time gate (TG), in the associated difference-equations model of the EECs. The TG learns for each neuron the optimal time step to be used in a simple Euler integration scheme, and leads to a very efficient gated unit. By observing that the TG corresponds to the forget gate (FG) in traditional gated recurrent units, we provide a new formulation of these units as neural ODEs. We also show that in GCUs, the FG is in fact its liquid time constant. Finally, we demonstrate that GCUs not only explain the elusive nature of gates in traditional recurrent units, but also represent a very competitive alternative to these units.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Algorithms Simulating Molecular Evolution: A New Field Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The genetic blueprint for the essential functions of life is encoded in DNA, which is translated into proteins -- the engines driving most of our metabolic processes. Recent advancements in genome sequencing have unveiled a vast diversity of protein families, but compared to the massive search space of all possible amino acid sequences, the set of known functional families is minimal. One could say nature has a limited protein "vocabulary." The major question for computational biologists, therefore, is whether this vocabulary can be expanded to include useful proteins that went extinct long ago, or maybe never evolved in the first place. We outline a computational approach to solving this problem. By merging evolutionary algorithms, machine learning (ML), and bioinformatics, we can facilitate the development of completely novel proteins which have never existed before. We envision this work forming a new sub-field of computational evolution we dub evolutionary algorithms simulating molecular evolution (EASME).</description>

      <title>Forward Direct Feedback Alignment for Online Gradient Estimates of Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an interest in finding energy efficient alternatives to current state of the art neural network training algorithms. Spiking neural network are a promising approach, because they can be simulated energy efficiently on neuromorphic hardware platforms. However, these platforms come with limitations on the design of the training algorithm. Most importantly, backpropagation cannot be implemented on those. We propose a novel neuromorphic algorithm, the \textit{Spiking Forward Direct Feedback Alignment} (SFDFA) algorithm, an adaption of \textit{Forward Direct Feedback Alignment} to train SNNs. SFDFA estimates the weights between output and hidden neurons as feedback connections. The main contribution of this paper is to describe how exact local gradients of spikes can be computed in an online manner while taking into account the intra-neuron dependencies between post-synaptic spikes and derive a dynamical system for neuromorphic hardware compatibility. We compare the SFDFA algorithm with a number of competitor algorithms and show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher performance and convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Effective anytime algorithm for multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multiobjective optimization, the result of an optimization algorithm is a set of efficient solutions from which the decision maker selects one. It is common that not all the efficient solutions can be computed in a short time and the search algorithm has to be stopped prematurely to analyze the solutions found so far. A set of efficient solutions that are well-spread in the objective space is preferred to provide the decision maker with a great variety of solutions. However, just a few exact algorithms in the literature exist with the ability to provide such a well-spread set of solutions at any moment: we call them anytime algorithms. We propose a new exact anytime algorithm for multiobjective combinatorial optimization combining three novel ideas to enhance the anytime behavior. We compare the proposed algorithm with those in the state-of-the-art for anytime multiobjective combinatorial optimization using a set of 480 instances from different well-known benchmarks and four different performance measures: the overall non-dominated vector generation ratio, the hypervolume, the general spread and the additive epsilon indicator. A comprehensive experimental study reveals that our proposal outperforms the previous algorithms in most of the instances.</description>

      <title>Verification for Object Detection -- IBP IoU</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) approach for the formal verification of object detection models, specifically targeting the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric. The approach has been implemented in an open source code, named IBP IoU, compatible with popular abstract interpretation based verification tools. The resulting verifier is evaluated on landing approach runway detection and handwritten digit recognition case studies. Comparisons against a baseline (Vanilla IBP IoU) highlight the superior performance of IBP IoU in ensuring accuracy and stability, contributing to more secure and robust machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Realtime Facial Expression Recognition: Neuromorphic Hardware vs. Edge AI Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper focuses on real-time facial expression recognition (FER) systems as an important component in various real-world applications such as social robotics. We investigate two hardware options for the deployment of FER machine learning (ML) models at the edge: neuromorphic hardware versus edge AI accelerators. Our study includes exhaustive experiments providing comparative analyses between the Intel Loihi neuromorphic processor and four distinct edge platforms: Raspberry Pi-4, Intel Neural Compute Stick (NSC), Jetson Nano, and Coral TPU. The results obtained show that Loihi can achieve approximately two orders of magnitude reduction in power dissipation and one order of magnitude energy savings compared to Coral TPU which happens to be the least power-intensive and energy-consuming edge AI accelerator. These reductions in power and energy are achieved while the neuromorphic solution maintains a comparable level of accuracy with the edge accelerators, all within the real-time latency requirements.</description>

      <title>Analog In-Memory Computing with Uncertainty Quantification for Efficient Edge-based Medical Imaging Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the role of the emerging Analog In-memory computing (AIMC) paradigm in enabling Medical AI analysis and improving the certainty of these models at the edge. It contrasts AIMC's efficiency with traditional digital computing's limitations in power, speed, and scalability. Our comprehensive evaluation focuses on brain tumor analysis, spleen segmentation, and nuclei detection. The study highlights the superior robustness of isotropic architectures, which exhibit a minimal accuracy drop (0.04) in analog-aware training, compared to significant drops (up to 0.15) in pyramidal structures. Additionally, the paper emphasizes IMC's effective data pipelining, reducing latency and increasing throughput as well as the exploitation of inherent noise within AIMC, strategically harnessed to augment model certainty.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Data Parallelism for Efficient Parallelism of Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training large deep learning models requires parallelization techniques to scale. In existing methods such as Data Parallelism or ZeRO-DP, micro-batches of data are processed in parallel, which creates two drawbacks: the total memory required to store the model's activations peaks at the end of the forward pass, and gradients must be simultaneously averaged at the end of the backpropagation step. We propose Cyclic Data Parallelism, a novel paradigm shifting the execution of the micro-batches from simultaneous to sequential, with a uniform delay. At the cost of a slight gradient delay, the total memory taken by activations is constant, and the gradient communications are balanced during the training step. With Model Parallelism, our technique reduces the number of GPUs needed, by sharing GPUs across micro-batches. Within the ZeRO-DP framework, our technique allows communication of the model states with point-to-point operations rather than a collective broadcast operation. We illustrate the strength of our approach on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of model distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distillation is the task of replacing a complicated machine learning model with a simpler model that approximates the original [BCNM06,HVD15]. Despite many practical applications, basic questions about the extent to which models can be distilled, and the runtime and amount of data needed to distill, remain largely open.
  To study these questions, we initiate a general theory of distillation, defining PAC-distillation in an analogous way to PAC-learning [Val84]. As applications of this theory: (1) we propose new algorithms to extract the knowledge stored in the trained weights of neural networks -- we show how to efficiently distill neural networks into succinct, explicit decision tree representations when possible by using the ``linear representation hypothesis''; and (2) we prove that distillation can be much cheaper than learning from scratch, and make progress on characterizing its complexity.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Expected Hitting Time of Evolutionary Computation-based Neural Architecture Search Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary computation-based neural architecture search (ENAS) is a popular technique for automating architecture design of deep neural networks. Despite its groundbreaking applications, there is no theoretical study for ENAS. The expected hitting time (EHT) is one of the most important theoretical issues, since it implies the average computational time complexity. This paper proposes a general method by integrating theory and experiment for estimating the EHT of ENAS algorithms, which includes common configuration, search space partition, transition probability estimation, population distribution fitting, and hitting time analysis. By exploiting the proposed method, we consider the ($\lambda$+$\lambda$)-ENAS algorithms with different mutation operators and estimate the lower bounds of the EHT. Furthermore, we study the EHT on the NAS-Bench-101 problem, and the results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to establish a theoretical foundation for ENAS algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Planning a public transit network is a challenging optimization problem, but essential in order to realize the benefits of autonomous buses. We propose a novel algorithm for planning networks of routes for autonomous buses. We first train a graph neural net model as a policy for constructing route networks, and then use the policy as one of several mutation operators in a evolutionary algorithm. We evaluate this algorithm on a standard set of benchmarks for transit network design, and find that it outperforms the learned policy alone by up to 20% and a plain evolutionary algorithm approach by up to 53% on realistic benchmark instances.</description>

      <title>Smooth Tchebycheff Scalarization for Multi-Objective Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems can be found in many real-world applications, where the objectives often conflict each other and cannot be optimized by a single solution. In the past few decades, numerous methods have been proposed to find Pareto solutions that represent different optimal trade-offs among the objectives for a given problem. However, these existing methods could have high computational complexity or may not have good theoretical properties for solving a general differentiable multi-objective optimization problem. In this work, by leveraging the smooth optimization technique, we propose a novel and lightweight smooth Tchebycheff scalarization approach for gradient-based multi-objective optimization. It has good theoretical properties for finding all Pareto solutions with valid trade-off preferences, while enjoying significantly lower computational complexity compared to other methods. Experimental results on various real-world application problems fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Random Search as a Baseline for Sparse Neural Network Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse neural networks have shown similar or better generalization performance than their dense counterparts while having higher parameter efficiency. This has motivated a number of works to learn or search for high performing sparse networks. While reports of task performance or efficiency gains are impressive, standard baselines are lacking leading to poor comparability and unreliable reproducibility across methods. In this work, we propose Random Search as a baseline algorithm for finding good sparse configurations and study its performance. We apply Random Search on the node space of an overparameterized network with the goal of finding better initialized sparse sub-networks that are positioned more advantageously in the loss landscape. We record the post-training performances of the found sparse networks and at various levels of sparsity, and compare against both their fully connected parent networks and random sparse configurations at the same sparsity levels. First, we demonstrate performance at different levels of sparsity and highlight that a significant level of performance can still be preserved even when the network is highly sparse. Second, we observe that for this sparse architecture search task, initialized sparse networks found by Random Search neither perform better nor converge more efficiently than their random counterparts. Thus we conclude that Random Search may be viewed as a reasonable neutral baseline for sparsity search methods.</description>
