      <title>Harmonic Maps into Euclidean Buildings and Non-Archimedean Superrigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that harmonic maps into Euclidean buildings, which are not necessarily locally finite, have singular sets of Hausdorff codimension 2, extending the locally finite regularity result of Gromov and Schoen. As an application, we prove superrigidity for algebraic groups over fields with non-Archimedean valuation, thereby generalizing the rank 1 $p$-adic superrigidity results of Gromov and Schoen and casting the Bader-Furman generalization of Margulis' higher rank superrigidity result in a geometric setting. We also prove an existence theorem for a pluriharmonic map from a K\"ahler manifold to a Euclidean building.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive review of golden Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In differential geometry, the concept of golden structure, initially proposed by S. I. Goldberg and K. Yano in 1970, presents a compelling area with wide-ranging applications. The exploration of golden Riemannian manifolds was initiated by C. E. Hretcanu and M. Crasmareanu in 2008, following the principles of the golden structure. Subsequently, numerous researchers have contributed significant insights into golden Riemannian manifolds. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey on golden Riemannian manifold done over the past decade.</description>

      <title>On the application of Lorentz-Finsler geometry to model wave propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent increasing interest in the study of Lorentz-Finsler geometry has led to several applications to model real-world physical phenomena. Our purpose is to provide a simple, step-by-step review on how to build and implement such a geometric model to describe the propagation of a classical wave satisfying Fermat's and Huygens' principles in an anisotropic and rheonomic (time-dependent) medium. The model is based on identifying the individual wave trajectories as lightlike pregeodesics of a specific Lorentz-Finsler metric, which obey a simple ODE system and can therefore be easily computed in real time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article generalizes the results of [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 512 (2022), Article No. 126075], which presented a theory of distributions (generalized functions) with a singular curve contained in the domain of the test functions. In this present article we construct a theory of distributions in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with a ``thick submanifold'', that is, a new theory of thick distributions in $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose domain contains a submanifold on which test functions may be singular.</description>

      <title>Categorical generalization of BF theory coupled to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a thorough introduction to the tools of category theory required for formulating gauge theories based on 2-connections. We provide a detailed construction of the categorical generalization of BF theory, dubbed BFCG, also known as 2BF. Similar to BF gravity, it is known that BFCG can be deformed to give general relativity. Here, we obtain an alternative relation between BFCG and gravity, which consists of coupling general relativity and BFCG by means of the volume form constructed out of the BFCG connections. The resulting theory, closely related to unimodular gravity, is a generalization of BF sequestered gravity not only in the sense that it adds new fields but also in that it allows for new choices for the volume form that is coupled to gravity. Furthermore, we show that BF sequestered gravity in the abelian case is recovered for a specific choice of the 2-group.</description>

      <title>Near horizon limit of the Wang--Yau quasi-local mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we compute the limit of the Wang--Yau quasi-local mass on a family of surfaces approaching the apparent horizon (the near horizon limit). Such limit is first considered in [1]. Recently, Pook-Kolb, Zhao, Andersson, Krishnan, and Yau investigated the near horizon limit of the Wang--Yau quasi-local mass in binary black hole mergers in [12] and conjectured that the optimal embeddings approach the isometric embedding of the horizon into $\R^3$. Moreover, the quasi-local mass converges to the total mean curvature of the image. The vanishing of the norm of the mean curvature vector implies special properties for the Wang--Yau quasi-local energy and the optimal embedding equation. We utilize these features to prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal embedding and investigate the minimization of the Wang--Yau quasi-local energy. In particular, we prove the continuity of the quasi-local mass in the near horizon limit.</description>

Abstract: We obtain the convergence speed for Fekete points on uniformly polynomially cuspidal compact sets introduced by Pawlucki and Ple\'sniak. This is done by showing that these sets are $(\mathscr{C}^{\alpha}, \mathscr{C}^{\alpha'})$-regular in the sense of Dinh, Ma and Nguyen.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a lower bound for the delta invariant of the fundamental divisor of a quasi-smooth weighted hypersurface. As a consequence, we prove K-stability of a large class of quasi-smooth Fano hypersurfaces of index 1 and of all smooth Fano weighted hypersurfaces of index 1 and 2. The proofs are based on the Abban--Zhuang method and on the study of linear systems on flags of weighted hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>A general model for wildfire propagation with wind and slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.03364v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A geometric model for the computation of the firefront of a forest wildfire which takes into account several effects (possibly time-dependent wind, anisotropies and slope of the ground) is introduced. It relies on a general theoretical framework, which reduces the hyperbolic PDE system of any wave to an ODE in a Lorentz-Finsler framework. The wind induces a sort of double semi-elliptical fire growth, while the influence of the slope is modeled by means of a term which comes from the Matsumoto metric (i.e., the standard non-reversible Finsler metric that measures the time when going up and down a hill). These contributions make a significant difference from previous models because, now, the infinitesimal wavefronts are not restricted to be elliptical. Even though this is a technical complication, the wavefronts remain computable in real time. Some simulations of evolution are shown, paying special attention to possible crossovers of the fire.</description>

Abstract: We construct the hyper-K\"ahler moduli space of framed monopoles over $\mathbb{R}^3$ for any connected, simply connected, compact, semisimple Lie group and arbitrary mass and charge, and hence symmetry breaking. In order to do so, we define a configuration space of pairs with appropriate asymptotic conditions and perform an infinite-dimensional quotient construction. We make use of the b and scattering calculuses to study the relevant differential operators.</description>

      <title>On the structure of compact K\"{a}hler manifolds with nonnegative holomorphic sectional curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18779v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a "pseudo-effective" version of the holonomy principle for compact K\"{a}hler manifolds with nonnegative holomorphic sectional curvature. As applications, we prove that if a compact complex manifold $M$ admits a K\"{a}hler metric $\omega$ with nonnegative holomorphic sectional curvature and $(M,\omega)$ has no nonzero truly flat tangent vector at some point (which is satisfied when the holomorphic sectional curvature is quasi-positive), then $M$ must be projective and rationally connected. This answers a problem raised by Matsumura and Yang and extends Yau's conjecture. We also prove that a compact simply connected K\"{a}hler manifold with nonnegative holomorphic sectional curvature is projective and rationally connected. Additionally, we classify non-projective K\"{a}hler 3-dimensional manifolds with nonnegative holomorphic sectional curvature. Furthermore, we show that a compact K\"{a}hler manifold admits a Hermitian metric with positive real bisectional curvature is a projective and rationally connected manifold.</description>

      <title>Discrete conformal structures on surfaces with boundary (I) -- Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the discrete conformal structures on surfaces with boundary in an axiomatic approach, which ensures that the Poincar\'{e} dual of an ideally triangulated surface with boundary has a good geometric structure. Then we classify the discrete conformal structures on surfaces with boundary, which turns out to unify and generalize Guo-Luo's generalized circle packings \cite{GL2}, Guo's vertex scalings \cite{Guo} and Xu's partial discrete conformal structures \cite{Xu22} on surfaces with boundary. Motivated by \cite{BPS, Zhang-Guo-Zeng-Luo-Yau-Gu}, we further study the relationships between the discrete conformal structures on surfaces with boundary and the hyperbolic trigonometry. Unexpectedly, we find that some subclasses of the discrete conformal structures on surfaces with boundary are closely related to the twisted generalized hyperbolic triangles introduced by Roger-Yang \cite{Roger-Yang}, which does not appear in the case of closed surfaces. Finally, we study the relationships between the discrete conformal structures on surfaces with boundary and the 3-dimensional hyperbolic geometry by constructing ten types of generalized hyperbolic tetrahedra. Some new generalized hyperbolic tetrahedra recently introduced by Belletti-Yang \cite{B-Y} naturally appears in the constructions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.03534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use time-independent incomplete Hamiltonian flows to excise interesting closed subsets of positive codimension from symplectic manifolds. Examples of such subsets include what we call a "Cantor brush", a "box with a tail", and -- more generally -- epigraphs of lower semicontinuous functions. This answers a question of Alan Weinstein about excision of a ray, and it generalizes a result of Bernd Stratmann about excision of the product of a ray with a manifold.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hukuhara directional differentiability of interval-valued functions on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that generalized Hukuhara directional differentiability of an interval-valued function (IVF) defined on Riemannian manifolds is not equivalent to the directional differentiability of its center and half-width functions and hence not to its end point functions. This contrasts with S.-L. Chen's \cite{chen} assertion which says the equivalence holds in terms of endpoint functions of an IVF which is defined on a Hadamard manifold. Additionally, the paper addresses some inaccuracies made by the author which arise when assuming the convexity of a function at a single point in its domain. In light of these arguments, the paper presents some basic results that relate to both the convexity and directional differentiability of an IVF.</description>
