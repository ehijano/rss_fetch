      <title>A market resilient data-driven approach to option pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a data-driven ensemble approach for option price prediction whose derivation is based on the no-arbitrage theory of option pricing. Using the theoretical treatment, we derive a common representation space for achieving domain adaptation. The success of an implementation of this idea is shown using some real data. Then we report several experimental results for critically examining the performance of the derived pricing models.</description>

      <title>Reconciling rough volatility with jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reconcile rough volatility models and jump models using a class of reversionary Heston models with fast mean reversions and large vol-of-vols. Starting from hyper-rough Heston models with a Hurst index $H \in (-1/2,1/2)$, we derive a Markovian approximating class of one dimensional reversionary Heston-type models. Such proxies encode a trade-off between an exploding vol-of-vol and a fast mean-reversion speed controlled by a reversionary time-scale $\epsilon&gt;0$ and an unconstrained parameter $H \in \mathbb R$. Sending $\epsilon$ to 0 yields convergence of the reversionary Heston model towards different explicit asymptotic regimes based on the value of the parameter H. In particular, for $H \leq -1/2$, the reversionary Heston model converges to a class of L\'evy jump processes of Normal Inverse Gaussian type. Numerical illustrations show that the reversionary Heston model is capable of generating at-the-money skews similar to the ones generated by rough, hyper-rough and jump models.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Structure of Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14219v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new concept called uncertainty spaces which is an extended concept of probability spaces. Then, we express n-layer uncertainty which we call hierarchical uncertainty by a hierarchically constructed sequence of uncertainty spaces, called a U-sequence. We use U-sequences for providing examples that illustrate Ellsberg's paradox. We will use the category theory to get a bird's eye view of the hierarchical structure of uncertainty. We discuss maps between uncertainty spaces and maps between U-sequences, seeing that they form categories of uncertainty spaces and the category of U-sequences, respectively. We construct an endofunctor of the category of measurable spaces in order to embed a given U-sequence into it. Then, by the iterative application of the endofunctor, we construct the universal uncertainty space which may be able to serve as a basis for multi-layer uncertainty theory.</description>

      <title>Pricing Barrier Options with DeepBSDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.10966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel and direct approach to price boundary and final-value problems, corresponding to barrier options, using forward deep learning to solve forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). Barrier instruments are instruments that expire or transform into another instrument if a barrier condition is satisfied before maturity; otherwise they perform like the instrument without the barrier condition. In the PDE formulation, this corresponds to adding boundary conditions to the final value problem. The deep BSDE methods developed so far have not addressed barrier/boundary conditions directly. We extend the forward deep BSDE to the barrier condition case by adding nodes to the computational graph to explicitly monitor the barrier conditions for each realization of the dynamics as well as nodes that preserve the time, state variables, and trading strategy value at barrier breach or at maturity otherwise. Given these additional nodes in the computational graph, the forward loss function quantifies the replication of the barrier or final payoff according to a chosen risk measure such as squared sum of differences. The proposed method can handle any barrier condition in the FBSDE set-up and any Dirichlet boundary conditions in the PDE set-up, both in low and high dimensions.</description>
