      <title>Determining the observation epochs of star catalogs from ancient China using the generalized Hough transform method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ancient China recorded a wealth of astronomical observations, notably distinguished by the inclusion of empirical measurements of stellar observations. However, determining the precise observational epochs for these datasets poses a formidable challenge. This study employs the Generalized Hough Transform methodology to analyze two distinct sets of observational data originating from the Song and Yuan dynasties, allowing accurate estimation of the epochs of these stellar observations. This research introduces a novel and systematic approach, offering a scholarly perspective for the analysis of additional datasets within the domain of ancient astronomical catalogs in future investigations.</description>

      <title>Determining the observational epoch of the Shi's star catalog using the generalized Hough transform method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ancient stellar observations are a valuable cultural heritage, profoundly influencing both cultural domains and modern astronomical research. The \textit{Shi's Star Catalog}, the oldest extant star catalog in China, faces controversy regarding its observational epoch. Determining this epoch via precession assumes accurate ancient coordinates and correspondence with contemporary stars, posing significant challenges. This study introduces a novel method using the Generalized Hough Transform to ascertain the catalog's observational epoch. This approach statistically accommodates errors in ancient coordinates and discrepancies between ancient and modern stars, addressing limitations in prior methods. Our findings date the \textit{Shi's Star Catalog} to the 4th century BCE, with 2nd-century CE adjustments. In comparison, the Western tradition's oldest known catalog, the Ptolemaic Star Catalog (2nd century CE), likely derives from the Hipparchus Star Catalog (2nd century BCE). Thus, the \textit{Shi's Star Catalog} is identified as the world's oldest known star catalog. Beyond establishing its observation period, this study aims to consolidate and digitize these cultural artifacts.</description>

      <title>FluxCT V2.0: Updates to a Web Tool Identifying Contaminating Flux in Space Telescope Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FluxCT V2.0, an updated web tool for identifying contaminating flux in Kepler and TESS target pixel files. FluxCT V2.0 focuses on enhancing functionality, user experience, and data processing capabilities. We resolved existing issues to allow for an extended user base, removed known bugs, and extended the tool to any TESS pixel file, allowing the user to search any TESS point object. A batch code for TESS is now available on the companion GitHub. Additional output parameters, such as amplitude dilution and a magnitude cut, have been added to the tool, allowing users more freedom to analyze the possible effects of target sources.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Compton telescope imaging with maximum a posteriori estimation: a modified Richardson-Lucy algorithm for the Compton Spectrometer and Imager</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a modified Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm tailored for image reconstruction in MeV gamma-ray observations, focusing on its application to the upcoming Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) mission. Our method addresses key challenges in MeV gamma-ray astronomy by incorporating Bayesian priors for sparseness and smoothness while optimizing background components simultaneously. We introduce a novel sparsity term suitable for Poisson-sampled data in addition to a smoothness prior, allowing for flexible reconstruction of both point sources and extended emission. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using simulated three-month COSI observations of gamma-ray lines of $^{44}$Ti (1.157 MeV), $^{26}$Al (1.809 MeV), and positron annihilation (0.511 MeV), respectively, representing various spatial features. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over conventional RL methods, particularly in suppressing artificial structures in point source reconstructions and retaining diffuse spatial structures. This work represents an important step towards establishing a robust data analysis for studying nucleosynthesis, positron annihilation, and other high-energy phenomena in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Robust direction-dependent gain-calibration of beam-modelling errors far from the target field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many astronomical questions require deep, wide-field observations at low radio frequencies. Phased arrays like LOFAR and SKA-low are designed for this, but have inherently unstable element gains, leading to time, frequency and direction-dependent gain errors. Precise direction-dependent calibration of observations is therefore key to reaching the highest possible dynamic range. Many tools for direction-dependent calibration utilise sky and beam models to infer gains. However, these calibration tools struggle with precision calibration for relatively bright (e.g. A-team) sources far from the beam centre. Therefore, the point-spread-function of these sources can potentially obscure a faint signal of interest. We show that, and why, the assumption of a smooth gain solution per station fails for realistic radio interferometers, and how this affects gain-calibration results. Subsequently, we introduce an improvement for smooth spectral gain constraints for direction-dependent gain-calibration algorithms, in which the level of regularisation is weighted by the expected station response to the sky model. We test this method using direction-dependent calibration method DDECal and physically-motivated beam modelling errors for LOFAR-HBA stations. The new method outperforms the standard method for various calibration settings near nulls in the beam, and matches the standard inverse-variance-weighted method's performance for the remainder of the data. The proposed method is especially effective for short baselines, both in visibility and image space. Improved direction-dependent gain-calibration is critical for future high-precision SKA-low observations, where higher sensitivity, increased antenna beam complexity, and mutual coupling call for better off-axis source subtraction, which may not be achieved through improved beam models alone.</description>

      <title>Denoising medium resolution stellar spectra with U-Net convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the use of a U-Net convolutional neural network for denoising simulated medium-resolution spectroscopic observations of stars. Simulated spectra were generated under realistic observational conditions resembling the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). We found that our U-Net model effectively captured spectral features, achieving an average relative error of around $1\%$ across a broad range of stellar parameters, despite a limited training set of only $1000$ observations and a relatively short training period. Although U-Net did not reach the performance previously demonstrated by fully-connected denoising autoencoders (DAEs) consisting of dense layers and trained extensively on larger datasets, it outperformed dense networks trained under similarly constrained conditions. These results indicate that the U-Net architecture offers rapid, robust feature learning and may be particularly advantageous in scenarios involving initial denoising, subsequently refined by more accurate, but otherwise slower deep-learning models.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Synchrotron Beam Shape Characterization using Interferometric Closure Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchrotron radiation interferometry (SRI) is widely used in particle accelerators to monitor the transverse beam profile, and thus the critical beam emittance parameter. We introduce a novel technique to SRI using closure amplitudes, inspired by radio interferometry, to determine the two-dimensional profile of the synchrotron beam. Previous techniques have required multiple interferograms or accurate estimates of the non-uniform aperture illuminations. In contrast, our method using closure amplitudes avoids the need to estimate the aperture illuminations while determining the two-dimensional beam shape from a single interferogram. The invariance of closure amplitudes to even time-varying aperture illuminations makes it suitable to longer averaging intervals, with potential to reducing data rates and computational overheads. Using data from the ALBA synchrotron light source and having validated the results against existing methods, this paper represents one of the first real-world applications of interferometric closure amplitudes to directly determine the light source shape.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength observation of a candidate pulsar halo LHAASO J0621+3755 and the first X-ray detection of PSR J0622+3749</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar halos are regions around middle-aged pulsars extending out to tens of parsecs. The large extent of the halos and well-defined central cosmic-ray accelerators make this new class of Galactic sources an ideal laboratory for studying cosmic-ray transport. LHAASO J0621+3755 is a candidate pulsar halo associated with the middle-aged gamma-ray pulsar PSR J0622+3749. We observed LHAASO J0621+3755 with VERITAS and XMM-Newton in the TeV and X-ray bands, respectively. For this work, we developed a novel background estimation technique for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope observations of such extended sources. No halo emission was detected with VERITAS (0.3--10 TeV) or XMM-Newton (2--7 keV) within 1 degree and 10 arcmin around PSR J0622+3749, respectively. Combined with the LHAASO-KM2A and Fermi-LAT data, VERITAS flux upper limits establish a spectral break at ~1--10 TeV, a unique feature compared with Geminga, the most studied pulsar halo. We model the gamma-ray spectrum and LHAASO-KM2A surface brightness as inverse Compton emission and find suppressed diffusion around the pulsar, similar to Geminga. A smaller diffusion suppression zone and harder electron injection spectrum than Geminga are necessary to reproduce the spectral cutoff. A magnetic field &lt;= 1 uG is required by our XMM-Newton observation and synchrotron spectral modeling, consistent with Geminga. Our findings support slower diffusion and lower magnetic field around pulsar halos than the Galactic averages, hinting at magnetohydrodynamic turbulence around pulsars. Additionally, we report the detection of an X-ray point source spatially coincident with PSR J0622+3749, whose periodicity is consistent with the gamma-ray spin period of 333.2 ms. The soft spectrum of this source suggests a thermal origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research explores the use of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation as a reference signal for Initial Orbit Determination (IOD). By leveraging the unique properties of CMB, this study introduces a novel method for estimating spacecraft velocity and position with minimal reliance on pre-existing environmental data, offering significant advantages for space missions independent of Earth-specific conditions. Using Machine Learning (ML) regression models, this approach demonstrates the capability to determine velocity from CMB signals and subsequently determine the satellite's position. The results indicate that CMB has the potential to enhance the autonomy and flexibility of spacecraft operations.</description>

      <title>Mid-Infrared Imaging Spectroscopy of N2O Solid Simulating the haze of trans-Neptunian objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \ Nitrous oxide (N$_2$O) ice is likely to exist in trans-Neptunian objects such as Pluto and Triton, potentially formed through ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun or cosmic ray irradiation of N$_2$ and CO ices. However, the mid-infrared spectral characteristics of N$_2$O ice in higher temperature regions (90-110 K), changes in mid-infrared spectra during UV irradiation, and the chemical network of nitrogen oxide (N$_x$O$_y$) ices remain insufficiently understood. This study aims to elucidate these aspects through in-situ mid-infrared spectral measurements of cryogenic particles using two-dimensional imaging Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
  Spectroscopic imaging confirmed strong absorption at 7.75 $\mu$m (N$_2$O $\nu_1$ vibrational mode), with weaker vibrational modes observed at 8.60 $\mu$m (N$_2$O 2$\nu_2$), 7.27 $\mu$m (N$_2$O torsion), and 5.29 $\mu$m (N$_2$O $\nu_1$+$\nu_2$). Annealing experiments simulating high-temperature conditions demonstrated that all vibrational modes irreversibly intensified with increasing temperature, indicating progressive crystallization. New spectral features appeared at approximately 12 $\mu$m and 14 $\mu$m at the condensed sample.
  N$_2$O ice was exposed to ultraviolet radiation (190-340 nm) using a D$_2$ lamp for 8.5 hours to investigate spectral changes during UV irradiation. After 60-90 minutes of irradiation, all N$_2$O vibrational modes disappeared, while absorption intensities of various nitrogen oxides, including NO, NO$_2$, N$_2$O$_3$, and O$_3$ increased. Beyond 180 minutes, vibrational modes of multiple nitrogen oxide ices exhibited intensity variations across different wavelengths, corresponding to other species such as cis-(NO)$_2$, N$_2$O$_4$, and N$_2$O$_5$.</description>

      <title>Identify main-sequence binaries from the Chinese Space Station Telescope Survey with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistical properties of double main sequence (MS) binaries are very important for binary evolution and binary population synthesis. To obtain these properties, we need to identify these MS binaries. In this paper, we have developed a method to differentiate single MS stars from double MS binaries from the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) Survey with machine learning. This method is reliable and efficient to identify binaries with mass ratios between 0.20 and 0.80, which is independent of the mass ratio distribution. But the number of binaries identified with this method is not a good approximation to the number of binaries in the original sample due to the low detection efficiency of binaries with mass ratios smaller than 0.20 or larger than 0.80. Therefore, we have improved this point by using the detection efficiencies of our method and an empirical mass ratio distribution and then can infer the binary fraction in the sample. Once the CSST data are available, we can identify MS binaries with our trained multi-layer perceptron model and derive the binary fraction of the sample.</description>

      <title>Identifying misclassified meteor showers in the IAU MDC database. Reclassification Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of meteoroid streams reveals the full complexity of these structures. At present, we have no objective method of deciding whether the parameters of the observed meteoroid stream represent a further solution to an already known object or whether they relate to a new discovery. As result, the Meteor Data Center (MDC) database of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) contains duplicates and false duplicates of the meteor showers.
  It is desirable to detect questionable cases and, if possible, correct their status, thereby contributing to the improvement of the content of the IAU MDC database. The correct content of the MDC database is important in its applications, for example, in assessing the threat from meteoroids to Earth's artificial satellites.
  Two approaches were used, in the first the internal compatibility of geocentric and heliocentric parameters representing a given flux was verified. In the second, a comparison of two or more solutions of the same stream was made in as much detail as possible. Fifty-six streams were verified, for which clear suspicion of misclassification was established in our earlier work.
  For 43 streams, the misclassification was confirmed, with a proposal to change their status in the MDC to autonomous. In the remaining 13 cases, it was proposed to leave their status unchanged.
  Although we do not consider it 'definitive', our study clearly shows that repeated misclassification of new meteoroid flux solutions has occurred in the past. Correction of these cases will significantly improve the content of the MDC database. As an additional product, based on the approach proposed in this and our earlier work, relevant procedures have been proposed, which, available on the MDC database website, will make it possible to compare new meteoroid data with the contents of the database, thereby avoiding errors in their classification.</description>

This review highlights applications of stellar polarimetry for massive hot stars, particularly in the context of ultraviolet (UV) spaceborne missions. The prevalence of binarity in the massive star population and uncertainties regarding the degree of rotational criticality among hot stars raises important questions about stellar interactions, interior structure, and even the lifetimes of evolutionary phases. These uncertainties have consequences for stellar population synthesis calculations. Spectropolarimetry is a key tool for extracting information about stellar and binary geometries. We review methodologies involving electron scattering in circumstellar envelopes; gravity darkening from rapid rotation; spectral line effects including the (a) "line effect", (b) Ohman effect, and (c) Hanle effect; and the imprint of interstellar polarization on measurements. Finally, we describe the Polstar UV spectropolarimetric SMEX mission concept as one means for employing these diagnostics to clarify the state of high rotation and its impacts for massive stars.</description>

Abstract: The next-generation radio astronomy instruments are providing a massive increase in sensitivity and coverage, through increased stations in the array and frequency span. Two primary problems encountered when processing the resultant avalanche of data are the need for abundant storage and I/O. An example of this is the data deluge expected from the SKA Telescopes of more than 60PB per day, all to be stored on the buffer filesystem. Compressing the data is an obvious solution. We used MGARD, an error-controlled compressor, and applied it to simulated and real visibility data, in noise-free and noise-dominated regimes. As the data has an implicit error level in the system temperature, using an error bound in compression provides a natural metric for compression. Measuring the degradation of images reconstructed using the lossy compressed data, we explore the trade-off between these error bounds and the corresponding compression ratios, as well as the impact on science quality derived from the lossy compressed data products through a series of experiments.
  We studied the global and local impacts on the output images. We found relative error bounds of as much as $10\%$, which provide compression ratios of about 20, have a limited impact on the continuum imaging as the increased noise is less than the image RMS. For extremely sensitive observations and for very precious data, we would recommend a $0.1\%$ error bound with compression ratios of about 4. These have noise impacts two orders of magnitude less than the image RMS levels. At these levels, the limits are due to instabilities in the deconvolution methods. We compared the results to the alternative compression tool DYSCO, in both the impacts on the images and in the relative flexibility. MGARD provides better compression for similar error bounds, and has a host of potentially powerful additional features.</description>

      <title>Characterization of more than three years of in-orbit radiation damage of SiPMs on GRBAlpha and VZLUSAT-2 CubeSats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00607</link>

Abstract: Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are prone to radiation damage which causes an increase of dark count rate. This leads to an increase in low-energy threshold in a gamma-ray detector combining SiPM and a scintillator. Despite this drawback, they are becoming preferred for scintillator-based gamma-ray detectors on CubeSats due to their low operation voltage, small size, linear response to low light intensity and fast response. This increasing popularity of SiPMs among new spaceborne missions makes it important to characterize their long-term performance in the space environment. In this work, we report the change of the dark count rate and low-energy threshold of S13360-3050 PE multi-pixel photon counters (MPPCs) by Hamamatsu, using measurements acquired by the GRBAlpha and VZLUSAT-2 CubeSats at low Earth orbit (LEO) spanning over three years. Such a long measurement of the performance of MPPCs in space has not been published before. GRBAlpha is a 1U CubeSat launched on March 22, 2021, to a 550 km altitude sun-synchronous polar orbit (SSO) carrying on board a gamma-ray detector based on CsI(Tl) scintillator readout by eight MPPCs and regularly detecting gamma-ray transients such as gamma-ray bursts and solar flares in the energy range of ~30-900 keV. VZLUSAT-2 is a 3U CubeSat launched on January 13, 2022 also to a 535 km altitude SSO carrying on board, among other payloads, two gamma-ray detectors similar to the one on GRBAlpha. We have flight-proven the Hamamatsu MPPCs S13360-3050 PE and demonstrated that MPPCs, shielded by 2.5 mm of PbSb alloy, can be used in LEO environment on a scientific mission lasting beyond three years. This manifests the potential of MPPCs being employed in future satellites.</description>

      <title>Extended Linearity in the High-Order Wavefront Sensor for the Roman Coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. The Coronagraphic Instrument (CGI) on the Roman Space Telescope aims for unprecedented contrast for direct imaging of exoplanets, serving as a critical tech demo for future missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory. This requires advanced wavefront sensing and control (WFS&amp;C), including pair-wise (PW) probing for electric field estimation in the focal plane. Optimizing PW probe designs is vital to enhance performance and reduce overheads.
  Aims. We investigate different probe designs for PW probing in the context of Roman CGI. We compare classic sinc-sinc-sine probes, previously introduced single-actuator probes, and newly proposed sharp sinc probes in terms of effectiveness in focal-plane modulation, resilience to non-linearities, and overall impact on convergence and contrast.
  Methods. We conducted experiments on the THD2 testbed, configured to emulate Roman CGI with a custom Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph. We evaluated the three probe designs through WFS&amp;C experiments using PW probing for estimation and electric field conjugation for wavefront correction. Simulations and hardware tests assessed contrast convergence and the impact of non-linear terms at varying probe amplitudes. We also explored low-flux scenarios to demonstrate the use of high-amplitude probes in reducing exposure times or closing the loop on faint targets.
  Results. Single-actuator probes emerged as the most effective, with faster convergence and reduced non-linear effects at high amplitudes. Sharp sinc probes performed moderately well but were less robust than single actuators. High-amplitude single-actuator probes showed advantages in dark-hole digging under low-flux, through faster iterations without significant degradation in contrast. The THD2 testbed, operating at contrasts analogous to Roman CGI, validated our results and underscored its role as a critical platform for advancing WFS&amp;C techniques.</description>

      <title>Classifying spectra of emission-line regions with neural networks -- An application to integral field spectroscopic data of M33</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emission-line regions are key to understanding the properties of galaxies, as they trace the exchange of matter and energy between stars and the interstellar medium (ISM). In nearby galaxies, individual nebulae can be identified as HII regions, planetary nebulae (PNe), supernova remnants (SNR), and diffuse ionised gas (DIG) with criteria on single or multiple emission-line ratios. However, these methods are limited by rigid classification boundaries, the narrow scope of information they are based upon, and the inability to account for line-of-sight nebular superpositions. In this work, we use artificial neural networks to classify these regions using their optical spectra. Our training set consists of simulated spectra, obtained from photoionisation and shock models, and processed to match observations obtained with MUSE. We evaluate the performance of the network on simulated spectra for a range of signal-to-noise (S/N) levels and dust extinction, and the superposition of different nebulae along the line of sight. At infinite S/N the network achieves perfect predictive performance, while as the S/N decreases, the classification accuracy declines, reaching an average of ~80% at S/N(H$\alpha$)=20. We apply our model to real spectra from MUSE observations of the galaxy M33, where it provides a robust classification of individual spaxels, even at low S/N, identifying HII regions and PNe and distinguishing them from SNRs and diffuse ionized gas, while identifying overlapping nebulae. We then compare the network's classification with traditional diagnostics and find satisfactory agreement. Using activation maximisation maps, we find that at high S/N the model mainly relies on weak lines (e.g. auroral lines of metal ions and He recombination lines), while at the S/N level typical of our dataset the model effectively emulates traditional diagnostic methods by leveraging strong nebular lines.</description>

      <title>The impact of local noise recorded at the ET candidate sites on the signal to noise ratio of CBC gravitational wave signals for the ET triangle configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an evaluation of how site dependent noise can affect the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals in the future 3rd generation gravitational wave (GW) detector Einstein Telescope (ET). The design of ET is currently pushing the scientific community to study its scientific potential with respect to known, and possibly unexpected, GW signals using its design sensitivity curves. However, local ambient noise may have an impact on the ET sensitivity at low frequency and therefore affect the SNR of CBC signals at low frequency. Therefore, we study the impact of ambient noise on the ET sensitivity curve at the two sites candidate to host ET - Sardinia, in Italy, and the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (EMR) at the Netherlands-Belgium border - and infer the impact on the ET sensitivity curve and how the SNR of CBC signals at low frequencies is affected. We find that Sardinia shows results which are on par, if not better, than the design case. On the other hand, ambient noise for the current EMR sensitivity curve in Terziet causes a higher degradation of the SNR performances.</description>
