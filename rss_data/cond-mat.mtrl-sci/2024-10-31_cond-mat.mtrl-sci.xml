      <title>Redundant Cross-Correlation for Drift Correction in SEM Nanoparticle Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is a widely used tool for nanoparticle characterization, but long-term directional drift can compromise image quality. We present a novel algorithm for post-imaging drift correction in SEM nanoparticle imaging. Our approach combines multiple rapidly acquired, noisy images to produce a single high-quality overlay through redundant cross-correlation, preventing drift-induced distortions. The preservation of critical geometrical properties and accurate imaging of surface features were verified using Atomic Force Microscopy. On platinum nanoparticles with diameters of 300 to 1000 nm, significant improvements in the mean-based signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were achieved, increasing from 4.4 dB in single images to 11.3 dB when overlaying five images. This method offers a valuable tool for enhancing SEM image quality in nanoparticle research and metrology, particularly in settings without specialized hardware-based drift correction.</description>

      <title>Orbital-spin Locking and its Optical Signatures in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets, magnetic materials with zero magnetization and spin-split band structure, have gained tremendous attention recently for their rich physics and potential applications. Here, we report on a microscopic tight-binding model that unveils a unique coupling between orbitals and spins in $d$-wave altermagnets which gives rise to momentum-dependent and spin-selective optical absorption. This coupling promotes the controlled optical excitation of up or down spins depending on the polarization direction of linearly polarized light. Such an effect originates from the coupling of orbitals to the sublattice degree of freedom through the crystal field, which is then coupled to spins through the antiferromagnetic interaction. Our crystal field analysis, which is general to any type of altermagnet, helps understand the onset of altermagnetism from a microscopic point of view, and we use our results to propose clear magneto-optical signatures of our predictions. Our findings shine light on the interplay between orbitals and spins in altermagnets, thus paving the way towards novel orbitronic and opto-spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantification of electronic asymmetry: chirality and axiality in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral and axial materials offer platforms for intriguing phenomena, such as cross-correlated responses and chirality-induced spin selectivity. However, quantifying the properties of such materials has generally been considered challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the spatial distribution of the electron chirality, represented by $\Psi^\dagger \gamma^5 \Psi$ with the four-component Dirac field $\Psi$, characterizes the chirality and axiality of materials. Furthermore, we reveal that spin-derived electric polarization can serve as an effective indicator of material polarity. We present quantitative evaluations of electron chirality distribution and spin-derived electric polarization based on first-principles calculations. Additionally, we propose that electron chirality can be directly observed via circular dichroism in photoemission spectroscopy, which measures the difference between right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. Electron chirality and spin-derived electric polarization provide a new framework for quantifying chirality, axiality, and polarity in asymmetric materials, paving the way for the exploration of novel functional materials.</description>

      <title>Giant Seebeck Effect in PEDOT Materials with Molecular Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poly 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) has been attracting attention as a thermoelectric material for room-temperature use due to its flexibility and non-toxicity. However, PEDOT reportedly generates insufficient thermoelectric power for practical use. This work tried to improve the Seebeck coefficient by introducing molecular strain to PEDOT molecules by loading a Polystyrene sulfonate (PSS)-free PEDOT on a Polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) fiber. Raman spectroscopy revealed the PEDOT materials with significant compression in the C{\alpha}-C{\alpha} bond and extension in the C{\alpha}=C\b{eta} bond exhibit Seebeck coefficients two orders of magnitude larger than usual. Furthermore, strain in the C\b{eta}-C\b{eta} bond strongly correlated with the Seebeck coefficient that varied in a broad range from -2100 to 3300 {\mu}V K-1. This variation indicated that the molecular strain formed a sharp peak or valley around the Fermi level in the density of state (DOS) function, which gradually shifts along with the C\b{eta}-C\b{eta} strain. This molecular strain-induced giant Seebeck effect is expected to be an applicable technique for other polythiophene molecules.</description>

      <title>Observation of chiral domain walls in an octupole-ordered antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin chirality in antiferromagnets offers new opportunities for spintronics. The kagome antiferromagnet Mn3Sn is a paradigmatic material in which the antiferromagnetic order parameter can be detected and controlled by electrical means. However, direct investigation of the magnetic texture of Mn3Sn has been challenging because of the tiny moment hosted in its magnetic octupole, hindering further clarification of this unique material. Here, we address this issue by observing the stray magnetic field from Mn3Sn using a diamond quantum scanning magnetometer. The spatially-resolved intrinsic domains and domain walls in a high-quality single-crystalline Mn3Sn film quantitatively reveal the polarization angle of the magnetic octupole in the kagome plane, the domain's local magnetization, the domain wall's width and chirality, and the octupole order in domain walls. Our nanoscale investigation of Mn3Sn, a powerful complement to macroscopic measurements, paves the road for developing chiral antiferromagnetism and its potential for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Performance of the MACE-MP-0 potential for calculating viscosity in LiF molten salt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform molecular dynamics simulations of molten Lithium Fluoride using the MACE-MP-0 (small) machine learnt interatomic potential and the classical Buckingham and Born-Huggins-Mayer potentials. We find that the MACE-MP-0, out-of-the-box, is able to accurately reproduce the experimental viscosity across the liquid state. Whilst the previous predicted viscosities from classical potentials are under-predicted, which has previously been attributed to a suppressed melting temperature. We find that the melting temperature simulated by MACE-MP-0, simply by heating a crystal structure, is significantly closer to the experimental melting temperature of LiF.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric terpolymer films with enhanced cooling efficiency: An integrated approach considering electrocaloric response and dielectric losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the growing demand for more efficient and compact refrigeration and energy conversion devices, electrocaloric poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorofluoroethylene) is among the most promising active substances. However, despite its high electrocaloric response, the maximum efficiency achievable over a cooling cycle is hampered by losses. To overcome this major limitation, losses have been reduced by using an electrothermal poling treatment as well as by controlling the surface roughness. The upper bound of the efficiency computed over a thermodynamic cycle mimicking the working conditions of an actual cooling device is increased from 1% to 10% of the Carnot efficiency. This represents a major improvement in enhancing ferroelectric materials for advanced energy applications.</description>

      <title>Steady-state distributions of carrier concentration and recombination rates in a solar cell under operating conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The steady-state distribution of carrier concentrations in a solar cell under operating conditions is a key source of carrier recombination and directly influences the output current density. In this study, we investigated the effects of illumination and bias voltage on the steady-state distributions of carrier concentrations and recombination rates in a homo-pn junction solar cell using one-dimensional numerical simulations to explore passivation strategies driven by the reduction of carrier concentrations. Simulations under open circuit conditions revealed that controlling the standard states of carriers can enhance the open circuit voltage without changing the carrier concentration. Furthermore, distributing recombination rates conventionally concentrated in the vicinity of the interface into the bulk region, such as within the absorbing layer, improves the open circuit voltage. Our results also showed that changing the carrier distribution in the dark to that under illumination, in other words, transition from an equilibrium to a steady state, is governed by drift rather than diffusion. This means that the electric field, which induces drift, is a primary driving force for carrier separation. Consequently, by optimizing the electric field distribution depending on properties of recombination-causing defects, a higher short circuit current density can be achieved, even without chemical passivation of defects. This work offers fundamental insights into reduction of steady-state recombination rates through precise control of carrier concentration, chemical potential, and electric field distributions.</description>

      <title>Electron-mediated anharmonicity and its role in the Raman spectrum of graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Raman active G mode in graphene exhibits strong coupling to electrons, yet the comprehensive treatment of this interaction in the calculation of its temperature-dependent Raman spectrum remains incomplete. In this study, we calculate the temperature dependence of the G mode frequency and linewidth, and successfully explain the experimental trend, by accounting for the contributions arising from the first-order electron-phonon coupling, electron-mediated phonon-phonon coupling, and standard lattice anharmonicity. The generality of our approach enables its broad applicability to study phonon dynamics in materials where both electron-phonon coupling and anharmonicity are important.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization of the two-dimensional electron gas at the EuO/SrTiO$_3$ interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-polarized two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) are of particular interest for functional oxide electronics applications. The redox-created 2DEG residing on the strontium titanate, SrTiO$_3$ (STO), side of a europium monoxide (EuO)/SrTiO$_3$ (001) interface is expected to be significantly spin-polarized due to the proximity to the strong ($7\,\mu_B/f.u.$) Heisenberg ferromagnet EuO. We apply magnetic circular dichroism in the angular distribution (MCDAD) of photoemitted electrons to investigate whether and how the induced spin polarization of the 2DEG depends on the dimensionality of the overlaying EuO layer. The experimental data are complemented by density functional theory calculations with Hubbard $U$ term (DFT+$U$). We show that the EuO/STO interfacial 2DEG is spin-polarized even for ultrathin EuO overlayers, starting at an EuO threshold thickness of only two monolayers. Additional EuO monolayers even increase the induced magnetic Ti moment and thus the spin polarization of the 2DEG. Our results and the potential to enhance the magnetic order of EuO by other proximity effects [1] indicate that the EuO/STO (001) interface is an ideal template for creating (multi-)functional spin-polarized 2DEGs for application in oxide electronics.</description>

      <title>Bayesian state estimation unlocks real-time control in thin film synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid validation of newly predicted materials through autonomous synthesis requires real-time adaptive control methods that exploit physics knowledge, a capability that is lacking in most systems. Here, we demonstrate an approach to enable the real-time control of thin film synthesis by combining in situ optical diagnostics with a Bayesian state estimation method. We developed a physical model for film growth and applied the Direct Filter (DF) method for real-time estimation of nucleation and growth rates during pulsed laser deposition (PLD) of transition metal dichalcogenides. We validated the approach on simulated and previously acquired reflectivity data for WSe$_2$ growth and ultimately deployed the algorithm on an autonomous PLD system during growth of 1T$^\prime$-MoTe$_2$ under various synthesis conditions. We found that the DF robustly estimates growth parameters in real-time at early stages of growth, down to 15% percent monolayer area coverage. This approach opens new opportunities for adaptive film growth control based on a fusion of in situ diagnostics, modern data assimilation methods, and physical models which promises to enable control of synthesis trajectories towards desired material states.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The water/electrode interface under an applied bias potential is a challenging out-of-equilibrium phenomenon, which is difficult to accurately model at the atomic scale. In this study, we employ a combined approach of Density Functional Theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) methods to analyze the influence of an external bias on the properties of water adsorbed on Au(111) and Pd(111) metallic electrodes. Our results demonstrate that while both Au and Pd-electrodes induce qualitatively similar structural responses in adsorbed water molecules, the quantitative differences are substantial, driven by the distinct nature of water-metal bonding. Our findings underscore the necessity of quantum-mechanical modeling for accurately describing electrochemical interfaces.</description>

      <title>Energy-Specific Bethe-Salpeter Equation Implementation for Efficient Optical Spectrum Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an energy-specific Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) implementation for efficient core and valence optical spectrum calculations. In energy-specific BSE, high-lying excitation energies are obtained by constructing trial vectors and expanding the subspace targeting excitation energies above the predefined energy threshold in the Davidson algorithm. To calculate optical spectra over a wide energy range, energy-specific BSE can be applied to multiple consecutive small energy windows, where trial vectors for each subsequent energy window are made orthogonal to the subspace of preceding windows to accelerate the convergence of the Davidson algorithm. For seven small molecules, energy-specific BSE combined with $G_0W_0$ provides small errors around 0.8 eV for absolute and relative $K$-edge excitation energies when starting from a hybrid PBEh solution with 45\% exact exchange. We further showcase the computational efficiency of this approach by simulating the N $1s$ $K$-edge excitation spectrum of the porphine molecule and the valence optical spectrum of silicon nanoclusters involving 5,000 excited states using $G_0W_0$-BSE. This work expands the applicability of the $GW$-BSE formalism for investigating high-energy excited states of large systems.</description>

Abstract: Material discovery is a critical area of research with the potential to revolutionize various fields, including carbon capture, renewable energy, and electronics. However, the immense scale of the chemical space makes it challenging to explore all possible materials experimentally. In this paper, we introduce FlowLLM, a novel generative model that combines large language models (LLMs) and Riemannian flow matching (RFM) to design novel crystalline materials. FlowLLM first fine-tunes an LLM to learn an effective base distribution of meta-stable crystals in a text representation. After converting to a graph representation, the RFM model takes samples from the LLM and iteratively refines the coordinates and lattice parameters. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, increasing the generation rate of stable materials by over three times and increasing the rate for stable, unique, and novel crystals by $\sim50\%$ - a huge improvement on a difficult problem. Additionally, the crystals generated by FlowLLM are much closer to their relaxed state when compared with another leading model, significantly reducing post-hoc computational cost.</description>

      <title>Specific heat of Gd$^{3+}$- and Eu$^{2+}$-based magnetic compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have studied theoretically the specific heat of a large number of non-frustrated magnetic structures described by the Heisenberg model for systems with total angular momentum $J=7/2$, which corresponds to the 4f$^7$ configuration of Gd$^{+3}$ and Eu$^{+2}$. For a given critical temperature (controlled by the magnitude of the exchange interactions) we find that to a large accuracy, the specific heat is controlled by two parameters: the effective number of neighbors (which controls the importance of quantum fluctuations) and the axial anisotropy. Using these two parameters we fit the specific heat of four Gd compounds and two Eu compounds obtaining a remarkable agreement. Another Gd compound has been fitted previously. Our work opens the possibility of describing the specific heat of non-frustrated 4f$^7$ systems within a general framework.</description>

      <title>Physics Origin of Universal Unusual Magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the unusual magnetoresistance (UMR) during the rotation of magnetization in the plane perpendicular to the electric current, which has been typically attributed to magnetization-dependent interfacial reflection of spin current, has brought remarkable impacts on the understanding and application of a variety of spintronic phenomena. Here, we report that giant UMR occurs also in single-layer magnetic metals and exhibits high-order contributions and a universal sum rule, which agree well with the physics origin of the recently proposed two-vector magnetoresistance that simply considers electron scattering by the magnetization vector and interfacial electric field, without the need for any relevance to spin current. Revisiting of the literature data reveals that the most representative data that were used to claim spin Hall magnetoresistance or other magnetoresistances related or unrelated to spin current can be understood unifiedly by the two-vector MR theory. Experimental and theoretical results against spin-current-related magnetoresistances, but not the two-vector magnetoresistance, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Ion Dynamics from Muon Diffusion in Muon Spin Relaxation II -- Extension to Paramagnetic Muons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the previously published model that distinguishes between the diffusive motion of diamagnetic muons and the dynamics of ions around the muon in matter, and propose a generalized model for {\sl paramagnetic muons} (Mu$^0$s, bound states of a muon and an unpaired electron) observed in non-metallic host materials. The new model distinguishes among the independent motion of unpaired electron associated with Mu$^0$, the self-diffusive motion of Mu$^0$ as single atomic entity, and that of the ions surrounding Mu$^0$, where the muon spin relaxation is induced by dynamical fluctuations of the hyperfine (HF) field exerted from the unpaired electron (e.g., due to spin/charge exchange reaction) and/or that of the nuclear hyperfine (NHF) interactions between the unpaired electron and the surrounding ions. We have applied this model to the muonated radicals (Mu$^0$s in a polaron state) in conducting polymers, and examined the validity of the interpretations claimed in the earlier literature that the spin relaxation is induced by quasi-one dimensional motion of the unpaired electron. The result suggests that experimental support for such a claim is still inadequate and needs to be reexamined, including the possibility of other origins for the fluctuations. It is expected that our model will prove a useful guide for $\mu$SR studies of various local dynamics involving paramagnetic muon states.</description>

      <title>Enhancing light-matter coupling with electric fields in polar semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the prevailing notion that spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization fields are inherently detrimental to light emission in polar semiconductor heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that polarization can enhance light-matter coupling in quantum wells through the quantum-confined Stark effect, by enabling a reduction in well width without shifting the emission to shorter wavelengths. We illustrate this with the paradigmatic example of red-emitting (644 nm-698 nm) AlInGaN heterostructures, which are essential for achieving polychromatic micron-scale pixels. By systematically exploring their design space with machine learning, we uncover that the globally optimal designs feature extreme internal electric fields exceeding 8 MV/cm. Structural and compositional engineering of electric fields not only offers precise control over the emission wavelength but also boosts the light-emission probability by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Dynamical structure factors of Warm Dense Matter from Time-Dependent Orbital-Free and Mixed-Stochastic-Deterministic Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first calculations of the inelastic part of the dynamical structure factor (DSF) for warm dense matter (WDM) using Time-Dependent Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory (TD-OF-DFT) and Mixed-Stochastic-Deterministic (mixed) Kohn Sham TD-DFT (KS TD-DFT). WDM is an intermediate phase of matter found in planetary cores and laser-driven experiments, where the accurate calculation of the DSF is critical for interpreting X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) measurements. Traditional TD-DFT methods, while highly accurate, are computationally expensive, motivating the exploration of TD-OF-DFT and mixed TD-KS-DFT as more efficient alternatives. We applied these methods to experimentally measured WDM systems, including solid-density aluminum and beryllium, compressed beryllium, and carbon-hydrogen mixtures. Our results show that TD-OF-DFT requires a dynamical kinetic energy potential in order to qualitatively capture the plasmon response. Additionally, it struggles with capturing bound electron contributions and accurately modeling plasmon dynamics without the inclusion of a dynamic kinetic energy potential. In contrast, mixed TD-KS-DFT offers greater accuracy in distinguishing bound and free electron effects, aligning well with experimental data, though at a higher computational cost. This study highlights the trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating that TD-OF-DFT remains a valuable tool for rapid scans of parameter space, while mixed TD-KS-DFT should be preferred for high-fidelity simulations. Our findings provide insight into the future development of DFT methods for WDM and suggest potential improvements for TD-OF-DFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome materials are known to be an ideal platform that hosts a plethora of interesting phases such as topological states, electronic correlation, and magnetism, owing to their unique band structure and geometry. We report magnetotransport measurement in Kagome metal Yb$_{0.5}$Co_3Ge$_3$ as a function of pressure. Below $\sim25^\circ$ K the temperature dependence of resistance shows an upturn that is accompanied by a strong negative magnetoresistance, which could be attributed to Kondo effect. Upon pressurization above 1 GPa the resistance shows a reduction as a function of temperature below $4^\circ$ K, along with a further enhanced negative magnetoresistance. This might indicate an onset of a pressure-induced Kondo coherence effect.</description>

      <title>Hall Transport of Charged Particles in Magnetic Disk Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of periodic structures has driven the development of advanced materials like photonic and phononic crystals. These metamaterials typically rely on complex repeating units or meta-atoms, limiting their adaptability after fabrication. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of metafields, which are repeating patterns of local magnetic fields instead of material structures. Unlike metamaterials, which consist of atoms arranged in structured patterns, metafields focus on the patterns of fields alone, allowing for dynamic property adjustments through external electric currents. This study explores a specific metafield where the repeating pattern is the magnetic disk (MD), defined by a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to its surface. By arranging multiple MDs, we form a magnetic disk array (MDA) and theoretically investigate the charged particle dynamics within this array. Our analysis highlights Hall transport phenomena, such as Hall diffusivity, conductivity, and thermal Hall effects. Using complex variables, we derive the collision integral and Boltzmann equation for particle distribution, applying perturbation methods and Fourier analysis to calculate transport coefficients. Simulations reveal a one-way preferential diffusion at the interface between MDAs with opposing field directions, where diffusion intensity varies with the particle movement direction. This highlights metafields' potential for dynamic particle control applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic proximity effect in biphenylene monolayer from first-principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-surface chemistry has emerged as a key technique for designing novel low-dimensional materials, enabling precise manipulation of their electronic and magnetic properties at the atomic scale. It also proves highly effective for the fabrication of heterostructures. Leveraging these benefits, herein, we perform a first principles study of the magnetic proximity effect (MPE) in a heterostructure formed by a monolayer of the two-dimensional carbon allotrope biphenylene network (BPN) deposited on the surface of the above-room-temperature ferrimagnet yttrium iron garnet (YIG). Our results reveal strong hybridization between BPN orbitals and YIG surface states, resulting in non-homogeneous electron transfer and robust MPE. The proposed methodology accurately describes YIG magnetic interactions, allowing us to study the tuning effects of BPN on the magnetic properties of the substrate for the first time. Additionally, we explore the impact of van der Waals (vdW) distance at the interface, finding enhanced spin splitting up to 30% under external pressure. These findings highlight a promising strategy for inducing spin polarization in BPN without chemical modifications, opening new possibilities for BPN-based spintronic devices through the creation of heterostructures with magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Darkness in interlayer and charge density wave states of 2H-TaS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wave-like nature of electrons is evident from quantum interference effects observed during the photoemission process. When there are different nuclei in the unit cell of a crystal and/or structural distortions, photo-electron wavefunctions can interfere, giving rise to peculiar intensity modulation of the spectrum, which can also hide energy states in a photoemission experiment. The 2H phase of transition metal dichalcogenides, with two nonequivalent layers per unit cell and charge density wave distortion, is an optimal platform for such effects to be observed. Here, we discover undetectable states in 2H-TaS2, interpreting high-resolution angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy considering interference effects of the correlated electron wave functions. In addition, phase mismatching induced by the charge density wave distortion, results in evident signature of the phase transition in the photoemission spectrum. Our results highlight the importance of quantum interference, electronic correlations and structural distortion to understand the physics of layered materials.</description>

      <title>Phase-field modeling of ductile fracture across grain boundaries in polycrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we address damage initiation and micro-crack formation in ductile failure of polycrystalline metals. We show how our recently published thermodynamic framework for ductile phase-field fracture of single crystals can be extended to polycyrstalline structures. A key feature of this framework is that is accounts for size effects by adopting gradient-enhanced (crystal) plasticity. Gradient-enhanced plasticity requires the definition of boundary conditions representing the plastic slip transmission resistance of the boundaries. In this work, we propose a novel type of micro-flexible boundary condition for gradient-plasticity, which couples the slip transmission resistance with the phase-field damage such that the resistance locally changes during the fracturing process. The formulation permits to maintain the effect of grain boundaries as obstacles for plastic slip during plastification, while also accounting for weakening of their resistance during the softening phase. In numerical experiments, the new damage-dependent boundary condition is compared to classical micro-free and micro-hard boundary conditions in polycrystals and it is demonstrated that it indeed produces a response that transitions from micro-hard to micro-free as the material fails. We show that the formulation maintains resistance to slip transmission during hardening, but can generate micro-cracks across grain boundaries during the fracture process. We further show examples of how the model can be used to simulate void coalescence and three-dimensional crack fronts in polycrystals.</description>

      <title>Quantitative measure of topological protection in Floquet systems through the spectral localizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard understanding of topological protection from band theory is that a system's topology cannot change without first closing the bulk band gap. However, in Floquet systems, this typical definition of topological protection is one step removed from the experimentally accessible system parameters, as the relationship between the disorder in a system's instantaneous Hamiltonian and its Floquet Hamiltonian that defines its topology is not straightforward. Here, we demonstrate that the spectral localizer framework for classifying material topology can be applied to Floquet systems and prove that its associated measure of topological protection can be understood in terms of the integrated disorder across the system's instantaneous Hamiltonians. As such, we have derived a quantitative bound on a Floquet system's topological protection in terms of the instantaneous system. Moreover, we show the utility of these bounds in both ordinary an anomalous Floquet Chern insulators.</description>

Abstract: The behavior of a Fermi gas across various dimensions has already been extensively explored. However, existing formulations often lack clarity or exhibit inconsistencies. In this work, we present a streamlined approach for deriving the density of states (DOS) for a $d$-dimensional Fermi gas for semiconductors. We provide explicit general expressions for key Fermi quantities, including the wavevector, energy, temperature, momentum, wavelength, and velocity. Moreover, we apply these expressions to calculate for the carrier concentration and thermodynamic properties such as the internal energy, chemical potential, specific heat, electron degeneracy pressure, and bulk modulus. From the degeneracy pressure, we attribute a purely quantum mechanical explanation for the enhancement of carrier concentration in lower dimensions.</description>

      <title>Guest-induced phase transition leads to polarization enhancement in MHyPbCl3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed first-principles investigation of the structural and polar properties of 3D hybrid perovskite, methylhydrazinium lead chloride, MHyPbCl3, as it transitions from a highly polar Phase-I (high temperature, HT) to less polar Phase-II (low temperature, LT) from the perspective of host/guest interactions. Structurally, the two phases vary in the orientation of the guest and the two differently distorted host layers. The transition character (TC) across the path of phase transition and a relatively high guest-reorientation barrier tells that the transition is primarily governed by guest-reorientation. This overall guest/host transition is interesting because it leads to enhancement in polarization with temperature which is quite unusual. Maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) have been used to probe into the atomistic origin of this enhancement which establishes the leading role of the host atoms, especially those lying in the more distorted octahedral layer, with only a negligible contribution from the guest, despite the fact that it is the primary effect leading to transition. Furthermore, we also find a significant feedback polarization of ~9% that the host distortion induces on the guest. This has a direct effect on the density of states occupied by the guest, which shifts away from the band edge with the increase in the host distortion (for Phase-II guest orientation). Thus the organic cations in 3D perovskites can also have a non-trivial contribution to the optoelectronic properties and exciton binding energies.</description>

      <title>Simulation of perovskite thin layer crystallization with varying evaporation rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSC) are promising potential competitors to established photovoltaic technologies due to their superior efficiency and low-cost solution processability. However, the limited understanding of the crystallization behaviour hinders the technological transition from lab-scale cells to modules. In this work, we perform Phase Field (PF) simulations of the doctor-bladed film formation to obtain mechanistic and morphological information that is experimentally challenging to access. PF simulations are validated extensively using in- and ex-situ experiments for different solvent evaporation rates. The well-known transition from a film with many pinholes, for a low evaporation rate, to a smooth film, for high evaporation rates, is recovered in simulation and experiment. From the simulation, the transition can be assigned to the change in the ratio of evaporation to crystallization rate because of two distinct mechanisms. Firstly, for larger evaporation rates, nuclei appear at higher concentrations, which favors nucleation as compared to growth. Secondly, the growth of the crystals is confined in a thinner film, which limits their vertical size. Both effects are expected to be valid independent of the specific chemistry of the chosen experimental system, as long as the evaporation time of the solvent is comparable to the crystallization time.</description>

      <title>Development of a Machine Learning Potential to Study Structure and Thermodynamics of Nickel Nanoclusters</title>

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) potentials such as Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in mapping structure to properties across diverse systems. Here, we introduce a GAP model for low-dimensional Ni nanoclusters and demonstrate its flexibility and effectiveness in capturing the energetics, structural diversity and thermodynamic properties of Ni nanoclusters across a broad size range. Through a systematic approach encompassing model development, validation, and application, we evaluate the model's efficacy in representing energetics and configurational features in low-dimensional regimes, while also examining its extrapolative nature to vastly different spatiotemporal regimes. Our analysis and discussion shed light on the data quality required to effectively train such models. Trajectories from large scale MD simulations using the GAP model analyzed with data-driven models like Graph Neural Networks (GNN) reveal intriguing insights into the size-dependent phase behavior and thermo-mechanical stability characteristics of porous Ni nanoparticles. Overall, our work underscores the potential of ML models which coupled with data-driven approaches serve as versatile tools for studying low-dimensional systems and complex material dynamics.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Persistent Homology Features for Accurate Defect Formation Energy Predictions via Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In machine-learning-assisted high-throughput defect studies, a defect-aware latent representation of the supercell structure is crucial to the accurate prediction of defect properties. The performance of current graph neural network (GNN) models is limited due to the fact that defect properties depend strongly on the local atomic configurations near the defect sites and due to the over-smoothing problem of GNN. Herein, we demonstrate that persistent homology features, which encode the topological information of local chemical environment around each atomic site, can characterize the structural information of defects. Using the dataset containing a wide spectrum of \ch{O}-based perovskites with all available vacancies as an example, we show that incorporating the persistent homology features, along with proper choices of graph pooling operations, significantly increases the prediction accuracy, with the MAE reduced by 55\%. Those features can be easily integrated into the state-of-the-art GNN models, including the graph Transformer network and the equivariant neural network, and universally improve their performance. Besides, our model also overcomes the convergence issue with respect to the supercell size that was present in previous GNN models. Furthermore, using the datasets of defective \ch{BaTiO3} with multiple substitutions and multiple vacancies as examples, our GNN model can also predict the defect-defect interactions accurately. These results suggest that persistent homology features can effectively improve the performance of machine learning models and assist the accelerated discovery of functional defects for technological applications.</description>

      <title>Nano-optics of transition metal dichalcogenides and their van der Waals heterostructures with electron spectroscopies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The outstanding properties of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, arising from their structure and the modified electron-hole Coulomb interaction in two-dimension, make them promising candidates for potential electro-optical devices. However, the production of reproducible devices remains challenging, partly due to variability at the nanometer to atomic scales. Thus, access to chemical, structural, and optical characterization at these lengthscales is essential. While electron microscopy and spectroscopy can provide chemical and structural data, accessing the optical response at the nanoscale through electron spectroscopies has been hindered until recently. This review focuses on the application of two electron spectroscopies in scanning (transmission) electron microscopes, namely cathodoluminescence and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, to study the nano-optics of TMD atomic layers and their vdW heterostructures. How technological advancements that can improve these spectroscopies, many of which are already underway, will make them ideal for studying the physics of vdW heterostructures at the nanoscale will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty of DFT calculated mechanical and structural properties of solids due to incompatibility of pseudopotentials and exchange-correlation functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The demand for pseudopotentials constructed for a given exchange-correlation (XC) functional far exceeds the supply, necessitating the use of those commonly available. The number of XC functionals currently available is in the hundreds, if not thousands, and the majority of pseudopotentials have been generated for the LDA and PBE. The objective of this study is to identify the error in the determination of the mechanical and structural properties (lattice constant, cohesive energy, surface energy, elastic constants, and bulk modulus) of crystals calculated by DFT with such inconsistency. Additionally, the study aims to estimate the performance of popular XC functionals (LDA, PBE, PBEsol, and SCAN) for these calculations in a consistent manner.</description>

      <title>Ground-States for Metals from Converged Coupled Cluster Calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-electron correlation methods offer a systematic approach to predicting material properties with high precision. However, practically attaining accurate ground-state properties for bulk metals presents significant challenges. In this work, we propose a novel scheme to reach the thermodynamic limit of the total ground-state energy of metals using coupled cluster theory. We demonstrate that the coupling between long-range and short-range contributions to the correlation energy is sufficiently weak, enabling us to restrict long-range contributions to low-energy excitations in a controllable way. Leveraging this insight, we calculate the surface energy of aluminum and platinum (111), providing numerical evidence that coupled cluster theory is well-suited for modeling metallic materials, particularly in surface science. Notably, our results exhibit convergence with respect to finite-size effects, basis-set size, and coupled cluster expansion, yielding excellent agreement with experimental data. This paves the way for more efficient coupled cluster calculations for large systems and a broader utilization of the theory in realistic metallic models of materials.</description>

      <title>Revealing subterahertz atomic vibrations in quantum paraelectrics by surface-sensitive spintronic terahertz spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding surface collective dynamics in quantum materials is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. For example, surface phonon modes in quantum paraelectrics are thought to play an essential role in facilitating interfacial superconductivity. However, detecting these modes, especially below 1 terahertz (THz), is challenging due to limited sampling volumes and the need for high spectroscopic resolution. Here, we report surface soft transverse optical (TO1) phonon dynamics in KTaO3 and SrTiO3 by developing surface-sensitive spintronic THz spectroscopy that can sense the collective modes only a few nanometers deep from the surface. In KTaO3, the TO1 mode softens and sharpens with decreasing temperature, leveling off at 0.7 THz. In contrast, this mode in SrTiO3 broadens significantly below the quantum paraelectric crossover and coincides with the hardening of a sub-meV phonon mode related to the antiferrodistortive transition. These observations that deviate from their bulk properties may have implications for interfacial superconductivity and ferroelectricity. The developed technique opens opportunities for sensing low-energy surface excitations.</description>

      <title>Non-linear anomalous Edelstein response at altermagnetic interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In altermagnets, time-reversal symmetry breaking spin-polarizes electronic states, while total magnetization remains zero. In addition, at altermagnetic surfaces Rashba-spin orbit coupling is activated due to broken inversion symmetry, introducing a competing spin-momentum locking interaction. Here we show that their interplay leads to the formation of complex, chiral spin textures that offer novel, non-linear spin-to-charge conversion properties. Whereas altermagnetic order suppresses the canonical linear in-plane Rashba-Edelstein response, we establish the presence of an anomalous transversal Edelstein effect for planar applied electric and magnetic field, or alternatively, an in-plane magnetization. Moreover the non-linear Edelstein response resulting purely from electric fields also triggers the anomalous out-of-plane magnetization. We determine the anomalous response with a model based on the ab-initio electronic structure of RuO$_2$ bilayers, ultimately opening experimental avenues to explore spin-charge conversion phenomena at altermagnetic interfaces.</description>

Abstract: In contrast to lead-based perovskites, double perovskites have attracted considerable interest due to their ability to modulate photovoltaic properties and high stability through elemental control. However, most double perovskites are mainly faced with large band gap ranges and indirect band gaps. Here, we report the structural, electronic, and optical properties of the double perovskites Cs2RhAgX6 and Cs2IrAgX6 (X = Cl, Br and I) by first-principles calculations. The results of the thermodynamic stability and electronic properties show that the double perovskites have a higher stability and exhibit a suitable band gap range in the field of optoelectronics, their band gap decrease with the substitution of halogen elements from Cl to I (0.55-2.2 eV). In addition, the double perovskite exhibits strong light absorption. These results suggest a great potential for Cs2RhAgX6 and Cs2IrAgX6 (X = Cl, Br and I) perovskites in optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Amplitude Expansion Phase Field Crystal (APFC) Modeling based Efficient Dislocation Simulations using Fourier Pseudospectral Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystalline defects play a critical role in determining the properties of crystalline solids, underscoring the need for accurate computational methods to study them. Lattice deformation in dislocation simulations, which involves changes in atomic positions, can be described either microscopically by specific atomic configurations or macroscopically by continuum elasticity, each with inherent limitations. The complex amplitude expansion of the phase field crystal (APFC) model provides a mesoscopic approach that bridges these scales. In this paper, we introduce a Fourier pseudospectral method for efficiently solving the APFC model in the context of crystalline defect simulations. This study marks the first application of the Fourier pseudospectral method to the APFC model. The method fully exploits the system's periodicity and facilitates the implementation of periodic boundary conditions, thanks to its high accuracy and computational efficiency. Numerical experiments conducted on two-dimensional triangular lattices and three-dimensional body-centered cubic lattices for edge dislocation geometry optimization have produced strain field images that align well with by continuum elasticity predictions. The findings demonstrate the potential of the APFC model to accurately capture the complex strain fields associated with dislocations at the mesoscopic scales, a key step toward modeling more intricate crystalline defect structures and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bi-phasic lithiation/delithiation dynamics in Li-ion batteries: application of the Smoothed Boundary Method in the phase field model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An appropriate description of the lithiation/delithiation dynamics in bi-phasic primary cathode particles of Li-ion batteries requires an accurate treatment of the conditions holding at the interface between the particle and the surrounding liquid electrolyte. We propose a phase field model based on the Allen-Cahn approach within which the particle-electrolyte interface is smooth (Smoothed Boundary Method - SBM), in order to simulate arbitrarily shaped particles. Surface terms are added to the evolution equations, and SBM calculations are compared with benchmark simulations for which the boundary conditions are explicitly imposed at the borders of the calculation domain. We find that strengthening factors for the surface terms are needed in order to achieve the desired conditions for the phase and elastic fields, and to correctly reproduce the level of stress within the particle. This reveals crucial in the context of Li-ion batteries for an accurate prediction of the Li insertion/extraction rate and the Li diffusion behavior. We perform also a simulation under potentio-static conditions with a full coupling of the different physical processes at play. It illustrates the applicability of our approach and demonstrates the capabilities of the SBM for a simulation of lithiation/delithiation dynamics with coupled electrochemistry and mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Special arrangements of atoms with more than one atom per unit cell, including honeycomb or kagome (woven bamboo mat) lattices, can host propagating excitations with non-trivial topology as defined by their evolution along closed paths in momentum space. Excitations on such lattices can also be momentum-independent, meaning that they are localized notwithstanding strong hopping of the underlying disturbances between neighbouring sites. The associated flat bands are interesting because the interactions between the heavy quasiparticles inhabiting them will become much more important than for strong dispersion, resulting in novel quantum solid and liquid states. Different stackings of two-dimensional lattices, for example twisted graphene bilayers, provide routes to further engineer topology and many-body effects. Here, we report the discovery, using circularly polarized x-rays for the unambiguous isolation of magnetic signals, of a nearly flat spin wave band and large (compared to elemental iron) orbital moment for the metallic ferromagnet Fe3Sn2, built from compact AB-stacked kagome bilayers and which has a topologically non-trivial electronic band structure controllable by modest external magnetic fields. As a function of out-of-plane momentum, the nearly flat optical mode and the global rotation symmetry-restoring acoustic mode are out of phase, consistent with a bilayer exchange coupling that is larger than the already large in-plane couplings. The defining units of this topological metal are therefore a triangular lattice of octahedral iron clusters rather than weakly coupled kagome planes. The spin waves are strongly damped when compared to elemental iron, opening the topic of interactions of topological bosons (spin waves) and fermions (electrons) with the very specific target of explaining boson lifetimes.</description>

Abstract: Despite much experimental and theoretical work, the nature of the charge order in the kagome metals belonging to the family of materials AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs,Rb,K) remains controversial. A crucial ingredient for the identification of the ordering in these materials is their response to external perturbations, such as strain or magnetic fields. To this end, we provide a comprehensive symmetry classification of the possible charge orders in kagome materials with a $2\times2$ increase of the unit cell. Motivated by the experimental reports of time-reversal-symmetry breaking and rotational anisotropy, we consider the interdependence of flux and bond orders. Deriving the relevant Landau free energy for possible orders, we study the effect of symmetry-breaking perturbations such as strain and magnetic fields. Our results, thus, provide a roadmap for future tests of these intricate orders.</description>

Abstract: The crystalline solids with lack of orientational ordering of anisotropic particles serve the purpose of studying the disordered systems with many fundamental applications in contemporary research. Despite the orientational disorder, multiple unique orientations with fixed angular differences exist in the crystal structures giving rise of "discrete plastic crystal" phase where the particles jump discretely within the unique orientations. We report the computational evidence of the role of symmetries between polyhedral particles and respective crystalline structures in controlling the existence of such phase at comparatively higher range of packing fractions beyond the freely rotating plastic crystals. The point groups of the particle and crystal structure were found to be directly connected in terms of the parallel alignment between the highest order rotational symmetry axes of the particle point group and any rotational axes of crystallographic point group, as a characteristic feature of this phase giving rise of discrete orientations. Based on our previous research [Kundu \textit{et al.}, arXiv:2311.06799, 2023] and new findings reported here, this symmetry relationship appeared to occur at the unit cells of the crystal structures which acted as the source of correlation, where as, all previously reported conserved orientational attributes i.e., number of unique orientations with fixed angular differences, equal population densities within the unique orientations, could be thought as the signatures of correlation present in the entire system. This relationship appeared to control all the aspects of phase which might be useful to draw fundamental insights about the disordered phases with orientational correlation as well as designing the disorder in the crystals.</description>

Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone \&amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson \&amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>
