      <title>Impact of UC2, UC, UBC and UB2 target compositions on the release of fission products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The release properties of 4 targets (UC2, UC, UBC, UB2) were measured for 11 elements (Kr, Sr, Ru, Sn, Sb, Te, I, Cs, Ba, La, and Ce) using an off-line technique. The crystal packing fraction and the size of the studied element play a key role in the release process. However, physicochemical properties are also involved, notably melting and boiling points in vacuum and the minimal oxidation state. Principal component analysis was used to investigate the interrelationships between the physicochemical properties of fission products (from Fe to Dy) and the observed releases, thereby enabling predictions to be made about the release properties of the four crystallic configurations for elements that are inaccessible in off-line experiments.</description>

      <title>Virtual Majorana Neutrinos and the Minimum Neutrino Mass Scale in Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual Majorana neutrinos are indispensable for neutrinoless double-beta (0$\nu\beta\beta$) decay. In this study, we demonstrate that the overlap of the virtual Majorana neutrino wavefunction, predominantly composed of a right-handed antineutrino component with a strongly suppressed left-handed component (with amplitude proportional to the effective Majorana neutrino mass, $|m_{\beta\beta}|$, is crucial for triggering this decay process. This effective mass, derived from the minimum neutrino mass, offers valuable insights into the absolute neutrino mass scale. Using best-fit parameters from neutrino oscillation experiments, the minimum neutrino mass is determined from the sum of the three neutrino mass eigenstates, $\Sigma = m_1 + m_2 + m_3,$ which is represented by two narrow bands centered at approximately 0.06 eV/c$^2$ for the normal hierarchy (NH) and 0.102 eV/c$^2$ for the inverted hierarchy (IH). Under these constraints, the minimum neutrino mass is found to be 0.001186 eV/c$^2$ for NH and 0.002646 eV/c$^2$ for IH, thereby establishing a potential absolute neutrino mass scale for both scenarios. From these values, we calculate $|m_{\beta\beta}|$, which plays a central role in $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. By combining $|m_{\beta\beta}|$ with decay phase-space factors, nuclear matrix elements, and the absorption probability of the virtual Majorana neutrino, we estimate the $0\nu\beta\beta$ half-life for key isotopes, namely, $^{76}$Ge, $^{130}$Te, and $^{136}$Xe, using two independent methods. The results are in good agreement, and we also discuss the uncertainties in the nuclear matrix elements that may affect these calculations.</description>

      <title>Glueballonia as Hopfions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We work out the Hopfion description of glueballs by inclusively comparing the energy spectra obtained by quantizing Hopfions with experimental data and lattice QCD. Identifying a Hopfion carrying a unit topological charge as $f_0(1500)$, the Hopfions with the topological charge two are classified as glueballonia, i.e., two glueballs are bound together. We find a tightly and a loosely bound glueballonia complying with $f_0 (2470)$ and a novel scalar particle carrying the mass around 2814 MeV, respectively, and calculate their binding energies. By the rigid body quantization of Hopfions, we predict a characteristic multiplet structure of tensor glueball states. Some of them are missing in the current experimental data and can be verified in future measurements.</description>

      <title>Bayesian reconstruction of anisotropic flow fluctuations at fixed impact parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cumulants of the distribution of anisotropic flow are measured accurately in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC as a function of centrality classifiers (charged multiplicity and/or transverse energy). Using Bayesian inference, we reconstruct from these measurements the probability distribution of anisotropic flow in the ``theorists' frame'' where the impact parameter has a fixed magnitude and orientation, up to $\sim 70\%$ centrality. The variation of flow fluctuations with impact parameter displays direct evidence of viscous damping, which is larger for higher Fourier harmonics, in line with expectations from hydrodynamics. We use intensive measures of non-Gaussian flow fluctuations, which have reduced dependence on centrality. We infer from ATLAS data the magnitude of these intensive non-Gaussianities in each Fourier harmonic. They provide data-driven estimates of response coefficients to initial anisotropies, without resorting to any specific microscopic model of initial conditions. These estimates agree with viscous hydrodynamic calculations.</description>

      <title>Dipole Polarizability of Finite Nuclei as a Probe of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear ground state and collective excitation properties provide a means to probe the nuclear matter equation of state and establish connections between observables in finite nuclei and neutron stars. Specifically, the electric dipole polarizability, measured with high precision in various neutron-rich nuclei, serves as a robust constraint on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. In this Letter, we employ a class of relativistic energy density functionals in a twofold process: first, to link the electric dipole polarizability from recent experiments to the slope of the symmetry energy, and second, to translate this information into constraints on the tidal deformability and radii of neutron stars, in connection with multimessenger astrophysical observations from pulsars and binary neutron stars. We provide compelling evidence that the electric dipole polarizability represents a key nuclear observable to probe the neutron star properties. By significantly reducing the uncertainties in the mass-radius plane, our findings also align with recent multimessenger observations.</description>

      <title>Extracting the speed of sound in quark-gluon plasma with ultrarelativistic lead-lead collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions create a strongly interacting state of hot and dense quark-gluon matter that exhibits a remarkable collective flow behavior with minimal viscous dissipation. To gain deeper insights into its intrinsic nature and fundamental degrees of freedom, we determine the speed of sound in an extended volume of quark-gluon plasma using lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.02 TeV. The data were recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 0.607 nb$^{-1}$. The measurement is performed by studying the multiplicity dependence of the average transverse momentum of charged particles emitted in head-on PbPb collisions. Our findings reveal that the speed of sound in this matter is nearly half the speed of light, with a squared value of 0.241 $\pm$ 0.002 (stat) $\pm$ 0.016 (syst) in natural units. The effective medium temperature, estimated using the mean transverse momentum, is 219 $\pm$ 8 (syst) MeV. The measured squared speed of sound at this temperature aligns precisely with predictions from lattice quantum chromodynamic (QCD) calculations. This result provides a stringent constraint on the equation of state of the created medium and direct evidence for a deconfined QCD phase being attained in relativistic nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>NuPECC Long Range Plan 2024 for European Nuclear Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nuclear Physics European Collaboration Committee ( NuPECC, http://nupecc.org/ ) hosted by the European Science Foundation represents today a large nuclear physics community from 23 countries, 3 ESFRI (European Strategy Forum for Research Infrastructures) nuclear physics infrastructures and ECT* (European Centre for Theoretical Studies in Nuclear Physics and Related Areas), as well as from 4 associated members and 10 observers.
  As stated in the NuPECC Terms of Reference one of the major objectives of the Committee is: "on a regular basis, the Committee shall organise a consultation of the community leading to the definition and publication of a Long Range Plan (LRP) of European nuclear physics". To this end, NuPECC has in the past produced five LRPs: in November 1991, December 1997, April 2004, December 2010, and November 2017.
  The LRP, being the unique document covering the whole nuclear physics landscape in Europe, identifies opportunities and priorities for nuclear science in Europe and provides national funding agencies, ESFRI, and the European Commission with a framework for coordinated advances in nuclear science. It serves also as a reference document for the strategic plans for nuclear physics in the European countries.</description>

      <title>Detectors for next-generation quasi-free scattering experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-free scattering of atomic nuclei away from the stability line has reached several milestones over the past decade. The advent of gamma, charged-particle, and neutron detection devices for inverse kinematics, especially in combination with RI beams, has opened new horizons in nuclear physics. Research is progressing with detection devices optimized to explore these new and challenging areas of physics. While some of the new detection developments aim for high energy and angular resolution, others focus on increasing detection efficiency or enhancing large angular acceptance. Notable new detection systems such as STRASSE, TOGAXI, HYPATIA, NEBULA(plus), and TRIP have been developed at the RIBF to meet these demands. As high-intensity RI beams become available worldwide, we reflect on past detectors and provide a review of the future development of detection devices.</description>
