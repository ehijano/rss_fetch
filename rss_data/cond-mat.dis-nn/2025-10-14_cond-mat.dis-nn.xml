      <title>Localization Transition on Random Graphs with Chiral and Bogoliubov-de Gennes Symmetry Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied single-particle Anderson localization in ensembles of graphs that correspond to chiral and Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) symmetry classes. For a random biregular bipartite graph with chiral symmetry, the density of states was found using the cavity approach. Calculating the fractal dimension shows the effects of disordered zero modes. For Bogoliubov-de Gennes ensembles with an underlying random regular graph (RRG), the density of states was calculated both numerically and analytically. The ensembles BdG-RRG with symmetry-conserving diagonal disorder in the delocalized phase have a smaller fractal dimension compared to the usual RRG.</description>

      <title>Defect-driven incoherent skin localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of dephasing during wave evolution has traditionally been viewed as an obstacle to localization, leading to diffusion even in strongly disordered Hermitian lattices. In contrast, here we demonstrate how the interplay of dephasing with non-Hermitian defects can be harnessed to engineer wave localization. Specifically, we identify a novel dynamical localization phenomenon characterized by wavefunction accumulation at the lattice's boundary due solely to dephasing, despite globally reciprocal couplings. Furthermore, we study the incoherent skin effect arising from coupling asymmetry, and investigate the interplay between these antagonistic localization mechanisms. By reframing dephasing from a hindrance into a tool, this study overturns established paradigms of wave localization and paves the way for novel approaches to controlling localization phenomena in non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Controllable Domain Wall Memories with Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain wall memories have undergone several changes over the years for faster shift, read, and write operations; however, fundamental issues persist due to creating pinning sites topographically along the nanowire. The deformity in notches creates non-uniform pinning strength, leading to multiple faults during shift operation. This study proposes a novel approach to address these challenges and gain greater control over domain manipulation for advanced applications in Boolean and non-Boolean paradigms. Utilizing the magnetic topological insulator (MTI) can create pinning sites without potentially faulty topographical notches made through complex lithography. Moreover, applying an external current enables precise control over the pinning potentials at these sites. Micromagnetic simulations validate the effectiveness of MTI-based pinning sites, showcasing their potential for future applications. Our approach introduces an alternative method for creating pinning sites by cross-architecture of ferromagnetic nanowires and MTI nanobars, inducing exchange interaction at their intersection points. This method offers simplicity of fabrication and enables control over the pinning strength by external current.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of a Non-Hermitian extension of the diluted Wishart ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework based on the cavity and replica methods to analyze the spectral properties of sparse asymmetric correlation matrices of the form $\boldsymbol{F} = (\boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{Y}^\top + \omega \boldsymbol{Y}\boldsymbol{X}^\top)/2T$, where $\boldsymbol{X}$ and $\boldsymbol{Y}$ are adjacency matrices of weighted Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graphs. We examine how the spectral density evolves as the asymmetry parameter $\omega$ varies from $0 &lt; \omega &lt; 1$ (nearly symmetric matrices) to $-1 &lt; \omega \le 0$ (nearly antisymmetric matrices). Analytical predictions are validated through exact numerical diagonalization, showing excellent agreement with theoretical results in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Learning Dynamics of Quantized Models with Straight-Through Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantized neural network training optimizes a discrete, non-differentiable objective. The straight-through estimator (STE) enables backpropagation through surrogate gradients and is widely used. While previous studies have primarily focused on the properties of surrogate gradients and their convergence, the influence of quantization hyperparameters, such as bit width and quantization range, on learning dynamics remains largely unexplored. We theoretically show that in the high-dimensional limit, STE dynamics converge to a deterministic ordinary differential equation. This reveals that STE training exhibits a plateau followed by a sharp drop in generalization error, with plateau length depending on the quantization range. A fixed-point analysis quantifies the asymptotic deviation from the unquantized linear model. We also extend analytical techniques for stochastic gradient descent to nonlinear transformations of weights and inputs.</description>

      <title>Chirality reversal at finite magnetic impurity strength and local signatures of a topological phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the honeycomb lattice with a single magnetic impurity modeled by adding imaginary next-nearest-neighbor hopping ih on a single hexagon. This Haldane defect gives a topological mass term to the gapless Dirac cones and generates chirality. For a small density of defects Neehus et al [arXiv:2405.19289] found that the system's chirality reverses at a critical hc ~ 0.95 associated with an unexpected tri-critical point of Dirac fermions at zero defect density. We investigate this zero-density limit by analyzing a single defect and computing two experimentally relevant measures of chirality: (1) orbital magnetization via local Chern marker, a bulk probe of all occupied states; and (2) electronic currents of low-energy states. Both probes show a chirality reversal at a critical hc ~ 0.9--1. Motivated by this consistency we propose a defect-scale toy model whose low energy states reverse their chirality at hc' ~ 0.87. Remarkably, the same pair of zero energy bound states also generate the critical point hc in the full impurity projected T-matrix. Our results show how the chirality reversal produced by an impurity can be observed either in local probes or in the global topology and suggest a possible role of the microscopic defect structure at the critical point.</description>

      <title>Comparing Symmetrized Determinant Neural Quantum States for the Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of the Hubbard model are crucial to understanding strongly correlated phenomena, where small energy differences between competing orders demand high numerical precision. In this work, Neural Quantum States are used to probe the strongly coupled and underdoped regime of the square-lattice Hubbard model. We systematically compare the Hidden Fermion Determinant State and the Jastrow-Backflow ansatz, parametrized by a Vision Transformer, finding that in practice, their accuracy is similar. We also test different symmetrization strategies, finding that output averaging yields the lowest energies, though it becomes costly for larger system sizes. On cylindrical systems, we consistently observe filled stripes. On the torus, our calculations display features consistent with a doped Mott insulator, including antiferromagnetic correlations and suppressed density fluctuations. Our results demonstrate both the promise and current challenges of neural quantum states for correlated fermions.</description>

      <title>Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling and Nonlocal Correlations in Disordered 2D Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extension of the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) that incorporates Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to investigate the interplay between disorder, spin-orbit interaction, and nonlocal spatial correlations in disordered two-dimensional systems. By analyzing the average density of states, momentum-resolved self-energy, and return probability, we demonstrate how Rashba SOC and nonlocal correlations jointly modify single-particle properties and spin-dependent interference. The method captures key features of the symplectic universality class, including SOC-induced delocalization signatures at finite times. We benchmark the DCA results against those obtained from the numerically exact kernel polynomial method, finding good agreement. This validates the computationally efficient, mean-field-based DCA framework as a robust tool for exploring disorder, spin-orbit coupling, and nonlocal correlation effects in low-dimensional systems, and paves the way for simulating multiorbital and strongly correlated systems that were previously inaccessible due to computational limitations.</description>

      <title>Overlap Gap and Computational Thresholds in the Square Wave Perceptron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Square Wave Perceptrons (SWPs) form a class of neural network models with oscillating activation function that exhibit intriguing ``hardness'' properties in the high-dimensional limit at a fixed constraint density $\alpha = O(1)$. In this work, we examine two key aspects of these models. The first is related to the so-called \emph{overlap-gap property}, that is a disconnectivity feature of the geometry of the solution space of combinatorial optimization problems proven to cause the failure of a large family of solvers, and conjectured to be a symptom of algorithmic hardness. We identify, both in the storage and in the teacher-student settings, the emergence of an overlap gap at a threshold $\alpha_{\mathrm{OGP}}(\delta)$, which can be made arbitrarily small by suitably increasing the frequency of oscillations $1/\delta$ of the activation. This suggests that in this small-$\delta$ regime, typical instances of the problem are hard to solve even for small values of $\alpha$. Second, in the teacher-student setup, we show that the recovery threshold of the planted signal for message-passing algorithms can be made arbitrarily large by reducing $\delta$. These properties make SWPs both a challenging benchmark for algorithms and an interesting candidate for cryptographic applications.</description>

      <title>Average-case matrix discrepancy: satisfiability bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$, and a margin $\Delta &gt; 0$, we investigate whether it is possible to find signs $(\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n) \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ such that the operator norm of the signed sum satisfies $\|\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \mathbf{W}_i\|_{\rm op} \leq \Delta$. Kunisky and Zhang (2023) recently introduced a random version of this problem, where the matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. This model can be seen as a random variant of the celebrated Matrix Spencer conjecture and as a matrix-valued analog of the symmetric binary perceptron in statistical physics. In this work, we establish a satisfiability transition in this problem as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \tau &gt; 0$. First, we prove that the expected number of solutions with margin $\Delta=\kappa \sqrt{n}$ has a sharp threshold at a critical $\tau_1(\kappa)$: for $\tau &lt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the problem is typically unsatisfiable, while for $\tau &gt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the average number of solutions is exponentially large. Second, combining a second-moment method with recent results from Altschuler (2023) on margin concentration in perceptron-type problems, we identify a second threshold $\tau_2(\kappa)$, such that for $\tau&gt;\tau_2(\kappa)$ the problem admits solutions with high probability. In particular, we establish that a system of $n = \Theta(d^2)$ Gaussian random matrices can be balanced so that the spectrum of the resulting matrix macroscopically shrinks compared to the semicircle law. Finally, under a technical assumption, we show that there exists values of $(\tau,\kappa)$ for which the number of solutions has large variance, implying the failure of the second moment method. Our proofs rely on establishing concentration and large deviation properties of correlated Gaussian matrices under spectral norm constraints.</description>

      <title>Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets on the square lattice</title>

Abstract: Machine-learning-based variational Monte Carlo simulations are a promising approach for targeting quantum many-body ground states, especially in two dimensions and in cases where the ground state is known to have a non-trivial sign structure. While many state-of-the-art variational energies have been reached with these methods for finite-size systems, little work has been done to use these results to extract information about the target state in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a variational ans\"{a}tze, and leverage their recurrent nature to simulate the ground states of progressively larger systems through iterative retraining. This transfer learning technique allows us to simulate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems on lattices with more than 1,000 spins without beginning optimization from scratch for each system size, thus reducing the demands for computational resources. In this study, we focus on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, where it is possible to carefully benchmark our results. We show that we are able to systematically improve the accuracy of the results from our simulations by increasing the training time, and obtain results for finite-sized lattices that are in good agreement with the literature values. Furthermore, we use these results to extract accurate estimates of the ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. This work demonstrates that RNN wavefunctions are able to extract accurate information about quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the effect of varying system conditions on the single-particle entanglement entropy for an arbitrary eigenstate of a complex system that can be described by a multiparametric Gaussian ensemble. Our theoretical analysis leads to the identification of a single functional of the system parameters that governs the entropy dynamics. This reveals a sensitivity of the entropy to collective information content, characterized by the functional, instead of the individual system details. The functional can further be used to identify the universality classes as well as a deep web of connection underlying different quantum states.</description>

      <title>Quantized Transport of $\nu = 2/3$ Fractional Quantum Hall Edge with Disordered Superconducting Proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Hall edge states in proximity to a superconductor (SC) usually acquire a non-quantized electron-to-hole conversion probability in transport, due to non-universal SC couplings and disorders. With counter-propagating modes, we show that the situation can be the opposite in the $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall (FQH) edge states with SC proximity, where disordered SC-couplings can reconstruct the edge states into an infinite set of stable phases with quantized electron-to-hole conversion probability along a long edge. Each phase is dominated by a disordered SC-coupling that tunnels $\pm |q_N|$ Cooper pairs, which can take values $|q_N|=1, 4, 15$, etc. We predict that this gives rise to a quantized downstream resistance $R_d = h/(2q^2_Ne^2)$ in an FQH-SC junction, serving as a quantized electrical transport signature beyond the Hall conductance. Higher-order nonlinear transport due to irrelevant Cooper pair tunneling or vortex dissipation is further studied, which becomes dominant when the edge is in a normal phase. Our results apply to both the single-layer state (as a particle-hole conjugate of $\nu=1/3$) and the bilayer Halperin-(112) state, revealing a rich landscape of disorder-stabilized phases in FQH edge states with SC proximity, and may as well apply to fractional Chern insulators recently observed at the same filling.</description>

      <title>Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets on the triangular lattice</title>

Abstract: Variational Monte Carlo simulations have been crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems, especially when the Hamiltonian is frustrated and the ground-state wavefunction has a non-trivial sign structure. In this paper, we use recurrent neural network (RNN) wavefunction ans\"{a}tze to study the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (TLAHM) for lattice sizes up to $30\times30$. In a recent study [M. S. Moss et al. arXiv:2502.17144], the authors demonstrated how RNN wavefunctions can be iteratively retrained in order to obtain variational results for multiple lattice sizes with a reasonable amount of compute. That study, which looked at the sign-free, square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, showed favorable scaling properties, allowing accurate finite-size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, our present results illustrate in detail the relative difficulty in simulating the sign-problematic TLAHM. We find that the accuracy of our simulations can be significantly improved by transforming the Hamiltonian with a judicious choice of basis rotation. We also show that a similar benefit can be achieved by using variational neural annealing, an alternative optimization technique that minimizes a pseudo free energy. Ultimately, we are able to obtain estimates of the ground-state properties of the TLAHM in the thermodynamic limit that are in close agreement with values in the literature, showing that RNN wavefunctions provide a powerful toolbox for performing finite-size scaling studies for frustrated quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Amplitude equations of associative memory patterns in spatially distributed systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolution equations of the amplitudes of heterogeneous states (associative memories) stored in the connectivity of distributed systems with non-local interactions are derived. The resulting system of coupled amplitude equations describes the spatio-temporal dynamics of memory recall. It is shown that these types of distributed systems perform pattern completion and selection, and that short-range connections afford spatio-temporal memory pattern dynamics taking the form of patterning fronts.</description>
