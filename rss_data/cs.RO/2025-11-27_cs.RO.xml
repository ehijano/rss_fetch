      <title>OVAL-Grasp: Open-Vocabulary Affordance Localization for Task Oriented Grasping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To manipulate objects in novel, unstructured environments, robots need task-oriented grasps that target object parts based on the given task. Geometry-based methods often struggle with visually defined parts, occlusions, and unseen objects. We introduce OVAL-Grasp, a zero-shot open-vocabulary approach to task-oriented, affordance based grasping that uses large-language models and vision-language models to allow a robot to grasp objects at the correct part according to a given task. Given an RGB image and a task, OVAL-Grasp identifies parts to grasp or avoid with an LLM, segments them with a VLM, and generates a 2D heatmap of actionable regions on the object. During our evaluations, we found that our method outperformed two task oriented grasping baselines on experiments with 20 household objects with 3 unique tasks for each. OVAL-Grasp successfully identifies and segments the correct object part 95% of the time and grasps the correct actionable area 78.3% of the time in real-world experiments with the Fetch mobile manipulator. Additionally, OVAL-Grasp finds correct object parts under partial occlusions, demonstrating a part selection success rate of 80% in cluttered scenes. We also demonstrate OVAL-Grasp's efficacy in scenarios that rely on visual features for part selection, and show the benefit of a modular design through our ablation experiments.

      <title>NOIR 2.0: Neural Signal Operated Intelligent Robots for Everyday Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Signal Operated Intelligent Robots (NOIR) system is a versatile brain-robot interface that allows humans to control robots for daily tasks using their brain signals. This interface utilizes electroencephalography (EEG) to translate human intentions regarding specific objects and desired actions directly into commands that robots can execute. We present NOIR 2.0, an enhanced version of NOIR. NOIR 2.0 includes faster and more accurate brain decoding algorithms, which reduce task completion time by 46%. NOIR 2.0 uses few-shot robot learning algorithms to adapt to individual users and predict their intentions. The new learning algorithms leverage foundation models for more sample-efficient learning and adaptation (15 demos vs. a single demo), significantly reducing overall human time by 65%.</description>

      <title>ACE-F: A Cross Embodiment Foldable System with Force Feedback for Dexterous Teleoperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleoperation systems are essential for efficiently collecting diverse and high-quality robot demonstration data, especially for complex, contact-rich tasks. However, current teleoperation platforms typically lack integrated force feedback, cross-embodiment generalization, and portable, user-friendly designs, limiting their practical deployment. To address these limitations, we introduce ACE-F, a cross embodiment foldable teleoperation system with integrated force feedback. Our approach leverages inverse kinematics (IK) combined with a carefully designed human-robot interface (HRI), enabling users to capture precise and high-quality demonstrations effortlessly. We further propose a generalized soft-controller pipeline integrating PD control and inverse dynamics to ensure robot safety and precise motion control across diverse robotic embodiments. Critically, to achieve cross-embodiment generalization of force feedback without additional sensors, we innovatively interpret end-effector positional deviations as virtual force signals, which enhance data collection and enable applications in imitation learning. Extensive teleoperation experiments confirm that ACE-F significantly simplifies the control of various robot embodiments, making dexterous manipulation tasks as intuitive as operating a computer mouse.

      <title>Efficient Greedy Algorithms for Feature Selection in Robot Visual Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot localization is a fundamental component of autonomous navigation in unknown environments. Among various sensing modalities, visual input from cameras plays a central role, enabling robots to estimate their position by tracking point features across image frames. However, image frames often contain a large number of features, many of which are redundant or uninformative for localization. Processing all features can introduce significant computational latency and inefficiency. This motivates the need for intelligent feature selection, identifying a subset of features that are most informative for localization over a prediction horizon. In this work, we propose two fast and memory-efficient feature selection algorithms that enable robots to actively evaluate the utility of visual features in real time. Unlike existing approaches with high computational and memory demands, the proposed methods are explicitly designed to reduce both time and memory complexity while achieving a favorable trade-off between computational efficiency and localization accuracy.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Test-Time Compute Scaling in Control Policy: Difficulty-Aware Stochastic Interpolant Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based policies deliver state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon robotic manipulation and imitation learning tasks. However, these controllers employ a fixed inference budget at every control step, regardless of task complexity, leading to computational inefficiency for simple subtasks while potentially underperforming on challenging ones. To address these issues, we introduce Difficulty-Aware Stochastic Interpolant Policy (DA-SIP), a framework that enables robotic controllers to adaptively adjust their integration horizon in real time based on task difficulty. Our approach employs a difficulty classifier that analyzes observations to dynamically select the step budget, the optimal solver variant, and ODE/SDE integration at each control cycle. DA-SIP builds upon the stochastic interpolant formulation to provide a unified framework that unlocks diverse training and inference configurations for diffusion- and flow-based policies. Through comprehensive benchmarks across diverse manipulation tasks, DA-SIP achieves 2.6-4.4x reduction in total computation time while maintaining task success rates comparable to fixed maximum-computation baselines. By implementing adaptive computation within this framework, DA-SIP transforms generative robot controllers into efficient, task-aware systems that intelligently allocate inference resources where they provide the greatest benefit.</description>

      <title>AerialMind: Towards Referring Multi-Object Tracking in UAV Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to achieve precise object detection and tracking through natural language instructions, representing a fundamental capability for intelligent robotic systems. However, current RMOT research remains mostly confined to ground-level scenarios, which constrains their ability to capture broad-scale scene contexts and perform comprehensive tracking and path planning. In contrast, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) leverage their expansive aerial perspectives and superior maneuverability to enable wide-area surveillance. Moreover, UAVs have emerged as critical platforms for Embodied Intelligence, which has given rise to an unprecedented demand for intelligent aerial systems capable of natural language interaction. To this end, we introduce AerialMind, the first large-scale RMOT benchmark in UAV scenarios, which aims to bridge this research gap. To facilitate its construction, we develop an innovative semi-automated collaborative agent-based labeling assistant (COALA) framework that significantly reduces labor costs while maintaining annotation quality. Furthermore, we propose HawkEyeTrack (HETrack), a novel method that collaboratively enhances vision-language representation learning and improves the perception of UAV scenarios. Comprehensive experiments validated the challenging nature of our dataset and the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive and Cost-Aware Visual-Inertial Odometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) is a critical component for robust ego-motion estimation, enabling foundational capabilities such as autonomous navigation in robotics and real-time 6-DoF tracking for augmented reality. Existing methods face a well-known trade-off: filter-based approaches are efficient but prone to drift, while optimization-based methods, though accurate, rely on computationally prohibitive Visual-Inertial Bundle Adjustment (VIBA) that is difficult to run on resource-constrained platforms. Rather than removing VIBA altogether, we aim to reduce how often and how heavily it must be invoked. To this end, we cast two key design choices in modern VIO, when to run the visual frontend and how strongly to trust its output, as sequential decision problems, and solve them with lightweight reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Our framework introduces a lightweight, dual-pronged RL policy that serves as our core contribution: (1) a Select Agent intelligently gates the entire VO pipeline based only on high-frequency IMU data; and (2) a composite Fusion Agent that first estimates a robust velocity state via a supervised network, before an RL policy adaptively fuses the full (p, v, q) state. Experiments on the EuRoC MAV and TUM-VI datasets show that, in our unified evaluation, the proposed method achieves a more favorable accuracy-efficiency-memory trade-off than prior GPU-based VO/VIO systems: it attains the best average ATE while running up to 1.77 times faster and using less GPU memory. Compared to classical optimization-based VIO systems, our approach maintains competitive trajectory accuracy while substantially reducing computational load.</description>

      <title>SocialNav: Training Human-Inspired Foundation Model for Socially-Aware Embodied Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied navigation that adheres to social norms remains an open research challenge. Our \textbf{SocialNav} is a foundational model for socially-aware navigation with a hierarchical "brain-action" architecture, capable of understanding high-level social norms and generating low-level, socially compliant trajectories. To enable such dual capabilities, we construct the SocNav Dataset, a large-scale collection of 7 million samples, comprising (1) a Cognitive Activation Dataset providing social reasoning signals such as chain-of-thought explanations and social traversability prediction, and (2) an Expert Trajectories Pyramid aggregating diverse navigation demonstrations from internet videos, simulated environments, and real-world robots. A multi-stage training pipeline is proposed to gradually inject and refine navigation intelligence: we first inject general navigation skills and social norms understanding into the model via imitation learning, and then refine such skills through a deliberately designed Socially-Aware Flow Exploration GRPO (SAFE-GRPO), the first flow-based reinforcement learning framework for embodied navigation that explicitly rewards socially compliant behaviors. SocialNav achieves +38% success rate and +46% social compliance rate compared to the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating strong gains in both navigation performance and social compliance.

      <title>Maglev-Pentabot: Magnetic Levitation System for Non-Contact Manipulation using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-contact manipulation has emerged as a transformative approach across various industrial fields. However, current flexible 2D and 3D non-contact manipulation techniques are often limited to microscopic scales, typically controlling objects in the milligram range. In this paper, we present a magnetic levitation system, termed Maglev-Pentabot, designed to address this limitation. The Maglev-Pentabot leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to develop complex control strategies for manipulating objects in the gram range. Specifically, we propose an electromagnet arrangement optimized through numerical analysis to maximize controllable space. Additionally, an action remapping method is introduced to address sample sparsity issues caused by the strong nonlinearity in magnetic field intensity, hence allowing the DRL controller to converge. Experimental results demonstrate flexible manipulation capabilities, and notably, our system can generalize to transport tasks it has not been explicitly trained for. Furthermore, our approach can be scaled to manipulate heavier objects using larger electromagnets, offering a reference framework for industrial-scale robotic applications.</description>

      <title>MarketGen: A Scalable Simulation Platform with Auto-Generated Embodied Supermarket Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of embodied agents for complex commercial environments is hindered by a critical gap in existing robotics datasets and benchmarks, which primarily focus on household or tabletop settings with short-horizon tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce MarketGen, a scalable simulation platform with automatic scene generation for complex supermarket environments. MarketGen features a novel agent-based Procedural Content Generation (PCG) framework. It uniquely supports multi-modal inputs (text and reference images) and integrates real-world design principles to automatically generate complete, structured, and realistic supermarkets. We also provide an extensive and diverse 3D asset library with a total of 1100+ supermarket goods and parameterized facilities assets. Building on this generative foundation, we propose a novel benchmark for assessing supermarket agents, featuring two daily tasks in a supermarket: (1) Checkout Unloading: long-horizon tabletop tasks for cashier agents, and (2) In-Aisle Item Collection: complex mobile manipulation tasks for salesperson agents. We validate our platform and benchmark through extensive experiments, including the deployment of a modular agent system and successful sim-to-real transfer. MarketGen provides a comprehensive framework to accelerate research in embodied AI for complex commercial applications.</description>

      <title>Kinematics-Aware Multi-Policy Reinforcement Learning for Force-Capable Humanoid Loco-Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humanoid robots, with their human-like morphology, hold great potential for industrial applications. However, existing loco-manipulation methods primarily focus on dexterous manipulation, falling short of the combined requirements for dexterity and proactive force interaction in high-load industrial scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework with a decoupled three-stage training pipeline, consisting of an upper-body policy, a lower-body policy, and a delta-command policy. To accelerate upper-body training, a heuristic reward function is designed. By implicitly embedding forward kinematics priors, it enables the policy to converge faster and achieve superior performance. For the lower body, a force-based curriculum learning strategy is developed, enabling the robot to actively exert and regulate interaction forces with the environment.</description>

      <title>Dual Preintegration for Relative State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative State Estimation perform mutually localization between two mobile agents undergoing six-degree-of-freedom motion. Based on the principle of circular motion, the estimation accuracy is sensitive to nonlinear rotations of the reference platform, particularly under large inter-platform distances. This phenomenon is even obvious for linearized kinematics, because cumulative linearization errors significantly degrade precision. In virtual reality (VR) applications, this manifests as substantial positional errors in 6-DoF controller tracking during rapid rotations of the head-mounted display. The linearization errors introduce drift in the estimate and render the estimator inconsistent. In the field of odometry, IMU preintegration is proposed as a kinematic observation to enable efficient relinearization, thus mitigate linearized error. Building on this theory, we propose dual preintegration, a novel observation integrating IMU preintegration from both platforms. This method serves as kinematic constraints for consecutive relative state and supports efficient relinearization. We also perform observability analysis of the state and analytically formulate the accordingly null space. Algorithm evaluation encompasses both simulations and real-world experiments. Multiple nonlinear rotations on the reference platform are simulated to compare the precision of the proposed method with that of other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. The field test compares the proposed method and SOTA algorithms in the application of VR controller tracking from the perspectives of bias observability, nonlinear rotation, and background texture. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is more precise and robust than the SOTA algorithms.</description>

      <title>Transformer Driven Visual Servoing and Dual Arm Impedance Control for Fabric Texture Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to align and place a fabric piece on top of another using a dual-arm manipulator and a grayscale camera, so that their surface textures are accurately matched. We propose a novel control scheme that combines Transformer-driven visual servoing with dualarm impedance control. This approach enables the system to simultaneously control the pose of the fabric piece and place it onto the underlying one while applying tension to keep the fabric piece flat. Our transformer-based network incorporates pretrained backbones and a newly introduced Difference Extraction Attention Module (DEAM), which significantly enhances pose difference prediction accuracy. Trained entirely on synthetic images generated using rendering software, the network enables zero-shot deployment in real-world scenarios without requiring prior training on specific fabric textures. Real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed system accurately aligns fabric pieces with different textures.</description>

      <title>Sampling-Based Optimization with Parallelized Physics Simulator for Bimanual Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, dual-arm manipulation has become an area of strong interest in robotics, with end-to-end learning emerging as the predominant strategy for solving bimanual tasks. A critical limitation of such learning-based approaches, however, is their difficulty in generalizing to novel scenarios, especially within cluttered environments. This paper presents an alternative paradigm: a sampling-based optimization framework that utilizes a GPU-accelerated physics simulator as its world model. We demonstrate that this approach can solve complex bimanual manipulation tasks in the presence of static obstacles. Our contribution is a customized Model Predictive Path Integral Control (MPPI) algorithm, \textbf{guided by carefully designed task-specific cost functions,} that uses GPU-accelerated MuJoCo for efficiently evaluating robot-object interaction. We apply this method to solve significantly more challenging versions of tasks from the PerAct$^{2}$ benchmark, such as requiring the point-to-point transfer of a ball through an obstacle course. Furthermore, we establish that our method achieves real-time performance on commodity GPUs and facilitates successful sim-to-real transfer by leveraging unique features within MuJoCo. The paper concludes with a statistical analysis of the sample complexity and robustness, quantifying the performance of our approach.

      <title>Improvement of Collision Avoidance in Cut-In Maneuvers Using Time-to-Collision Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new strategy for collision avoidance system leveraging Time-to-Collision (TTC) metrics for handling cut-in scenarios, which are particularly challenging for autonomous vehicles (AVs). By integrating a deep learning with TTC calculations, the system predicts potential collisions and determines appropriate evasive actions compared to traditional TTC -based approaches.</description>

      <title>Neural NMPC through Signed Distance Field Encoding for Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a neural Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) framework for mapless, collision-free navigation in unknown environments with Aerial Robots, using onboard range sensing. We leverage deep neural networks to encode a single range image, capturing all the available information about the environment, into a Signed Distance Function (SDF). The proposed neural architecture consists of two cascaded networks: a convolutional encoder that compresses the input image into a low-dimensional latent vector, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron that approximates the corresponding spatial SDF. This latter network parametrizes an explicit position constraint used for collision avoidance, which is embedded in a velocity-tracking NMPC that outputs thrust and attitude commands to the robot. First, a theoretical analysis of the contributed NMPC is conducted, verifying recursive feasibility and stability properties under fixed observations. Subsequently, we evaluate the open-loop performance of the learning-based components as well as the closed-loop performance of the controller in simulations and experiments. The simulation study includes an ablation study, comparisons with two state-of-the-art local navigation methods, and an assessment of the resilience to drifting odometry. The real-world experiments are conducted in forest environments, demonstrating that the neural NMPC effectively performs collision avoidance in cluttered settings against an adversarial reference velocity input and drifting position estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An autonomous robotic nut tightening system for a serial manipulator equipped with a parallel gripper is proposed. The system features a hierarchical motion-primitive-based planner and a control-switching scheme that alternates between force and position control. Extensive simulations demonstrate the system's robustness to variance in initial conditions. Additionally, the proposed controller tightens threaded screws 14% faster than the baseline while applying 40 times less contact force on manipulands. For the benefit of the research community, the system's implementation is open-sourced.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{E}_0$: Enhancing Generalization and Fine-Grained Control in VLA Models via Continuized Discrete Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a unified framework for robotic manipulation by integrating visual perception, language understanding, and control generation. Yet existing VLA models still struggle to generalize across diverse tasks, scenes, and camera viewpoints, and often produce coarse or unstable actions. We introduce E0, a continuized discrete diffusion framework that formulates action generation as iterative denoising over quantized action tokens. Compared with continuous diffusion policies, E0 offers two key advantages: (1) discrete action tokens align naturally with the symbolic structure of pretrained VLM/VLA backbones, enabling stronger semantic conditioning; and 2. discrete diffusion matches the true quantized nature of real-world robot control-whose hardware constraints (e.g., encoder resolution, control frequency, actuation latency) inherently discretize continuous signals-and therefore benefits from a Bayes-optimal denoiser that models the correct discrete action distribution, leading to stronger generalization. Compared with discrete autoregressive and mask-based discrete diffusion models, E0 supports a significantly larger and finer-grained action vocabulary and avoids the distributional mismatch introduced by masking-based corruptions-yielding more accurate fine-grained action control. We further introduce a spherical viewpoint perturbation augmentation method to improve robustness to camera shifts without additional data. Experiments on LIBERO, VLABench, and ManiSkill show that E0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 diverse environments, outperforming strong baselines by 10.7% on average. Real-world evaluation on a Franka arm confirms that E0 delivers precise, robust, and transferable manipulation, establishing discrete diffusion as a promising direction for generalizable VLA policy learning.</description>

      <title>VacuumVLA: Boosting VLA Capabilities via a Unified Suction and Gripping Tool for Complex Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Language Action models have significantly advanced general purpose robotic manipulation by harnessing large scale pretrained vision and language representations. Among existing approaches, a majority of current VLA systems employ parallel two finger grippers as their default end effectors. However, such grippers face inherent limitations in handling certain real world tasks such as wiping glass surfaces or opening drawers without handles due to insufficient contact area or lack of adhesion. To overcome these challenges, we present a low cost, integrated hardware design that combines a mechanical two finger gripper with a vacuum suction unit, enabling dual mode manipulation within a single end effector. Our system supports flexible switching or synergistic use of both modalities, expanding the range of feasible tasks. We validate the efficiency and practicality of our design within two state of the art VLA frameworks: DexVLA and Pi0. Experimental results demonstrate that with the proposed hybrid end effector, robots can successfully perform multiple complex tasks that are infeasible for conventional two finger grippers alone. All hardware designs and controlling systems will be released.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Policy Adaptation for Closed-Loop End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving models have demonstrated strong performance in open-loop evaluations but often suffer from cascading errors and poor generalization in closed-loop settings. To address this gap, we propose Model-based Policy Adaptation (MPA), a general framework that enhances the robustness and safety of pretrained E2E driving agents during deployment. MPA first generates diverse counterfactual trajectories using a geometry-consistent simulation engine, exposing the agent to scenarios beyond the original dataset. Based on this generated data, MPA trains a diffusion-based policy adapter to refine the base policy's predictions and a multi-step Q value model to evaluate long-term outcomes. At inference time, the adapter proposes multiple trajectory candidates, and the Q value model selects the one with the highest expected utility. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark using a photorealistic closed-loop simulator demonstrate that MPA significantly improves performance across in-domain, out-of-domain, and safety-critical scenarios. We further investigate how the scale of counterfactual data and inference-time guidance strategies affect overall effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Visual Object Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty of an object's pose estimate is essential for robust control and planning. Although pose estimation is a well-studied robotics problem, attaching statistically rigorous uncertainty is not well understood without strict distributional assumptions. We develop distribution-free pose uncertainty bounds about a given pose estimate in the monocular setting. Our pose uncertainty only requires high probability noise bounds on pixel detections of 2D semantic keypoints on a known object. This noise model induces an implicit, non-convex set of pose uncertainty constraints. Our key contribution is SLUE (S-Lemma Uncertainty Estimation), a convex program to reduce this set to a single ellipsoidal uncertainty bound that is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. SLUE solves a relaxation of the minimum volume bounding ellipsoid problem inspired by the celebrated S-lemma. It requires no initial guess of the bound's shape or size and is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. For tighter uncertainty bounds at the same confidence, we extend SLUE to a sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy which is guaranteed to converge to the minimum volume ellipsoidal uncertainty bound for a given set of keypoint constraints. We show this pose uncertainty bound can easily be projected to independent translation and axis-angle orientation bounds. We evaluate SLUE on two pose estimation datasets and a real-world drone tracking scenario. Compared to prior work, SLUE generates substantially smaller translation bounds and competitive orientation bounds. We release code at https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/PoseUncertaintySets.</description>

      <title>TraceGen: World Modeling in 3D Trace Space Enables Learning from Cross-Embodiment Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning new robot tasks on new platforms and in new scenes from only a handful of demonstrations remains challenging. While videos of other embodiments - humans and different robots - are abundant, differences in embodiment, camera, and environment hinder their direct use. We address the small-data problem by introducing a unifying, symbolic representation - a compact 3D "trace-space" of scene-level trajectories - that enables learning from cross-embodiment, cross-environment, and cross-task videos. We present TraceGen, a world model that predicts future motion in trace-space rather than pixel space, abstracting away appearance while retaining the geometric structure needed for manipulation. To train TraceGen at scale, we develop TraceForge, a data pipeline that transforms heterogeneous human and robot videos into consistent 3D traces, yielding a corpus of 123K videos and 1.8M observation-trace-language triplets. Pretraining on this corpus produces a transferable 3D motion prior that adapts efficiently: with just five target robot videos, TraceGen attains 80% success across four tasks while offering 50-600x faster inference than state-of-the-art video-based world models. In the more challenging case where only five uncalibrated human demonstration videos captured on a handheld phone are available, it still reaches 67.5% success on a real robot, highlighting TraceGen's ability to adapt across embodiments without relying on object detectors or heavy pixel-space generation.</description>

      <title>DeeAD: Dynamic Early Exit of Vision-Language Action for Efficient Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (&lt;2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.</description>

      <title>ENACT: Evaluating Embodied Cognition with World Modeling of Egocentric Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

      <title>Dataset Poisoning Attacks on Behavioral Cloning Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is a popular framework for training sequential decision policies from expert demonstrations via supervised learning. As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

      <title>Design and Measurements of mmWave FMCW Radar Based Non-Contact Multi-Patient Heart Rate and Breath Rate Monitoring System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in mmWave radar technologies have enabled the truly non-contact heart-rate (HR) and breath-rate (BR) measurement approaches, which provides a great ease in patient monitoring. Additionally, these technologies also provide opportunities to simultaneously detect HR and BR of multiple patients, which has become increasingly important for efficient mass monitoring scenarios. In this work, a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) mmWave radar based truly non-contact multiple patient HR and BR monitoring system has been presented. Furthermore, a novel approach is also proposed, which combines multiple processing methods using a least squares solution to improve measurement accuracy, generalization, and handle measurement error. The proposed system has been developed using Texas Instruments' FMCW radar and experimental results with multiple subjects are also presented, which show &gt;97% and &gt;93% accuracy in the measured BR and HR values, respectively.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multisubject Vital Sign Monitoring With mmWave FMCW Radar and FPGA Prototyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an innovative approach to estimate the vital signs of multiple human subjects simultaneously in a non-contact way using a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar-based system. Traditional vital sign monitoring methods often face significant limitations, including subject discomfort with wearable devices, challenges in calibration, and the risk of infection transmission through contact measurement devices. To address these issues, this research is motivated by the need for versatile, non-contact vital monitoring solutions applicable in various critical scenarios. This work also explores the challenges of extending this capability to an arbitrary number of subjects, including hardware and theoretical limitations. Supported by rigorous experimental results and discussions, the paper illustrates the system's potential to redefine vital sign monitoring. An FPGA-based implementation is also presented as proof of concept for a hardware-based and portable solution, improving upon previous works by offering 2.7x faster execution and 18.4% less Look-Up Table (LUT) utilization, as well as providing over 7400x acceleration compared to its software counterpart.</description>

      <title>Predictive Safety Shield for Dyna-Q Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining safety guarantees for reinforcement learning is a major challenge to achieve applicability for real-world tasks. Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions. In this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space. Our safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model. This shielding approach improves performance while maintaining hard safety guarantees. Our experiments on gridworld environments demonstrate that even short prediction horizons can be sufficient to identify the optimal path. We observe that our approach is robust to distribution shifts, e.g., between simulation and reality, without requiring additional training.</description>

      <title>Safety Control of Service Robots with LLMs and Embodied Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety limitations in service robotics across various industries have raised significant concerns about the need for robust mechanisms ensuring that robots adhere to safe practices, thereby preventing actions that might harm humans or cause property damage. Despite advances, including the integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges in ensuring consistent safety in autonomous robot actions persist. In this paper, we propose a novel integration of Large Language Models with Embodied Robotic Control Prompts (ERCPs) and Embodied Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) to enhance the safety framework for service robots. ERCPs are designed as predefined instructions that ensure LLMs generate safe and precise responses. These responses are subsequently validated by EKGs, which provide a comprehensive knowledge base ensuring that the actions of the robot are continuously aligned with safety protocols, thereby promoting safer operational practices in varied contexts. Our experimental setup involved diverse real-world tasks, where robots equipped with our framework demonstrated significantly higher compliance with safety standards compared to traditional methods. This integration fosters secure human-robot interactions and positions our methodology at the forefront of AI-driven safety innovations in service robotics.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Multi-robot Task Allocation for Long-Endurance Missions in Dynamic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) in heterogeneous teams performing long-endurance missions in dynamic scenarios. Given the limited battery of robots, especially for aerial vehicles, we allow for robot recharges and the possibility of fragmenting and/or relaying certain tasks. We also address tasks that must be performed by a coalition of robots in a coordinated manner. Given these features, we introduce a new class of heterogeneous MRTA problems which we analyze theoretically and optimally formulate as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program. We then contribute a heuristic algorithm to compute approximate solutions and integrate it into a mission planning and execution architecture capable of reacting to unexpected events by repairing or recomputing plans online. Our experimental results show the relevance of our newly formulated problem in a realistic use case for inspection with aerial robots. We assess the performance of our heuristic solver in comparison with other variants and with exact optimal solutions in small-scale scenarios. In addition, we evaluate the ability of our replanning framework to repair plans online.</description>

      <title>Steering Flexible Linear Objects in Planar Environments by Two Robot Hands Using Euler's Elastica Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The manipulation of flexible objects such as cables, wires and fresh food items by robot hands forms a special challenge in robot grasp mechanics. This paper considers the steering of flexible linear objects in planar environments by two robot hands. The flexible linear object, modeled as an elastic non-stretchable rod, is manipulated by varying the gripping endpoint positions while keeping equal endpoint tangents. The flexible linear object shape has a closed form solution in terms of the grasp endpoint positions and tangents, called Euler's elastica. This paper obtains the elastica solutions under the optimal control framework, then uses the elastica solutions to obtain closed-form criteria for non self-intersection, stability and obstacle avoidance of the flexible linear object. The new tools are incorporated into a planning scheme for steering flexible linear objects in planar environments populated by sparsely spaced obstacles. The scheme is fully implemented and demonstrated with detailed examples.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Safe Trajectory Planning over Diverse Scenes through Diffusion Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safe trajectory planning in complex environments must balance stringent collision avoidance with real-time efficiency, which is a long-standing challenge in robotics. In this work, we present a diffusion-based trajectory planning framework that is both rapid and safe. First, we introduce a scene-agnostic, MPC-based data generation pipeline that efficiently produces large volumes of kinematically feasible trajectories. Building on this dataset, our integrated diffusion planner maps raw onboard sensor inputs directly to kinematically feasible trajectories, enabling efficient inference while maintaining strong collision avoidance. To generalize to diverse, previously unseen scenarios, we compose diffusion models at test time, enabling safe behavior without additional training. We further propose a lightweight, rule-based safety filter that, from the candidate set, selects the trajectory meeting safety and kinematic-feasibility requirements. Across seen and unseen settings, the proposed method delivers real-time-capable inference with high safety and stability. Experiments on an F1TENTH vehicle demonstrate practicality on real hardware.

      <title>X-Nav: Learning End-to-End Cross-Embodiment Navigation for Mobile Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing navigation methods are primarily designed for specific robot embodiments, limiting their generalizability across diverse robot platforms. In this paper, we introduce X-Nav, a novel framework for end-to-end cross-embodiment navigation where a single unified policy can be deployed across various embodiments for both wheeled and quadrupedal robots. X-Nav consists of two learning stages: 1) multiple expert policies are trained using deep reinforcement learning with privileged observations on a wide range of randomly generated robot embodiments; and 2) a single general policy is distilled from the expert policies via navigation action chunking with transformer (Nav-ACT). The general policy directly maps visual and proprioceptive observations to low-level control commands, enabling generalization to novel robot embodiments. Simulated experiments demonstrated that X-Nav achieved zero-shot transfer to both unseen embodiments and photorealistic environments. A scalability study showed that the performance of X-Nav improves when trained with an increasing number of randomly generated embodiments. An ablation study confirmed the design choices of X-Nav. Furthermore, real-world experiments were conducted to validate the generalizability of X-Nav in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>MonoMPC: Monocular Vision Based Navigation with Learned Collision Model and Risk-Aware Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigating unknown environments with a single RGB camera is challenging, as the lack of depth information prevents reliable collision-checking. While some methods use estimated depth to build collision maps, we found that depth estimates from vision foundation models are too noisy for zero-shot navigation in cluttered environments. We propose an alternative approach: instead of using noisy estimated depth for direct collision-checking, we use it as a rich context input to a learned collision model. This model predicts the distribution of minimum obstacle clearance that the robot can expect for a given control sequence. At inference, these predictions inform a risk-aware MPC planner that minimizes estimated collision risk. We proposed a joint learning pipeline that co-trains the collision model and risk metric using both safe and unsafe trajectories. Crucially, our joint-training ensures well calibrated uncertainty in our collision model that improves navigation in highly cluttered environments. Consequently, real-world experiments show reductions in collision-rate and improvements in goal reaching and speed over several strong baselines.</description>

      <title>Analytical Solvers for Common Algebraic Equations Arising in Kinematics Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents analytical solvers for four common types of algebraic equations encountered in robot kinematics: single trigonometric equations, single-angle trigonometric systems, two-angle trigonometric systems, and bilinear two-angle systems. These equations arise frequently in the kinematics problems, particularly in robot kinematics. We provide detailed solution methods, including closed-form expressions, numerical algorithms, and robustness considerations. The solvers are designed to handle general coefficients, manage singularities, and enumerate all real solutions efficiently. These solvers are implemented in Python packages and can be reproduced by prompting Language Lanuage Models. Sampe prompts are also provided in the public code space Github repo. These prompts can generate a working solver code with one single prompt in coding agent such as OpenAI's Codex 5.1. This work serves as a foundation for developing complete inverse kinematics solvers for various robot architectures. Extensive validation and benchmarking demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Calibration of Noise Covariance and Kinematics for State Estimation of Legged Robots via Bi-level Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate state estimation is critical for legged and aerial robots operating in dynamic, uncertain environments. A key challenge lies in specifying process and measurement noise covariances, which are typically unknown or manually tuned. In this work, we introduce a bi-level optimization framework that jointly calibrates covariance matrices and kinematic parameters in an estimator-in-the-loop manner. The upper level treats noise covariances and model parameters as optimization variables, while the lower level executes a full-information estimator. Differentiating through the estimator allows direct optimization of trajectory-level objectives, resulting in accurate and consistent state estimates. We validate our approach on quadrupedal and humanoid robots, demonstrating significantly improved estimation accuracy and uncertainty calibration compared to hand-tuned baselines. Our method unifies state estimation, sensor, and kinematics calibration into a principled, data-driven framework applicable across diverse robotic platforms.</description>

      <title>Floor Plan-Guided Visual Navigation Incorporating Depth and Directional Cues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Guiding an agent to a specific target in indoor environments based solely on RGB inputs and a floor plan is a promising yet challenging problem. Although existing methods have made significant progress, two challenges remain unresolved. First, the modality gap between egocentric RGB observations and the floor plan hinders the integration of visual and spatial information for both local obstacle avoidance and global planning. Second, accurate localization is critical for navigation performance, but remains challenging at deployment in unseen environments due to the lack of explicit geometric alignment between RGB inputs and floor plans. We propose a novel diffusion-based policy, denoted as GlocDiff, which integrates global path planning from the floor plan with local depth-aware features derived from RGB observations. The floor plan offers explicit global guidance, while the depth features provide implicit geometric cues, collectively enabling precise prediction of optimal navigation directions and robust obstacle avoidance. Moreover, GlocDiff introduces noise perturbation during training to enhance robustness against pose estimation errors, and we find that combining this with a relatively stable VO module during inference results in significantly improved navigation performance. Extensive experiments on the FloNa benchmark demonstrate GlocDiff's efficiency and effectiveness in achieving superior navigation performance, and the success of real-world deployments also highlights its potential for widespread practical applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Monocular Dense SLAM With 3D Reconstruction Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) aims to estimate a robot's pose while simultaneously reconstructing an unknown 3D scene using a single camera. While existing monocular SLAM systems generate detailed 3D geometry through dense scene representations, they are computationally expensive due to the need for iterative optimization. To address this challenge, MASt3R-SLAM utilizes learned 3D reconstruction priors, enabling more efficient and accurate estimation of both 3D structures and camera poses. However, MASt3R-SLAM is limited to single-agent operation. In this paper, we extend MASt3R-SLAM to introduce the first multi-agent monocular dense SLAM system. Each agent performs local SLAM using a 3D reconstruction prior, and their individual maps are fused into a globally consistent map through a loop-closure-based map fusion mechanism. Our approach improves computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining similar mapping accuracy when evaluated on real-world datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are becoming popular day by day not only for autonomous road traversal but also for industrial automation, farming and military. Most of the standard vehicles follow the Ackermann style steering mechanism. This has become to de facto standard for large and long faring vehicles. The local planner of an autonomous vehicle controls the low-level vehicle movement upon which the vehicle will perform its motor actuation. In our work, we focus on autonomous vehicles in road and perform experiments to analyze the effect of low-level controllers in the simulation and a real environment. To increase the precision and stability of trajectory tracking in autonomous cars, a novel method that combines lane identification with Model Predictive Control (MPC) is presented. The research focuses on camera-equipped autonomous vehicles and uses methods like edge recognition, sliding window-based straight-line identification for lane line extraction, and dynamic region of interest (ROI) extraction. Next, to follow the identified lane line, an MPC built on a bicycle vehicle dynamics model is created. A single-lane road simulation model is built using ROS Gazebo and tested in order to verify the controller's performance. The root mean square error between the optimal tracking trajectory and the target trajectory was reduced by 27.65% in the simulation results, demonstrating the high robustness and flexibility of the developed controller.</description>

      <title>MAPF-HD: Multi-Agent Path Finding in High-Density Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) involves planning efficient paths for multiple agents to move simultaneously while avoiding collisions. In typical warehouse environments, agents are often sparsely distributed along aisles; however, increasing the agent density can improve space efficiency. When the agent density is high, it becomes necessary to optimize the paths not only for goal-assigned agents but also for those obstructing them. This study proposes a novel MAPF framework for high-density environments (MAPF-HD). Several studies have explored MAPF in similar settings using integer linear programming (ILP). However, ILP-based methods require substantial computation time to optimize all agent paths simultaneously. Even in small grid-based environments with fewer than $100$ cells, these computations can take tens to hundreds of seconds. Such high computational costs render these methods impractical for large-scale applications such as automated warehouses and valet parking. To address these limitations, we introduce the phased null-agent swapping (PHANS) method. PHANS employs a heuristic approach to incrementally swap positions between agents and empty vertices. This method solves the MAPF-HD problem within a few seconds, even in large environments containing more than $700$ cells. The proposed method has the potential to improve efficiency in various real-world applications such as warehouse logistics, traffic management, and crowd control. The implementation is available at https://github.com/ToyotaCRDL/MAPF-in-High-Density-Envs.</description>

      <title>scipy.spatial.transform: Differentiable Framework-Agnostic 3D Transformations in Python</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional rigid-body transforms, i.e. rotations and translations, are central to modern differentiable machine learning pipelines in robotics, vision, and simulation. However, numerically robust and mathematically correct implementations, particularly on SO(3), are error-prone due to issues such as axis conventions, normalizations, composition consistency and subtle errors that only appear in edge cases. SciPy's spatial$.$transform module is a rigorously tested Python implementation. However, it historically only supported NumPy, limiting adoption in GPU-accelerated and autodiff-based workflows. We present a complete overhaul of SciPy's spatial$.$transform functionality that makes it compatible with any array library implementing the Python array API, including JAX, PyTorch, and CuPy. The revised implementation preserves the established SciPy interface while enabling GPU/TPU execution, JIT compilation, vectorized batching, and differentiation via native autodiff of the chosen backend. We demonstrate how this foundation supports differentiable scientific computing through two case studies: (i) scalability of 3D transforms and rotations and (ii) a JAX drone simulation that leverages SciPy's Rotation for accurate integration of rotational dynamics. Our contributions have been merged into SciPy main and will ship in the next release, providing a framework-agnostic, production-grade basis for 3D spatial math in differentiable systems and ML.</description>

      <title>Connectivity-Preserving Multi-Agent Area Coverage via Optimal-Transport-Based Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems play a central role in area coverage tasks across search-and-rescue, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture. Achieving non-uniform coverage, where spatial priorities vary across the domain, requires coordinating agents while respecting dynamic and communication constraints. Density-driven approaches can distribute agents according to a prescribed reference density, but existing methods do not ensure connectivity. This limitation often leads to communication loss, reduced coordination, and degraded coverage performance.
  This letter introduces a connectivity-preserving extension of the Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework. The coverage objective, defined using the Wasserstein distance between the agent distribution and the reference density, admits a convex quadratic program formulation. Communication constraints are incorporated through a smooth connectivity penalty, which maintains strict convexity, supports distributed implementation, and preserves inter-agent communication without imposing rigid formations.
  Simulation studies show that the proposed method consistently maintains connectivity, improves convergence speed, and enhances non-uniform coverage quality compared with density-driven schemes that do not incorporate explicit connectivity considerations.</description>

      <title>BRIC: Bridging Kinematic Plans and Physical Control at Test Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose BRIC, a novel test-time adaptation (TTA) framework that enables long-term human motion generation by resolving execution discrepancies between diffusion-based kinematic motion planners and reinforcement learning-based physics controllers. While diffusion models can generate diverse and expressive motions conditioned on text and scene context, they often produce physically implausible outputs, leading to execution drift during simulation. To address this, BRIC dynamically adapts the physics controller to noisy motion plans at test time, while preserving pre-trained skills via a loss function that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. In addition, BRIC introduces a lightweight test-time guidance mechanism that steers the diffusion model in the signal space without updating its parameters. By combining both adaptation strategies, BRIC ensures consistent and physically plausible long-term executions across diverse environments in an effective and efficient manner. We validate the effectiveness of BRIC on a variety of long-term tasks, including motion composition, obstacle avoidance, and human-scene interaction, achieving state-of-the-art performance across all tasks.</description>
