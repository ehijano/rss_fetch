      <title>Theory of Linear Magnetoresistance in a Strange Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central puzzle in strongly correlated electronic phases is strange metallic transport, marked by $T$-linear resistivity and $B$-linear magnetoresistance, in sharp contrast with quadratic scalings observed in conventional metals. Here, we demonstrate that proximity to quantum critical points, a recurring motif in the phase diagrams of strange metal candidates, can explain both transport anomalies. We construct and solve a minimal microscopic model by coupling electronic excitations at the Fermi surface to quantum critical bosons via a spatially disordered Yukawa interaction, as well as static pinned domains of density wave order. The resultant transport relaxation rate scales as $k_B T/\hbar$ at low magnetic fields, and as an effective Bohr magneton $\tilde{\mu}_B B/\hbar$ at low temperatures. Further, the magnetoresistance in our model shows a scaling collapse upon rescaling the magnetic field and the resistance by temperature, in agreement with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Chiral vortex-line liquid of three-dimensional interacting Bose systems with moat dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate and investigate a novel quantum state, the Chiral Vortex-Line Liquid (CVLL), emerging in three-dimensional interacting Bose systems exhibiting moat-band dispersions. Such dispersions feature extensive degeneracy along closed manifolds in momentum space, significantly amplifying quantum fluctuations that suppress conventional Bose-Einstein condensation. By extending the two-dimensional Chern-Simons flux-attachment transformation to three dimensions through a combination of planar CS phases and Jordan-Wigner fermionization along vortex lines, we construct the CVLL state, characterized by nontrivial vortex-line excitations with topological properties. We develop an associated topological field theory in a curved spatial geometry and study the low-energy effective theory of the CVLL state. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we numerically determine the CVLL ground state's chemical potential for interacting bosons in cylindrical moat-band geometries and demonstrate that the CVLL phase energetically outcompetes traditional condensate phases at low densities, highlighting its relevance to experimental platforms including frustrated quantum magnets, ultracold atomic gases, physics of rotons in $^4$He, and moat regimes in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced orbital reordering in Na$_2$CuF$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-pressure behaviour of Na$_2$CuF$_4$ is explored by powder neutron diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A first-order phase transition is observed to take place between 2.4 - 2.9 GPa, involving a reorientation of the Jahn-Teller (JT) long axes of the (CuF6) octahedra (and therefore the d$_{z^2}$ Cu orbitals), in agreement with our DFT calculations which suggest a transition at 2.8 GPa. The transition can be described as being between a state of ferro-orbital order and one of A-type antiferro-orbital order, reflecting a shift in the associated electronic instability from being in the zone-center to zone boundary of the first Brillouin zone of the parent structure, with pressure. This change results in a decoupling of magnitude of the associated Jahn-Teller distortion of the Cu-F bond lengths from the lattice strain. This scenario is supported by our observations that the compressibility of the pre-transition phase is highly anisotropic, whilst in the post-transition phase it becomes almost isotropic, and that we observed no further decrease of the magnitude the JT distortion up to 5 GPa, or melting of the OO in our DFT calculations up to at least 5 GPa.</description>

      <title>Shaking and pushing skyrmions: Formation of a non-equilibrium phase with zero critical current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In three-dimensional chiral magnets, skyrmions are line-like objects oriented parallel to the applied magnetic field. The efficient coupling of magnetic skyrmion lattices to spin currents and magnetic fields permits their dynamical manipulation. Here, we explore the dynamics of skyrmion lattices when slowly oscillating the field direction by up to a few degrees on millisecond timescales while simultaneously pushing the skyrmion lattice by electric currents. The field oscillations induce a shaking of the orientation of the skyrmion lines, leading to a phase where the critical depinning current for translational motion vanishes. We measure the transverse susceptibility of MnSi to track various depinning phase transitions induced by currents, oscillating fields, or combinations thereof. An effective slip--stick model for the bending and motion of the skyrmion lines in the presence of disorder explains main features of the experiment and predicts the existence of several dynamical skyrmion lattice phases under shaking and pushing representing new phases of matter far from thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Minimal pole representation for spectral functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing spectral densities, real-frequency, and real-time Green's functions of continuous systems by a small discrete set of complex poles is an ubiquitous problem in condensed matter physics, with applications ranging from quantum transport simulations to the simulation of strongly correlated electron systems. This paper introduces a method for obtaining a compact, approximate representation of these functions, based on their parameterization on the real axis and a given approximate precision. We show applications to typical spectral functions and results for structured and unstructured correlation functions of model systems.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of the electronic Fermi liquid: a pedagogical overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over a hundred years, electron transport in conductive materials has been primarily described by the Drude model, which assumes that current flow is impeded primarily by momentum-relaxing collisions between electrons and extrinsic objects such as impurities or phonons. In the past decade, however, experiments have increasingly realized ultra-high quality electronic materials that demonstrate a qualitatively distinct method of charge transport called hydrodynamic flow. Hydrodynamic flow occurs when electrons collide much more frequently with each other than with anything else, and in this limit the electric current has long-wavelength collective behavior analogous to that of a classical fluid. While electron hydrodynamics has long been postulated theoretically for solid-state systems, the plethora of recent experimental realizations has reinvigorated the field. Here, we review recent theoretical and experimental progress in understanding hydrodynamic electrons using the (hydrodynamic) Fermi liquid as our prototypical example.</description>

      <title>Low-energy structure and topology of the two-band Hubbard-Kanamori model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Mott transition in a two-band Hubbard-Kanamori model using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) with the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and the Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG) as impurity solvers. Our study focuses on the case where the intraorbital and interorbital Coulomb interactions are equal (U = U2) and the Hund's coupling is absent (J = 0). Spectral analysis confirms the absence of an orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT), even in systems with significantly different bandwidths (t1 and t2 for the wide and narrow bands, respectively), indicating a simultaneous Mott transition in both bands. Notably, the NRG results reveal the emergence of a pseudo-gap-like feature and a central peak in the narrow band, whose characteristics depend on the hopping parameter t2. These spectral features may serve as precursors to OSMT in more realistic systems with finite Hund's coupling (J &gt; 0). Furthermore, in the Mott insulating phase, the self-energies of both bands diverge, suggesting that the Mott transition represents a topological phase transition. Our results highlight the crucial role of accurate impurity solvers in capturing the density of states and detailed spectral structures.</description>

      <title>Fully ergodic simulations using radial updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sensible application of the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method is often hindered by the presence of large - or even infinite - potential barriers. These potential barriers separate the configuration space into distinct sectors and can lead to ergodicity violations that bias measurements. In this work, we address this problem by augmenting HMC with a multiplicative Metropolis-Hastings update in a so-called ''radial direction'' of the fields which enables crossing the potential barriers and ensures ergodicity of the sampling algorithm at comparably low computational cost. We demonstrate the algorithm on a simple toy model and show how it can be applied to the fermionic Hubbard model describing physics ranging from an exactly-solvable two-site system to the $C_{20}H_{12}$ perylene molecule. Our numerical results show that the radial updates successfully remove ergodicity violations, while simultaneously reducing autocorrelation times.</description>

      <title>Introduction to dimensional reduction of fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive pedagogical introduction to the dimensional reduction protocol (DRP), a versatile framework for analyzing instabilities and critical points in interacting fermionic systems. The DRP simplifies the study of many-body problems by systematically reducing their effective spatial dimension while retaining essential physics. This method works for electron gases in a diverse array of settings: in any number of spatial dimensions, in the presence of Zeeman fields, with spin-orbit coupling, including repulsive or attractive interactions. Focusing on two-point correlation functions, the DRP identifies a minimal subspace relevant for capturing analytic properties, facilitating efficient computation of critical phenomena in electronic systems. This work outlines the assumptions, proof, and applications of the DRP, emphasizing its simplicity and broad applicability for future studies in correlated electron physics.</description>

      <title>Toroid, Altermagnetic and Noncentrosymmetric ordering in metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article is dedicated to the 60th anniversary of the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics and is a review of normal and superconducting properties of toroidal, altermagnetic and noncentrosymmetric metals. Metals with toroidal order are compounds with an electron spectrum that is asymmetric with respect to the reflection of the momentum. An electric current propagating through samples of such a material causes its magnetization. Superconducting states in toroidal metals are a mixture of singlet and triplet pair states. Superconductivity is gapless even in ideal crystals without impurities. Altermegnets are antiferromagnetic metals that have a specific splitting of electron bands determined by symmetry. In this respect, they are similar to metals whose symmetry does not have a spatial inversion operation. Both of these types of materials have an anomalous Hall effect. A current propagating through a noncentrosymmetric metal causes magnetization, but this is not the case in altermagnets. On the other hand, in altermagnets there is a specific piezomagnetic Hall effect. Superconducting pairing in non-centrosymmetric metals occurs between electrons occupying states in one zone, whereas in altermagnets we are dealing with interband pairing, which is unfavorable for the formation of a superconducting state.</description>

      <title>Topological Feature of Real-time Fisher Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are numerous methods to characterize topology and its boundary zero modes, yet their statistical mechanical properties have not received as much attention as other approaches. Here, we investigate the Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics of topological models, revealing that boundary zero modes can be described by an overlooked real-time Fisher zero pairing effect. This effect is validated in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Kitaev chain model, with the latter exhibiting a Fisher zero braiding picture. Topological zero modes exhibit robustness even when non-Hermiticity is introduced into the system and display characteristics of imaginary-time crystals when the energy eigenvalues are complex. We further examine the real-time Fisher zeros of the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, which maps to the Kitaev chain. We present a fractal picture of the Fisher zeros, illustrating how interactions eliminate topology. The mechanism of zero-pairing provides a natural statistical mechanical approach to understanding the connection between topology and many-body physics.</description>

      <title>A method to derive material-specific spin-bath model descriptions of materials displaying prevalent spin physics (for simulation on NISQ devices)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetism and spin physics are true quantum mechanical effects and their description usually requires multi reference methods and is often hidden in the standard description of molecules in quantum chemistry. In this work we present a twofold approach to the description of spin physics in molecules and solids. First, we present a method that identifies the single-particle basis in which a given subset of the orbitals is equivalent to spin degrees of freedom for models and materials which feature significant spin physics at low energies. We introduce a metric for the spin-like character of a basis orbital, of which the optimization yields the basis containing the optimum spin-like basis orbitals. Second, we demonstrate an extended Schrieffer-Wolff transformation method to derive the effective Hamiltonian acting on the subspace of the Hilbert space in which the charge degree of freedom of electron densities in the spin-like orbitals is integrated out. The method then yields an effective spin-bath Hamiltonian description for the system. This extended Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is applicable to a wide range of Hamiltonians and has been utilized in this work for model Hamiltonians as well as the active space Hamiltonian of molecular chromium bromide.</description>

      <title>Robustness of ferromagnetism in van der Waals magnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ to hydrostatic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ (FGT) holds a great potential for applications in spintronic devices, due to its high Curie temperature, easy tunability, and excellent structural stability in air. Theoretical studies have shown that pressure, as an external parameter, significantly affects its ferromagnetic properties. In this study, we have performed comprehensive high-pressure neutron powder diffraction (NPD) experiments on FGT up to 5 GPa, to investigate the evolution of its structural and magnetic properties with hydrostatic pressure. The NPD data clearly reveal the robustness of the ferromagnetism in FGT, despite of an apparent suppression by hydrostatic pressure. As the pressure increases from 0 to 5 GPa, the Curie temperature is found to decrease monotonically from 225(5) K to 175(5) K, together with a dramatically suppressed ordered moment of Fe, which is well supported by the first-principles calculations. Although no pressure-driven structural phase transition is observed up to 5 GPa, quantitative analysis on the changes of bond lengths and bond angles indicate a significant modification of the exchange interactions, which accounts for the pressure-induced suppression of the ferromagnetism in FGT.</description>

Abstract: We present the emergence of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor-based artificial graphene using high-precision variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods, complemented by exact diagonalization calculations of the extended Hubbard model. Specifically, we analyze a realistic model of an armchair hexagonal geometry comprising $42$ lattice sites, nanopatterned on GaAs quantum wells with nearest-neighbor distance of $a = 50$ nm. Our results reveal a distinct magnetic phase transition near $U/t \approx 60$ driven by the absence/addition of a single electron at half-filling where the ferromagnetic phase is further stabilized by Coulomb scattering terms.</description>

      <title>Fully-gapped superconductivity with rotational symmetry breaking in pressurized kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ has generated significant interest in its complex physical properties, particularly its superconducting behavior under different pressures, though its nature remains debated. Here, we performed low-temperature, high-pressure $^{121/123}$Sb nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to explore the superconducting pairing symmetry in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. At ambient pressure, we found that the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/$T_1$ exhibits a kink at $T \sim$ 0.4 $T_\textrm{c}$ within the superconducting state and follows a $T^3$ variation as temperature further decreases. This suggests the presence of two superconducting gaps with line nodes in the smaller one. As pressure increases beyond $P_{\rm c} \sim 1.85$ GPa, where the charge-density wave phase is completely suppressed, 1/$T_1$ shows no Hebel-Slichter peak just below $T_\textrm{c}$, and decreases rapidly, even faster than $T^5$, indicating that the gap is fully opened for pressures above $P_{\rm c}$. In this high pressure region, the angular dependence of the in-plane upper critical magnetic field $H_{\rm c2}$ breaks the $C_6$ rotational symmetry. We propose the $s+id$ pairing at $P &gt; P_{\rm c}$ which explains both the 1/$T_1$ and $H_{\rm c2}$ behaviors. Our findings indicate that CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is an unconventional superconductor and its superconducting state is even more exotic at high pressures.</description>

      <title>Many neighbors little entanglement: A curious scaling in the variable-range extended Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the two-point correlation functions and the bipartite entanglement in the ground state of the exactly-solvable variable-range extended Ising model of qubits in the presence of a transverse field on a one-dimensional lattice. We introduce the variation in the range of interaction by varying the coordination number, $\mathcal{Z}$, of each qubit, where the interaction strength between a pair of qubits at a distance $r$ varies as $\sim r^{-\alpha}$. We show that the algebraic nature of the correlation functions is present only up to $r=\mathcal{Z}$, above which it exhibits short-range exponential scaling. We also show that at the critical point, the bipartite entanglement exhibits a power-law decrease ($\sim\mathcal{Z}^{-\gamma}$) with increasing coordination number irrespective of the partition size and the value of $\alpha$ for $\alpha&gt;1$. We further consider a sudden quench of the system starting from the ground state of the infinite-field limit of the system Hamiltonian via turning on the critical Hamiltonian, and demonstrate that the long-time averaged bipartite entanglement exhibits a qualitatively similar variation ($\sim\mathcal{Z}^{-\gamma}$) with $\mathcal{Z}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for calculating the Yang-Lee partition function zeros of a translationally invariant model of lattice fermions, exemplified by the Hubbard model. The method rests on a theorem involving the single electron self-energy $\Sigma_\sigma(k, i \omega_n)$ in the imaginary time Matsubara formulation. The theorem maps the Yang-Lee zeros to a set of wavevector and spin labeled virtual energies $\xi_{k \sigma}$. These, thermodynamically derived virtual energies, are solutions of equations involving the self-energy at corresponding $k\sigma$'s. Examples of the method in simplified situations are provided.</description>

      <title>Observing Spatial Charge and Spin Correlations in a Strongly-Interacting Fermi Gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional correlated fermions constitute a cornerstone of quantum matter, covering a broad fundamental and technological scope, and have attracted increasing interest with the emergence of modern materials such as high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductors, graphene, topological insulators, and Moir\'e structures. Atom-based quantum simulators provide a new pathway to understand the microscopic mechanisms occurring at the heart of such systems. In this work, we explore two-dimensional attractive Fermi gases at the microscopic level by probing spatial charge and spin correlations in situ. Using atom-resolved continuum quantum gas microscopy, we directly observe fermion pairing and study the evolution of two- and three-point correlation functions as inter-spin attraction is increased. The precision of our measurement allows us to reveal a marked dip in the pair correlation function, fundamentally forbidden by the mean-field result based on Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory but whose existence we confirm in exact auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We demonstrate that the BCS prediction is critically deficient not only in the superfluid crossover regime but also deep in the weakly attractive side. Guided by our measurements, we find a remarkable relation between two- and three-point correlations that establishes the dominant role of pair-correlations. Finally, leveraging local single-pair losses, we independently characterize the short-range behavior of pair correlations, via the measurement of Tan's Contact, and find excellent agreement with numerical predictions. Our measurements provide an unprecedented microscopic view into two-dimensional Fermi gases and constitute a paradigm shift for future studies of strongly-correlated fermionic matter in the continuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological holography is a holographic principle that describes the generalized global symmetry of a local quantum system in terms of a topological order in one higher dimension. This framework separates the topological data from the local dynamics of a theory and provides a unified description of the symmetry and duality in gapped and gapless phases of matter. In this work, we develop the topological holographic picture for (1+1)d quantum phases, including both gapped phases as well as a wide range of quantum critical points, including phase transitions between symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, symmetry enriched quantum critical points, deconfined quantum critical points, and intrinsically gapless SPT phases. Topological holography puts a strong constraint on the emergent symmetry and the anomaly for these critical theories. We show how the partition functions of these critical points can be obtained from dualizing (orbifolding) more familiar critical theories. The topological responses of the defect operators are also discussed in this framework. We further develop a topological holographic picture for conformal boundary states of (1+1)d rational conformal field theories. This framework provides a simple physical picture to understand conformal boundary states and also uncovers the nature of the gapped phases corresponding to the boundary states.</description>

Abstract: We consider quantum entanglement in strongly correlated quantum impurity systems for states manifesting interesting properties such as multi-level Kondo effect and dual nature between itineracy and localization etc.. For this purpose, we set up a system consisting of one or two quantum impurities arbitrarily selected from the system as a subsystem, and investigate quantum entanglement with its environmental system. We reduce the pure state of interest as described above to the subsystem, and formulate quantum informative quantities such as entanglement entropy, mutual information and relative entropy. We apply them to quantum impurity systems consisting of several sites and the single impurity Anderson model to study the relationship between their states and the behaviors of quantum informative quantities. The obtained results suggest that the method proposed here is promising for elucidating the quantum entanglement of pure states in various quantum impurity systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement between the spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom in condensed matter systems can emerge due to an interplay between spin-orbit and vibronic interactions. Heavy transition metal ions decorated on a face-centered cubic lattice, for example, in $5d^1$ double perovskites, are particularly suited to support these quantum entangled states, but direct evidence has not yet been presented. In this work, we report additional peaks in the low-energy spectra of a $5d^1$ double perovskite, Ba$_2$CaReO$_6$, which cannot be explained by adopting a purely classical description of lattice vibrations. Instead, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that these spectroscopic signatures are characteristic of orbital-lattice entangled states in Ba$_2$CaReO$_6$. Crucially, both theory and experiment demonstrate that these quantum-entangled states persist to low temperatures, despite the onset of multipolar order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chiral Luttinger liquid develops quantum chaos as soon as a -- however slight -- nonlinear dispersion is introduced for the microscopic electronic degrees of freedom. For this nonlinear version of the model, we identify an infinite family of translation-invariant interaction potentials with corresponding modulated symmetries. These symmetries are highly unconventional: they are modulated in momentum space (and do not seem to have an easy physical interpretation). We develop a systematic understanding of these symmetries and study the resulting blocks in the Hamiltonian. In particular, this approach allows us to predict the analytic Hamiltonian block sizes and derive asymptotic scaling laws in the limit of large total momentum. These blocks are reminiscent of Hilbert space fragmentation in that, even though they are labeled by a symmetry, this symmetry is highly nonlocal and does not have a simple interpretation. We corroborate this result by studying entanglement entropy and level statistics.</description>

      <title>An Atlas of Classical Pyrochlore Spin Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frustrated magnetism in the pyrochlore lattice magnet has proven to be a most fruitful setting for the experimental and theoretical search for spin liquids. Besides the canonical case of spin ice, recent works have identified a variety of new classical and quantum spin liquids engendered by the generic nearest-neighbor anisotropic spin Hamiltonian for that lattice. However, a general framework for the thorough and systematic classification and characterization of these exotic states of matter has been lacking, as has an exhaustive list of all possible spin liquids that this model can support and, perhaps most interesting, what is the corresponding structure of their emergent field theory description. In this work, we develop such a theoretical framework to identify the interaction parameters stabilizing different classical spin liquids and derive their corresponding effective generalized Gauss's laws at low temperatures. Combining this with Monte Carlo simulations, we systematically identify all classical spin liquids for the general nearest-neighbor anisotropic spin Hamiltonian on the pyrochlore lattice. In doing so, we uncover new spin liquid models with exotic forms of generalized Gauss's law and multipole conservation laws. Our approach allows us to compile an atlas of all spin liquids realized in the phase diagram, providing a global picture of their mutual connections in parameter space and transitions between them. Our work will inform future theoretical and experimental studies of classical and quantum spin liquids on the pyrochlore lattice and help rationalize the exotic properties of pyrochlore magnets.</description>

      <title>Stability of Floquet sidebands and quantum coherence in 1D strongly interacting spinless fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For strongly correlated quantum systems, fundamental questions about the formation and stability of Floquet-Bloch sidebands (FBs) upon periodic driving remain unresolved. Here, we investigate the impact of electron-electron interactions and perturbations in the coherence of the driving on the lifetime of FBs by directly computing time-dependent single-particle spectral functions using exact diagonalization (ED) and matrix product states (MPS). We study interacting metallic and correlated insulating phases in a chain of correlated spinless fermions. At high-frequency driving we obtain clearly separated, long-lived FBs of the full many-body excitation continuum. However, if there is significant overlap of the features, which is more probable in the low-frequency regime, the interactions lead to strong heating, which results in a significant loss of quantum coherence and of the FBs. Similar suppression of FBs is obtained in the presence of noise. The emerging picture is further elucidated by the behavior of real-space single-particle propagators, of the energy gain, and of the momentum distribution function, which is related to a quantum Fisher information that is directly accessible by spectroscopic measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the first principles gauge theoretical construction of relativistic gapless fracton theory developed by A.~Blasi and N.~Maggiore. The difference is that, instead of considering a symmetric tensor field, we consider a vector field with a gauge group index, \emph{i.e.} the usual Einstein-Cartan variable used in the first order formalism of gravity. After discussing the most general quadratic action for this field, we explore the physical sectors contained in the model. Particularly, we show that the model contains not only linear gravity and fractons, but also ordinary Maxwell equations, suggesting an apparent electrically charged phase of, for instance, spin liquids and glassy dynamical systems. Moreover, by a suitable change of field variables, we recover the Blasi-Maggiore gauge model of fractons and linear gravity.</description>

      <title>Nematic quantum disordered state in FeSe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unusual quantum-disordered magnetic ground state intertwined with superconductivity and electronic nematicity in FeSe has been a research focus in iron-based superconductors. However, the intrinsic spin excitations across the entire Brillouin zone in detwinned FeSe, which forms the basis for a microscopic understanding of the magnetic state and superconductivity, remain to be determined. Here, we use inelastic neutron scattering to map out the spin excitations of FeSe dewtinned with a uniaxial-strain device. We find that the stripe spin excitations (Q=(1, 0)/(0, 1)) exhibit the $C_2$ symmetry up to $E\approx120$ meV, while the N{\'e}el spin excitations (Q=(1, 1)) retain their $C_4$ symmetry in the nematic state. The temperature dependence of the difference in the spin excitations at Q=(1, 0) and (0, 1) for temperatures above the structural phase transition unambiguously shows the establishment of the nematic quantum disordered state. The similarity of the N\'eel excitations in FeSe and NaFeAs suggests that the N\'eel excitations are driven by the enhanced electron correlations in the $3d_{xy}$ orbital. By determining the key features of the stripe excitations and fitting their dispersions using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with biquadratic interaction ($J_1$-$K$-$J_2$), we establish a spin-interaction phase diagram and conclude that FeSe is close to a crossover region between the antiferroquadrupolar, N\'eel, and stripe ordering regimes. The results provide an experimental basis for establishing a microscopic theoretical model to describe the origin and intertwining of the emergent orders in iron-based superconductors.</description>

Abstract: We study the evolution of a quantum many-body system driven by two competing measurements, which induces a topological entanglement transition between two distinct area law phases. We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with variable coupling between the system and detector within free fermion dynamics. This approach allows us to continuously track the universal properties of the transition between projective and continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest that the percolation universality of the transition in the projective limit is unstable when the system-detector coupling is reduced.</description>

Abstract: We derive the Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories for diffusion including the lowest non-hydrodynamic degree of freedom from holographic Gubser-Rocha systems. At low temperature the dynamical non-hydrodynamic mode could be either an IR mode or a slow mode, which is related to IR quantum critical excitations or encodes the information of all energy scales. This additional dynamical vector mode could be viewed as an ultraviolet sector of the diffusive hydrodynamic theory. We construct two different effective actions for each case and discuss their physical properties. In particular we show that the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger symmetry is preserved.</description>

      <title>Measuring entanglement without local addressing in quantum many-body simulators via spiral quantum state tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography serves as a key tool for identifying quantum states generated in quantum computers and simulators, typically involving local operations on individual particles or qubits to enable independent measurements. However, this approach requires an exponentially larger number of measurement setups as quantum platforms grow in size, highlighting the necessity of more scalable methods to efficiently perform quantum state estimation. Here, we present a tomography scheme that scales far more efficiently and, remarkably, eliminates the need for local addressing of single constituents before measurements. Inspired by the ``spin-spiral'' structure in magnetic materials, our scheme combines a series of measurement setups, each with different spiraling patterns, with compressed sensing techniques. The results of the numerical simulations demonstrate a high degree of tomographic efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we show how this method is suitable for the measurement of specific entanglement properties of interesting quantum many-body states, such as entanglement entropy, under various realistic experimental conditions. This method offers a positive outlook across a wide range of quantum platforms, including those in which precise individual operations are challenging, such as optical lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Selective enhancement of Coulomb interactions in planar Weyl fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on our study of the electron interaction effects in topological two-dimensional (2D) materials placed in a quantizing magnetic field. Taking our cue from a recent experimental report, we consider a particular case of bismuthene monolayer with a strong spin-orbit interaction which can be a Weyl semimetal when placed on a specially tuned substrate. Interestingly, we observe that in some Landau levels of this material, the interaction effects are strongly enhanced compared to those for a conventional 2D system. Such an enhancement of electron-electron interactions in these materials is largely due to an anisotropy present in the materials. Additionally, the interaction effects can be tuned by changing the coupling to the substrate and the strongest inter-electron interactions are observed when the system is a Weyl semimental. The observed enhancement of the interaction effects can therefore be an important signature of the 2D Weyl fermions.</description>

      <title>Vacancy-assisted superfluid drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study superfluid drag in the two-component Bose-Hubbard model with infinitely strong repulsive interactions. In this system, all transport is mediated by the motion of empty sites, or ``holes", and it is hard to move one component without moving the other. We demonstrate, with a combination of analytic and numeric techniques, that the motion of holes leads to strong dissipationless coupling between currents in the two components. This behavior is attributable to polaronic correlations that emerge in the presence of spin currents, which can be observed in experiments. We derive a closed-form expression for the coupling on various lattices in arbitrary spatial dimensions, which we verify through numerical simulations on two dimensional lattices.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Driven Transition of Particles from Dispersive to Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) play a crucial role in condensed matter physics, offering an ideal platform to study strong correlation effects and enabling applications in diffraction-free photonics and quantum devices. However, the study and application of FB properties are susceptible to interference from dispersive bands. Here, we explore the impact of bond dissipation on systems hosting both flat and dispersive bands by calculating the steady-state density matrix. We demonstrate that bond dissipation can drive particles from dispersive bands into FBs and establish the general conditions for this phenomenon to occur. Our results demonstrate that dissipation can facilitate FB preparation, property measurement, and utilization. This opens a new avenue for exploring FB physics in open quantum systems, with potential implications for strongly correlated physics.</description>
