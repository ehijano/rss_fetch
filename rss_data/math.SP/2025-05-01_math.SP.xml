      <title>On Spectral Properties of Restricted Fractional Laplacians with Self-adjoint Boundary Conditions on a Finite Interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe all self-adjoint realizations of the restricted fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^a$ with power $a \in (\frac{1}{2}, 1)$ on a bounded interval by imposing boundary conditions on the functions in the domain of a maximal realization; such conditions relate suitable weighted Dirichlet and Neumann traces. This is done in a systematic way by using the abstract concept of boundary triplets and their Weyl functions from extension and spectral theory of symmetric and self-adjoint operators in Hilbert spaces. Our treatment follows closely the well-known one for classical Laplacians on intervals and it shows that all self-adjoint realizations have purely discrete spectrum and are semibounded from below. To demonstrate the method, we focus on three self-adjoint realizations of the restricted fractional Laplacian: the Friedrichs extension, corresponding to Dirichlet-type boundary conditions, the Krein--von Neumann extension, and a Neumann-type realization. Notably, the Neumann-type realization exhibits a simple negative eigenvalue, thus it is not larger than the Krein--von Neumann extension.</description>

      <title>Direct and inverse spectral continuity for Dirac operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The half-line Dirac operators with $L^2$-potentials can be characterized by their spectral data. It is known that the spectral correspondence is a homeomorphism: close potentials give rise to close spectral data and vice versa. We prove the first explicit two-sided uniform estimate related to this continuity in the general $L^2$-case. The proof is based on an exact solution of the inverse spectral problem for Dirac operators with $\delta$-interactions on a half-lattice in terms of the Schur's algorithm for analytic functions.</description>

      <title>Direct spectral problems for Paley-Wiener canonical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note focuses on the direct spectral problem for canonical Hamiltonian systems on the half-line $\mathbb{R}_+$. Truncated Toeplitz operators have been effectively used to solve the inverse spectral problem when the spectral measure is a locally finite periodic measure (see \cite{MP}). Here, we reverse the inverse problem algorithm to solve the direct spectral problem for step-function Hamiltonians. For a non-step-function Hamiltonian, we consider its step-function approximations and their corresponding spectral measures, and show that these spectral measures converge to the spectral measure of the original Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Polynomial and rational matrices with the invariant rational functions and the four sequences of minimal indices prescribed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complete eigenstructure, or structural data, of a rational matrix $R(s)$ is comprised by its invariant rational functions, both finite and at infinity, which in turn determine its finite and infinite pole and zero structures, respectively, and by the minimal indices of its left and right null spaces. These quantities arise in many applications and have been thoroughly studied in numerous references. However, other two fundamental subspaces of $R(s)$ in contrast have received much less attention: the column and row spaces, which also have their associated minimal indices. This work solves the problems of finding necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of rational matrices in two scenarios: (a) when the invariant rational functions and the minimal indices of the column and row spaces are prescribed, and (b) when the complete eigenstructure together with the minimal indices of the column and row spaces are prescribed. The particular, but extremely important, cases of these problems for polynomial matrices are solved first and are the main tool for solving the general problems. The results in this work complete and non-trivially extend the necessary and sufficient conditions recently obtained for the existence of polynomial and rational matrices when only the complete eigenstructure is prescribed.</description>

      <title>On a time-resolved interpretation of the Husimi function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we interpret the Husimi function as the conditional probability density of continuously measuring a stream of constant position and momentum outcomes, indefinitely. This gives rise to an alternative definition that naturally extends to an arbitrary collection of self-adjoint operators without reference to coherent states. This definition recovers the Husimi distribution for a spin-half particle when monitoring the three Pauli matrices, as well as Born's rule for quantum measurement when monitoring commuting quantum observables. Ultimately, the proposed paradigm generates positive representations of quantum states as conditional densities, on both finite and infinite time classical experiments, as expectations of a fundamental operator, the Gaussian semigroup.</description>

      <title>Cwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum type estimates for the Pauli and magnetic Schr\"odinger operator in dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a Cwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum type inequality for the number of negative eigenvalues of Pauli operators in dimension two. The resulting upper bound is sharp both in the weak as well as in the strong coupling limit. We also derive different upper bounds for magnetic Schr\"odinger operators. The nature of the two estimates depends on whether or not the spin-orbit coupling is taken into account.</description>

      <title>Bethe-Sommerfeld Conjecture and Absolutely Continuous Spectrum of Multi-Dimensional Quasi-Periodic Schr\"odinger Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.05881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Schr\"odinger operators $H=-\Delta+V({\mathbf x})$ in ${\mathbb R}^d$, $d\geq2$, with quasi-periodic potentials $V({\mathbf x})$. We prove that the absolutely continuous spectrum of a generic $H$ contains a semi-axis $[\lambda_*,+\infty)$. We also construct a family of eigenfunctions of the absolutely continuous spectrum; these eigenfunctions are small perturbations of the exponentials. The proof is based on a version of the multi-scale analysis in the momentum space with several new ideas introduced along the way.</description>
