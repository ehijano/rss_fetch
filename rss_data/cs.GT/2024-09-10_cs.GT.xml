      <title>Causal Analysis of Shapley Values: Conditional vs. Marginal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shapley values, a game theoretic concept, has been one of the most popular tools for explaining Machine Learning (ML) models in recent years. Unfortunately, the two most common approaches, conditional and marginal, to calculating Shapley values can lead to different results along with some undesirable side effects when features are correlated. This in turn has led to the situation in the literature where contradictory recommendations regarding choice of an approach are provided by different authors. In this paper we aim to resolve this controversy through the use of causal arguments. We show that the differences arise from the implicit assumptions that are made within each method to deal with missing causal information. We also demonstrate that the conditional approach is fundamentally unsound from a causal perspective. This, together with previous work in [1], leads to the conclusion that the marginal approach should be preferred over the conditional one.</description>

      <title>Position Fair Mechanisms Allocating Indivisible Goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fair division problem for indivisible goods, mechanisms that output allocations satisfying fairness concepts, such as envy-freeness up to one good (EF1), have been extensively studied. These mechanisms usually require an arbitrary order of agents as input, which may cause some agents to feel unfair since the order affects the output allocations. In the context of the cake-cutting problem, Manabe and Okamoto (2012) introduced meta-envy-freeness to capture such kind of fairness, which guarantees the absence of envy compared to different orders of agents.
  In this paper, we introduce position envy-freeness and its relaxation, position envy-freeness up to $k$ goods (PEF$k$), for mechanisms in the fair division problem for indivisible goods, analogous to the meta-envy-freeness. While the round-robin or the envy-cycle mechanism is not PEF1, we propose a PEF1 mechanism that always outputs an EF1 allocation. In addition, in the case of two agents, we prove that any mechanism that always returns a maximum Nash social welfare allocation is PEF1, and propose a modified adjusted winner mechanism satisfying PEF1. We further investigate the round-robin and the envy-cycle mechanisms to measure how far they are from position envy-freeness.</description>

      <title>Indirect Dynamic Negotiation in the Nash Demand Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper addresses a problem of sequential bilateral bargaining with incomplete information. We proposed a decision model that helps agents to successfully bargain by performing indirect negotiation and learning the opponent's model. Methodologically the paper casts heuristically-motivated bargaining of a self-interested independent player into a framework of Bayesian learning and Markov decision processes. The special form of the reward implicitly motivates the players to negotiate indirectly, via closed-loop interaction. We illustrate the approach by applying our model to the Nash demand game, which is an abstract model of bargaining. The results indicate that the established negotiation: i) leads to coordinating players' actions; ii) results in maximising success rate of the game and iii) brings more individual profit to the players.</description>

      <title>Bayesian hypergame approach to equilibrium stability and robustness in moving target defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the equilibrium stability and robustness in a class of moving target defense problems, in which players have both incomplete information and asymmetric cognition. We first establish a Bayesian Stackelberg game model for incomplete information and then employ a hypergame reformulation to address asymmetric cognition. With the core concept of the hyper Bayesian Nash equilibrium (HBNE), a condition for achieving both the strategic and cognitive stability in equilibria can be realized by solving linear equations. Moreover, to deal with players' underlying perturbed knowledge, we study the equilibrium robustness by presenting a condition of robust HBNE under the given configuration. Experiments evaluate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Fixed-budget and Multiple-issue Quadratic Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic Voting (QV) is a social choice mechanism that addresses the "tyranny of the majority" of one-person-one-vote mechanisms. Agents express not only their preference ordering but also their preference intensity by purchasing $x$ votes at a cost of $x^2$. Although this pricing rule maximizes utilitarian social welfare and is robust against strategic manipulation, it has not yet found many real-life applications. One key reason is that the original QV mechanism does not limit voter budgets. Two variations have since been proposed: a (no-budget) multiple-issue generalization and a fixed-budget version that allocates a constant number of credits to agents for use in multiple binary elections. While some analysis has been undertaken with respect to the multiple-issue variation, the fixed-budget version has not yet been rigorously studied. In this work, we formally propose a novel fixed-budget multiple-issue QV mechanism. This integrates the advantages of both the aforementioned variations, laying the theoretical foundations for practical use cases of QV, such as multi-agent resource allocation. We analyse our fixed-budget multiple-issue QV by comparing it with traditional voting systems, exploring potential collusion strategies, and showing that checking whether strategy profiles form a Nash equilibrium is tractable.</description>

      <title>A Policy Iteration Method for Inverse Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a policy iteration method to solve an inverse problem for a mean-field game model, specifically to reconstruct the obstacle function in the game from the partial observation data of value functions, which represent the optimal costs for agents. The proposed approach decouples this complex inverse problem, which is an optimization problem constrained by a coupled nonlinear forward and backward PDE system in the MFG, into several iterations of solving linear PDEs and linear inverse problems. This method can also be viewed as a fixed-point iteration that simultaneously solves the MFG system and inversion. We further prove its linear rate of convergence. In addition, numerical examples in 1D and 2D, along with performance comparisons to a direct least-squares method, demonstrate the superior efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method for solving inverse MFGs.</description>

      <title>Maximum Stable Matching with Matroids and Partial Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Stable Marriage problem (SM), solved by the famous deferred acceptance algorithm of Gale and Shapley (GS), has many natural generalizations. If we allow ties in preferences, then the problem of finding a maximum stable matching becomes NP-hard, and the best known approximation ratio is 1.5 (McDermid 2009, Paluch 2011, Z. Kir\'aly 2012), achievable by running GS on a cleverly constructed modified instance. Another elegant generalization of SM is the matroid kernel problem introduced by Fleiner (2001), which is solvable in polynomial time using an abstract matroidal version of GS.
  Our main result is a simple 1.5-approximation algorithm for the matroid kernel problem when preferences are given as interval orders -- a broad subclass of partial orders that covers many applications beyond preferences with ties. In addition, for the bipartite matching case, we show that the output of our algorithm also 1.5-approximates the LP-optimum of the relaxation of the corresponding Integer Program, which shows that the integrality gap is at most 1.5 for the interval order case. To contrast this with hardness results, we show that if arbitrary partial orders are allowed in the preferences, then even in the bipartite matching case, the problem becomes hard to approximate within a factor better than 2 assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, and the integrality gap becomes 2.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Cheap Talk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The literature on strategic communication originated with the influential cheap talk model, which precedes the Bayesian persuasion model by three decades. This model describes an interaction between two agents: sender and receiver. The sender knows some state of the world which the receiver does not know, and tries to influence the receiver's action by communicating a cheap talk message to the receiver.
  This paper initiates the systematic algorithmic study of cheap talk in a finite environment (i.e., a finite number of states and receiver's possible actions). We first prove that approximating the sender-optimal or the welfare-maximizing cheap talk equilibrium up to a certain additive constant or multiplicative factor is NP-hard. We further prove that deciding whether there exists an equilibrium in which the receiver gets utility higher than the trivial utility he can guarantee is NP-hard. Fortunately, we identify two naturally-restricted cases that admit efficient algorithms for finding a sender-optimal equilibrium - a constant number of states or a receiver having only two actions.</description>
