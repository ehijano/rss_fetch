      <title>Mapping the path to Cryogenic Atom Probe Tomography Analysis of biomolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The understanding of protein structure, folding, and interaction with other proteins remains one of the grand challenges of modern biology. Tremendous progress has been made thanks to X-ray- or electron-based techniques that have provided atomic configurations of proteins, and their solvation shell. These techniques though require a large number of similar molecules to provide an average view, and lack detailed compositional information that might play a major role in the biochemical activity of these macromolecules. Based on its intrinsic performance and recent impact in materials science, atom probe tomography (APT) has been touted as a potential novel tool to analyse biological materials, including proteins. However, analysis of biomolecules in their native, hydrated state by APT have not yet been routinely achieved, and the technique's true capabilities remain to be demonstrated. Here, we present and discuss systematic analyses of individual amino-acids in frozen aqueous solutions on two different nanoporous metal supports across a wide range of analysis conditions. Using a ratio of the molecular ions of water as a descriptor for the conditions of electrostatic field, we study the fragmentation and behavior of those amino acids. We discuss the importance sample support, specimen preparation route, acquisition conditions and data analysis, to pave the way towards establishing guidelines for cryo-APT analysis of biomolecules.</description>

      <title>Information theory for data-driven model reduction in physics and biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06608v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model reduction is the construction of simple yet predictive descriptions of the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of a few relevant variables. A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these relevant variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop a systematic approach based on the information bottleneck to identify the relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. Further, we show that in the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our information-based approach indicates when to optimally stop increasing the complexity of the reduced model. Furthermore, it provides a firm foundation to construct interpretable deep learning tools that perform model reduction. We illustrate how these tools work in practice by considering uncurated videos of atmospheric flows from which our algorithms automatically extract the dominant slow collective variables, as well as experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.</description>

      <title>Break-up and Recovery of Harmony between Direct and Indirect Pathways in The Basal Ganglia; Huntington's Disease and Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The basal ganglia (BG) in the brain exhibit diverse functions for motor, cognition, and emotion. Such BG functions could be made via competitive harmony between the two competing pathways, direct pathway (DP) (facilitating movement) and indirect pathway (IP) (suppressing movement). As a result of break-up of harmony between DP and IP, there appear pathological states with disorder for movement, cognition, and psychiatry. In this paper, we are concerned about the Huntington's disease (HD), which is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder causing involuntary movement and severe cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. For the HD, the number of D2 SPNs ($N_{\rm D2}$) is decreased due to degenerative loss, and hence, by decreasing $x_{\rm D2}$ (fraction of $N_{\rm D2}$), we investigate break-up of harmony between DP and IP in terms of their competition degree ${\cal C}_d$, given by the ratio of strength of DP (${\cal S}_{DP}$) to strength of IP (${\cal S}_{IP}$) (i.e., ${\cal C}_d = {\cal S}_{DP} / {\cal S}_{IP}$). In the case of HD, the IP is under-active, in contrast to the case of Parkinson's disease with over-active IP, which results in increase in ${\cal C}_d$ (from the normal value). Thus, hyperkinetic dyskinesia such as chorea (involuntary jerky movement) occurs. We also investigate treatment of HD, based on optogenetics and GP ablation, by increasing strength of IP, resulting in recovery of harmony between DP and IP. Finally, we study effect of loss of healthy synapses of all the BG cells on HD. Due to loss of healthy synapses, disharmony between DP and IP increases, leading to worsen symptoms of the HD.</description>
