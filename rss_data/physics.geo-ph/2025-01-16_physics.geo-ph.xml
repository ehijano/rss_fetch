      <title>Deep learning selection of analogues for Mars landing sites in the Qaidam Basin, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote sensing observations and Mars rover missions have recorded the presence of beaches, salt lakes, and wind erosion landforms in Martian sediments. All these observations indicate that Mars was hydrated in its early history. There used to be oceans on Mars, but they have now dried up. Therefore, signs of previous life on Mars could be preserved in the evaporites formed during this process. The study of evaporite regions has thus become a priority area for Mars' life exploration. This study proposes a method for training similarity metrics from surface land image data of Earth and Mars, which can be used for recognition or validation applications. The method will be applied in simulating tasks to select Mars landing sites using a selecting small-scale area of the Mars analaogue the evaporite region of Qaidam Basin, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This learning process minimizes discriminative loss function, which makes the similarity measure smaller for images from the same location and larger for images from different locations. This study selected a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based model, which has been trained to explain various changes in image appearance and identify different landforms in Mars. By identifying different landforms, priority landing sites on Mars can be selected.</description>

      <title>Use of electrical resistivity tomography to map the tree roots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient advanced numerical model for mapping the distribution of the buried tree roots is presented. It not only simplify the complicate root branches to an easy manipulated model, but also grasp the main structure of tree roots ignoring the unnecessary minutiae, and thus provide an intuitive impression of subsurface invisible anomalies. The processing model is combined with an adaptive finite element method, which can automatically generate unstructured triangular meshes during the process of discretization, which also enable user to specifically set the resistivity along each part of tree roots.</description>

      <title>An investigation of the relationship between morphology and chemistry of the D-type spherules from the recovery expedition of the CNEOS 2014-01-08 bolide: Implications for origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic spherules have largely been classified into S-, I-, and G-types according to their compositions, and are identified to have chondritic or achondritic materials as precursors. A recent recovery expedition attempted to sample fragments of the CNEOS 2014-01-08 bolide retrieved roughly 850 magnetic particles, some of which have unknown origins. Among those identified were a new group of highly differentiated materials consisting of close to 160 specimens categorized as "D-type" particles. We studied the D-type particles with the goal of comparing their various morphological features to their chemical compositional groupings. Four morphological classifications are considered: "scoriaceous," "stubby," "blocky," and "vesicular." The specimens from the "scoriaceous" and "stubby" groups exhibit a spinel/magnetite rim in at least one instance, characteristic of atmospheric entry, and textures indicative of quenching such as dendritic microcrystalline structures, suggesting that a subset of specimens from these groups are candidates for materials of extraterrestrial origin. The particles exhibiting "blocky" and "vesicular" textures are likely to be terrestrial in origin, with no obvious quench features or signs of ablation. The D-type particles identified and characterized in this study have a spectrum of terrestrial and probable extraterrestrial origins.</description>

      <title>CDDIP: Constrained Diffusion-Driven Deep Image Prior for Seismic Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seismic data frequently exhibits missing traces, substantially affecting subsequent seismic processing and interpretation. Deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated significant advancements in reconstructing irregularly missing seismic data through supervised and unsupervised methods. Nonetheless, substantial challenges remain, such as generalization capacity and computation time cost during the inference. Our work introduces a reconstruction method that uses a pre-trained generative diffusion model for image synthesis and incorporates Deep Image Prior to enforce data consistency when reconstructing missing traces in seismic data. The proposed method has demonstrated strong robustness and high reconstruction capability of post-stack and pre-stack data with different levels of structural complexity, even in field and synthetic scenarios where test data were outside the training domain. This indicates that our method can handle the high geological variability of different exploration targets. Additionally, compared to other state-of-the-art seismic reconstruction methods using diffusion models. During inference, our approach reduces the number of sampling timesteps by up to 4x.</description>

      <title>Exploring the conditions conducive to convection within the Greenland Ice Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large plume-like features within the Greenland Ice Sheet disrupt radiostratigraphy and complicate the use of isochrones in reconstructions of past ice dynamics. Here we use numerical modeling to test the hypothesis that convection is a viable mechanism for the formation of the large (&gt;1/3 ice thickness) englacial plume-like features observed in north Greenland. Greater horizontal shear and snow accumulation impede formation of convection plumes, while stable and softer ice encourages them. These results potentially explain the dearth of basal plumes in the younger and higher-accumulation southern ice sheet. Leveraging this mechanism to place bounds on ice rheology suggests that -- for north Greenland -- ice viscosity may be ~9-15 times lower than commonly assumed. Softer-than-assumed ice there implies significantly reduced basal sliding compared to standard models. Implementing a softer basal ice rheology in numerical models may help reduce uncertainty in projections of future ice-sheet mass balance.</description>

      <title>Removing Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Using Large Land Or Ocean Areas Will Change Earth Albedo And Force Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When large surface areas of the Earth are altered, radiative forcing due to changes in surface reflectance can drive climate change. Yet to achieve the necessary scale to remove the substantial amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere relevant for ameliorating climate change, enhanced rock weathering (ERW) will need to be applied to very large land areas. Likewise, marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) must alter a large fraction of the ocean surface waters to have a significant impact upon climate. We show that surface albedo modification (SAM) associated with ERW or mCDR can easily overwhelm the radiative forcing from the decrease of atmospheric CO2 over years or even decades. A change in albedo as small as parts per thousand has a radiative impact comparable to the removal of 10 tons of carbon per hectare. SAM via ERW can be either cooling or warming. We identify some of the many questions raised by radiative forcing due to these forms of CDR.</description>
