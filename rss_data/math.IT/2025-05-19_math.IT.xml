      <title>Towards an open geotechnical data platform in France</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important quantity of geotechnical data is constantly collected for all the new projects of civil engineering. This data includes generally core and destructive boreholes, in which samples are taken for laboratory testing and in situ geotechnical tests are performed. The density of geotechnical data is particularly high in urban areas. The data is collected by geotechnical engineering or drilling Companies for public or private owners. Data is essential to define the geotechnical conditions of a project and are obviously necessary for the geotechnical design of foundations or underground structures. However, most of the time, data is not accessible in a numerical format, and at the end of the project, is often forgotten, while it could be reused for neighbouring projects. It is a great loss of information and knowledge to the technical and scientific geosciences community, and it represents a significant cost for the country economy. In France, the BRGM (French geological survey office) is currently developing a new open access platform dedicated to the capitalization and accessibility of geotechnical data, compliant with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). This paper describes the challenges to overcome and the possible solutions, considering the high diversity of geotechnical tests, explains the need of keeping the exhaustive data set for each test, and describes the next stages of development.</description>

      <title>ToDMA: Large Model-Driven Token-Domain Multiple Access for Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Token communications (TokCom) is an emerging generative semantic communication concept that reduces transmission rates by using context and multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based token processing, with tokens serving as universal semantic units across modalities. In this paper, we propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as token domain multiple access (ToDMA), where a large number of devices share a token codebook and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding, respectively. Specifically, each transmitter first tokenizes its source signal and modulate each token to a codeword. At the receiver, compressed sensing is employed first to detect active tokens and the corresponding channel state information (CSI) from the superposed signals. Then, the source token sequences are reconstructed by clustering the token-associated CSI across multiple time slots. In case of token collisions, some active tokens cannot be assigned and some positions in the reconstructed token sequences are empty. We propose to use pre-trained MLLMs to leverage the context, predict masked tokens, and thus mitigate token collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ToDMA framework for both text and image transmission tasks, achieving significantly lower latency compared to context-unaware orthogonal communication schemes, while also delivering superior distortion and perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art context-unaware non-orthogonal communication methods.</description>

      <title>Doppler Resilient Complementary Sequences: Tighter Aperiodic Ambiguity Function Bound and Optimal Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doppler-resilient complementary sequence sets (DRCSs) are crucial in modern communication and sensing systems in mobile environments. In this paper, we propose a new lower bound for the aperiodic ambiguity function (AF) of unimodular DRCSs based on weight vectors, which generalizes the existing bound as a special case. The proposed lower bound is tighter than the Shen-Yang-Zhou-Liu-Fan bound. Finally, we propose a novel class of aperiodic DRCSs with small alphabets based on quasi-Florentine rectangles and Butson-type Hadamard matrices. Interestingly, the proposed DRCSs asymptotically satisfy the proposed bound.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Task Foundation Model for Wireless Channel Representation Using Contrastive and Masked Autoencoder Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current applications of self-supervised learning to wireless channel representation often borrow paradigms developed for text and image processing, without fully addressing the unique characteristics and constraints of wireless communications. Aiming to fill this gap, we first propose WiMAE (Wireless Masked Autoencoder), a transformer-based encoder-decoder foundation model pretrained on a realistic open-source multi-antenna wireless channel dataset. Building upon this foundation, we develop ContraWiMAE, which enhances WiMAE by incorporating a contrastive learning objective alongside the reconstruction task in a unified multi-task framework. By warm-starting from pretrained WiMAE weights and generating positive pairs via noise injection, the contrastive component enables the model to capture both structural and discriminative features, enhancing representation quality beyond what reconstruction alone can achieve. Through extensive evaluation on unseen scenarios, we demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches across multiple downstream tasks, with ContraWiMAE showing further improvements in linear separability and adaptability in diverse wireless environments. Comparative evaluations against a state-of-the-art wireless channel foundation model confirm the superior performance and data efficiency of our models, highlighting their potential as powerful baselines for future research in self-supervised wireless channel representation learning.</description>

      <title>Cross-layer Integrated Sensing and Communication: A Joint Industrial and Academic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables radio systems to simultaneously sense and communicate with their environment. This paper, developed within the Hexa-X-II project funded by the European Union, presents a comprehensive cross-layer vision for ISAC in 6G networks, integrating insights from physical-layer design, hardware architectures, AI-driven intelligence, and protocol-level innovations. We begin by revisiting the foundational principles of ISAC, highlighting synergies and trade-offs between sensing and communication across different integration levels. Enabling technologies, such as multiband operation, massive and distributed MIMO, non-terrestrial networks, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and machine learning, are analyzed in conjunction with hardware considerations including waveform design, synchronization, and full-duplex operation. To bridge implementation and system-level evaluation, we introduce a quantitative cross-layer framework linking design parameters to key performance and value indicators. By synthesizing perspectives from both academia and industry, this paper outlines how deeply integrated ISAC can transform 6G into a programmable and context-aware platform supporting applications from reliable wireless access to autonomous mobility and digital twinning.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bounds for Quantum Learning via R\'enyi Divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work advances the theoretical understanding of quantum learning by establishing a new family of upper bounds on the expected generalization error of quantum learning algorithms, leveraging the framework introduced by Caro et al. (2024) and a new definition for the expected true loss. Our primary contribution is the derivation of these bounds in terms of quantum and classical R\'enyi divergences, utilizing a variational approach for evaluating quantum R\'enyi divergences, specifically the Petz and a newly introduced modified sandwich quantum R\'enyi divergence. Analytically and numerically, we demonstrate the superior performance of the bounds derived using the modified sandwich quantum R\'enyi divergence compared to those based on the Petz divergence. Furthermore, we provide probabilistic generalization error bounds using two distinct techniques: one based on the modified sandwich quantum R\'enyi divergence and classical R\'enyi divergence, and another employing smooth max R\'enyi divergence.</description>

      <title>Unfolded Deep Graph Learning for Networked Over-the-Air Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has emerged as a promising technology that enables simultaneous transmission and computation through wireless channels. In this paper, we investigate the networked AirComp in multiple clusters allowing diversified data computation, which is yet challenged by the transceiver coordination and interference management therein. Particularly, we aim to maximize the multi-cluster weighted-sum AirComp rate, where the transmission scalar as well as receive beamforming are jointly investigated while addressing the interference issue. From an optimization perspective, we decompose the formulated problem and adopt the alternating optimization technique with an iterative process to approximate the solution. Then, we reinterpret the iterations through the principle of algorithm unfolding, where the channel condition and mutual interference in the AirComp network constitute an underlying graph. Accordingly, the proposed unfolding architecture learns the weights parameterized by graph neural networks, which is trained through stochastic gradient descent approach. Simulation results show that our proposals outperform the conventional schemes, and the proposed unfolded graph learning substantially alleviates the interference and achieves superior computation performance, with strong and efficient adaptation to the dynamic and scalable networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Nash Equilibria with Black-Box Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern open and softwarized systems -- such as O-RAN telecom networks and cloud computing platforms -- host independently developed applications with distinct, and potentially conflicting, objectives. Coordinating the behavior of such applications to ensure stable system operation poses significant challenges, especially when each application's utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. In this paper, we consider a centralized optimization framework in which a system controller suggests joint configurations to multiple strategic players, representing different applications, with the goal of aligning their incentives toward a stable outcome. To model this interaction, we formulate a Stackelberg game in which the central optimizer lacks access to analytical utility functions and instead must learn them through sequential, multi-fidelity evaluations. To address this challenge, we propose MF-UCB-PNE, a novel multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization strategy that leverages a budget-constrained sampling process to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. MF-UCB-PNE systematically balances exploration across low-cost approximations with high-fidelity exploitation steps, enabling efficient convergence to incentive-compatible configurations. We provide theoretical and empirical insights into the trade-offs between query cost and equilibrium accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of MF-UCB-PNE in identifying effective equilibrium solutions under limited cost budgets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a minimax approach for characterizing the capacities of fully quantum arbitrarily varying channels (FQAVCs) under different shared resource models. In contrast to previous methods, our technique avoids de Finetti-type reductions, allowing us to treat quantum jammers with infinite-dimensional systems. Consequently, we show that the entanglement-assisted and shared-randomness-assisted capacities of FQAVCs match those of the corresponding compound channels, even in the presence of general quantum adversaries.</description>

      <title>Emerging Technologies in Intelligent Metasurfaces: Shaping the Future of Wireless Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent metasurfaces have demonstrated great promise in revolutionizing wireless communications. One notable example is the two-dimensional (2D) programmable metasurface, which is also known as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to manipulate the wireless propagation environment to enhance network coverage. More recently, three-dimensional (3D) stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) have been developed to substantially improve signal processing efficiency by directly processing analog electromagnetic signals in the wave domain. Another exciting breakthrough is the flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM), which possesses the ability to morph its 3D surface shape in response to dynamic wireless channels and thus achieve diversity gain. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of these emerging intelligent metasurface technologies. We commence by examining recent experiments of RIS and exploring its applications from four perspectives. Furthermore, we delve into the fundamental principles underlying SIM, discussing relevant prototypes as well as their applications. Numerical results are also provided to illustrate the potential of SIM for analog signal processing. Finally, we review the state-of-the-art of FIM technology, discussing its impact on wireless communications and identifying the key challenges of integrating FIMs into wireless networks.</description>

      <title>The dimension and Bose distance of certain primitive BCH codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bose-Ray-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes are a significant class of cyclic codes that play an important role in both theoretical research and practical applications. Their strong error-correcting abilities and efficient encoding and decoding methods make BCH codes widely applicable in various areas, including communication systems, data storage devices, and consumer electronics. Although BCH codes have been extensively studied, the parameters of BCH codes are not known in general.
  Let $q$ be a prime power and $m$ be a positive integer. Denote by $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ the narrow-sense primitive BCH code with length $q^m-1$ and designed distance $\delta$. As of now, the dimensions of $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ are fully understood only for $m \leq 2$. For $m \geq 4$, the dimensions of $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ are known only for the range $2 \leq \delta \leq q^{\lfloor (m+1)/2 \rfloor +1}$ and for a limited number of special cases. In this paper, we determined the dimension and Bose distance of $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ for $m\geq 4$ and $\delta\in [2, q^{\lfloor ( 2m-1)/{3}\rfloor+1}]. $ Additionally, we have also extended our results to primitive BCH codes that are not necessarily narrow-sense.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds on Learning Pauli Channels with Individual Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the noise affecting a quantum device is of fundamental importance for scaling quantum technologies. A particularly important class of noise models is that of Pauli channels, as randomized compiling techniques can effectively bring any quantum channel to this form and are significantly more structured than general quantum channels. In this paper, we show fundamental lower bounds on the sample complexity for learning Pauli channels in diamond norm. We consider strategies that may not use auxiliary systems entangled with the input to the unknown channel and have to perform a measurement before reusing the channel. For non-adaptive algorithms, we show a lower bound of $\Omega(2^{3n}\varepsilon^{-2})$ to learn an $n$-qubit Pauli channel. In particular, this shows that the recently introduced learning procedure by Flammia and Wallman is essentially optimal. In the adaptive setting, we show a lower bound of $\Omega(2^{2.5n}\varepsilon^{-2})$ for $\varepsilon=\mathcal{O}(2^{-n})$, and a lower bound of $\Omega(2^{2n}\varepsilon^{-2} )$ for any $\varepsilon&gt; 0$. This last lower bound holds even in a stronger model where in each step, before performing the measurement, the unknown channel may be used arbitrarily many times sequentially interspersed with unital operations.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Statistical Tests for LLM-Generated Text Detection using Finite Sample Concentration Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02406v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verifying the provenance of content is crucial to the function of many organizations, e.g., educational institutions, social media platforms, firms, etc. This problem is becoming increasingly challenging as text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes almost indistinguishable from human-generated content. In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs and want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content within the institution. In this paper, we answer the following question: Given a piece of text, can we identify whether it was produced by a particular LLM or not? We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process with complete dependence on history. We then design zero-shot statistical tests to (i) distinguish between text generated by two different known sets of LLMs $A$ (non-sanctioned) and $B$ (in-house), and (ii) identify whether text was generated by a known LLM or generated by any unknown model, e.g., a human or some other language generation process. We prove that the type I and type II errors of our test decrease exponentially with the length of the text. For that, we show that if $B$ generates the text, then except with an exponentially small probability in string length, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average cross-entropy of $B$ and $A$. We then present experiments using LLMs with white-box access to support our theoretical results and empirically examine the robustness of our results to black-box settings and adversarial attacks. In the black-box setting, our method achieves an average TPR of 82.5\% at a fixed FPR of 5\%. Under adversarial perturbations, our minimum TPR is 48.6\% at the same FPR threshold. Both results outperform all non-commercial baselines. See https://github.com/TaraRadvand74/llm-text-detection for code, data, and an online demo of the project.</description>

      <title>Ratio Attack on G+G Convoluted Gaussian Signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A lattice-based signature, called G+G convoluted Gaussian signature, was proposed in ASIACRYPT 2023 and was proved secure in the quantum random oracle model. In this paper, we propose a ratio attack on the G+G convoluted Gaussian signature to recover the secret key and comment on the revised eprint paper. The attack exploits the fact, proved in this paper, that the secret key can be obtained from the expected value of the ratio of signatures which follows a truncated Cauchy distribution. Moreover, we also compute the number of signatures required to successfully recover the secret key. Furthermore, we simulate the ratio attack in Sagemath with a few different parameters as a proof-of-concept of the ratio attack. In addition, although the revised signature in the revised eprint paper is secure against the ratio attack, we found that either a valid signature cannot be produced or a signature can be forged easily for their given parameters in the eprint.</description>

      <title>Learnable Residual-Based Latent Denoising in Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A latent denoising semantic communication (SemCom) framework is proposed for robust image transmission over noisy channels. By incorporating a learnable latent denoiser into the receiver, the received signals are preprocessed to effectively remove the channel noise and recover the semantic information, thereby enhancing the quality of the decoded images. Specifically, a latent denoising mapping is established by an iterative residual learning approach to improve the denoising efficiency while ensuring stable performance. Moreover, channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is utilized to estimate and predict the latent similarity score (SS) for conditional denoising, where the number of denoising steps is adapted based on the predicted SS sequence, further reducing the communication latency. Finally, simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively and efficiently remove the channel noise at various levels and reconstruct visual-appealing images.</description>

      <title>TwinTURBO: Semi-Supervised Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models via Mutual Information Decompositions for Downstream Task and Latent Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a semi-supervised fine-tuning framework for foundation models that utilises mutual information decomposition to address the challenges of training for a limited amount of labelled data. Our approach derives two distinct lower bounds: i) for the downstream task space, such as classification, optimised using conditional and marginal cross-entropy alongside Kullback-Leibler divergence, and ii) for the latent space representation, regularised and aligned using a contrastive-like decomposition. This fine-tuning strategy retains the pre-trained structure of the foundation model, modifying only a specialised projector module comprising a small transformer and a token aggregation technique. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate significant improvements in classification tasks under extremely low-labelled conditions by effectively leveraging unlabelled data.</description>
