      <title>A logical approach to concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concentration results say that a sequence of random variables becomes progressively concentrated around the mean. Such results are common in the study of functions of random graphs. We introduce a real-valued logic with various aggregate operators on graphs, including summation, and prove that every term in the language, seen as a random variable on random graphs within the classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph model, is concentrated. We prove this for dense and sparse variants of Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs. On the one hand, our results extend the line of work originating with Fagin and Glebskii et al. on zero-one laws for dense random graphs, as well as the zero-one law of Shelah and Spencer for sparse random graphs. On the other hand, they can be seen as a meta-theorem for inferring concentration results on random graphs, and we give examples of such applications.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic local law for non-separable sample covariance matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish local laws for sample covariance matrices $K = N^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^N \g_i\g_i^*$ where the random vectors $\g_1, \ldots, \g_N \in \R^n$ are independent with common covariance $\Sigma$. Previous work has largely focused on the separable model $\g = \Sigma^{1/2}\w$ with $\w$ having independent entries, but this structure is rarely present in statistical applications involving dependent or nonlinearly transformed data. Under a concentration assumption for quadratic forms $\g^*A\g$, we prove an optimal averaged local law showing that the Stieltjes transform of $K$ converges to its deterministic limit uniformly down to the optimal scale $\eta \geq N^{-1+\eps}$. Under an additional structural assumption on the cumulant tensors of $\g$ -- which interpolates between the highly structured case of independent entries and generic dependence -- we establish the full anisotropic local law, providing entrywise control of the resolvent $(K-zI)^{-1}$ in arbitrary directions. We discuss several classes of non-separable examples satisfying our assumptions, including conditionally mean-zero distributions, the random features model $\g = \sigma(X\w)$ arising in machine learning, and Gaussian measures with nonlinear tilting. The proofs introduce a tensor network framework for analyzing fluctuation averaging in the presence of higher-order cumulant structure.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Half-Space Last Passage Percolation Away from the Boundary to the Directed Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we prove convergence of the half-space exponential last passage percolation (LPP) model, away from the boundary, to the directed landscape. Our approach couples the half-space and full-space LPP models and constructs two barrier events based on the monotonicity of last passage paths. Combining this coupling with moderate deviation estimates for both models and the known convergence of full-space LPP to the directed landscape, we establish the desired convergence.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of Discrete-Time Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes are devoted to fluctuations of one-dimensional random walks. We discuss various approaches to first-passage times and to the corresponding conditional distributions. After discussion of some classical methods, such as reflection principle for simple random walks and Wiener-Hopf factorisation, we proceed to the universality approach, which has been developed in recent past. Considering one-dimensional case allows us to avoid some technical obstacles and to present the core of this method in a more transparent way. It turns out that the universality method is much more robust than the Wiener-Hopf factorisation and allows one to consider walks with non-identically distributed or even dependent increments.</description>

      <title>Corrected diffusion approximation for random walks conditioned to stay positive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S_n$ be a random walk with i.i.d. increments which have zero mean and finite variance. For every $x\ge0$ we define the stopping time $\tau_x:=\inf\{n\ge1:x+S_n\le0\}$ and consider the probabilities $\mathbb{P}(x+S_n\ge y,\tau_x&gt;n)$. We study the quality of the normal approximation for these probabilities and derive a Berry-Esseen-type inequality for $\mathbb{P}(x+S_n\ge y|\tau_x&gt;n)$. Our Theorem 1 is an extension of the results in our previous paper (arXiv:2412.08502) where we have considered the special case $x=0$. It is also worth mentioning that Theorem 1 complements the results of Siegmund and Yuh (1982) on the corrected diffusion approximation.</description>

      <title>Strong law of large numbers for $\varphi$-sub-Gaussian random variables under sub-linear expectation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of sub Gaussian random variables in sub-linear expectation spaces. To avoid the problem caused by the existence of two different expectations, i.e., the upper expectation and the lower expectation, we divide the definition of the sub-Gaussian property into an upper part and a lower part. It turns out that this approach fits well to the sub-linear setting; it provides a proper framework for extending Zajkowski's general result to sublinear expectation spaces. Within our framework, we establish a strong law of large numbers for sub-Gaussian sequences. We present an example showing the usefulness of our results.</description>

      <title>Weak error approximation for rough and Gaussian mean-reverting stochastic volatility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a class of stochastic models with Gaussian and rough mean-reverting volatility that embeds the genuine rough Stein-Stein model, we study the weak approximation rate when using a Euler type scheme with integrated kernels. Our first result is a weak convergence rate for the discretised rough Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, that is essentially in $\min(3\alpha-1,1)$, where $\frac{t^{\alpha-1}}{\Gamma(\alpha)} $ is the fractional convolution kernel with $\alpha \in (1/2,1)$. Then, our main result is to obtain the same convergence rate for the corresponding stochastic rough volatility model with polynomial test functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the weak convergence of a generic tamed Euler-Maruyama scheme for kinetic stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with integrable drifts. We show that the marginal density of the considered scheme converges at rate 1/2 to the corresponding marginal density of the SDE. The convergence rate is independent from the criticality gap, which is new compared to previous results.</description>

      <title>Quenched path limits and periodization stability for tilted Brownian motion in Poissonian potentials on $\mathbb{H}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the existence of Brownian motion tilted by a potential of full support on hyperbolic spaces $\mathbb{H}^d$. On compact spaces, it is classical that these path limits, called Q-processes, exist and can be directly defined using the ground state of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator. On non-compact spaces like $\mathbb{H}^d$, the existence fails in general.
  We show that for \emph{stationary random} potentials on $\mathbb{H}^d$ with suitable spectral and sup norm bounds, the Q-processes exist a.s. For potentials that are factors of a Poisson point process, the method works up to sup norm $(d-1)^2/8$. In this case, we also show that the path limit can be approximated by periodic potentials.
  As a tool, we use the foliated space defined by the point process. It turns out that the global ground state of this foliated space serves as a substitute for the non-existing $L^2$ ground states on the leaves of the foliation. Restricting the global ground state to a leaf gives a generalized eigenwave that can be plugged into the usual machinery to get the Q-process.</description>

      <title>The mean-field control problem for heterogeneous forward-backward systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of mean-field control when the state dynamics are given by general systems of forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) with heterogeneous mean-field interactions. Firstly, we introduce a novel methodology for reducing the well-posedness of such systems to that of a single randomized mean-field FBSDE. As a consequence, we show that, in the fully coupled case, smallness conditions yield existence and uniqueness for both the system itself and the associated variational and adjoint systems. Secondly, we derive a stochastic maximum principle and a verification for the mean-field control problem. This provides necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality.</description>

      <title>Conditional thinning and multiplicative statistics of Laguerre-type orthogonal polynomial ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local statistics of orthogonal polynomial ensembles near a hard edge, subject to a multiplicative deformation of the measure. Probabilistically, this deformation corresponds to a position-dependent conditional thinning of the particles. We prove that, under critical hard edge scaling and for a large class of potentials and deformation symbols, the correlation kernel of the conditional ensemble converges to a universal limit, which we identify as the conditional thinned Bessel point process.
  We derive an explicit expression for this limiting kernel in terms of the solution to a nonlocal integrable system depending on a parameter. For a special choice of the parameter, this system was recently identified in the study of multiplicative statistics of the Bessel point process. Our results establish that this system governs the full correlation structure of the conditional Bessel point process, extending the classical connection between the standard Bessel kernel and the Painlev\'e V equation.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Type Maximal Inequalities for Independent and Dependent Negative Binomial Random Variables: Sharp Bounds, Sub-Exponential Refinements, and Applications to Overdispersed Count Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops Kolmogorov-type maximal inequalities for sums of Negative Binomial random variables under both independence and dependence structures. For independent heterogeneous Negative Binomial variables we derive sharp Markov-type deviation inequalities and Kolmogorov-type bounds expressed in terms of Tweedie dispersion parameters, providing explicit control limits for NB2 generalized linear model monitoring. For dependent count data arising through a shared Gamma mixing variable, we establish a \emph{sub-exponential Bernstein-type refinement} that exploits the Poisson-Gamma hierarchical structure to yield exponentially decaying tail probabilities -- this refinement is new in the literature. Through moment-matched Monte Carlo experiments ($n=20$, 2{,}000 replications), we document a 55\% reduction in mean maximum deviation under appropriate dependence structures, a stabilization effect we explain analytically. A concrete epidemiological application with NB2 parameters calibrated from COVID-19 surveillance data demonstrates practical utility. These results materially advance the applicability of classical maximal inequalities to overdispersed and dependent count data prevalent in public health, insurance, and ecological modeling.</description>

      <title>On the $q$-integrability of $p$-Wasserstein barycenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $L^q$-regularity of the density of barycenters of $N$ probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to the $p$-Wasserstein metric ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$). According to a previous result by the first author and collaborators, if one marginal is absolutely continuous, so is the $W_p$-barycenter. The next natural question is whether the $L^q$- regularity on the marginals is also preserved for any $q &gt; 1$, as in the classical case ($p=2$) of Agueh--Carlier, or for $W_p$-geodesics ($N=2$). Here we prove that this is the case if one marginal belongs to $L^q$ and the supports of all the marginals satisfy suitable geometric assumptions. However, we show that, as soon as $N&gt;2$, it is possible to find examples of $W_p$-barycenters which are not $q$-integrable, even if one marginal is compactly supported and bounded, thus highlighting the role played by the geometry of the supports. Furthermore, we provide a general estimate of the $L^q$-norm, including a detailed study of the sources of singularities, and a characterization of the $W_p$-barycenters \`a la Agueh--Carlier in terms of the associated Kantorovich potentials. Finally, we explicitly compute the $W_p$-barycenters of measures obtained as push-forward of special affine transformations. In this case, regularity holds without any additional requirement on the supports.</description>

Abstract: In a previous paper (arXiv:2510.19746), we have studied the maximal hard-code model on the square lattice ${\mathbb Z}^2$ from the perspective of recoverable systems. Here we extend this study to the case of the triangular lattice ${\mathbb A}$. The following results are obtained:
  (1) We derive bounds on the capacity of the associated recoverable system on ${\mathbb A}$;
  (2) We show non-uniqueness of Gibbs measures in the high-activity regime;
  (3) We characterize extremal periodic Gibbs measures for sufficiently low values of activity.</description>

      <title>PRISM-FCP: Byzantine-Resilient Federated Conformal Prediction via Partial Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose PRISM-FCP (Partial shaRing and robust calIbration with Statistical Margins for Federated Conformal Prediction), a Byzantine-resilient federated conformal prediction framework that utilizes partial model sharing to improve robustness against Byzantine attacks during both model training and conformal calibration. Existing approaches address adversarial behavior only in the calibration stage, leaving the learned model susceptible to poisoned updates. In contrast, PRISM-FCP mitigates attacks end-to-end. During training, clients partially share updates by transmitting only $M$ of $D$ parameters per round. This attenuates the expected energy of an adversary's perturbation in the aggregated update by a factor of $M/D$, yielding lower mean-square error (MSE) and tighter prediction intervals. During calibration, clients convert nonconformity scores into characterization vectors, compute distance-based maliciousness scores, and downweight or filter suspected Byzantine contributions before estimating the conformal quantile. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and the UCI Superconductivity dataset demonstrate that PRISM-FCP maintains nominal coverage guarantees under Byzantine attacks while avoiding the interval inflation observed in standard FCP with reduced communication, providing a robust and communication-efficient approach to federated uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations for Stochastic Evolution Equations in the Critical Variational Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16622v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the weak convergence approach, we prove the large deviation principle (LDP) for solutions to quasilinear stochastic evolution equations with small Gaussian noise in the critical variational setting, a recently developed general variational framework. No additional assumptions are made apart from those required for well-posedness. In particular, no monotonicity is required, nor a compact embedding in the Gelfand triple. Moreover, we allow for flexible growth of the diffusion coefficient, including gradient noise. This leads to numerous applications for which the LDP was not established yet, in particular equations on unbounded domains with gradient noise. Since our framework includes the 2D Navier-Stokes and Boussinesq equations with gradient noise and unbounded domains, our results resolve an open problem that has remained unsolved for over 15 years.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08691v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove large deviation principles for the empirical measures associated with the Independent Metropolis Hastings (IMH) sampler and the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA). These are the first large deviation results for empirical measures of Markov chains arising from specific Metropolis-Hastings methods on a continuous state space. Moreover, we show that the existing large deviation framework, that we developed in a previous work (Milinanni and Nyquist, 2024), does not cover the Random Walk Metropolis sampler, even in cases when the underlying Markov chain is geometrically ergodic.</description>

      <title>The multinomial dimer model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dimer model is a classical statistical mechanics model which is exactly solvable in two dimensions, but about which little is known in higher dimensions. In analogy with large $N$ limits in lattice gauge theory, we study a large $N$ limit of the dimer model in any dimension $d$. The dependence on $N$ comes from the multinomial tiling model introduced by Kenyon and Pohoata, which gives a general framework for adding a dependence on $N$ to a tiling model. We study the behavior of this model on periodic bipartite graphs in ${\mathbb R}^d$, in the scaling limit as the multiplicity $N$ and then the size of the graph go to infinity.
  In this iterated limit, in any dimension $d$, we prove a variational principle and show that random configurations concentrate on a limit shape which is the unique solution to an associated system of Euler-Lagrange equations. The rate function of the variational principle is the integral of a surface tension function, which we can compute explicitly for lattices in any dimension $d$ as the Legendre dual of the free energy for the model on the torus. We give a unified methodology for computing the surface tension and Euler-Lagrange equations in any dimension $d$.
  A new structure called the critical gauge also emerges in the large $N$ limit. We show that the critical gauge functions converges in the scaling limit to a limiting gauge function which is the unique solution to a dual Euler-Lagrange equation. This limiting gauge function determines the limit shape and vice versa.
  We further use our techniques to compute explicit limit shapes in some two and three dimensional examples, such as the Aztec diamond and "Aztec cuboid". This is one of the first stat mech models in dimensions $d\ge3$ where limit shapes can be computed explicitly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the Stochastic Sandpile Model on finite graphs, with two main results. First, we describe a procedure to exactly sample from the stationary distribution of the model in all connected finite graphs, extending a result obtained by Levine and Liang for Activated Random Walks. Then, we study the model on the complete graph with a number of vertices tending to infinity and show that the stationary density tends to $1/2$. Along the way, we introduce a new point of view on the dynamics of the model, with active and sleeping particles, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Perturbative renormalisation of the $\Phi^4_{4-\varepsilon}$ model via generalized Wick maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the perturbative renormalisation of the $\Phi^4_d$ model from Euclidean Quantum Field Theory for any, possibly non-integer dimension $d&lt;4$. The so-called BPHZ renormalisation, named after Bogoliubov, Parasiuk, Hepp and Zimmermann, is usually encoded into extraction-contraction operations on Feynman diagrams, which have a complicated combinatorics. We show that the same procedure can be encoded in the much simpler algebra of polynomials in two unknowns $X$ and $Y$, which represent the fourth and second Wick power of the field. In this setting, renormalisation takes the form of a \lq\lq Wick map\rq\rq\ which maps monomials into Bell polynomials. The construction makes use of recent results by Bruned and Hou on multiindices, which are algebraic objects of intermediate complexity between Feynman diagrams and polynomials.</description>

      <title>Sobolev multipliers and fractional Gaussian fields on Lipschitz boundaries with applications to deterministic and random acoustic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by Applied Physics and Photonics studies of random resonators, we study in the stochastic part of this paper random acoustic operators in non-smooth bounded domains $G \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and introduce m-dissipative impedance boundary conditions containing (eigenfunction) fractional Gaussian fields. The deterministic part of the paper constructs and studies the spaces of pointwise multipliers on Lipschitz boundaries $\partial G$, as well as the spaces of Sobolev (distribution-type) multipliers on boundaries $\partial G$ of better regularity. These multipliers are used as generalized impedance coefficients $\zeta$ in impedance boundary conditions $\zeta p = \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{v}$ accompanying the 1st order acoustic system. We study the m-dissipativity of associated acoustic operators and the discreteness of their spectra aiming the main efforts on the weakest possible assumptions on the regularity of $\zeta$. In order to pass from deterministic results to the randomization, we introduce fractional Gaussian fields (FGFs) on Lipschitz boundaries $\partial G$ and study their regularity. To this end, we prove that a rough Weyl-type asymptotics takes place for the Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalues on arbitrary compact Lipschitz boundary $\partial G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $ \tt W^{-\dd,k}$ be the local negative Sobolev space on $\R^d$ with indexes $\dd \in [0,\infty)$ and $k\in [1,\infty].$ We study McKean-Vlasov SDEs with interaction kernels in $\tt W^{-\dd,k}.$ By developing a time-shift argument which allows the singular interactions vanishing at time $0$, the global well-posedness is proved for regular enough initial distributions and any singular indexes $(\dd,k)\in [0,\infty)\times [1,\infty],$ and
  for any initial distributions provided $\dd+\ff d k&lt;1$. Moreover, the relative entropy and the $\|\cdot\|_{\dd,k*}$-distance induced by $ \tt W^{-\dd,k}$ are estimated for the time-marginal distributions of solutions by using the Wasserstein distance of initial distributions, which describe the regularity of the solution in initial distribution. In particular, the main results apply to Nemytskii-type SDEs depending on higher order derivatives of density functions,
  as well as McKean-Vlasov SDEs with interactions more singular than Riesz kernels.</description>

      <title>Convergence of gradient descent for deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16462v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a simple local Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) criterion that guarantees linear (exponential) convergence of gradient flow and gradient descent to a zero-loss solution of a nonnegative objective. We then verify this criterion for the squared training loss of a feedforward neural network with smooth, strictly increasing activation functions, in a regime that is complementary to the usual over-parameterized analyses: the network width and depth are fixed, while the input data vectors are assumed to be linearly independent (in particular, the ambient input dimension is at least the number of data points). A notable feature of the verification is that it is constructive: it leads to a simple "positive" initialization (zero first-layer weights, strictly positive hidden-layer weights, and sufficiently large output-layer weights) under which gradient descent provably converges to an interpolating global minimizer of the training loss. We also discuss a probabilistic corollary for random initializations, clarify its dependence on the probability of the required initialization event, and provide numerical experiments showing that this theory-guided initialization can substantially accelerate optimization relative to standard random initializations at the same width.</description>

      <title>Assouad-like dimensions of a class of random Moran measures II -- non-homogeneous Moran sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the almost sure values of the $\Phi$-dimensions of random measures $\mu$ supported on random Moran sets in $\R^d$ that satisfy a uniform separation condition. This paper generalizes earlier work done on random measures on homogeneous Moran sets \cite{HM} to the case of unequal scaling factors. The $\Phi$-dimensions are intermediate Assouad-like dimensions with the (quasi-)Assouad dimensions and the $\theta$-Assouad spectrum being special cases.
  The almost sure value of $\dim_\Phi \mu$ exhibits a threshold phenomena, with one value for ``large'' $\Phi$ (with the quasi-Assouad dimension as an example of a ``large'' dimension) and another for ``small'' $\Phi$ (with the Assouad dimension as an example of a ``small'' dimension). We give many applications, including where the scaling factors are fixed and the probabilities are uniformly distributed. The almost sure $\Phi$ dimension of the underlying random set is also a consequence of our results.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates the combinatorial structures underlying cyclic conditional freeness and introduces cumulants that serve to linearize the cyclic conditional additive convolution. In the process, we establish the notion of "cyclic freeness", demonstrating its equivalence to infinitesimal freeness in the presence of tracial states. Furthermore, we show that cyclic conditional freeness can be reduced to cyclic freeness through a multivariate extension of the inverse Markov-Krein transform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a short rate model in continuous time that adds one or more memory (delay) components to the Merton model (Merton 1970, 1973) or the Vasi\v{c}ek model (Vasi\v{c}ek 1977) for the short rate. The distribution of the short rate in this model is normal, with the mean depending on past values of the short rate, and a limiting distribution exists for certain values of the parameters. The zero coupon bond price is an affine function of the short rate, whose coefficients satisfy a system of delay differential equations. This system can be solved analytically, obtaining a closed formula. An analytical expression for the instantaneous forward rate is given: it satisfies the risk neutral dynamics of the Heath-Jarrow-Morton model. Formulae for both forward looking and backward looking caplets on overnight risk free rates are presented. Finally, the proposed model is calibrated against forward looking caplets on SONIA rates and the United States yield curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with deformed Wigner random matrices. These matrices are closely related to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): weight matrices of trained DNNs could be represented in the form $R + S$, where $R$ is random and $S$ is highly correlated. The spectrum of such matrices plays a key role in rigorous underpinning of the novel pruning technique based on Random Matrix Theory. In practice, the spectrum of the matrix $S$ can be rather complicated. In this paper, we develop an asymptotic analysis for the case of full rank $S$ with increasing number of outlier eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a queueing-based sampling framework for continuous-time temporal networks. We focus on a Markovian parametrization in which link start times follow a homogeneous Poisson process and link durations are exponentially distributed. We derive stochastic properties of the resulting link streams and exploit them to generate synthetic temporal networks with controllable smoothness and prescribed event patterns, relevant for the validation and interpretation of methods for community, scale, change-point, and periodicity detection. By coupling this temporal mechanism with block-structured endpoint distributions, we obtain a continuous-time analogue of stochastic block models. We also discuss extensions of the framework, including discrete-time and instantaneous-contact limits.</description>

      <title>Majority-Logic Decoding of Binary Locally Recoverable Codes: A Probabilistic Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Locally repairable codes (LRCs) were originally introduced to enable efficient recovery from erasures in distributed storage systems by accessing only a small number of other symbols. While their structural properties-such as bounds and constructions-have been extensively studied, the performance of LRCs under random erasures and errors has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study the error- and erasure-correction performance of binary linear LRCs under majority-logic decoding (MLD). Focusing on LRCs with fixed locality and varying availability, we derive explicit upper bounds on the probability of decoding failure over the memoryless Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) and Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). Our analysis characterizes the behavior of the bit-error rate (BER) and block-error rate (BLER) as functions of the locality and availability parameters. We show that, under mild growth conditions on the availability, the block decoding failure probability vanishes asymptotically, and that majority-logic decoding can successfully correct virtually all of error and erasure patterns of weight linear in the blocklength. The results reveal a substantial gap between worst-case guarantees and typical performance under stochastic channel models.</description>

Abstract: We study the almost sure convergence of the Stochastic Approximation algorithm to the fixed point $x^\star$ of a nonlinear operator under a negative drift condition and a general noise sequence with finite $p$-th moment for some $p &gt; 1$. Classical almost sure convergence results of Stochastic Approximation are mostly analyzed for the square-integrable noise setting, and it is shown that any non-summable but square-summable step size sequence is sufficient to obtain almost sure convergence. However, such a limitation prevents wider algorithmic application. In particular, many applications in Machine Learning and Operations Research admit heavy-tailed noise with infinite variance, rendering such guarantees inapplicable. On the other hand, when a stronger condition on the noise is available, such guarantees on the step size would be too conservative, as practitioners would like to pick a larger step size for a more preferable convergence behavior. To this end, we show that any non-summable but $p$-th power summable step size sequence is sufficient to guarantee almost sure convergence, covering the gap in the literature.
  Our guarantees are obtained using a universal Lyapunov drift argument. For the regime $p \in (1, 2)$, we show that using the Lyapunov function $\norm{x-x^\star}^p$ and applying a Taylor-like bound suffice. For $p &gt; 2$, such an approach is no longer applicable, and therefore, we introduce a novel iterate projection technique to control the nonlinear terms produced by high-moment bounds and multiplicative noise. We believe our proof techniques and their implications could be of independent interest and pave the way for finite-time analysis of Stochastic Approximation under a general noise condition.</description>
