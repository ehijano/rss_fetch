      <title>A dissipation-induced superradiant transition in a strontium cavity-QED system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), emitters and a resonator are coupled together to enable precise studies of quantum light-matter interactions. Over the past few decades, this has led to a variety of quantum technologies such as more precise inertial sensors, clocks, memories, controllable qubits, and quantum simulators. Furthermore, the intrinsically dissipative nature of cavity QED platforms makes them a natural testbed for exploring driven-dissipative phenomena in open quantum systems as well as equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions in quantum optics. One such model, the so-called cooperative resonance fluorescence (CRF) model, concerns the behavior of coherently driven emitters in the presence of collective dissipation (superradiance). Despite tremendous interest, this model has yet to be realized in a clean experimental system. Here we provide an observation of the continuous superradiant phase transition predicted in the CRF model using an ensemble of ultracold $^{88}$Sr atoms coupled to a driven high-finesse optical cavity on a long-lived optical transition. Below a critical drive, atoms quickly reach a steady state determined by the self-balancing of the drive and the collective dissipation. The steady state possesses a macroscopic dipole moment and corresponds to a superradiant phase. Above a critical drive strength, the atoms undergo persistent Rabi-like oscillations until other decoherence processes kick in. In fact, our platform also allows us to witness the change of this phase transition from second to first order induced by single-particle spontaneous emission, which pushes the system towards a different steady state. Our observations are a first step towards finer control of driven-dissipative systems, which have been predicted to generate quantum states that can be harnessed for quantum information processing and in particular quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Calculating the energy profile of an enzymatic reaction on a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) provides a promising avenue toward enabling quantum chemistry calculations, which are classically impossible due to a computational complexity that increases exponentially with system size. As fully fault-tolerant algorithms and hardware, for which an exponential speedup is predicted, are currently out of reach, recent research efforts are dedicated to developing and scaling algorithms for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices to showcase the practical utility of such machines. To demonstrate the utility of NISQ devices in the field of chemistry, we apply our recently developed FAST-VQE algorithm and a novel quantum gate reduction strategy based on propositional satisfiability together with standard optimization tools for the simulation of the rate-determining proton transfer step for CO2 hydration catalysed by carbonic anhydrase resulting in the first application of a quantum computing device for the simulation of an enzymatic reaction. To this end, we have combined classical force field simulations with quantum mechanical methods on classical and quantum computers in a hybrid calculation approach. The presented technique significantly enhances the accuracy and capabilities of QC-based molecular modeling and finally pushes it into compelling and realistic applications. The framework is general and can be applied beyond the case of computational enzymology.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer codes for Heisenberg-limited many-body Hamiltonian estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating many-body Hamiltonians has wide applications in quantum technology. By allowing coherent evolution of quantum systems and entanglement across multiple probes, the precision of estimating a fully connected $k$-body interaction can scale up to $(n^kt)^{-1}$, where $n$ is the number of probes and $t$ is the probing time. However, the optimal scaling may no longer be achievable under quantum noise, and it is important to apply quantum error correction in order to recover this limit. In this work, we study the performance of stabilizer quantum error correcting codes in estimating many-body Hamiltonians under noise. When estimating a fully connected $ZZZ$ interaction under single-qubit noise, we showcase three families of stabilizer codes -- thin surface codes, quantum Reed--Muller codes and Shor codes -- that achieve the scalings of $(nt)^{-1}$, $(n^2t)^{-1}$ and $(n^3t)^{-1}$, respectively, all of which are optimal with $t$. We further discuss the relation between stabilizer structure and the scaling with $n$, and identify several no-go theorems. For instance, we find codes with constant-weight stabilizer generators can at most achieve the $n^{-1}$ scaling, while the optimal $n^{-3}$ scaling is achievable if and only if the code bears a repetition code substructure, like in Shor code.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking bosonic and fermionic dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog quantum simulation allows for assessing static and dynamical properties of strongly correlated quantum systems to high precision. To perform simulations outside the reach of classical computers, accurate and reliable implementations of the anticipated Hamiltonians are required. To achieve those, characterization and benchmarking tools are a necessity. For digital quantum devices, randomized benchmarking can provide a benchmark on the average quality of the implementation of a gate set. In this work, we introduce a versatile framework for randomized analog benchmarking of bosonic and fermionic quantum devices implementing particle number preserving dynamics. The scheme makes use of the restricted operations which are native to analog simulators and other continuous variable systems. Importantly, like randomized benchmarking, it is robust against state preparation and measurement errors. We discuss the scheme's efficiency, derive theoretical performance guarantees and showcase the protocol with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of phase transitions in quantum control landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control landscape phase transitions (CLPTs) occur as abrupt changes in the cost function landscape upon varying a control parameter, and can be revealed by non-analytic points in statistical order parameters. A prime example are quantum speed limits (QSL) which mark the onset of controllability as the protocol duration is increased. Here we lay the foundations of an analytical theory for CLPTs by developing Dyson, Magnus, and cumulant expansions for the cost function that capture the behavior of CLPTs with a controlled precision. Using linear and quadratic stability analysis, we reveal that CLPTs can be associated with different types of instabilities of the optimal protocol. This allows us to explicitly relate CLPTs to critical structural rearrangements in the extrema of the control landscape: utilizing path integral methods from statistical field theory, we trace back the critical scaling of the order parameter at the QSL to the topological and geometric properties of the set of optimal protocols, such as the number of connected components and its dimensionality. We verify our predictions by introducing a numerical sampling algorithm designed to explore this optimal set via a homotopic stochastic update rule. We apply this new toolbox explicitly to analyze CLPTs in the single- and two-qubit control problems whose landscapes are analytically tractable, and compare the landscapes for bang-bang and continuous protocols. Our work provides the first steps towards a systematic theory of CLPTs and paves the way for utilizing statistical field theory techniques for generic complex control landscapes.</description>

      <title>Bosonic randomized benchmarking with passive transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized benchmarking (RB) is the most commonly employed protocol for the characterization of unitary operations in quantum circuits due to its reasonable experimental requirements and robustness against state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. So far, the protocol has been limited to discrete or fermionic systems, whereas extensions to bosonic systems have been unclear for a long time due to challenges arising from the underlying infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In this work, we close this gap and develop an RB protocol for passive Gaussian transformations, which we call bosonic passive RB. The protocol is based on the recently developed filtered RB framework and is designed to isolate the multitude of exponential decays arising for bosonic systems. We give explicit formulas and a Julia implementation for the necessary post-processing of the experimental data. We also analyze the sampling complexity of bosonic passive RB by deriving analytical expressions for the variance. They show a mild scaling with the number of modes, suggesting that bosonic passive RB is experimentally feasible for a moderate number of modes. We focus on experimental settings involving Fock states and particle number resolving measurements, but also discuss Gaussian settings, deriving first results for heterodyne measurements.</description>

      <title>Notes on solvable models of many-body quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of many body chaotic models related to the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. An emergent symmetry maps the quantum dynamics into a classical stochastic process. Thus we are able to study many dynamical properties at finite N on an arbitrary graph structure. A comprehensive study of operator size growth with or without spatial locality is presented. We will show universal behaviors emerge at large N limit, and compare them with field theory method. We also design simple stochastic processes as an intuitive way of thinking about many-body chaotic behaviors. Other properties including entanglement growth and other variants of this solvable models are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We consider interpretative problems of models of physical reality including quantum information phenomenon in the context of Heisenberg's classification of the fundamental physical theoretic models under the role universal constants Planck's constant h and speed of light c and correspondence principle. We introduce hypothesis of quantum space of directly unobserved relations, which precede correlations in the 'classical' Minkowski space-time and are compatible with Reichenbach common cause principle. Finally, we present Chyli\'nski's idea of quantum relational continuum space, which predicts potentially measurable effects for the bound states.</description>

      <title>Exact spectral gaps of random one-dimensional quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral gap of local random quantum circuits is a fundamental property that determines how close the moments of the circuit's unitaries match those of a Haar random distribution. When studying spectral gaps, it is common to bound these quantities using tools from statistical mechanics or via quantum information-based inequalities. By focusing on the second moment of one-dimensional unitary circuits where nearest neighboring gates act on sets of qudits (with open and closed boundary conditions), we show that one can exactly compute the associated spectral gaps. Indeed, having access to their functional form allows us to prove several important results, such as the fact that the spectral gap for closed boundary condition is exactly the square of the gap for open boundaries, as well as improve on previously known bounds for approximate design convergence. Finally, we verify our theoretical results by numerically computing the spectral gap for systems of up to 70 qubits, as well as comparing them to gaps of random orthogonal and symplectic circuits.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Quantum Fourier Transformation (QFT) Kernels for Modern NISQ and FT Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid development in quantum computing leads to the appearance of several quantum applications. Quantum Fourier Transformation (QFT) sits at the heart of many of these applications. Existing work leverages SAT solver or heuristics to generate a hardware-compliant circuit for QFT by inserting SWAP gates to remap logical qubits to physical qubits. However, they might face problems such as long compilation time due to the huge search space for SAT solver or suboptimal outcome in terms of the number of cycles to finish all gate operations. In this paper, we propose a domain-specific hardware mapping approach for QFT. We unify our insight of relaxed ordering and unit exploration in QFT to search for a qubit mapping solution with the help of program synthesis tools. Our method is the first one that guarantees linear-depth QFT circuits for Google Sycamore, IBM heavy-hex, and the lattice surgery, with respect to the number of qubits. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, our method can save up to 53% in SWAP gate and 92% in depth.</description>

      <title>Quantum Property Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum property preservation (QPP) is the problem of maintaining a target property of a quantum system for as long as possible. This problem arises naturally in the context of open quantum systems subject to decoherence. Here, we develop a general theory to formalize and analyze QPP. We characterize properties encoded as scalar functions of the system state that can be preserved time-locally via continuous control using smoothly varying, time-dependent control Hamiltonians. The theory offers an intuitive geometric interpretation involving the level sets of the target property and the stable and unstable points related to the noise channel. We present solutions for various noise channels and target properties, which are classified as trivially controllable, uncontrollable, or controllable. In the controllable scenario, we demonstrate the existence of control Hamiltonian singularities and breakdown times, beyond which property preservation fails. QPP via Hamiltonian control is complementary to quantum error correction, as it does not require ancilla qubits or rely on measurement and feedback. It is also complementary to dynamical decoupling, since it uses only smooth Hamiltonians without pulsing and works in the regime of Markovian open system dynamics. From the perspective of control theory, this work addresses the challenge of tracking control for open quantum systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that swallowtail catastrophe consisting of various-order non-Hermitian and Hermitian degeneracies naturally exists in the dynamics of two-mode driven-dissipative quadrature squeezing systems that break pseudo-Hermiciticy by judiciously engineered losses. We reveal that the swallowtail degeneracy structure enables nontrivial braiding of complex eigenvalues by looping around an exceptional line in the parameter space. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the degeneracy geometry in two-mode driven-dissipative bosonic quadratic systems, opening new pathways toward topologically nontrivial control of Gaussian states.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the time evolution of the Bloch vector of the thermal multi-photon Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) and discuss the following two facts. First, we consider a plot that consists of points of a trajectory of the Bloch vector of the multi-photon JCM for a discrete-time sequence with a constant time interval. We show that this plot is invariant under a scale transformation of the finite but not zero interval of the time. Second, we numerically evaluate values of the time when the absolute value of the $z$-component of the Bloch vector is nearly equal to zero. We demonstrate that some values of the time can be derived with denominators of fractions of the Diophantine approximation for irrational numbers. The origin of those phenomena is that the components of the Bloch vector for thermal multi-photon JCM cannot be described with the Fourier series.</description>

      <title>Harvesting asymmetric steering via non-identical detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate asymmetric steering harvesting phenomenon involving two non-identical inertial detectors with different energy gaps, which interact locally with vacuum massless scalar fields. Our study assumes that the energy gap of detector $B$ exceeds that of detector $A$. It is shown that $A\rightarrow B$ steerability is bigger that $B\rightarrow A$ steerability, implying that the observer with a small energy gap has more stronger steerability than the other one. We find that the energy gap difference can enlarge the harvesting-achievable range of $A\rightarrow B$ steering, while it can also narrow the harvesting-achievable range of $B\rightarrow A$ steering at the same time. In addition, the maximal steering asymmetry indicates the transformation between two-way steering and one-way steering in some cases, showing that $B\rightarrow A$ steering suffers ``sudden death" at the point of this parameter. These results suggest that asymmetric steering exhibits richer and more interesting properties than quantum entanglement harvested from vacuum quantum field.</description>

      <title>Designing elegant Bell inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elegant Bell inequality is well known for its much exploited property, being maximally violated by maximal entanglement, mutually unbiased bases, and symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measure elements. It is the only one with such property known so far. We present a method to construct Bell inequalities with violation feature analogous to original elegant Bell inequality in high dimension from a simple analytic quantum bound. A Bell inequality with such feature is derived in three dimension for the first time. It shows larger violation than existing Bell inequalities of similar classes while requiring arguably small number of measurements.</description>

      <title>On estimates of trace-norm distance between quantum Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper of F.A. Mele, A.A. Mele, L. Bittel, J. Eisert, V. Giovannetti, L. Lami, L. Leone, S.F.E. Oliviero, ArXiv:2405.01431, estimates for the trace-norm distance between two quantum Gaussian states in terms of the mean vectors and covariance matrices were derived and used to evaluate the number of elements in the $\varepsilon -$net in the set of energy-constrained Gaussian states. In the present paper we obtain different estimates; our proof is based on a fidelity-like quantity which we call states overlap, and is more straightforward leading to estimates which are sometimes even more stringent, especially in the cases of pure or gauge-invariant states. They do not depend on number of modes and hence can be extended to the case of bosonic field with infinite number of modes. These derivations are not aimed to replace the useful inequalities from ArXiv:2405.01431; they just show an alternative approach to the problem leading to different results. The problem studied in this paper can be considered as a noncommutative analog of estimation of the total variance distance between Gaussian probability distributions in the classical probability theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points are the branch-point singularities of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, and have rich consequences in open-system dynamics. While the exceptional points and their critical phenomena are widely studied in the non-Hermitian settings without quantum jumps, they also emerge in open quantum systems depicted by the Lindblad master equations, wherein they are identified as the degeneracies in the Liouvillian eigenspectrum. These Liouvillian exceptional points often have distinct properties compared to their counterparts in non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, leading to fundamental modifications of the steady states or the steady-state-approaching dynamics. Since the Liouvillian exceptional points widely exist in quantum systems such as the atomic vapours, superconducting qubits, and ultracold ions and atoms, they have received increasing amount of attention of late. Here we present a brief review on an important aspect of the dynamic consequence of Liouvillian exceptional points, namely the chiral state transfer induced by the parametric encircling the Liouvillian exceptional points. Our review focuses on the theoretical description and experimental observation of the phenomena in atomic systems that are experimentally accessible. We also discuss the on-going effort to unveil the collective dynamic phenomena close to the Liouvillian exceptional points, as a consequence of the many-body effects therein. Formally, these phenomena are the quantum-many-body counterparts to those in classical open systems with nonlinearity, but hold intriguing new potentials for quantum applications.</description>

      <title>How to use the dispersion in the $\chi^{(3)}$ tensor for broadband generation of polarization-entangled photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization-entangled photon pairs are a widely used resource in quantum optics and technologies, and are often produced using a nonlinear process. Most sources based on spontaneous parametric downconversion have relatively narrow optical bandwidth because the pump, signal and idler frequencies must satisfy a phase-matching condition. Extending the bandwidth, for example to achieve spectral multiplexing, requires changing some experimental parameters such as temperature, crystal angle, poling period, etc. Here, we demonstrate broadband (tens of THz for each photon) generation of polarization-entangled photon pairs by spontaneous four-wave mixing in a diamond crystal, with a simple colinear geometry requiring no further optical engineering. Our approach leverages the quantum interference between electronic and vibrational contributions to the $\chi^{(3)}$ tensor. Entanglement is characterized in a single realization of a Bell test over the entire bandwidth using fiber dispersion spectroscopy and fast single-photon detectors. The results agree with the biphoton wavefunction predicted from the knowledge of the $\chi^{(3)}$ and Raman tensors and demonstrate the general applicability of our approach to other crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Upper Bound on Locally Extractable Energy from Entangled Pure State under Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an effective thermodynamics for multipartite entangled pure states and derive an upper bound on extractable energy with feedback control from a subsystem under a local Hamiltonian. The inequality that gives the upper bound corresponds to the second law of information thermodynamics in our effective thermodynamics. In addition, we derive a more general bound that is determined only by an initial state and the local Hamiltonian. This bound gives an explicit relationship between the extractable energy and the entanglement structure of the initial state. We also investigate the tightness of the upper bounds and show that the bounds can be achieved in a simple example.</description>

      <title>Quantum gates between distant atoms mediated by a Rydberg excitation antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel protocol to implement quantum gates between distant atomic qubits connected by an array of neutral atoms playing the role of a quantum bus. The protocol is based on adiabatically transferring the atoms in the array to an antiferromagnetic-like state of Rydberg excitations using chirped laser pulses. Upon exciting and de-exciting the atoms in the array under the blockage of nearest neighbors, depending on the state of the two qubits, the system acquires a conditional geometric $\pi$-phase, while the dynamical phase cancels exactly, even when the atomic positions are disordered but nearly frozen in time, which requires sufficiently low temperatures. For van der Waals interacting atoms, under the optimal parameters of the pulses minimizing the Rydberg-state decay and non-adiabatic errors, the gate infidelity scales with the distance $L$ and the number of atoms $N$ between the qubits as $\sim L^6/N^3$. Hence, increasing the number of atoms in the quantum bus connecting the qubits at a given spatial separation will lead to higher gate fidelity.</description>

      <title>Genuinely nonlocal sets without entanglement in multipartite systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of multipartite orthogonal states is genuinely nonlocal if it is locally indistinguishable in every bipartition of the subsystems. If the set is locally reducible, we say it has genuine nonlocality of type \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral 1}. Otherwise, we say it has genuine nonlocality of type \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral 2}. Due to the complexity of the problem, the construction of genuinely nonlocal sets in general multipartite systems has not been completely solved so far. In this paper, we first provide a nonlocal set of product states in bipartite systems. We obtain a genuinely nonlocal set of type~\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral 1} without entanglement in general $n$-partite systems $\otimes^{n}_{i=1}\mathbb{C}^{d_{i}}$ $[3\leq (d_{1}-1)\leq d_{2}\leq \cdots\leq d_{n},n\geq3]$. Then we present two constructions with genuine nonlocality of type~\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral 2} in $\mathbb{C}^{d_{1}}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d_{2}}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d_{3}}$ $(3\leq d_{1}\leq d_{2}\leq d_{3})$ and $\otimes^{n}_{i=1}\mathbb{C}^{d_{i}}$ $(3\leq d_{1}\leq d_{2}\leq \cdots\leq d_{n},n\geq4)$. Our results further positively answer the open problem that there does exist a genuinely nonlocal set of type~\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2} in multipartite systems [M. S. Li, Y. L. Wang, F. Shi, and M. H. Yung, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 54, 445301 (2021)] and highlight its related applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Losses resistant verification of quantum non-Gaussian photon statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum non-Gaussian states of light have fundamental properties that are essential for a multitude of applications in quantum technology. However, many of these features are difficult to detect using standard criteria due to optical losses and detector inefficiency. As the statistics of light are unknown, the loss correction on the data is unreliable, despite the fact that the losses can be precisely measured. To address this issue, we employ a loss-mitigated verification technique utilising quantum non-Gaussian witnesses, which incorporate the known optical losses and detector inefficiency into their derivation. This approach allows us to address the considerable challenge of experimentally demonstrating unheralded quantum non-Gaussian states of single photons and photon pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently [PRA 108, L051501 (2023)], it has been shown that in a centrosymmetric cubic system, two-photons from a broadband intense laser field can be converted into a pair of Stokes and anti-Stokes entangled photons. Here we properly explain, demonstrate, quantify (for diamond) and explore the possibilities offered by such system, designing an entanglement map based on changes in the light-matter system. In particular, we show how the broadband polarization entanglement, that emerges from the interference between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the four-wave mixing process, depends on parameters such as Stokes-anti-Stokes Raman shift, scattering geometry and laser bandwidth, opening the avenue of exploration of such phenomenon in information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin ensembles are promising quantum technological platforms, but their utility relies on the ability to perform quantum error correction (QEC) for the specific decoherence in these systems. Typical QEC for ensembles requires addressing individually resolved qubits, but this is practically challenging in most realistic architectures. Here, we propose QEC schemes for unresolvable spin ensembles. By using degenerate superpositions of excited states, which are fundamentally mixed, we find codes that can protect against both individual and collective errors, including dephasing, decay, and pumping. We show how information recovery can be achieved with only collective measurement and control, and illustrate its applications in extending memory lifetime and loss-tolerant sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a short topical review, this article reports progress on the generalization and applications of entanglement in non-Hermitian quantum systems. We begin by examining the realization of non-Hermitian quantum systems through the Lindblad master equation, alongside a review of typical non-Hermitian free-fermion systems that exhibit unique features. A pedagogical discussion is provided on the relationship between entanglement quantities and the correlation matrix in Hermitian systems. Building on this foundation, we focus on how entanglement concepts are extended to non-Hermitian systems from their Hermitian free-fermion counterparts, with a review of the general properties that emerge. Finally, we highlight various applications, demonstrating that entanglement entropy remains a powerful diagnostic tool for characterizing non-Hermitian physics. The entanglement spectrum also reflects the topological characteristics of non-Hermitian topological systems, while unique non-Hermitian entanglement behaviors are also discussed. The review is concluded with several future directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an advanced quantum super-resolution imaging technique based on photon statistics measurement and its accurate modeling. Our reconstruction algorithm adapts to any kind of non-Poissonian emitters, outperforming the corresponding classical SOFI method. It offers sub-diffraction resolution improvement that scales with the $\sqrt{j}$, where $j$ is the highest order central moments of the photocounts. More remarkably, in combination with structured illumination a linear improvement with j can be reached. Through simulations and experiments, we prove our method's clear superiority over traditional SOFI, especially in low excitation light conditions, providing a promising avenue for non-invasive super-resolution microscopy of delicate samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have been used extensively for high-sensitivity nanoscale sensing, but conventional approaches use confocal microscopy to measure individual centers sequentially, limiting throughput and access to non-local physical properties. Here we design and implement a multiplexed NV sensing platform that allows us to read out many single NV centers simultaneously using a low-noise camera. Using this platform, we coherently manipulate and read out the spin states of hundreds of individual NV centers in parallel, achieving comparable magnetic field sensitivity to confocal measurements. We also implement a parallelized version of spin-to-charge-conversion readout for low NV center spin state readout noise and use it to demonstrate multiplexed covariance magnetometry, in which we measure six two-point magnetic field correlators from four NV centers simultaneously. The number of correlators we can measure is limited only by the available laser power, opening the door to massively multiplexed covariance magnetometry. Our platform significantly increases the throughput and broadens the applications of nanoscale sensing using diamond quantum sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixers play a crucial role in superconducting quantum computing, primarily by facilitating frequency conversion of signals to enable precise control and readout of quantum states. However, imperfections, particularly carrier leakage and unwanted sideband signal, can significantly compromise control fidelity. To mitigate these defects, regular and precise mixer calibrations are indispensable, yet they pose a formidable challenge in large-scale quantum control. Here, we introduce an in situ calibration technique and outcome-focused mixer calibration scheme using superconducting qubits. Our method leverages the qubit's response to imperfect signals, allowing for calibration without modifying the wiring configuration. We experimentally validate the efficacy of this technique by benchmarking single-qubit gate fidelity and qubit coherence time.</description>

      <title>Faster Quantum Simulation Of Markovian Open Quantum Systems Via Randomisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems with quantum computers, it is essential to accurately approximate the system's behaviour while preserving the physicality of its evolution. Traditionally, for Markovian open quantum systems, this has been achieved using first and second-order Trotter-Suzuki product formulas or probabilistic algorithms. In this work, we introduce novel non-probabilistic algorithms for simulating Markovian open quantum systems using randomisation. Our methods, including first and second-order randomised Trotter-Suzuki formulas and the QDRIFT channel, not only maintain the physicality of the system's evolution but also enhance the scalability and precision of quantum simulations. We derive error bounds and step count limits for these techniques, bypassing the need for the mixing lemma typically employed in Hamiltonian simulation proofs. We also present two implementation approaches for these randomised algorithms: classical sampling and quantum forking, demonstrating their gate complexity advantages over deterministic Trotter-Suzuki product formulas. This work is the first to apply randomisation techniques to the simulation of open quantum systems, highlighting their potential to enable faster and more accurate simulations.</description>

      <title>Criteria of absolutely separability from spectrum for qudit-qudits states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Separability from the spectrum is a significant and ongoing research topic in quantum entanglement. In this study, we investigate properties related to absolute separability from the spectrum in qudits-qudits states in the bipartite states space $\mathcal{H}_{mn}=\mathcal{H}_m \otimes \mathcal{H}_n$. Firstly, we propose the necessary and sufficient conditions for absolute separable states in the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{4n}$. These conditions are equivalent to the positive semidefiniteness of twelve matrices resulting from the symmetric matricizations of eigenvalues. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this sufficient condition can be extended to the general $\mathcal{H}_{mn}$ case, improving existing conclusions in the literature. These sufficient conditions depend only on the first few leading and last few leading eigenvalues, significantly reducing the complexity of determining absolute separable states. On the other hand, we also introduce additional sufficient conditions for determining that states in $\mathcal{H}_{mn}$ are not absolutely separable. These conditions only depend on $2m-1$ eigenvalues of the mixed states. Our sufficient conditions are not only simple and easy to implement. As applications, we derive distance bounds for eigenvalues and purity bounds for general absolutely separable states.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As superconducting quantum computing continues to advance at an unprecedented pace, there is a compelling demand for the innovation of specialized electronic instruments that act as crucial conduits between quantum processors and host computers. Here, we introduce a Microwave Measurement and Control System (M2CS) dedicated for large-scale superconducting quantum processors. M2CS features a compact modular design that balances overall performance, scalability, and flexibility. Electronic tests of M2CS show key metrics comparable to commercial instruments. Benchmark tests on transmon superconducting qubits further show qubit coherence and gate fidelities comparable to state-of-the-art results, confirming M2CS's capability to meet the stringent requirements of quantum experiments run on intermediate-scale quantum processors. The system's compact and scalable design offers significant room for further enhancements that could accommodate the measurement and control requirements of over 1000 qubits, and can also be adopted to other quantum computing platforms such as trapped ions and silicon quantum dots. The M2CS architecture may also be applied to wider range of scenarios, such as microwave kinetic inductance detectors, as well as phased array radar systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable parallel measurement of individual nitrogen-vacancy centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11715v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a solid-state spin defect that has been widely adopted for quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Typically, experiments are performed either with a single isolated NV center or with an unresolved ensemble of many NV centers, resulting in a trade-off between measurement speed and spatial resolution or control over individual defects. In this work, we introduce an experimental platform that bypasses this trade-off by addressing multiple optically resolved NV centers in parallel. We perform charge- and spin-state manipulations selectively on multiple NV centers from within a larger set, and we manipulate and measure the electronic spin states of 10 NV centers in parallel. Further, we show that the high signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements enables the detection of shot-to-shot pairwise correlations between the spin states of 10 NV centers, corresponding to the simultaneous measurement of 45 unique correlation coefficients. We conclude by discussing how our platform can be scaled to parallel experiments with thousands of individually resolved NV centers. These results enable high-throughput experiments with individual spin defects, and provide a natural platform for the application of recently developed correlated sensing techniques.</description>

However, its processing demands significant fraction of a wireless network's resources, due to its computationally-expensive decoding process. This forces network designers to compromise between performance and implementation complexity. In this paper, we investigate a novel processing architecture for FEC decoding, one based on the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), to evaluate the potential of this emerging quantum compute approach in resolving the decoding performance-complexity tradeoff.
  We present FDeQ, a QAOA-based FEC Decoder design targeting the popular NextG wireless Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) and Polar codes. To accelerate QAOA-based decoding towards practical utility, FDeQ exploits temporal similarity among the FEC decoding tasks. This similarity is enabled by the fixed structure of a particular FEC code, which is independent of any time-varying wireless channel noise, ambient interference, and even the payload data. We evaluate FDeQ at a variety of system parameter settings in both ideal (noiseless) and noisy QAOA simulations, and show that FDeQ achieves successful decoding with error performance at par with state-of-the-art classical decoders at low FEC code block lengths. Furthermore, we present a holistic resource estimation analysis, projecting quantitative targets for future quantum devices in terms of the required qubit count and gate duration, for the application of FDeQ in practical wireless networks, highlighting scenarios where FDeQ may outperform state-of-the-art classical FEC decoders.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of operator size distribution in q-local quantum Brownian SYK and spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study operator dynamics in Brownian quantum many-body models with $q$-local interactions. The operator dynamics are characterized by the time-dependent size distribution, for which we derive an exact master equation in both the Brownian Majorana Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and the spin model for general $q$. This equation can be solved numerically for large systems. Additionally, we obtain the analytical size distribution in the large $N$ limit for arbitrary initial conditions and $q$. The distributions for both models take the same form, related to the $\chi$-squared distribution by a change of variable, and strongly depend on the initial condition. For small initial sizes, the operator dynamics are characterized by a broad distribution that narrows as the initial size increases. When the initial operator size is below $q-2$ for the Majorana model or $q-1$ for the spin model, the distribution diverges in the small size limit at all times. The mean size of all operators, which can be directly measured by the out-of-time ordered correlator, grows exponentially during the early time. In the late time regime, the mean size for a single Majorana or Pauli operator for all $q$ decays exponentially as $t e^{-t}$, much slower than all other operators, which decay as $e^{-t}$. At finite $N$, the size distribution exhibits modulo-dependent branching within a symmetry sector for the $q \geq 8$ Majorana model and the $q \geq 4$ spin model. Our results reveal universal features of operator dynamics in $q$-local quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: With the second quantum revolution underway, quantum-enhanced sensors are moving from laboratory demonstrations to field deployments, providing enhanced and even new capabilities. Signal processing and operational software is becoming integral parts of these emerging sensing systems to reap the benefits of this progress. This paper looks into widefield Nitrogen Vacancy Center-based magnetometry and focuses on estimating the magnetic field from the Optically Detected Magnetic Resonances (ODMR) signal, a crucial output for various applications. Mapping the shifts of ODMR signals to phase estimation, a computationally efficient approaches are proposed. Involving Fourier Transform and Filtering as pre-processing steps, the suggested approaches involve linear curve fit or complex frequency estimation based on well-known super-resolution technique Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT). The existing methods in the quantum sensing literature take different routes based on Lorentzian fitting for determining magnetic field maps. To showcase the functionality and effectiveness of the suggested techniques, relevant results, based on experimental data are provided, which shows a significant reduction in computational time with the proposed method over existing methods</description>

Abstract: Every new generation of mobile networks brings significant advances in two segments, enhancement of the network parameters within the legacy technologies and introduction of new technologies enabling new paradigms in designing the networks. In the first class of enhancements the effort is to increase data rates, improve energy efficiency, enhance connectivity, reduce data transmission latency etc. In the second class of innovations for 6G and 7G, we anticipate focus on optimum integration of advanced ML and AI in general, and quantum computing with the continuous interest in the satellite networks for optimal quantum key distribution . By introducing quantum technology 7G will be able to speed up computing processes in the net, enhance network security as well as to enable distributed QC, which is a new paradigm in computer sciences.
  Using advanced networks as a basic ingredient of inter system integration, here we focus only on the second segment of anticipated innovations in networking and present a survey of the subset of potential technology enablers for the above concept with special emphasis on the inter dependency of the solutions chosen in different segments of the network. In Section II, we present several anticipated 6G/7G (system of systems type) network optimization examples resulting in a new paradigm of network optimization indicating a need for quantum computing and quantum computing based optimization algorithms. In Section III we survey work on quantum cryptography and QKD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Krylov spread complexity in the context of black hole scattering by studying highly excited string states (HESS). Krylov complexity characterizes chaos by quantifying the spread of a state or operator under a known Hamiltonian. In contrast, quantum field theory often relies on S-matrices, where the Hamiltonian density becomes non-trivially time-dependent rendering the computations of complexity in Krylov basis exponentially hard. We define Krylov spread complexity for scattering amplitudes by analyzing the distribution of extrema, treating these as eigenvalues of a fictional Hamiltonian that evolves a thermo-field double state non-trivially. Our analysis of black hole scattering, through highly excited string states scattering into two or three tachyons, reveals that the Krylov complexity of these amplitudes mirrors the behavior of chaotic Hamiltonian evolution, with a pre-saturation peak indicating chaos. This formalism bridges the concepts of chaos in scattering and state evolution, offering a framework to distinguish different scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Detecting Fraudulent Services on Quantum Cloud Platforms via Dynamic Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, while accessible via cloud platforms, face challenges due to limited availability and suboptimal quality. These challenges raise the risk of cloud providers offering fraudulent services. This emphasizes the need for users to detect such fraud to protect their investments and ensure computational integrity. This study introduces a novel dynamic fingerprinting method for detecting fraudulent service provision on quantum cloud platforms, specifically targeting machine substitution and profile fabrication attacks. The dynamic fingerprint is constructed using a \textit{single} probing circuit to capture the unique error characteristics of quantum devices, making this approach practical because of its trivial computational costs. When the user examines the service, the execution results of the probing circuit act as the device-side fingerprint of the quantum device providing the service. The user then generates the user-side fingerprint by estimating the expected execution result, assuming the correct device is in use. We propose an algorithm for users to construct the user-side fingerprint with linear complexity. By comparing the device-side and user-side fingerprints, users can effectively detect fraudulent services. Our experiments on the IBM Quantum platform, involving seven devices with varying capabilities, confirm the method's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Beyond skyrmion spin texture from quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability</title>

Abstract: Topology profoundly influences diverse fields of science, providing a powerful framework for classifying phases of matter and predicting nontrivial excitations, such as solitons, vortices, and skyrmions. These topological defects are typically characterized by integer numbers, called topological charges, representing the winding number in their order parameter field. The classification and prediction of topological defects, however, become challenging when singularities are included within the integration domain for calculating the topological charge. While such exotic nonlinear excitations have been proposed in the superfluid $^3$He-A phase and spinor Bose-Einstein condensate of atomic gases, experimental observation of these structures and studies of their stability have long been elusive. Here we report the observation of a singular skyrmion that goes beyond the framework of topology in a ferromagnetic superfluid. The exotic skyrmions are sustained by undergoing anomalous symmetry breaking associated with the eccentric spin singularity and carry half of the elementary charge, distinctive from conventional skyrmions or merons. By successfully realizing the universal regime of the quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, we identified the eccentric fractional skyrmions, produced by emission from a magnetic domain wall and a spontaneous splitting of an integer skyrmion with spin singularities. The singular skyrmions are stable and can be observed after 2~s of hold time. Our results confirm the universality between classical and quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities and broaden our understanding on complex nonlinear dynamics of nontrivial texture beyond skyrmion in topological quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Plasmon Mode Engineering with Electrons on Helium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ensemble of electrons trapped above the surface of superfluid helium is a paradigm system for investigating, and controlling, the collective charge dynamics of low-dimensional electronic matter. Of particular interest is the ability to engineer the spatial and spectral structure of surface plasmon modes in this system for integration into hybrid quantum systems or circuit quantum electrodynamic device architectures. Here we present experiments on a hybrid electron-on-helium microchannel device designed to host microwave-frequency plasmon modes having a spatial structure dictated by the geometry of the microchannel confinement. The plasma oscillations are generated via local microwave frequency excitation of the electrons in the microchannel. When this excitation is resonant with a particular surface plasmon-mode it produces a non-equilibrium decrease in the electron conductance, which we detect via simultaneous transport measurements. We find that the spatial structure of the surface plasmons is in excellent agreement with our device design parameters and modeling, and their frequency can be tuned over a broad range (several GHz) by precisely varying the areal density of electrons in the channel. By measuring the plasma resonance spectrum lineshape, and its power dependence, we can quantify the level of spatial homogeneity associated with each plasmon mode. The results highlight the versatility of electrons on helium as a model system for investigating, and engineering, the collective mode structure of low-dimensional Coulomb liquid and solid states and demonstrate a viable path for integrating precisely engineered surface plasmons in electrons on helium with future hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamic systems.</description>

      <title>HiMA: Hierarchical Quantum Microarchitecture for Qubit-Scaling and Quantum Process-Level Parallelism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds immense potential for addressing a myriad of intricate challenges, which is significantly amplified when scaled to thousands of qubits. However, a major challenge lies in developing an efficient and scalable quantum control system. To address this, we propose a novel Hierarchical MicroArchitecture (HiMA) designed to facilitate qubit scaling and exploit quantum process-level parallelism. This microarchitecture is based on three core elements: (i) discrete qubit-level drive and readout, (ii) a process-based hierarchical trigger mechanism, and (iii) multiprocessing with a staggered triggering technique to enable efficient quantum process-level parallelism. We implement HiMA as a control system for a 72-qubit tunable superconducting quantum processing unit, serving a public quantum cloud computing platform, which is capable of expanding to 6144 qubits through three-layer cascading. In our benchmarking tests, HiMA achieves up to a 4.89x speedup under a 5-process parallel configuration. Consequently, to the best of our knowledge, we have achieved the highest CLOPS (Circuit Layer Operations Per Second), reaching up to 43,680, across all publicly available platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust solid-state protein junctions (RPJs) with permanent contacts are essential for a wide range of studies aimed at elucidating the mechanisms for electron transport across such junctions and their possible applications. Here we report on first time, RPJs formed with vacuum-evaporated carbon (eC) followed by Au as top electrode set on a single bilayer of bacteriorhodopsin (bR), self-assembled from so-lution on an Au substrate. The light-induced photocycle of bR, as well as the amide I &amp; II vibrational frequencies of bR, were unchanged upon eC deposition; the yield of the resulting junctions was reproducible ~ 90 % (non-shorted), and they were stable between ~ 10 and 300K. The current-voltage characteristics of these junc-tions were temperature-independent and the junctions were stable for several months. Hence, such robust all-solid-state protein junctions provide valuable tools for investigating the potential use of proteins in future bio-molecular electronic de-vices.</description>

Abstract: Circuit-based quantum devices rely on keeping electrons at millikelvin temperatures. Improved coherence and sensitivity as well as discovering new physical phenomena motivate pursuing ever lower electron temperatures, accessible using on-chip cooling techniques. Here we show that a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), manipulated using gate voltages, works as an on-chip heat sink only limited by a fundamental phonon heat-leak. A single-shot 2DEG cooler can reduce the electron temperature by a factor of two with a hold time up to a second. Integrating an array of such coolers to obtain continuous cooldown in will allow reaching down to microkelvin device temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Nuclear fission at barrier-top energies is conventionally modeled by a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation applied to internal fission channels, but that treatment is hard to justify in the configuration-interaction approach to nuclear Hamiltonians. Here we show that inclusion of states of finite momentum by the Generator Coordinate Method (GCM) considerably extends the range of energies at which GCM-based Hamiltonians could reproduce the Schr\"odinger treatment. The transmission probabilities for crossing the barrier are calculated by a discrete version of Kohn's variational method, which may also be useful for other systems of interacting fermions.</description>

      <title>Impurities in a trapped 1D Bose gas of arbitrary interaction strength: localization-delocalization transition and absence of self-localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss impurities in a trapped one-dimensional Bose gas with arbitrary boson-boson and boson-impurity interactions. To fully account for quantum effects, in particular in the regime of strong boson-boson interactions, we employ numerical simulations based on the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and analytic approximations exploiting the mapping to weakly interacting fermions. Mobile impurities in a box potential undergo a phase transition between a delocalized state and a solution localized at one of the potential edges upon increasing the impurity-boson interaction. While a mean-field ansatz based on coupled Gross-Pitaevski -- Schr\"odinger equations gives reasonable predictions of this transition, it also predicts the existence of a self-localized polaron solution, which we show to be an artifact of the underlying decoupling approximation. This demonstrates that impurity-boson correlations are important even in the limit of weak boson-boson interactions, where mean-field approaches are expected to work well. Furthermore we calculate the energy of a single polaron formed by a heavy impurity for arbitrary interaction strengths and give analytical approximations for large but finite boson-boson couplings. Finally we numerically determine the polaron-polaron interaction potential in Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which in the Tonks gas limit is oscillatory due to Friedel oscillations in the Bose gas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vlasov-Maxwell equations provide kinetic simulations of collisionless plasmas, but numerically solving them on classical computers is often impractical. This is due to the computational resource constraints imposed by the time evolution in the 6-dimensional phase space, which requires broad spatial and temporal scales. In this study, we develop a quantum-classical hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell solver. Specifically, the Vlasov solver implements the Hamiltonian simulation based on Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT), coupled with a classical Maxwell solver. We perform numerical simulation of a 1D advection test and a 1D1V two-stream instability test on the Qiskit-Aer-GPU quantum circuit emulator with an A100 GPU. The computational complexity of our quantum algorithm can potentially be reduced from the classical $O(N^6T^2)$ to $O(\text{poly}(\log(N),N,T))$ for the $N$ grid system and simulation time $T$. Furthermore, the numerical analysis reveals that our quantum algorithm is robust under larger time steps compared with classical algorithms with the constraint of Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition.</description>

Abstract: Diophantine equations are multivariate equations, usually polynomial, in which only integer solutions are admitted. A brute force method for finding solutions would be to systematically substitute possible integer solutions and check for equality.
  Grover's algorithm is a quantum search algorithm which can find marked indices in a list very efficiently. By treating the indices as the integer variables in the diophantine equation, Grover's algorithm can be used to find solutions in brute force way more efficiently than classical methods. We present an example for the simplest possible diophantine equation.</description>

      <title>Imaging transverse modes in a GHz surface acoustic wave cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full characterization of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices requires imaging the spatial distribution of the acoustic field, which is not possible with standard all-electrical measurements where an interdigital transducer (IDT) is used as a detector. Here we present a fiber-based scanning Michelson interferometer employing a strongly focused laser beam as a probe. Combined with a heterodyne circuit, this setup enables frequency- and spatially-resolved measurements of the amplitude and phase of the SAW displacement. We demonstrate this by investigating a 1 GHz SAW cavity, revealing the presence of frequency-overlapping transverse modes, which are not resolved with an all-electrical measurement. The frequency overlap of these transverse modes leads to mode superpositions, which we analyze by quadrature decomposition of the complex acoustic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An experimental study on Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in rubidium (Rb) vapor cells containing inert gases at pressures $\le 5$ Torr is reported. Using an inert-gas-free Rb vapor cell as a reference, we measure frequency shift and line broadening of the EIT spectra in Rb vapor cells with argon, neon or nitrogen gases at pressures ranging from a few mTorr to 5 Torr. The results qualitatively agree with a pseudo-potential model that includes $s$-wave scattering between the Rydberg electron and the inert-gas atoms, and the effect of polarization of the inert-gas atoms by the Rydberg atoms. Our results are important for establishing Rydberg-EIT as an all-optical and non-intrusive spectroscopic probe for field diagnostics in low-pressure radio-frequency discharges.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the dynamical behaviors in a quasiperiodic mosaic lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic mosaic systems have attracted significant attention due to their unique spectral properties with exactly known mobility edges, which do not vanish even in the large quasiperiodic potential strength region, although the width of energy window of extended states becomes very narrow and decreases with the increase of strength of the quasiperiodic potential.In this work we study the dynamics of a quasiperiodic mosaic lattice and unravel its peculiar dynamical properties. By scrutinizing the expansion dynamics of wave packet and the evolution of density distribution, we unveil that the long-time density distribution display obviously different behaviors at odd and even sites in the large quasiperiodic potential strength region. Particularly, the time scale of dynamics exhibits an inverse relationship with the quasiperiodic potential strength. To understand these behaviors, we derive an effective Hamiltonian in the large quasiperiodic potential strength region, which is composed of decoupled Hamiltonians defined on the odd and even sites, respectively. While all eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian defined on even sites are localized, the eigenstates of effective Hamiltonian defined on odd sites include both localized and extended eigenstates. Our results demonstrate that the effective Hamiltonian can describe the dynamical behaviors well in the large quasiperiodic potential strength region and provides an intuitive framework for understanding the peculiar dynamical behaviors in the quasiperiodic mosaic lattice.</description>

Abstract: Various physical quantities -- including real-time response, inclusive cross-sections, and decay rates -- may not be directly determined from Euclidean correlators. They are, however, easily determined from the spectral density, motivating the task of estimating a spectral density from a Euclidean correlator. This spectral reconstruction problem can be written as an ill-posed inverse Laplace transform; incorporating positivity constraints allows one to obtain finite-sized bounds on the region of spectral density functions consistent with the Euclidean data. Expressing the reconstruction problem as a convex optimization problem and exploiting Lagrange duality, bounds on arbitrary integrals of the spectral density can be efficiently obtained from Euclidean data. This paper applies this approach to reconstructing a smeared spectral density and determining smeared real-time evolution. Bounds of this form are information-theoretically complete, in the sense that for any point within the bounds one may find an associated spectral density consistent with both the available Euclidean data and positivity.</description>

Abstract: We propose a decoder for the correction of erasures with hypergraph product codes, which form one of the most popular families of quantum LDPC codes. Our numerical simulations show that this decoder provides a close approximation of the maximum likelihood decoder that can be implemented in O(N^2) bit operations where N is the length of the quantum code. A probabilistic version of this decoder can be implemented in O(N^1.5) bit operations.</description>

Abstract: Quadratic programming over orthogonal matrices encompasses a broad class of hard optimization problems that do not have an efficient quantum representation. Such problems are instances of the little noncommutative Grothendieck problem (LNCG), a generalization of binary quadratic programs to continuous, noncommutative variables. In this work, we establish a natural embedding for this class of LNCG problems onto a fermionic Hamiltonian, thereby enabling the study of this classical problem with the tools of quantum information. This embedding is accomplished by a new representation of orthogonal matrices as fermionic quantum states, which we achieve through the well-known double covering of the orthogonal group. Correspondingly, the embedded LNCG Hamiltonian is a two-body fermion model. Determining extremal states of this Hamiltonian provides an outer approximation to the original problem, a quantum analogue to classical semidefinite relaxations. In particular, when optimizing over the \emph{special} orthogonal group our quantum relaxation obeys additional, powerful constraints based on the convex hull of rotation matrices. The classical size of this convex-hull representation is exponential in matrix dimension, whereas our quantum representation requires only a linear number of qubits. Finally, to project the relaxed solution back into the feasible space, we propose rounding procedures which return orthogonal matrices from appropriate measurements of the quantum state. Through numerical experiments we provide evidence that this rounded quantum relaxation can produce high-quality approximations.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the great success of classical generative models in machine learning, enthusiastic exploration of their quantum version has recently started. To depart on this journey, it is important to develop a relevant metric to evaluate the quality of quantum generative models; in the classical case, one such example is the (classical) inception score (cIS). In this paper, as a natural extension of cIS, we propose the quantum inception score (qIS) for quantum generators. Importantly, qIS relates the quality to the Holevo information of the quantum channel that classifies a given dataset. In this context, we show several properties of qIS. First, qIS is greater than or equal to the corresponding cIS, which is defined through projection measurements on the system output. Second, the difference between qIS and cIS arises from the presence of quantum coherence, as characterized by the resource theory of asymmetry. Third, when a set of entangled generators is prepared, there exists a classifying process leading to the further enhancement of qIS. Fourth, we harness the quantum fluctuation theorem to characterize the physical limitation of qIS. Finally, we apply qIS to assess the quality of the one-dimensional spin chain model as a quantum generative model, with the quantum convolutional neural network as a quantum classifier, for the phase classification problem in the quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) method is a powerful scheme for the block encoding of operators but suffers from high overheads. In this work, we discuss the parallelisation of LCU and in particular the SELECT subroutine of LCU based on partitioning of observables into groups of commuting operators, as well as the use of adaptive circuits and teleportation that allow us to perform required Clifford circuits in constant depth. We additionally discuss the parallelisation of QROM circuits which are a special case of our main results, and provide methods to parallelise the action of multi-controlled gates on the control register. We only require an $O(\log n)$ factor increase in the number of qubits in order to produce a significant depth reduction, with prior work suggesting that for molecular Hamiltonians, the depth saving is $O(n)$, and numerics indicating depth savings of a factor approximately $n/2$. The implications of our method in the fault-tolerant setting are also considered, noting that parallelisation reduces the $T$-depth by the same factor as the logical algorithm, without changing the $T$-count, and that our method can significantly reduce the overall space-time volume of the computation, even when including the increased number of $T$ factories required by parallelisation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the link between quantum position-verification (QPV) and holography established in [MPS19] using holographic quantum error correcting codes as toy models. By inserting the "temporal" scaling of the AdS metric by hand via the bulk Hamiltonian interaction strength, we recover a toy model with consistent causality structure. This leads to an interesting implication between two topics in quantum information: if position-based verification is secure against attacks with small entanglement then there are new fundamental lower bounds for resources required for one Hamiltonian to simulate another.</description>

Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics represents a powerful platform to generate entanglement and tailor photonic states. We consider a pair of identical qubits coupled to a parity invariant waveguide in the microwave domain. By working in the one- and two-excitation sectors, we provide a unified view of decay processes and we show the common origin of directional single photon emission and two photon directional bunching. Unveiling the quantum trajectories, we demonstrate that both phenomena are rooted in the selective coupling of orthogonal qubits Bell states with different photon propagation directions. We comment on how to use this mechanism to implement optimized post-selection of Bell states, heralded by the detection of photons on one qubits side.</description>

Abstract: Complex forms of quantum entanglement can arise in two qualitatively different ways; either between many qubits or between two particles with higher-than-qubit dimension. While the many-qubit frontier and the high-dimension frontier both are well-established, state-of-the-art quantum technology is becoming increasingly able to create and manipulate entangled states that simltaneously feature many particles and high dimension. Here, we investigate generic states that can be considered both genuinely high-dimensional and genuine multi-particle entangled. We consider a natural quantity that characterises this key property. To detect it, we develop three different classes of criteria. These enable us both to probe the ultimate noise tolerance of this form of entanglement and to make detection schemes using sparse or even minimal measurement resources. The approach provides a simple way of benchmarking entanglement dimensionality in the multi-particle regime and general, platform-independent, detection methods that readily apply to experimental use.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state designs, by enabling an efficient sampling of random quantum states, play a quintessential role in devising and benchmarking various quantum protocols with broad applications ranging from circuit designs to black hole physics. Symmetries, on the other hand, are expected to reduce the randomness of a state. Despite being ubiquitous, the effects of symmetry on quantum state designs remain an outstanding question. The recently introduced projected ensemble framework generates efficient approximate state $t$-designs by hinging on projective measurements and many-body quantum chaos. In this work, we examine the emergence of state designs from the random generator states exhibiting symmetries. Leveraging on translation symmetry, we analytically establish a sufficient condition for the measurement basis leading to the state $t$-designs. Then, by making use of the trace distance measure, we numerically investigate the convergence to the designs. Subsequently, we inspect the violation of the sufficient condition to identify bases that fail to converge. We further demonstrate the emergence of state designs in a physical system by studying the dynamics of a chaotic tilted field Ising chain with translation symmetry. We find faster convergence of the trace distance during the early time evolution in comparison to the cases when the symmetry is broken. To delineate the general applicability of our results, we extend our analysis to other symmetries. We expect our findings to pave the way for further exploration of deep thermalization and equilibration of closed and open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advancement of large-scale quantum technologies necessitates a deeper understanding of the quantum network (QN) design from first principles. Pioneering studies, however, do not fully capture the origin of the stronger connectivity in QN that surpasses classical percolation predictions. Here, we apply statistical physics to identify the origin of this stronger connectivity -- known as concurrence percolation. Our finding is demonstrated on hierarchical scale-free networks, the ($U,V$) flowers, which allow full analytical control over path connectivity by adjusting the two distinct path length scales, $U \leq V$. This advantage enables us to analytically determine the critical exponents for infinite systems well beyond the current simulation limits. Our analysis reveals for the first time that classical and concurrence percolations, while both satisfying the hyperscaling relation, fall into distinct universality classes. This distinction arises from their different methods for how to ``superpose'' parallel, non-shortest path contributions into overall connectivity. Notably, we find that concurrence percolation relies on non-shortest paths and shows a higher resilience to detouring when these paths are rerouted and extended. This increased resilience is also evident in real-world hierarchical, scale-free Internet networks. Our findings highlight a critical principle for QN design: non-shortest paths contribute significantly to QN connectivity compared to classical percolation -- as long as they are abundant.</description>

Abstract: Circuit knitting, a method for connecting quantum circuits across multiple processors to simulate nonlocal quantum operations, is a promising approach for distributed quantum computing. While various techniques have been developed for circuit knitting, we uncover fundamental limitations to the scalability of this technology. We prove that the sampling overhead of circuit knitting is exponentially lower bounded by the exact entanglement cost of the target bipartite dynamic, even for asymptotic overhead in the parallel cut regime. Specifically, we prove that the regularized sampling overhead assisted with local operations and classical communication (LOCC), of any bipartite quantum channel is lower bounded by the exponential of its exact entanglement cost under separable preserving operations. Furthermore, we show that the regularized sampling overhead for simulating a general bipartite channel via LOCC is lower bounded by $\kappa$-entanglement and max-Rains information, providing efficiently computable benchmarks. Our work reveals a profound connection between virtual quantum information processing via quasi-probability decomposition and quantum Shannon theory, highlighting the critical role of entanglement in distributed quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Constant-Overhead Magic State Distillation</title>

Abstract: Magic state distillation is a crucial yet resource-intensive process in fault-tolerant quantum computation. The protocol's overhead, defined as the number of input magic states required per output magic state with an error rate below $\epsilon$, typically grows as $\mathcal{O}(\log^\gamma(1/\epsilon))$. Achieving smaller overheads, i.e., smaller exponents $\gamma$, is highly desirable; however, all existing protocols require polylogarithmically growing overheads with some $\gamma &gt; 0$, and identifying the smallest achievable exponent $\gamma$ for distilling magic states of qubits has remained challenging. To address this issue, we develop magic state distillation protocols for qubits with efficient, polynomial-time decoding that achieve an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ overhead, meaning the optimal exponent $\gamma = 0$; this improves over the previous best of $\gamma \approx 0.678$ due to Hastings and Haah. In our construction, we employ algebraic geometry codes to explicitly present asymptotically good quantum codes for $2^{10}$-dimensional qudits that support transversally implementable logical gates in the third level of the Clifford hierarchy. The use of asymptotically good codes with non-vanishing rate and relative distance leads to the constant overhead. These codes can be realised by representing each $2^{10}$-dimensional qudit as a set of $10$ qubits, using stabiliser operations on qubits. The $10$-qubit magic states distilled with these codes can be converted to and from conventional magic states for the controlled-controlled-$Z$ ($CCZ$) and $T$ gates on qubits with only a constant overhead loss, making it possible to achieve constant-overhead distillation of such standard magic states for qubits. These results resolve the fundamental open problem in quantum information theory concerning the construction of magic state distillation protocols with the optimal exponent.</description>

Abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts that massive particles exhibit wave-like behavior. Matterwave interferometry has been able to validate such predictions through ground-breaking experiments involving microscopic systems like atoms and molecules. The wavefunction of such systems coherently extends over a distance much larger than their size, an achievement that is incredibly challenging for massive and more complex objects. Yet, reaching similar level of coherent diffusion will enable tests of fundamental physics at the genuinely macroscopic scale, as well as the development of quantum sensing apparata of great sensitivity. We report on experimentally achieving an unprecedented degree of position diffusion in a massive levitated optomechanical system through frequency modulation of the trapping potential. By starting with a pre-cooled state of motion and employing a train of sudden pulses yet of mild modulation depth, we surpass previously attained values of position diffusion in this class of systems to reach diffusion lengths that exceed the physical dimensions of the trapped nanoparticle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.09482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explain at the simplest possible level why finite mathematics based on a finite ring of characteristic $p$ is more general (fundamental) than standard mathematics. The belief of most mathematicians and physicists that standard mathematics is the most fundamental arose for historical reasons. However, simple {\it mathematical} arguments show that standard mathematics (involving the concept of infinities) is a degenerate case of finite mathematics in the formal limit $p\to\infty$: standard mathematics arises from finite mathematics in the degenerate case when operations modulo a number are discarded. Quantum theory based on a finite ring of characteristic $p$ is more general than standard quantum theory because the latter is a degenerate case of the former in the formal limit $p\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Universal platform of point-gap topological phases from topological materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08110v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whereas point-gap topological phases are responsible for exceptional phenomena intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems, their realization in quantum materials is still elusive. Here we propose a simple and universal platform of point-gap topological phases constructed from Hermitian topological insulators and superconductors. We show that (d-1)-dimensional point-gap topological phases are realized by making a boundary in d-dimensional topological insulators and superconductors dissipative. A crucial observation of the proposal is that adding a decay constant to boundary modes in d-dimensional topological insulators and superconductors is topologically equivalent to attaching a (d-1)-dimensional point-gap topological phase to the boundary. We furthermore establish the proposal from the extended version of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem, relating dissipative gapless modes to point-gap topological numbers. From the bulk-boundary correspondence of the point-gap topological phases, the resultant point-gap topological phases exhibit exceptional boundary states or in-gap higher-order non-Hermitian skin effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a practical scheme for the efficient preparation of laser-cooled $^{43}$Ca$^+$ ions in an ion trap. Our approach integrates two well-established methods: isotope-selective photoionization and isotope-specific parametric excitation. Drawing inspiration from the individual merits of each method, we have successfully integrated these techniques to prepare extended chains of $^{43}$Ca$^+$ ions, overcoming the challenge posed by their low natural abundance of 0.135\% in a natural source. Furthermore, we explore the subtleties of our scheme, focusing on the influence of different factors on the purification process. Our investigation contributes to a broader understanding of the technique and highlights the adaptability of established methods in addressing specific isotopic challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consciousness within the brain hinges on the synchronized activities of millions of neurons, but the mechanism responsible for orchestrating such synchronization remains elusive. In this study, we employ cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) to explore entangled biphoton generation through cascade emission in the vibration spectrum of C-H bonds within the lipid molecules' tails. The results indicate that the cylindrical cavity formed by a myelin sheath can facilitate spontaneous photon emission from the vibrational modes and generate a significant number of entangled photon pairs. The abundance of C-H bond vibration units in neurons can therefore serve as a source of quantum entanglement resources for the nervous system. The finding may offer insight into the brain's ability to leverage these resources for quantum information transfer, thereby elucidating a potential source for the synchronized activity of neurons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13029v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We verify that the recently proven infinite families of holographic entropy inequalities are maximally tight, i.e. they are facets of the holographic entropy cone. The proof is technical but it offers some heuristic insight. On star graphs, both families of inequalities quantify how concentrated / spread information is with respect to a dihedral symmetry acting on subsystems. In addition, toric inequalities viewed in the K-basis show an interesting interplay between four-party and six-party perfect tensors.</description>

      <title>From the Choi Formalism in Infinite Dimensions to Unique Decompositions of Generators of Completely Positive Dynamical Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14344v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given any separable complex Hilbert space, any trace-class operator $B$ which does not have purely imaginary trace, and any generator $L$ of a norm-continuous one-parameter semigroup of completely positive maps we prove that there exists a unique bounded operator $K$ and a unique completely positive map $\Phi$ such that (i) $L=K(\cdot)+(\cdot)K^*+\Phi$, (ii) the superoperator $\Phi(B^*(\cdot)B)$ is trace class and has vanishing trace, and (iii) ${\rm tr}(B^*K)$ is a real number. Central to our proof is a modified version of the Choi formalism which relates completely positive maps to positive semi-definite operators. We characterize when this correspondence is injective and surjective, respectively, which in turn explains why the proof idea of our main result cannot extend to non-separable Hilbert spaces. In particular, we find examples of positive semi-definite operators which have empty pre-image under the Choi formalism as soon as the underlying Hilbert space is infinite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Entanglement of Anyonic Systems using the Anyonic Partial Transpose</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement of mixed quantum states can be quantified using the partial transpose and its corresponding entanglement measure, the logarithmic negativity. Recently, the notion of partial transpose has been extended to systems of anyons, which are exotic quasiparticles whose exchange statistics go beyond the bosonic and fermionic case. Studying the fundamental properties of this anyonic partial transpose, we first reveal that when applied to the special case of fermionic systems, it can be reduced to the fermionic partial transpose or its twisted variant depending on whether or not a boundary Majorana fermion is present. Focusing on ground state properties, we find that the anyonic partial transpose captures both the correct entanglement scaling for gapless systems, as predicted by conformal field theory, and the phase transition between a topologically trivial and a nontrivial phase. For non-abelian anyons and the bipartition geometry, we find a rich multiplet structure in the eigenvalues of the partial transpose, the so-called negativity spectrum, and reveal the possibility of defining both a charge- and an imbalance-resolved negativity.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang theory of the superradiant phase transition in the open Dicke model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dicke model describes an ensemble of two-level atoms that are coupled to a confined light mode of an optical cavity. Above a critical coupling, the cavity becomes macroscopically occupied, and the system enters the superradiant phase. This phase transition can be observed by detecting the photons that are emitted from the cavity; however, it only becomes apparent in the limit of long observation times, while actual experiments are of a finite duration. To circumvent this problem, we here make use of recent advances in Lee-Yang theories of phase transitions to show that the superradiant phase transition can be inferred from the factorial cumulants of the photon emission statistics obtained during a finite measurement time. Specifically, from the factorial cumulants, we can determine the complex singularities of generating functions that describe the photon emission statistics, and by extrapolating their positions to the long-time limit, one can detect the superradiant phase transition. We also show that the convergence points determine the tails of the large-deviation statistics of the photon current. Our work demonstrates how phase transitions in the Dicke model and in other quantum many-body systems can be detected from measurements of a finite duration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the prevalent view that quantum mechanics is irrelevant to macroscopic biological systems because of inherent noise and decoherence, this paper demonstrates that the electrical noise (Brownian motion) in neuron membranes gives rise to an `emergent' Schr\"{o}dinger equation involving a new neuronal constant $\hat{\hbar}$, fundamentally challenging the standard view of neuronal behaviour. This result could provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of brain function, thus challenging existing paradigms in both quantum physics and neuroscience. A possible empirical test of this emergent quantum behaviour would be to look for quantum fluctuations in subthreshold neural oscillations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the realization and characterization of a novel magic-wavelength nanofiber-based two-color optical dipole trap that allows us to generate a periodic one-dimensional array of trapping sites with a spacing significantly smaller than half of the resonant wavelength of the cesium D2-line. To this end, we launch a blue-detuned partial standing wave and two red-detuned light fields through the nanofiber. We demonstrate the trapping of atoms in the array and characterize the resulting trap configuration by measuring the trap frequencies in three directions and observe good agreement with theoretical predictions. The implementation of this nanofiber-based optical interface with magic trapping wavelengths and sub-$\lambda/2$ spacing is an important step towards the exploration of novel collective radiative effects such as selective radiance in 1D atomic arrays.</description>

      <title>Apparent delay of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in quenched open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a new intermediate regime in the quench time, $\tau_{q}$, separating the usual validity of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) and its breakdown for rapid quenches in open systems under finite quench protocols. It manifests in the power-law scaling of the transition time with $\tau_{q}$ as the system appears to enter the adiabatic regime, even though the ramp is already terminated and the final quench value is held constant. This intermediate regime, which we dub as the delayed KZM, emerges due to the dissipation preventing the system from freezing in the impulse regime. This results in a large delay between the actual time the system undergoes a phase transition and the time inferred from a threshold-based criterion for the order parameter, as done in most experiments. We demonstrate using the open Dicke model and its one-dimensional lattice version that this phenomenon is a generic feature of open systems that can be mapped onto an effective coupled oscillator model. We also show that the phenomenon becomes more prominent near criticality, and its effects on the transition time measurement can be further exacerbated by large threshold values for an order parameter. Due to this, we propose an alternative method for threshold-based criterion which uses the spatio-temporal information, such as the system's defect number, for identifying the transition time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilayer nanoscale systems incorporating buried ultrathin tunnel oxides, 2D materials, and solid electrolytes are crucial for next-generation logics, memory, quantum and neuro-inspired computing. Still, an ultrathin layer control at angstrom scale is challenging for cutting-edge applications. Here we introduce a scalable approach utilizing focused ion-beam annealing for buried ultrathin oxides engineering with angstrom-scale thickness control. Our molecular dynamics simulations of Ne+ irradiation on Al/a-AlOx/Al structure confirms the pivotal role of ion generated crystal defects. We experimentally demonstrate its performance on Josephson junction tunning in the resistance range of 2 to 37% with a standard deviation of 0.86% across 25x25 mm chip. Moreover, we showcase +-17 MHz frequency control (+-0.172 A tunnel barrier thickness) for superconducting transmon qubits with coherence times up to 500 us, which is promising for useful fault-tolerant quantum computing. This work ensures ultrathin multilayer nanosystems engineering at the ultimate scale by depth-controlled crystal defects generation.</description>
