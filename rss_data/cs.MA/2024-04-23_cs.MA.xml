      <title>Reducing Redundant Computation in Multi-Agent Coordination through Locally Centralized Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning, decentralized execution is a common approach, yet it suffers from the redundant computation problem. This occurs when multiple agents redundantly perform the same or similar computation due to overlapping observations. To address this issue, this study introduces a novel method referred to as locally centralized team transformer (LCTT). LCTT establishes a locally centralized execution framework where selected agents serve as leaders, issuing instructions, while the rest agents, designated as workers, act as these instructions without activating their policy networks. For LCTT, we proposed the team-transformer (T-Trans) architecture that allows leaders to provide specific instructions to each worker, and the leadership shift mechanism that allows agents autonomously decide their roles as leaders or workers. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces redundant computation, does not decrease reward levels, and leads to faster learning convergence.</description>

      <title>Multi-AUV Cooperative Underwater Multi-Target Tracking Based on Dynamic-Switching-enabled Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of underwater communication, sensing, automation, robot technologies, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) swarms are gradually becoming popular and have been widely promoted in ocean exploration and underwater tracking or surveillance, etc. However, the complex underwater environment poses significant challenges for AUV swarm-based accurate tracking for the underwater moving targets.In this paper, we aim at proposing a multi-AUV cooperative underwater multi-target tracking algorithm especially when the real underwater factors are taken into account.We first give normally modelling approach for the underwater sonar-based detection and the ocean current interference on the target tracking process.Then, we regard the AUV swarm as a underwater ad-hoc network and propose a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) architecture towards the AUV swarm based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN).It enhances the flexibility and scalability of the AUV swarm through centralized management and distributed operations.Based on the proposed MARL architecture, we propose the "dynamic-attention switching" and "dynamic-resampling switching" mechanisms, to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of AUV swarm cooperation during task execution.Finally, based on a proposed AUV classification method, we propose an efficient cooperative tracking algorithm called ASMA.Evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed tracking algorithm can perform precise underwater multi-target tracking, comparing with many of recent research products in terms of convergence speed and tracking accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the Liquid-Graph Time-constant (LGTC) network, a continuous graph neural network(GNN) model for control of multi-agent systems based on therecent Liquid Time Constant (LTC) network. We analyse itsstability leveraging contraction analysis and propose a closed-form model that preserves the model contraction rate and doesnot require solving an ODE at each iteration. Compared todiscrete models like Graph Gated Neural Networks (GGNNs),the higher expressivity of the proposed model guaranteesremarkable performance while reducing the large amountof communicated variables normally required by GNNs. Weevaluate our model on a distributed multi-agent control casestudy (flocking) taking into account variable communicationrange and scalability under non-instantaneous communication</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Geo-spatiotemporal Bipartite Network to Optimize GCOOS Sensor Placement Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes two new measures applicable in a spatial bipartite network model: coverage and coverage robustness. The bipartite network must consist of observer nodes, observable nodes, and edges that connect observer nodes to observable nodes. The coverage and coverage robustness scores evaluate the effectiveness of the observer node placements. This measure is beneficial for stochastic data as it may be coupled with Monte Carlo simulations to identify optimal placements for new observer nodes. In this paper, we construct a Geo-SpatioTemporal Bipartite Network (GSTBN) within the stochastic and dynamical environment of the Gulf of Mexico. This GSTBN consists of GCOOS sensor nodes and HYCOM Region of Interest (RoI) event nodes. The goal is to identify optimal placements to expand GCOOS to improve the forecasting outcomes by the HYCOM ocean prediction model.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Coordination of Distributed Energy Resources through Local Energy Markets and Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the energy landscape evolves toward sustainability, the accelerating integration of distributed energy resources poses challenges to the operability and reliability of the electricity grid. One significant aspect of this issue is the notable increase in net load variability at the grid edge. Transactive energy, implemented through local energy markets, has recently garnered attention as a promising solution to address the grid challenges in the form of decentralized, indirect demand response on a community level. Given the nature of these challenges, model-free control approaches, such as deep reinforcement learning, show promise for the decentralized automation of participation within this context. Existing studies at the intersection of transactive energy and model-free control primarily focus on socioeconomic and self-consumption metrics, overlooking the crucial goal of reducing community-level net load variability. This study addresses this gap by training a set of deep reinforcement learning agents to automate end-user participation in ALEX, an economy-driven local energy market. In this setting, agents do not share information and only prioritize individual bill optimization. The study unveils a clear correlation between bill reduction and reduced net load variability in this setup. The impact on net load variability is assessed over various time horizons using metrics such as ramping rate, daily and monthly load factor, as well as daily average and total peak export and import on an open-source dataset. Agents are then benchmarked against several baselines, with their performance levels showing promising results, approaching those of a near-optimal dynamic programming benchmark.</description>

      <title>When `Computing follows Vehicles': Decentralized Mobility-Aware Resource Allocation in the Edge-to-Cloud Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transformation of smart mobility is unprecedented--Autonomous, shared and electric connected vehicles, along with the urgent need to meet ambitious net-zero targets by shifting to low-carbon transport modalities result in new traffic patterns and requirements for real-time computation at large-scale, for instance, augmented reality applications. The cloud computing paradigm can neither respond to such low-latency requirements nor adapt resource allocation to such dynamic spatio-temporal service requests. This paper addresses this grand challenge by introducing a novel decentralized optimization framework for mobility-aware edge-to-cloud resource allocation, service offloading, provisioning and load-balancing. In contrast to related work, this framework comes with superior efficiency and cost-effectiveness under evaluation in real-world traffic settings and mobility datasets. This breakthrough capability of `\emph{computing follows vehicles}' proves able to reduce utilization variance by more than 40 times, while preventing service deadline violations by 14\%-34\%.</description>

      <title>DNA: Differentially private Neural Augmentation for contact tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID19 pandemic had enormous economic and societal consequences. Contact tracing is an effective way to reduce infection rates by detecting potential virus carriers early. However, this was not generally adopted in the recent pandemic, and privacy concerns are cited as the most important reason. We substantially improve the privacy guarantees of the current state of the art in decentralized contact tracing. Whereas previous work was based on statistical inference only, we augment the inference with a learned neural network and ensure that this neural augmentation satisfies differential privacy. In a simulator for COVID19, even at epsilon=1 per message, this can significantly improve the detection of potentially infected individuals and, as a result of targeted testing, reduce infection rates. This work marks an important first step in integrating deep learning into contact tracing while maintaining essential privacy guarantees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an architectural alternative to global digital platforms termed grassroots, designed to serve the social, economic, civic, and political needs of local digital communities, as well as their federation. Grassroots platforms may offer local communities an alternative to global digital platforms while operating solely on the smartphones of their members, forsaking any global resources other than the network itself. Such communities may form digital economies without initial capital or external credit, exercise sovereign democratic governance, and federate, ultimately resulting in the grassroots formation of a global digital democracy.</description>

      <title>Rate Analysis of Coupled Distributed Stochastic Approximation for Misspecified Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an $n$ agents distributed optimization problem with imperfect information characterized in a parametric sense, where the unknown parameter can be solved by a distinct distributed parameter learning problem. Though each agent only has access to its local parameter learning and computational problem, they mean to collaboratively minimize the average of their local cost functions. To address the special optimization problem, we propose a coupled distributed stochastic approximation algorithm, in which every agent updates the current beliefs of its unknown parameter and decision variable by stochastic approximation method; and then averages the beliefs and decision variables of its neighbors over network in consensus protocol. Our interest lies in the convergence analysis of this algorithm. We quantitatively characterize the factors that affect the algorithm performance, and prove that the mean-squared error of the decision variable is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{nk})+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}(1-\rho_w)}\right)\frac{1}{k^{1.5}}+\mathcal{O}\big(\frac{1}{(1-\rho_w)^2} \big)\frac{1}{k^2}$, where $k$ is the iteration count and $(1-\rho_w)$ is the spectral gap of the network weighted adjacency matrix. It reveals that the network connectivity characterized by $(1-\rho_w)$ only influences the high order of convergence rate, while the domain rate still acts the same as the centralized algorithm. In addition, we analyze that the transient iteration needed for reaching its dominant rate $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{nk})$ is $\mathcal{O}(\frac{n}{(1-\rho_w)^2})$. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the theoretical results by taking different CPUs as agents, which is more applicable to real-world distributed scenarios.</description>

      <title>A survey of air combat behavior modeling using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent advances in machine learning, creating agents that behave realistically in simulated air combat has become a growing field of interest. This survey explores the application of machine learning techniques for modeling air combat behavior, motivated by the potential to enhance simulation-based pilot training. Current simulated entities tend to lack realistic behavior, and traditional behavior modeling is labor-intensive and prone to loss of essential domain knowledge between development steps. Advancements in reinforcement learning and imitation learning algorithms have demonstrated that agents may learn complex behavior from data, which could be faster and more scalable than manual methods. Yet, making adaptive agents capable of performing tactical maneuvers and operating weapons and sensors still poses a significant challenge. The survey examines applications, behavior model types, prevalent machine learning methods, and the technical and human challenges in developing adaptive and realistically behaving agents. Another challenge is the transfer of agents from learning environments to military simulation systems and the consequent demand for standardization. Four primary recommendations are presented regarding increased emphasis on beyond-visual-range scenarios, multi-agent machine learning and cooperation, utilization of hierarchical behavior models, and initiatives for standardization and research collaboration. These recommendations aim to address current issues and guide the development of more comprehensive, adaptable, and realistic machine learning-based behavior models for air combat applications.</description>

      <title>STROOBnet Optimization via GPU-Accelerated Proximal Recurrence Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal networks' observational capabilities are crucial for accurate data gathering and informed decisions across multiple sectors. This study focuses on the Spatiotemporal Ranged Observer-Observable Bipartite Network (STROOBnet), linking observational nodes (e.g., surveillance cameras) to events within defined geographical regions, enabling efficient monitoring. Using data from Real-Time Crime Camera (RTCC) systems and Calls for Service (CFS) in New Orleans, where RTCC combats rising crime amidst reduced police presence, we address the network's initial observational imbalances. Aiming for uniform observational efficacy, we propose the Proximal Recurrence approach. It outperformed traditional clustering methods like k-means and DBSCAN by offering holistic event frequency and spatial consideration, enhancing observational coverage.</description>

      <title>PTDE: Personalized Training with Distilled Execution for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has emerged as a widely adopted paradigm in multi-agent reinforcement learning, emphasizing the utilization of global information for learning an enhanced joint $Q$-function or centralized critic. In contrast, our investigation delves into harnessing global information to directly enhance individual $Q$-functions or individual actors. Notably, we discover that applying identical global information universally across all agents proves insufficient for optimal performance. Consequently, we advocate for the customization of global information tailored to each agent, creating agent-personalized global information to bolster overall performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel paradigm named Personalized Training with Distilled Execution (PTDE), wherein agent-personalized global information is distilled into the agent's local information. This distilled information is then utilized during decentralized execution, resulting in minimal performance degradation. PTDE can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art algorithms, leading to notable performance enhancements across diverse benchmarks, including the SMAC benchmark, Google Research Football (GRF) benchmark, and Learning to Rank (LTR) task.</description>

      <title>Introducing Delays in Multi-Agent Path Finding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11252v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) setting where agents have been assigned a plan, but during its execution some agents are delayed. Instead of replanning from scratch when such a delay occurs, we propose delay introduction, whereby we delay some additional agents so that the remainder of the plan can be executed safely. We show that finding the minimum number of additional delays is APX-Hard, i.e., it is NP-Hard to find a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation for some $\varepsilon&gt;0$. However, in practice we can find optimal delay-introductions using Conflict-Based Search for very large numbers of agents, and both planning time and the resulting length of the plan are comparable, and sometimes outperform the state-of-the-art heuristics for replanning.</description>

      <title>Optimal Task Assignment and Path Planning using Conflict-Based Search with Precedence and Temporal Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem entails finding collision-free paths for a set of agents, guiding them from their start to goal locations. However, MAPF does not account for several practical task-related constraints. For example, agents may need to perform actions at goal locations with specific execution times, adhering to predetermined orders and timeframes. Moreover, goal assignments may not be predefined for agents, and the optimization objective may lack an explicit definition. To incorporate task assignment, path planning, and a user-defined objective into a coherent framework, this paper examines the Task Assignment and Path Finding with Precedence and Temporal Constraints (TAPF-PTC) problem. We augment Conflict-Based Search (CBS) to simultaneously generate task assignments and collision-free paths that adhere to precedence and temporal constraints, maximizing an objective quantified by the return from a user-defined reward function in reinforcement learning (RL). Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm, CBS-TA-PTC, can solve highly challenging bomb-defusing tasks with precedence and temporal constraints efficiently relative to MARL and adapted Target Assignment and Path Finding (TAPF) methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generic Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework optimized for crafting adversarial attacks on different model types spanning from ECG signal analysis (1D), image classification (2D), and video classification (3D). The framework focuses on identifying sensitive regions and inducing misclassifications with minimal distortions and various distortion types. The novel RL method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for all three applications, proving its efficiency. Our RL approach produces superior localization masks, enhancing interpretability for image classification and ECG analysis models. For applications such as ECG analysis, our platform highlights critical ECG segments for clinicians while ensuring resilience against prevalent distortions. This comprehensive tool aims to bolster both resilience with adversarial training and transparency across varied applications and data types.</description>

Abstract: Cooperatively utilizing both ego-vehicle and infrastructure sensor data via V2X communication has emerged as a promising approach for advanced autonomous driving. However, current research mainly focuses on improving individual modules, rather than taking end-to-end learning to optimize final planning performance, resulting in underutilized data potential. In this paper, we introduce UniV2X, a pioneering cooperative autonomous driving framework that seamlessly integrates all key driving modules across diverse views into a unified network. We propose a sparse-dense hybrid data transmission and fusion mechanism for effective vehicle-infrastructure cooperation, offering three advantages: 1) Effective for simultaneously enhancing agent perception, online mapping, and occupancy prediction, ultimately improving planning performance. 2) Transmission-friendly for practical and limited communication conditions. 3) Reliable data fusion with interpretability of this hybrid data. We implement UniV2X, as well as reproducing several benchmark methods, on the challenging DAIR-V2X, the real-world cooperative driving dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of UniV2X in significantly enhancing planning performance, as well as all intermediate output performance.

      <title>Group-Aware Coordination Graph for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) necessitates seamless collaboration among agents, often represented by an underlying relation graph. Existing methods for learning this graph primarily focus on agent-pair relations, neglecting higher-order relationships. While several approaches attempt to extend cooperation modelling to encompass behaviour similarities within groups, they commonly fall short in concurrently learning the latent graph, thereby constraining the information exchange among partially observed agents. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel approach to infer the Group-Aware Coordination Graph (GACG), which is designed to capture both the cooperation between agent pairs based on current observations and group-level dependencies from behaviour patterns observed across trajectories. This graph is further used in graph convolution for information exchange between agents during decision-making. To further ensure behavioural consistency among agents within the same group, we introduce a group distance loss, which promotes group cohesion and encourages specialization between groups. Our evaluations, conducted on StarCraft II micromanagement tasks, demonstrate GACG's superior performance. An ablation study further provides experimental evidence of the effectiveness of each component of our method.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Synthetic Participatory Planning of Shared Automated Electric Mobility Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unleashing the synergies of rapidly evolving mobility technologies in a multi-stakeholder landscape presents unique challenges and opportunities for addressing urban transportation problems. This paper introduces a novel synthetic participatory method, critically leveraging large language models (LLMs) to create digital avatars representing diverse stakeholders to plan shared automated electric mobility systems (SAEMS). These calibratable agents collaboratively identify objectives, envision and evaluate SAEMS alternatives, and strategize implementation under risks and constraints. The results of a Montreal case study indicate that a structured and parameterized workflow provides outputs with high controllability and comprehensiveness on an SAEMS plan than generated using a single LLM-enabled expert agent. Consequently, the approach provides a promising avenue for cost-efficiently improving the inclusivity and interpretability of multi-objective transportation planning, suggesting a paradigm shift in how we envision and strategize for sustainable and equitable transportation systems.</description>
