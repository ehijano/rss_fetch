      <title>The nonmodal kinetic theory of the macroscale convective flows of magnetized plasma, generated by the inhomogeneous microturbulenc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the nonmodal kinetic theory of the macroscale convective flows of magnetized plasma, which stem from the average motion of ions and electrons in the electric field of the spatially inhomogeneous microturbulence. This theory bases on the two-scales approach to the solution of the Vlasov-Poisson system of equations for magnetized plasma, in which the solutions depend simultaneously on micro and macro scales. The developed theory predicts the generation of the sheared poloidal convective flow and of the radial compressed flow with radial flow velocity gradient. It was found that the macroscale (radial) inhomogeneity of the spectral intensity of the microturbulence is the condition necessary for the development of the two-dimensional non-diffusive convective plasma flows. The developed theory includes the theory of the evolution of the microscale turbulence in the sheared-compressed convective flows, formed by the microturbulence, and the theory of the slow macroscale evolution of a bulk of plasma by the compressed-sheared convective flows.</description>

      <title>Electron dynamics of three distinct discharge modes of a cross-field atmospheric pressure plasma jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the electron dynamics in three distinct discharge modes of a cross-field atmospheric pressure plasma jet, the COST-Jet. Thereby, the discharge modes are the non-neutral, the quasi-neutral, and the constricted mode. Using a hybrid Particle-In-Cell/Monte-Carlo Collisions (PIC/MCC) simulation, the study systematically varies the applied voltage and driving frequency to explore the operation modes and their relations. The results reveal that at low input power, the COST-Jet operates in a non-neutral mode, characterized by a discharge close to extinction, analogous to the chaotic mode observed in other plasma devices. As power increases, the jet transitions to a quasi-neutral mode, which aligns with the well-known {\Omega}- and Penning modes, comparable to the bullet mode in parallel-field jets. At the highest power levels, the COST-Jet enters a constricted mode, where the plasma significantly densifies and constricts towards the electrodes along the entire discharge channel. Experimental validation using phase-resolved optical emission spectroscopy (PROES) supports the simulation findings, particularly identifying the constricted mode as a distinct operational regime. These insights into the mode transitions of the COST-Jet under varying operational conditions help optimize plasma applications in various fields.</description>

      <title>Effects of oxidation and impurities in lithium surfaces on the emitting wall plasma sheath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Use of lithium as a surface coating in fusion devices improves plasma performance, but the change in wall properties affects the secondary electron emission properties of the material. Lithium oxidizes easily, which drives the emission yield well above unity. We present here simulations demonstrating the change in sheath structure from monotonic to the nonmonotonic space-charge limited sheath using an energy-dependent data-driven emission model which self-consistently captures both secondary emission and backscattering populations. Increased secondary electron emission from the material has ramifications for the degradation and erosion of the wall. Results shows that the oxidation leads to an increased electron flux into the wall, and a reduced ion flux. The net transfer of energy to the surface is significantly greater for the oxidized case than for the pure lithium case. High reflection rates of low-energy backscattered particles leads to a high re-emission rate at the wall.</description>

      <title>Generalized Expanding-Box Formulations of Reduced Magnetohydrodynamics in the Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a set of simplified equations that can be used for numerical studies of reduced magnetohydrodynamic turbulence within a small patch of the radially expanding solar wind. We allow the box to be either stationary in the Sun's frame or to be moving at an arbitrary velocity along the background magnetic field lines, which we take to be approximately radial. We focus in particular on the case in which the box moves at the same speed as outward-propagating Alfv\'en waves. To aid in the design and optimization of future numerical simulations, we express the equations in terms of scalar potentials and Clebsch coordinates. The equations we derive will be particularly useful for conducting high-resolution numerical simulations of reflection-driven magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the solar wind, and may also be useful for studying turbulence within other astrophysical outflows.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for the Analysis of Traced Particles in Kinetic Plasma Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray acceleration processes in astrophysical plasmas are often investigated with fully-kinetic or hybrid kinetic numerical simulations, which enable us to describe a detailed microphysics of particle energization mechanisms. Tracing of individual particles in such simulations is especially useful in this regard. However, visually inspecting particle trajectories introduces a significant amount of bias and uncertainty, making it challenging to pinpoint specific acceleration mechanisms. Here, we present a novel approach utilising neural networks to assist in the analysis of individual particle data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using the dataset from our recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of non-relativistic perpendicular shocks that consists of 252,000 electrons, each characterised by their position, momentum and electromagnetic field at particle's position, recorded in a time series of 1200 time steps. These electrons cross a region affected by the electrostatic Buneman instability, and a small percentage of them attain high energies. We perform classification, regression, and anomaly detection algorithms on the dataset by using a convolutional neural network, a multi-layer perceptron, and an autoencoder. Despite the noisy and imbalanced dataset, all methods demonstrate the capability to differentiate between thermal and accelerated electrons with remarkable accuracy. The proposed methodology may considerably simplify particle classification in large-scale PIC and hybrid simulations.</description>

      <title>Doubling Fusion Power with Volumetric Optimization in Magnetic Confinement Fusion Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A technique, volumetric power optimization, is presented for enhancing the power output of magnetic confinement fusion devices. Applied to a tokamak, this approach involves shifting the burning plasma region to a larger plasma volume while introducing minimal perturbations to the plasma boundary shape. This edge perturbation -- squareness -- is analogous to pinching and stretching the edge boundary. Stability calculations confirm that this edge alteration is compatible with maintaining plasma stability. This optimization method for optimizing fusion power output could improve the performance of magnetic confinement fusion power plants.</description>

      <title>Tritium-Lean Fusion Power Plants with Asymmetric Deuterium-Tritium Transport and Pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymmetries in deuterium-tritium (D-T) particle transport and divertor pumping speeds are shown to enhance tritium self-sufficiency in fusion power plants. Using a diffusive particle transport model that links the plasma core, separatrix, and divertor regions, it is shown that reducing tritium transport while increasing deuterium transport improves both tritium burn efficiency and overall fusion power. By selectively increasing deuterium transport, tritium burn efficiency can be further optimized, assuming the availability of asymmetric D-T fueling and advanced divertor technologies. These asymmetries become especially beneficial at high tritium burn efficiency. In one example, by increasing the D-T particle diffusivity ratio and decreasing the D-T divertor pump speed ratio, each by a factor of five, the tritium burn efficiency increases eleven-fold from 0.026 to 0.29 at fixed fusion power. We propose a novel approach to achieve asymmetric D-T pumping using either an isotope separation and divertor re-injection approach or a partial ionization plasma centrifuge. In an ARC-class power plant, this approach could yield an order-of-magnitude improvement in tritium burn efficiency and/or increases in fusion power output. These findings motivate the development of techniques and technologies to reduce core tritium transport and increase tritium divertor pumping speeds.</description>

      <title>A coordinate-free expression of plasma theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of plasmas, that is collectives of charged particles, is developed using the coordinate-free and geometric methods of exterior calculus. This dramatically simplifies the algebra and gives a geometric physical interpretation. The fundamental foundation on which the theory is built is the conservation of phase space volume expressed by the Generalized Liouville Equation in terms of the Lie derivative. The theory is expanded both in the order of the correlation and in the weakness of the correlation. This gives a Generalized BBGKY (Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon) Hierarchy. The derivation continues to give a new generalized formula for the Variational Theory of Reaction Rates (VTRR). Pullbacks of the generalized formulas to generic canonical coordinates and Poisson brackets are done. Where appropriate, the canonical coordinates are assumed to be "action-angle" coordinates that are generated by the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, the action. Finally, generalized forms of all the common kinetic equations are derived: the Vlasov Equation, the Boltzmann Equation, the Master Equation, the Fokker-Planck Equation, the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) Equation, the Fluid Equations, and the MagnetoHydroDynamic (MHD) Equations. Specific examples are given of these equations. The application of the VTRR to three-body recombination in a strong magnetic field is shown.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of energetic particles scattered in the solar wind : Magnetohydrodynamics and test-particle simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model the transport of solar energetic particles (SEPs) in the solar wind. We propagated relativistic test particles in the field of a steady three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the solar wind. We used the code MPI-AMRVAC for the wind simulations and integrated the relativistic guiding center equations using a new third-order-accurate predictor-corrector time-integration scheme. Turbulence-induced scattering of the particle trajectories in velocity space was taken into account through the inclusion of a constant field-aligned scattering mean free path $\lambda_\parallel$. We considered mid-range SEP electrons of $81\:{\rm keV}$ injected into the solar wind at a heliocentric distance of 0.28 AU and a magnetic latitude of $24^{\circ}$. For $\lambda_\parallel =0.5\:{\rm AU}$, the simulated velocity pitch angle distributions agree qualitatively well with in situ measurements at 1 AU. More generally, for $\lambda_\parallel$ in the range 0.1 to 1\:AU, an energy-loss rate associated with the velocity drift of about $10\%$ per day is observed. The energy loss is attributable to the magnetic curvature and gradient-induced poleward drifts of the electrons against the dominant component of the electric field. In our case study, which is representative of the average solar wind conditions, the observed drift-induced energy-loss rate is fastest near a heliocentric distance of 1.2 AU. We emphasize that adiabatic cooling is the dominant mechanism during the first 1.5 hours of propagation. Only at later times does the drift-associated loss rate become dominant.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection: an alternative explanation of radio emission in galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of galaxy clusters show radio emission extended over almost the system scale, necessitating mechanisms for particle acceleration. Previous models for acceleration such as diffusive shock acceleration and that due to turbulence can fall short in terms of efficiency. In this letter, we propose the possibility of acceleration via magnetic reconnection. In particular, we invoke the plasmoid instability which has been previously applied to understand particle energization in high energy systems. Turbulence in galaxy clusters lead to fluctuation dynamos that are known to generate magnetic fields structures consisting of sharp reversals. These form natural sites of reconnection. We perform Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations of the plasmoid instability in collisionless and nonrelativistic plasmas. We show that the resulting electron energy spectra have power law indices that are consistent with that inferred from observations. Our estimates show that the acceleration timescales are much smaller than the lifetime of the reconnecting magnetic structures indicating the feasibility of our model. The synchrotron radio luminosity estimate is about $10^{41}$ ergs/s, agreeing with observations. Finally, we find that the maximum achievable Lorentz factor can go upto $10^5$ indicating that acceleration due magnetic reconnection is a promising avenue for understanding the origin of nonthermal emission in galaxy clusters.</description>
