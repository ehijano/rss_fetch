      <title>Data-Driven Deep MIMO Detection:Network Architectures and Generalization Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical Multiuser Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) systems, symbol detection remains challenging due to severe inter-user interference and sensitivity to Channel State Information (CSI) uncertainty. In contrast to the mostly studied belief propagation-type model-driven methods, which incur high computational complexity, Soft Interference Cancellation (SIC) strikes a good balance between performance and complexity. To further address CSI mismatch and nonlinear effects, the recently proposed data-driven deep neural receivers, such as DeepSIC, leverage the advantages of deep neural networks for interference cancellation and symbol detection, demonstrating strong empirical performance. However, there is still a lack of theoretical underpinning for why and to what extent DeepSIC could generalize with the number of training samples. This paper proposes inspecting the fully data-driven DeepSIC detection within a Network-of-MLPs architecture, which is composed of multiple interconnected MLPs via outer and inner Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Within such an architecture, DeepSIC can be upgraded as a graph-based message-passing process using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), termed GNNSIC, with shared model parameters across users and iterations. Notably, GNNSIC achieves excellent expressivity comparable to DeepSIC with substantially fewer trainable parameters, resulting in improved sample efficiency and enhanced user generalization. By conducting a norm-based generalization analysis using Rademacher complexity, we reveal that an exponential dependence on the number of iterations for DeepSIC can be eliminated in GNNSIC due to parameter sharing. Simulation results demonstrate that GNNSIC attains comparable or improved Symbol Error Rate (SER) performance to DeepSIC with significantly fewer parameters and training samples.</description>

      <title>The Sim-to-Real Gap in MRS Quantification: A Systematic Deep Learning Validation for GABA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is used to quantify metabolites in vivo and estimate biomarkers for conditions ranging from neurological disorders to cancers. Quantifying low-concentration metabolites such as GABA ($\gamma$-aminobutyric acid) is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral overlap. We investigate and validate deep learning for quantifying complex, low-SNR, overlapping signals from MEGA-PRESS spectra, devise a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a Y-shaped autoencoder (YAE), and select the best models via Bayesian optimisation on 10,000 simulated spectra from slice-profile-aware MEGA-PRESS simulations. The selected models are trained on 100,000 simulated spectra. We validate their performance on 144 spectra from 112 experimental phantoms containing five metabolites of interest (GABA, Glu, Gln, NAA, Cr) with known ground truth concentrations across solution and gel series acquired at 3 T under varied bandwidths and implementations. These models are further assessed against the widely used LCModel quantification tool. On simulations, both models achieve near-perfect agreement (small MAEs; regression slopes $\approx 1.00$, $R^2 \approx 1.00$). On experimental phantom data, errors initially increased substantially. However, modelling variable linewidths in the training data significantly reduced this gap. The best augmented deep learning models achieved a mean MAE for GABA over all phantom spectra of 0.151 (YAE) and 0.160 (FCNN) in max-normalised relative concentrations, outperforming the conventional baseline LCModel (0.220). A sim-to-real gap remains, but physics-informed data augmentation substantially reduced it. Phantom ground truth is needed to judge whether a method will perform reliably on real data.</description>

      <title>Fast Spectrogram Event Extraction via Offline Self-Supervised Learning: From Fusion Diagnostics to Bioacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation fusion facilities like ITER face a "data deluge," generating petabytes of multi-diagnostic signals daily that challenge manual analysis. We present a "signals-first" self-supervised framework for the automated extraction of coherent and transient modes from high-noise time-frequency data. We also develop a general-purpose method and tool for extracting coherent, quasi-coherent, and transient modes for fluctuation measurements in tokamaks by employing non-linear optimal techniques in multichannel signal processing with a fast neural network surrogate on fast magnetics, electron cyclotron emission, CO2 interferometers, and beam emission spectroscopy measurements from DIII-D. Results are tested on data from DIII-D, TJ-II, and non-fusion spectrograms. With an inference latency of 0.5 seconds, this framework enables real-time mode identification and large-scale automated database generation for advanced plasma control.

      <title>Cooperative ISAC for Joint Localization and Velocity Estimation in Cell-Free MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework that utilizes orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms. Under the control of a central processing unit (CPU), multiple access points (APs) collaboratively perform multistatic sensing while providing communication service in a cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Achieving high sensing accuracy requires the collection of global sensing information at the CPU, which can lead to significant fronthaul signaling overhead due to the feedback of the sensing signals from each AP. To tackle this issue, we propose a collaborative processing scheme in which the APs locally compress and quantize the received sensing signals before forwarding them to the CPU. The CPU then aggregates the information from all APs to estimate the location and velocity of the targets. We develop a distributed vector-quantized variational autoencoder (D-VQVAE) to enable an end-to-end implementation of this scheme. D-VQVAE consists of distributed encoders at the APs to locally encode the received sensing signals, codebooks for quantizing the encoded results, and a decoder at the CPU for location and velocity estimation. It effectively reduces the amount of data transmitted from each AP to the CPU while maintaining a high sensing accuracy. We employ a collaborative learning-assisted scheme to train D-VQVAE in an end-to-end manner. Simulation results show that the proposed D-VQVAE network outperforms the baseline schemes in sensing accuracy and reduces fronthaul signaling overhead by 99% when compared with the centralized sensing approach.</description>

      <title>Waveform Design for Partial-Time Superimposed ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, waveforms of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are almost based on conventional communication and sensing signal, which bounds both the communication and sensing performance. To deal with this issue, in this paper, a novel waveform design is presented for the partial-time superimposed (PTS) ISAC system. At the base station (BS), a parameter-adjustable linear frequency modulation (LFM) pulse signal and a continuous communication orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal are employed to broadcast public information and perform sensing tasks, respectively, using a PTS scheme. Pulse compression gain enhances the system's long-range sensing capability, while OFDM ensures the system's high-speed data transmission capability. Meanwhile, the LFM signal is utilized as superimposed pilot for channel estimation, which has higher time-frequency resource utilization and stronger real-time performance compared to orthogonal pilots. We present an accurate parameter estimation method of multi-path sensing signal for reconstructing and interference cancellation in communication users. Additionally, a cyclic maximum likelihood method is introduced for channel estimation and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of channel estimation is derived. Simulations demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed parameter estimation algorithm as well as the improved channel estimation performance over traditional methods. The proposed waveform design method can achieve reliable data transmission and accurate target sensing.</description>

      <title>Height-Dependent Spectrum Activity Measurements and Modeling: A Case Study with FM Radio Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for wireless connectivity necessitates advanced spectrum modeling to enable efficient spectrum sharing for next-generation aerial communications. While traditional models often overlook vertical variations in signal behavior, this paper proposes a height-dependent propagation model using a helikite-mounted software-defined radio (SDR). We collected extensive measurement data across the 88 MHz to 6 GHz range in both urban and rural environments. As a case study to validate our methodology, we focus on the FM radio band, which allows us to use publicly available transmitter locations and transmit power levels to facilitate comparisons between analytical with measurement results. We identify a clear transition from non-line-of-sight (NLoS) to line-of-sight (LoS) regimes at a specific altitude threshold and propose an altitude-dependent path loss model that incorporates this transition. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the standard free space path loss (FSPL) model in complex urban topologies, providing a more accurate framework for altitude-aware spectrum prediction and management across emerging aerial wireless technologies and bands.</description>

      <title>Comparing Implicit Neural Representations and B-Splines for Continuous Function Fitting from Sparse Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous signal representations are naturally suited for inverse problems, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography, because the measurements depend on an underlying physically continuous signal. While classical methods rely on predefined analytical bases like B-splines, implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative that use coordinate-based networks to parameterize continuous functions with implicitly defined bases. Despite their empirical success, direct comparisons of their intrinsic representation capabilities with conventional models remain limited. This preliminary empirical study compares a positional-encoded INR with a cubic B-spline model for continuous function fitting from sparse random samples, isolating the representation capacity difference by only using coefficient-domain Tikhonov regularization. Results demonstrate that, under oracle hyperparameter selection, the INR achieves a lower normalized root-mean-squared error, yielding sharper edge transitions and fewer oscillatory artifacts than the oracle-tuned B-spline model. Additionally, we show that a practical bilevel optimization framework for INR hyperparameter selection based on measurement data split effectively approximates oracle performance. These findings empirically support the superior representation capacity of INRs for sparse data fitting.</description>

      <title>On Channel Estimation for Group-Connected Beyond Diagonal RIS Assisted Multi-User MIMO Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) architectures offer superior beamforming gain over conventional diagonal RISs. However, the channel estimation overhead is the main hurdle for reaping the above gain in practice. This letter addresses this issue for group-connected BDRIS aided uplink communication from multiple multi-antenna users to one multi-antenna base station (BS). We first reveal that within each BD-RIS group, the cascaded channel associated with one user antenna and one BD-RIS element is a scaled version of that associated with any other user antenna and BD-RIS element due to the common RIS-BS channel. This insight drastically reduces the dimensionality of the channel estimation problem. Building on this property, we propose an efficient two-phase channel estimation protocol. In the first phase, the reference cascaded channels for all groups are estimated in parallel based on common received signals while determining the scaling coefficients for a single reference antenna. In the second phase, the scaling coefficients for all remaining user antennas are estimated. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves substantially lower estimation error with fewer pilot signals compared to state-of-the-art benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Provable orbit recovery over SO(3) from the non-uniform second moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the recovery of an unknown three-dimensional band-limited signal from multiple noisy observations that are randomly rotated by latent elements of SO(3), where the rotations are drawn from an unknown, non-uniform distribution. Because the rotations are unobserved, only the signal orbit under the rotation group can be recovered. We show that the signal orbit and the rotation distribution are jointly identifiable from the first and second moments. This yields an improved high-noise sample complexity that scales quadratically with the noise variance, rather than cubically as in the uniform-rotation case. We further develop a provable, computationally efficient reconstruction algorithm that recovers the 3-D signal by successively solving a sequence of well-conditioned linear systems. The algorithm is validated through extensive numerical experiments. Our results provide a principled and tractable framework for high-noise 3-D orbit recovery, with potential relevance to cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography modeling, where molecules are observed in unknown orientations.</description>

      <title>Functional Continuous Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of non-stationary time-series data requires insight into its local and global patterns with physical interpretability. However, traditional smoothing algorithms, such as B-splines, Savitzky-Golay filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), lack the ability to perform parametric optimization with guaranteed continuity. In this paper, we propose Functional Continuous Decomposition (FCD), a JAX-accelerated framework that performs parametric, continuous optimization on a wide range of mathematical functions. By using Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to achieve up to $C^1$ continuous fitting, FCD transforms raw time-series data into $M$ modes that capture different temporal patterns from short-term to long-term trends. Applications of FCD include physics, medicine, financial analysis, and machine learning, where it is commonly used for the analysis of signal temporal patterns, optimized parameters, derivatives, and integrals of decomposition. Furthermore, FCD can be applied for physical analysis and feature extraction with an average SRMSE of 0.735 per segment and a speed of 0.47s on full decomposition of 1,000 points. Finally, we demonstrate that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) enhanced with FCD features, such as optimized function values, parameters, and derivatives, achieved 16.8% faster convergence and 2.5% higher accuracy over a standard CNN.</description>

      <title>FGFRFT: Fast Graph Fractional FourierTransform via Fourier Series Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) generalizes the graph Fourier transform (GFT) but suffers from a significant computational bottleneck: determining the optimal transform order requires expensive eigendecomposition and matrix multiplication, leading to $O(N^3)$ complexity. To address this issue, we propose a fast GFRFT (FGFRFT) algorithm for unitary GFT matrices based on Fourier series approximation and an efficient caching strategy. FGFRFT reduces the complexity of generating transform matrices to $O(2LN^2)$ while preserving differentiability, thereby enabling adaptive order learning. We validate the algorithm through theoretical analysis, approximation accuracy tests, and order learning experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate its practical efficacy for image and point cloud denoising and present the fractional specformer, which integrates the FGFRFT into the specformer architecture. This integration enables the model to overcome the limitations of a fixed GFT basis and learn optimal fractional orders for complex data. Experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm significantly accelerates computation and achieves superior performance compared with the GFRFT.</description>

      <title>Symbol-Aware Precoder Design for Physical-Layer Anonymous Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical-layer characteristics, such as channel state information (CSI) and transmitter noise induced by hardware impairments, are often uniquely associated with a transmitter. This paper investigates transmitter anonymity at the physical layer from a signal design perspective. We consider an anonymous communication problem where the receiver should reliably decode the signal from the transmitter but should not make use of the signal to infer the transmitter's identity.Transmitter anonymity is quantified using a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD)-based metric, which enables the formulation of explicit anonymity constraints in the precoder design.We then propose an anonymous symbol-level precoding strategy that preserves reliable communication under spatial multiplexing while preventing transmitter identification. The proposed framework employs a partitioned equal-gain combining (P-EGC) scheme that leverages receiver diversity without requiring transmitter-specific CSI. Simulation results demonstrate anonymity-reliability tradeoffs across different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and numbers of data streams. Moreover, the results reveal opposite trends of anonymity with respect to transmitter-dependent noise variations in the low-SNR and high-SNR regimes.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time Analysis of AFDM: Fundamental Bounds, and Effects of Pulse-Shaping and Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) has recently emerged as a resilient waveform candidate for high-mobility next-generation wireless systems. However, current literature mostly focuses on discrete time (DT) models, often overlooking effects and hardware non-idealities of actual continuous time (CT) signal generation. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing a CT-analytical framework based on the affine Fourier series (AFS) representation, which allows us to demonstrate that strictly bandlimited pulses and subcarrier suppression strategies are essential to maintain the multicarrier structure of the signal. In addition, we derive the analytical power spectral density of AFDM and evaluate its spectral characteristics in comparison with other multicarrier schemes, considering the impact of realistic truncated pulse-shaping. Furthermore, we analyze the sensitivity of the CT model to phase noise, carrier frequency offset, and sampling jitter, providing a theoretical analysis of communication performance. Finally, we derive closed-form Cram\'er-Rao bounds for channel parameter estimation, showing that the chirped modulation peculiar of AFDM increases the estimation variance but enables the resolution of Doppler ambiguities. Our findings provide the necessary theoretical and practical foundations for the implementation of AFDM in realistic wireless transceivers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional protection systems for microgrids, which rely on high fault currents and continuous communication, struggle to keep up with the changing dynamics and cybersecurity concerns of decentralized networks. In this study, we introduce a novel biologically inspired protection system based on neuromorphic principles, where each distributed energy resource (DER) functions as a simple neuron. These neurons process local changes in voltage, current signals, and converting them into spike patterns that represent the severity of disturbances. Just as neurons communicate via synapses in biological systems, we exploit transmission cables to coordinate between DERs, enabling them to share information and respond to faults collectively. Fault detection and circuit breaker activation are driven by a First-To-Spike (FTTS) mechanism, similar to the concept of traveling wave protection, but without needing GPS synchronization or communication links. A key innovation is the ability to use the timing of spikes to locally determine the nature of a fault, offering an intelligent, adaptive response to disturbances. Performance shows tripping latency of 10-58 ms, surpassing conventional relays and even traveling-wave methods (60 ms), while maintaining detection accuracy above 98% and spatial selectivity over 97%, enabling real-time, communication-free, scalable protection for plug-and-play microgrids.</description>

      <title>Timing Recovery and Sequence Detection for Integrate-and-Fire Time Encoding Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in neuromorphic signal processing have introduced time encoding machines as a promising alternative to conventional uniform sampling for low-power communication receivers. In this paradigm, analog signals are converted into event timings by an integrate-and-fire circuit, allowing information to be represented through spike times rather than amplitude samples. While event-driven sampling eliminates the need for a fixed-rate clock, receivers equipped with integrate-and-fire time encoding machines, called time encoding receivers, often assume perfect symbol synchronization, leaving the problem of symbol timing recovery unresolved. This paper presents a joint timing recovery and data detection framework for integrate-and-fire time encoding receivers. The log-likelihood function is derived to capture the dependence between firing times, symbol timing offset, and transmitted sequence, leading to a maximum likelihood formulation for joint timing estimation and sequence detection. A practical two-stage receiver is developed, consisting of a timing recovery algorithm followed by a zero-forcing detector. Simulation results demonstrate accurate symbol timing offset estimation and improved symbol error rate performance compared to existing time encoding receivers.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO-Assisted SWIPT Using Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores a next-generation multiple access (NGMA) framework for cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems enhanced by stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), aiming to improve simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) performance. A fundamental challenge lies in optimally selecting the operating modes of access points (APs) to jointly maximize the received energy and satisfy spectral efficiency (SE) quality-of-service constraints. Practical system impairments, including a non-linear harvested energy model, pilot contamination (PC), channel estimation errors, and reliance on long-term statistical channel state information (CSI), are considered. We derive closed-form expressions for both the achievable SE and the average sum harvested energy (sum-HE). A mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the SIM phase shifts, APs mode selection, and power allocation to maximize average sum-HE under SE and average harvested energy constraints. To solve this problem, we propose a centralized training, decentralized execution (CTDE) framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which efficiently handles high-dimensional decision spaces. A Markovian environment and a normalized joint reward function are introduced to enhance the training stability across on-policy and off-policy DRL algorithms. Additionally, we provide a two-phase convex-based solution as a theoretical robust performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DRL-based CTDE framework achieves SWIPT performance comparable to convexification-based solution, while significantly outperforming baselines.</description>

      <title>Optimal QAM Constellation for Over-the-Air Computation in the Presence of Heavy-Tailed Channel Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (OAC) enables low-latency aggregation over multiple-access channels (MACs) by exploiting the superposition property of the wireless medium to compute functions efficiently in distributed networks. A critical but often overlooked challenge is that electromagnetic interference in practical radio channels frequently exhibits heavy-tailed behavior, causing strong impulsive noise that severely degrades computation performance. This work studies digital OAC with QAM-based signaling under heavy-tailed interference modeled by a Cauchy distribution (lacking a finite second moment). We seek QAM-like constellations that minimize the mean-squared error (MSE) of sum aggregation subject to an average-power constraint. The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization, whose solution yields unique optimality conditions. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed design. Notably, the framework extends naturally to nomographic functions, broader constellation families, and alternative noise models.</description>

      <title>Distributed Continuous Aperture Arrays for Multiuser SWIPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a distributed continuous aperture array (D CAPA) to support simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) to multiple information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs). Each metasurface supports continuous surface currents that radiate electromagnetic (EM) waves for information and energy transmission to the users. These waves propagate through continuous EM channels characterized by the dyadic Green function. We formulate a system power consumption (PC) minimization problem subject to spectral efficiency and energy harvesting quality of service (QoS) requirements, where the QoS requirements are derived under the equal power allocation (EPA) scheme. An efficient two layer optimization algorithm is developed to solve this problem by optimizing the power allocation subject to the QoS violation penalties using augmented Lagrangian transformation. Our numerical results show that well optimized current distributions over each metasurface in the proposed D CAPA achieve up to 65% and 61% reductions in overall system PC compared to the EPA and colocated CAPA (C CAPA) cases, while maintaining the same total aperture size and transmission power.</description>

      <title>BRISC: A Dataset of Channel Measurements at 5 GHz With a Reflective Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the broadband reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) channel (BRISC) dataset. The dataset comprises measurements of channel state information (CSI) collected at 5.53 GHz using a 256-element RIS with binary states. In the measurement campaign, the transmitter and receiver are two software defined radios (SDRs), phase-synchronized via an OctoClock, where the transmitter (receiver) is equipped with one (two) antenna(s). To manage complexity, the RIS elements are grouped into blocks of different sizes, where all elements within a block share the same state. CSIs have been captured for multiple a) transmitter positions (and fixed receiver location), b) pilot block sizes, and c) state configurations. Furthermore, we calibrated the parameters of state-of-the-art RIS channel models to fit the measured CSI. With approximately 10000 configurations explored per transmitting position, BRISC serves as a robust benchmark in communication applications. We also show here an example of its use for physical-layer authentication.</description>

      <title>Resilient Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel optimization framework for enhancing the security resilience of cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) networks with multi-antenna access points (APs) and protective partial zero-forcing (PPZF) under active eavesdropping. Based on the main principles of absorption, adaptation, and recovery, we formulate a security-aware resilience metric to quantify the system performance during and after a security outage. A multi-user service priority-aware power allocation problem is formulated to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between real-time and desired security efficiency, thereby enabling a trade-off between the target user's secrecy performance and multi-user quality of service (QoS). To solve this non-convex problem, a security-aware iterative algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) is employed. The proposed algorithm determines the optimal power allocation strategy by balancing solution quality against recovery time. At each iteration, it evaluates the overall resilience score and selects the strategy that achieves the highest value. Simulation results confirm that the proposed framework significantly improves the resilience of CF-mMIMO networks, allowing flexible adaptation between rapid recovery and high-quality recovery, depending on system requirements.</description>

      <title>Attention-Based SINR Estimation in User-Centric Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is central to performance optimization in user-centric beamforming for satellite-based non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). Its assessment either requires the transmission of dedicated pilots or relies on computing the beamforming matrix through minimum mean squared error (MMSE)-based formulations beforehand, a process that introduces significant computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity SINR estimation framework that leverages multi-head self-attention (MHSA) to extract inter-user interference features directly from either channel state information or user location reports. The proposed dual MHSA (DMHSA) models evaluate the SINR of a scheduled user group without requiring explicit MMSE calculations. The architecture achieves a computational complexity reduction by a factor of three in the CSI-based setting and by two orders of magnitude in the location-based configuration, the latter benefiting from the lower dimensionality of user reports. We show that both DMHSA models maintain high estimation accuracy, with the root mean squared error typically below 1 dB with priority-queuing-based scheduled users. These results enable the integration of DMHSA-based estimators into scheduling procedures, allowing the evaluation of multiple candidate user groups and the selection of those offering the highest average SINR and capacity.</description>

      <title>On the Optimal Integer-Forcing Precoding: A Geometric Perspective and a Polynomial-Time Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The joint optimization of the integer matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and the power scaling matrix $\mathbf{D}$ is central to achieving the capacity-approaching performance of Integer-Forcing (IF) precoding. This problem, however, is known to be NP-hard, presenting a fundamental computational bottleneck. In this paper, we reveal that the solution space of this problem admits a intrinsic geometric structure: it can be partitioned into a finite number of conical regions, each associated with a distinct full-rank integer matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Leveraging this decomposition, we transform the NP-hard problem into a search over these regions and propose the Multi-Cone Nested Stochastic Pattern Search (MCN-SPS) algorithm. Our main theoretical result is that MCN-SPS finds a near-optimal solution with a computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}\left(K^4\log K\log_2(r_0)\right)$, which is polynomial in the number of users $K$. Numerical simulations corroborate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the algorithm's efficacy.</description>

      <title>Efficient Solvers for Coupling-Aware Beamforming in Continuous Aperture Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In continuous aperture arrays (CAPAs), careful consideration of the underlying physics is essential, among which electromagnetic (EM) mutual coupling plays a critical role in beamforming performance. Building on a physically consistent mutual coupling model, the beamforming design is formulated as a functional optimization whose optimality condition leads to a Fredholm integral equation. The incorporation of the coupling model, however, substantially increases computational complexity, necessitating efficient and accurate integral equation solvers. In this letter, we propose two efficient solvers: 1) a coordinate-transformation-based kernel approximation that preserves the operator structure while alleviating discretization demands, and 2) a direct lower-upper (LU)-based solver that stably handles the Nystr\"om-discretized system. Numerical results demonstrate improved accuracy and reduced computational overhead compared to conventional methods, with the LU-based solver emerging as an efficient and scalable solution for large-scale CAPA optimization via offline factorization.</description>

      <title>Hierarchic-EEG2Text: Assessing EEG-To-Text Decoding across Hierarchical Abstraction Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An electroencephalogram (EEG) records the spatially averaged electrical activity of neurons in the brain, measured from the human scalp. Prior studies have explored EEG-based classification of objects or concepts, often for passive viewing of briefly presented image or video stimuli, with limited classes. Because EEG exhibits a low signal-to-noise ratio, recognizing fine-grained representations across a large number of classes remains challenging; however, abstract-level object representations may exist. In this work, we investigate whether EEG captures object representations across multiple hierarchical levels, and propose episodic analysis, in which a Machine Learning (ML) model is evaluated across various, yet related, classification tasks (episodes). Unlike prior episodic EEG studies that rely on fixed or randomly sampled classes of equal cardinality, we adopt hierarchy-aware episode sampling using WordNet to generate episodes with variable classes of diverse hierarchy. We also present the largest episodic framework in the EEG domain for detecting observed text from EEG signals in the PEERS dataset, comprising $931538$ EEG samples under $1610$ object labels, acquired from $264$ human participants (subjects) performing controlled cognitive tasks, enabling the study of neural dynamics underlying perception, decision-making, and performance monitoring.
  We examine how the semantic abstraction level affects classification performance across multiple learning techniques and architectures, providing a comprehensive analysis. The models tend to improve performance when the classification categories are drawn from higher levels of the hierarchy, suggesting sensitivity to abstraction. Our work highlights abstraction depth as an underexplored dimension of EEG decoding and motivates future research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Scaling Vision Transformers: Evaluating DeepSpeed for Image-Centric Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in image processing tasks by utilizing self-attention mechanisms to capture global relationships within data. However, their scalability is hindered by significant computational and memory demands, especially for large-scale models with many parameters. This study aims to leverage DeepSpeed, a highly efficient distributed training framework that is commonly used for language models, to enhance the scalability and performance of ViTs. We evaluate intra- and inter-node training efficiency across multiple GPU configurations on various datasets like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, exploring the impact of distributed data parallelism on training speed, communication overhead, and overall scalability (strong and weak scaling). By systematically varying software parameters, such as batch size and gradient accumulation, we identify key factors influencing performance of distributed training. The experiments in this study provide a foundational basis for applying DeepSpeed to image-related tasks. Future work will extend these investigations to deepen our understanding of DeepSpeed's limitations and explore strategies for optimizing distributed training pipelines for Vision Transformers.</description>

      <title>A Light Fixture Color Temperature and Color Rendering Index Measuring Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correlated color temperature (CCT) and color rendering index (CRI) of artificial light sources are important because they have implications for human biology and professional applications. Although CCT information is generally available for commercial lamps, CRI is commonly not reported. In addition, devices measuring these parameters are difficult to access as they require a spectrophotometer, a commonly expensive device. In this context, the present work designs and builds a meter in detail, from the structural part of the equipment, interface with sensors, and the calculation to the compensation algorithms implementation, aiming to build the dedicated functionalities of a spectrophotometer, which is designed without the use of optical lenses. In addition to simplifying the device, this approach allows measurements free from dispersions caused by chromatic aberrations typical of optical lenses. The prototype obtained proved to be effective, capturing the spectral power distributions of various light sources and calculating their CCT and CRI.</description>

      <title>Superimposed Pilot-Based OTFS: Will It Work?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a promising solution to handle doubly-selective fading, but its channel estimation is a nontrivial task in terms of maximizing spectral efficiency. Conventional pilot assignment approaches face challenges: the standard embedded pilot-based scheme suffers from low transmission rates, and the single superimposed pilot (SP)-based scheme experiences inevitable data-pilot interference, leading to coarse channel estimation. To cope with this issue, focusing on the SP-based OTFS system in channel coded scenarios, we propose a novel pilot assignment scheme and an iterative algorithm. The proposed scheme allocates multiple SPs per frame to estimate channel coefficients accurately. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm performs refined interference cancellation, utilizing a replica of data symbols generated from soft-decision outputs provided by a decoder. Assuming fair and unified conditions, we evaluate each pilot assignment scheme in terms of reliability, channel estimation accuracy, effective throughput, and computational complexity. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the multiple SP-based scheme, which balances the transmission rate and the interference cancellation performance, has the best throughput at the expense of slightly increased complexity. In addition, we confirm that the multiple SP-based scheme achieves further improved throughput due to the proposed interference cancellation algorithm.</description>

      <title>MoEMba: A Mamba-based Mixture of Experts for High-Density EMG-based Hand Gesture Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-Density surface Electromyography (HDsEMG) has emerged as a pivotal resource for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), offering direct insights into muscle activities and motion intentions. However, a significant challenge in practical implementations of HD-sEMG-based models is the low accuracy of inter-session and inter-subject classification. Variability between sessions can reach up to 40% due to the inherent temporal variability of HD-sEMG signals. Targeting this challenge, the paper introduces the MoEMba framework, a novel approach leveraging Selective StateSpace Models (SSMs) to enhance HD-sEMG-based gesture recognition. The MoEMba framework captures temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions through channel attention techniques. Furthermore, wavelet feature modulation is integrated to capture multi-scale temporal and spatial relations, improving signal representation. Experimental results on the CapgMyo HD-sEMG dataset demonstrate that MoEMba achieves a balanced accuracy of 56.9%, outperforming its state-of-the-art counterparts. The proposed framework's robustness to session-to-session variability and its efficient handling of high-dimensional multivariate time series data highlight its potential for advancing HD-sEMG-powered HCI systems.</description>

      <title>Single-Satellite-Based Geolocation of Broadcast GNSS Spoofers from Low Earth Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis and experimental demonstration of single-satellite single-pass geolocation of a terrestrial broadcast Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofer from Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The proliferation of LEO-based GNSS receivers offers the prospect of unprecedented spectrum awareness, enabling persistent GNSS interference detection and geolocation. Accurate LEO-based single-receiver emitter geolocation is possible when a range-rate time history can be extracted for the emitter. This paper presents a technique crafted specifically for indiscriminate broadcast-type GNSS spoofing signals. Furthermore, it explores how unmodeled oscillator instability and worst-case spoofer-introduced signal variations degrade the geolocation estimate. The proposed geolocation technique is validated by a controlled experiment, in partnership with Spire Global, in which a LEO-based receiver captures broadcast GNSS spoofing signals transmitted from a known ground station on a non-GNSS frequency band.</description>

      <title>Bistatic Passive Sensing via CSI Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Passive object sensing with communication signals is a key enabler of perceptive mobile networks and integrated sensing and communication. In practical bistatic deployments, transmitter-receiver asynchrony and hardware impairments introduce time-varying random phase offsets in Channel State Information (CSI). Together with limited bandwidth and small antenna arrays, these effects degrade sensing accuracy. This work proposes a lightweight bistatic passive tracking and sensing framework that operates in the CSI-power domain. CSI power suppresses these offsets without explicit phase calibration, while preserving target-induced sensing cues. We show that physically admissible constraints in the spatial-frequency domain induced by transmitter-receiver geometry can resolve the mirror ambiguity inherent to real-valued CSI power. Building on these properties, we develop a real-time 3D Fourier-domain processing pipeline that jointly recovers spectral (delay), spatial (angle), and temporal (Doppler) signatures. The resulting features are integrated into an online framework with adaptive motion detection, outlier suppression, and extended Kalman filter tracking with deterministic initialization, followed by position-refined micro-Doppler feature extraction for micro-motion sensing. Extensive experiments, including simulations, a real-world prototype using 3.1 GHz LTE signals, and an open-source gait recognition dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CSI-power-based framework for bistatic passive tracking and sensing.</description>

      <title>Rethinking RSSI for WiFi Sensing</title>

Abstract: The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is ubiquitously available on commodity WiFi devices but is commonly regarded as too coarse for fine-grained sensing. This paper revisits its sensing potential and presents WiRSSI, a bistatic WiFi sensing framework that enables RSSI-only passive human tracking and motion sensing. WiRSSI employs a transmitter and a receiver equipped with a three-antenna array (1Tx-3Rx), and is readily extensible to Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) deployments. We first show how Channel State Information (CSI) power implicitly preserves phase-related motion modulation and how this relationship carries over to RSSI, indicating that RSSI can retain exploitable Doppler, Angle-of-Arrival (AoA), and delay cues. WiRSSI extracts Doppler-AoA features via a lightweight 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) pipeline and infers bistatic delay from amplitude-only information in the absence of subcarrier-level phase. The estimated AoA and delay are then mapped to Cartesian coordinates and denoised to recover motion trajectories. Experiments in practical environments show that WiRSSI achieves median XY localization errors of 0.905 m, 0.784 m, and 0.785 m for elliptical, linear, and rectangular trajectories, respectively, compared with 0.574 m, 0.599 m, and 0.514 m from a representative CSI-based method. We further demonstrate RSSI-only gesture recognition on the Widar3.0 dataset, where WiRSSI features provide meaningful discriminative performance. These results suggest that, despite lacking subcarrier-level information compared with CSI, RSSI can support practical WiFi sensing as a complementary and hardware-friendly option when CSI is restricted, unreliable, or privacy-sensitive.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Future Connectivity: A Contemporary Survey on AI-empowered Satellite-based Non-Terrestrial Networks in 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01633</link>

Abstract: Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) are expected to be a critical component of 6th Generation (6G) networks, providing ubiquitous, continuous, and scalable services. Satellites emerge as the primary enabler for NTN, leveraging their extensive coverage, stable orbits, scalability, and adherence to international regulations. However, satellite-based NTN presents unique challenges, including long propagation delay, high Doppler shift, frequent handovers, spectrum sharing complexities, and intricate beam and resource allocation, among others. The integration of NTNs into existing terrestrial networks in 6G introduces a range of novel challenges, including task offloading, network routing, network slicing, and many more. To tackle all these obstacles, this paper proposes Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a promising solution, harnessing its ability to capture intricate correlations among diverse network parameters. We begin by providing a comprehensive background on NTN and AI, highlighting the potential of AI techniques in addressing various NTN challenges. Next, we present an overview of existing works, emphasizing AI as an enabling tool for satellite-based NTN, and explore potential research directions. Furthermore, we discuss ongoing research efforts that aim to enable AI in satellite-based NTN through software-defined implementations, while also discussing the associated challenges. Finally, we conclude by providing insights and recommendations for enabling AI-driven satellite-based NTN in future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Framework for Graph Neural Operators: Convergence Guarantees and Tradeoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphons, as limits of graph sequences, provide an operator-theoretic framework for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of graph neural operators. Spectral convergence of sampled graphs to graphons induces convergence of the corresponding neural operators, enabling transferability analyses of graph neural networks (GNNs). This paper develops a unified spectral framework that brings together convergence results under different assumptions on the underlying graphon, including no regularity, global Lipschitz continuity, and piecewise-Lipschitz continuity. The framework places these results in a common operator setting, enabling direct comparison of their assumptions, convergence rates, and tradeoffs. We further illustrate the empirical tightness of these rates on synthetic and real-world graphs.</description>
