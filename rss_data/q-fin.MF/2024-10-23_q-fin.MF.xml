      <title>Dynamic graph neural networks for enhanced volatility prediction in financial markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volatility forecasting is essential for risk management and decision-making in financial markets. Traditional models like Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) effectively capture volatility clustering but often fail to model complex, non-linear interdependencies between multiple indices. This paper proposes a novel approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent global financial markets as dynamic graphs. The Temporal Graph Attention Network (Temporal GAT) combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to capture the temporal and structural dynamics of volatility spillovers. By utilizing correlation-based and volatility spillover indices, the Temporal GAT constructs directed graphs that enhance the accuracy of volatility predictions. Empirical results from a 15-year study of eight major global indices show that the Temporal GAT outperforms traditional GARCH models and other machine learning methods, particularly in short- to mid-term forecasts. The sensitivity and scenario-based analysis over a range of parameters and hyperparameters further demonstrate the significance of the proposed technique. Hence, this work highlights the potential of GNNs in modeling complex market behaviors, providing valuable insights for financial analysts and investors.</description>

      <title>Optimal consumption under relaxed benchmark tracking and consumption drawdown constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an optimal consumption problem with both relaxed benchmark tracking and consumption drawdown constraint, leading to a stochastic control problem with dynamic state-control constraints. In our relaxed tracking formulation, it is assumed that the fund manager can strategically inject capital to the fund account such that the total capital process always outperforms the benchmark process, which is described by a geometric Brownian motion. We first transform the original regular-singular control problem with state-control constraints into an equivalent regular control problem with a reflected state process and consumption drawdown constraint. By utilizing the dual transform and the optimal consumption behavior, we then turn to study the linear dual PDE with both Neumann boundary condition and free boundary condition in a piecewise manner across different regions. Using the smoothfit principle and the super-contact condition, we derive the closed-form solution of the dual PDE, and obtain the optimal investment and consumption in feedback form. We then prove the verification theorem on optimality by some novel arguments with the aid of an auxiliary reflected dual process and some technical estimations. Some numerical examples and financial insights are also presented.</description>

      <title>Nash equilibria for dividend distribution with competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct Nash equilibria in feedback form for a class of two-person stochastic games of singular control with absorption, arising from a stylized model for corporate finance. More precisely, the paper focusses on a strategic dynamic game in which two financially-constrained firms operate in the same market. The firms distribute dividends and are faced with default risk. The strategic interaction arises from the fact that if one firm defaults, the other one becomes a monopolist and increases its profitability. The firms choose their dividend distribution policies from a class of randomised strategies and we identify two types of equilibria, depending on the firms' initial endowments. In both situations the optimal strategies and the equilibrium payoffs are found explicitly.</description>
