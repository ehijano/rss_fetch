      <title>Scalable Optimal Motion Planning for Multi-Agent Systems by Cosserat Theory of Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the motion planning problem for large multi-agent systems, utilizing Cosserat rod theory to model the dynamic behavior of vehicle formations. The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem over partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe the system as a continuum. This approach ensures scalability with respect to the number of vehicles, as the problem's complexity remains unaffected by the size of the formation. The numerical discretization of the governing equations and problem's constraints is achieved through Bernstein surface polynomials, facilitating the conversion of the optimal control problem into a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem. This NLP problem is subsequently solved using off-the-shelf optimization software. We present several properties and algorithms related to Bernstein surface polynomials to support the selection of this methodology. Numerical demonstrations underscore the efficacy of this mathematical framework.</description>

      <title>An Integrated Supply Chain Network Design for Advanced Air Mobility Aircraft Manufacturing Using Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft manufacturers await numerous pre-orders for eVTOLs and expect demand for such advanced air mobility (AAM) aircraft to rise dramatically soon. However, eVTOL manufacturers (EMs) cannot commence mass production of commercial eVTOLs due to a lack of supply chain planning for eVTOL manufacturing. The eVTOL supply chain differs from traditional ones due to stringent quality standards and limited suppliers for eVTOL parts, shortages in skilled labor and machinery, and contract renegotiations with major aerospace suppliers. The emerging AAM aircraft market introduces uncertainties in supplier pricing and capacities, eVTOL manufacturing costs, and eVTOL demand, further compounding the supply chain planning challenges for EMs. Despite this critical need, no study has been conducted to develop a comprehensive supply chain planning model for EMs. To address this research gap, we propose a stochastic optimization model for integrated supply chain planning of EMs while maximizing their operating profits under the abovementioned uncertainties. We conduct various numerical cases to analyze the impact of 1) endogenous eVTOL demand influenced by the quality of eVTOLs, 2) supply chain disruptions caused by geopolitical conflicts and resource scarcity, and 3) high-volume eVTOL demand similar to that experienced by automotive manufacturers, on EM supply chain planning. The results indicate that our proposed model is adaptable in all cases and outperforms established benchmark stochastic models. The findings suggest that EMs can commence mass eVTOL production with our model, enabling them to make optimal decisions and profits even under potential disruptions.</description>

      <title>Data-driven confidence bound for structural response using segmented least squares: a mixed-integer programming approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of data-driven approaches to computational mechanics in elasticity, this paper presents a method finding a bound for structural response, taking uncertainty in a material data set into account. For construction of an uncertainty set, we adopt the segmented least squares so that a data set that is not fitted well by the linear regression model can be dealt with. Since the obtained uncertainty set is nonconvex, the optimization problem solved for the uncertainty analysis is nonconvex. We recast this optimization problem as a mixed-integer programming problem to find a global optimal solution. This global optimality, together with a fundamental property of the order statistics, guarantees that the obtained bound for the structural response is conservative, in the sense that, at least a specified confidence level, probability that the structural response is in this bound is no smaller than a specified target value. We present numerical examples for three different types of skeletal structures.</description>

      <title>Shape-Constrained Distributional Optimization via Importance-Weighted Sample Average Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape-constrained optimization arises in a wide range of problems including distributionally robust optimization (DRO) that has surging popularity in recent years. In the DRO literature, these problems are usually solved via reduction into moment-constrained problems using the Choquet representation. While powerful, such an approach could face tractability challenges arising from the geometries and the compatibility between the shape and the objective function and moment constraints. In this paper, we propose an alternative methodology to solve shape-constrained optimization problems by integrating sample average approximation with importance sampling, the latter used to convert the distributional optimization into an optimization problem over the likelihood ratio with respect to a sampling distribution. We demonstrate how our approach, which relies on finite-dimensional linear programs, can handle a range of shape-constrained problems beyond the reach of previous Choquet-based reformulations, and entails vanishing and quantifiable optimality gaps. Moreover, our theoretical analyses based on strong duality and empirical processes reveal the critical role of shape constraints in guaranteeing desirable consistency and convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Optimal Tracking Control for Strict-Feedback Nonlinear Systems With Non-Affine Nonlinear Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies the control ideas of the optimal backstepping technique, proposing an event-triggered optimal tracking control scheme for a class of strict-feedback nonlinear systems with non-affine and nonlinear faults. A simplified identifier-critic-actor framework is employed in the reinforcement learning algorithm to achieve optimal control. The identifier estimates the unknown dynamic functions, the critic evaluates the system performance, and the actor implements control actions, enabling modeling and control of anonymous systems for achieving optimal control performance. In this paper, a simplified reinforcement learning algorithm is designed by deriving update rules from the negative gradient of a simple positive function related to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and it also releases the stringent persistent excitation condition. Then, a fault-tolerant control method is developed by applying filtered signals for controller design. Additionally, to address communication resource reduction, an event-triggered mechanism is employed for designing the actual controller. Finally, the proposed scheme's feasibility is validated through theoretical analysis and simulation.</description>

      <title>McCormick envelopes in mixed-integer PDE-constrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: McCormick envelopes are a standard tool for deriving convex relaxations of optimization problems that involve polynomial terms. McCormick envelopes provide lower bounds, for example, in branch-and-bound procedures for mixed-integer nonlinear programs but have not gained much attention in infinite-dimensional optimization so far. This lack of attention may be due to the distributed nature of infinite-dimensional problems, which on the one hand leads to infinitely many constraints (generally state constraints that may be difficult to handle) that are added to the problem under consideration and on the other hand renders bound-tightening procedures that successively improve these convex envelopes computationally intractable.
  We take on the challenge and analyze McCormick envelopes for a model problem class that is governed by a semilinear PDE involving a bilinearity. We approximate the McCormick envelopes by averaging them over the cells of a discretization of the computational domain. This process yields convex problems that underestimate the original problem up to an a priori error estimate that depends on the mesh size of the discretization. These approximate McCormick envelopes can be improved by means of an optimization-based bound-tightening procedure and can be shown to $\Gamma$-converge to a limit problem with a pointwise formulation of the McCormick envelopes.
  We provide a computational example, for which we certify all of our imposed assumptions. The results point to both the potential of the methodology and the gaps in the research that need to be closed.
  Our methodology provides a framework first for obtaining pointwise underestimators for nonconvexities and second for approximating them with finitely many linear inequalities in a superordinate infinite-dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Online Algorithm for EV Charging Station Energy Management and Carbon Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing electric vehicle (EV) adoption challenges the energy management of charging stations (CSs) due to the large number of EVs and the underlying uncertainties. Moreover, the carbon footprint of CSs is growing significantly due to the rising charging power demand. This makes it important for CSs to properly manage their energy usage and ensure their carbon footprint stay within their carbon emission quotas. This paper proposes a two-stage online algorithm for this purpose, considering the different time scales of energy management and carbon trading. In the first stage, the CS characterizes the real-time aggregate EV power flexibility, in terms of upper and lower bounds on the total charging power, by a Lyapunov optimization-based online algorithm. In the second stage, the CS co-optimizes energy management and carbon trading, with EV charging power chosen within the aggregate flexibility region provided by the first stage. A generalized battery model is proposed to capture the dynamic carbon footprint changes and carbon trading. A virtual carbon queue is designed to develop an online algorithm for the second stage, which can ensure the carbon footprint of CS be within its carbon emission quota and its total operation cost is nearly offline optimal. Case studies validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Multicriteria Adjustable Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multicriteria adjustable robust optimization (MARO) problems arise in a wide variety of practical settings, for example, in the design of a building's energy supply. However, no general approaches, neither for the characterization of solutions to this problem class, nor potential solution methods, are available in the literature so far. We give different definitions for efficient solutions to MARO problems and look at three computational concepts to deal with the problems. These computational concepts can also be understood as additional solution definitions. We assess the advantages and disadvantages of the different computational approaches and analyze their connections to our initial definitions of MARO-efficiency. We observe that an $\varepsilon$-constraint inspired first-scalarize-then-robustify computational approach is beneficial because it provides an efficient set that is easy to understand for decision makers and provides tight bounds on the worst-case evaluation for a particular efficient solution. In contrast, a weighted sum first-scalarize-then-robustify approach keeps the problem structure more simple but is only beneficial if the desired trade-off between objectives is already known because the efficient set might look ambiguous. Further, we demonstrate that a first-robustify procedure only gives bad bounds and can be too optimistic as well as too pessimistic.</description>

      <title>Stabilizability of parabolic equations by switching controls based on point actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that a switching control involving a finite number of Dirac delta actuators is able to steer the state of a general class of nonautonomous parabolic equations to zero as time increases to infinity. The strategy is based on a recent feedback stabilizability result, which utilizes control forces given by linear combinations of appropriately located Dirac delta distribution actuators. Then, the existence of a stabilizing switching control with no more than one actuator active at each time instant is established. For the implementation in practice, the stabilization problem is formulated as an infinite horizon optimal control problem, with cardinality-type control constraints enforcing the switching property. Subsequently, this problem is tackled using a receding horizon framework. Its suboptimality and stabilizabilizing properties are analyzed. Numerical simulations validate the approach, illustrating its stabilizing and switching properties.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Maximum Principle for optimal advertising models with delay and non-convex control space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study optimal advertising problems that models the introduction of a new product into the market in the presence of carryover effects of the advertisement and with memory effects in the level of goodwill. In particular, we let the dynamics of the product goodwill to depend on the past, and also on past advertising efforts. We treat the problem by means of the stochastic Pontryagin maximum principle, that here is considered for a class of problems where in the state equation either the state or the control depend on the past. Moreover the control acts on the martingale term and the space of controls can be chosen to be non-convex. The maximum principle is thus formulated using a first-order adjoint Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs), which can be explicitly computed due to the specific characteristics of the model, and a second-order adjoint relation.</description>

      <title>Neural Data-Enabled Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) for linear systems utilizes data matrices of recorded trajectories to directly predict new system trajectories, which is very appealing for real-life applications. In this paper we leverage the universal approximation properties of neural networks (NNs) to develop neural DeePC algorithms for nonlinear systems. Firstly, we point out that the outputs of the last hidden layer of a deep NN implicitly construct a basis in a so-called neural (feature) space, while the output linear layer performs affine interpolation in the neural space. As such, we can train off-line a deep NN using large data sets of trajectories to learn the neural basis and compute on-line a suitable affine interpolation using DeePC. Secondly, methods for guaranteeing consistency of neural DeePC and for reducing computational complexity are developed. Several neural DeePC formulations are illustrated on a nonlinear pendulum example.</description>

      <title>LQR control for a system describing the interaction between a floating solid and the surrounding fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an infinite time horizon LQR optimal control problem for a system describing, within a linear approximation, the vertical oscillations of a floating solid, coupled to the motion of the free boundary fluid on which it floats. The fluid flow is described by a viscous version of the linearized Saint-Venant equations (shallow water regime). The major difficulty we are facing is that the domain occupied by the fluid is unbounded so that the system is not exponentially stable. This fact firstly raises challenges in proving the wellposedness, requiring the combined use of analytic semigroup theory and of an interpolation technique. The main contribution of the paper is that we show that, in spite of the lack of exponential stabilizability, we can define a wellposed LQR problem for which a Riccati based approach to design feedback controls can be implemented.</description>

      <title>A New Linear Programming Approach and a New Backtracking Strategy for Multiple-Gradient Descent in Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the author presents a novel method for finding descent directions shared by two or more differentiable functions defined on the same unconstrained domain space. Then, the author illustrates an alternative Multiple-Gradient Descent procedure for Multi-Objective Optimization problems that is based on this new method. In particular, the proposed method consists in finding the shared descent direction solving a relatively cheap Linear Programming (LP) problem, where the LP's objective function and the constraints are defined by the gradients of the objective functions of the Multi-Objective Optimization problem. More precisely, the formulation of the LP problem is such that, if a shared descent direction does not exist for the objective functions, but a non-ascent direction for all the objectives does, the LP problem returns the latter. Moreover, the author defines a new backtracking strategy for Multiple-Gradient Descent methods such that, if the proposed LP is used for computing the direction, the ability to reach and/or explore the Pareto set and the Pareto front is improved. A theoretical analysis of the properties of the new methods is performed, and tests on classic Multi-Objective Optimization problems are proposed to assess their goodness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the Pontryagin-type maximum principle for optimal control of quantum stochastic systems in fermion fields is obtained. These systems have gained significant prominence in numerous quantum applications ranging from physical chemistry to multi-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. Furthermore, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to backward quantum stochastic differential equations driven by fermion Brownian motion. The application of noncommutative martingale inequalities and the martingale representation theorem enables this achievement.</description>

      <title>Shape differentiation for Poincar\'e maps of harmonic fields in toroidal domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study Poincar\'e maps of harmonic fields in toroidal domains using a shape variational approach. Given a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^3$, we define its harmonic fields as the set of magnetic fields which are curl free and tangent to the boundary. For toroidal domains, this space is one dimensional, and one may thus single out a harmonic field by specifying a degree of freedom, such as the circulation along a toroidal loop. We are then interested in the Poincar\'e maps of such fields restricted to the boundary, which produce diffeomorphisms of the circle. We begin by proving a general shape differentiability result of such Poincar\'e maps in the smooth category, and obtain a general formula for the shape derivative. We then investigate two specific examples of interest; axisymmetric domains, and domains for which the harmonic field has a diophantine rotation number on the boundary. We prove that, in the first case, the shape derivative of the Poincar\'e map is always identically zero, whereas in the second case, assuming an additional condition on the geometry of the domain, the shape derivative of the Poincar\'e map may be any smooth function of the circle by choosing an appropriate perturbation of the domain.</description>

      <title>Idealized Social Dynamics In Bayesian Space of Assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present an idealized hypotheses-drawn model describing dynamics of variability in business and other social areas. A new construct is introduced called the Bayesian space of assessments to consider changes in positions of individuals and intrinsically interrelated entities called social bodies. The bodies spatial coordinates are their assessments in any required for a specific purpose professional and or ethical dimensions. A concept of market power introduced originally in entrepreneurship and technology commercialization (Michael Danov, Brock Smith, and Ronald Mitchell, 2003) is extended to become a driving force applicable to other social processes. The model describes interrelations between driving forces acting on social bodies and changes in positions of these bodies in the Bayesian space of assessments. Implications are discussed for some business and political oscillations.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Integer Programming Formulation of Graph Matching Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph theory has been a powerful tool in solving difficult and complex problems arising in all disciplines. In particular, graph matching is a classical problem in pattern analysis with enormous applications. Many graph problems have been formulated as a mathematical program and then solved using exact, heuristic, and/or approximated-guaranteed procedures. On the other hand, graph theory has been a powerful tool in visualizing and understanding complex mathematical programming problems, especially integer programs. Formulating a graph problem as a natural integer program (IP) is often a challenging task. However, an IP formulation of the problem has many advantages. Several researchers have noted the need for natural IP formulation of graph theoretic problems. The present study aims to provide a unified framework for IP formulation of graph-matching problems. Although there are many surveys on graph matching problems, none is concerned with IP formulation. This paper is the first to provide a comprehensive IP formulation for such problems. The framework includes a variety of graph optimization problems in the literature. While these problems have been studied by different research communities, however, the framework presented here helps to bring efforts from different disciplines to tackle such diverse and complex problems. We hope the present study can significantly help to simplify some of the difficult problems arising in practice, especially in pattern analysis.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Regret for Black-Box Predict-then-Optimize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the predict-then-optimize paradigm for decision-making in which a practitioner (1) trains a supervised learning model on historical data of decisions, contexts, and rewards, and then (2) uses the resulting model to make future binary decisions for new contexts by finding the decision that maximizes the model's predicted reward. This approach is common in industry. Past analysis assumes that rewards are observed for all actions for all historical contexts, which is possible only in problems with special structure. Motivated by problems from ads targeting and recommender systems, we study new black-box predict-then-optimize problems that lack this special structure and where we only observe the reward from the action taken. We present a novel loss function, which we call Empirical Soft Regret (ESR), designed to significantly improve reward when used in training compared to classical accuracy-based metrics like mean-squared error. This loss function targets the regret achieved when taking a suboptimal decision; because the regret is generally not differentiable, we propose a differentiable "soft" regret term that allows the use of neural networks and other flexible machine learning models dependent on gradient-based training. In the particular case of paired data, we show theoretically that optimizing our loss function yields asymptotically optimal regret within the class of supervised learning models. We also show our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on real-world decision-making problems in news recommendation and personalized healthcare compared to benchmark methods from contextual bandits and conditional average treatment effect estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates first the existence and uniqueness of solutions for McKean-Vlasov forward-backward doubly stochastic differential equations (MV-FBDSDEs) in infinite-dimensional real separable Hilbert spaces. These equations combine the features of forward-backward doubly stochastic differential equations with the mean-field approach, allowing the coefficients to depend on the solution distribution. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for MV-FBDSDEs using the method of continuation and provide an example and a counterexample to illustrate our findings. Moreover, we extend the practical applicability of our results by employing them within the context of the stochastic maximum principle for a control problem governed by MV-FBDSDEs. This study contributes to the field of stochastic control problems and presents the first analysis of MV-FBDSDEs in infinite-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the null controllability of forward and backward linear stochastic parabolic equations with linear Robin (or Fourier) boundary conditions. These equations incorporate zero and first order terms with bounded coefficients. To prove our null controllability results, a key tool will be the derivation of two new global Carleman estimates for the weak solutions of the corresponding adjoint equations in negative Sobolev space. These Carleman estimates are established using a duality method.</description>

      <title>Highly Connected Graph Partitioning: Exact Formulation and Solution Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph partitioning (GP) and vertex connectivity have traditionally been two distinct fields of study. This paper introduces the highly connected graph partitioning (HCGP) problem, which partitions a graph into compact, size balanced, and $Q$-(vertex) connected parts for any $Q\geq 1$. This problem is valuable in applications that seek cohesion and fault-tolerance within their parts, such as community detection in social networks and resiliency-focused partitioning of power networks. Existing research in this fundamental interconnection primarily focuses on providing theoretical existence guarantees of highly connected partitions for a limited set of dense graphs, and do not include canonical GP considerations such as size balance and compactness. This paper's key contribution is providing a general modeling and algorithmic approach for HCGP, inspired by recent work in the political districting problem, a special case of HCGP with $Q=1$. This approach models $Q$-connectivity constraints as mixed integer programs for any $Q\geq 1$ and provides an efficient branch-and-cut method to solve HCGP. When solution time is a priority over optimality, this paper provides a heuristic method specifically designed for HCGP with $Q=2$. A computational analysis evaluates these methods using a test bed of instances from various real-world graphs. In this analysis, the branch-and-cut method finds an optimal solution within one hour in $82.8\%$ of the instances solved. For $Q=2$, small and sparse instances are challenging for the heuristic, whereas large and sparse instances are challenging for the exact method. Furthermore, this study quantifies the computational cost of ensuring higher connectivity using the branch-and-cut approach, compared to a baseline of ensuring $1$-connectivity. Overall, this work serves as an effective tool to partition a graph into resilient and cohesive parts.</description>

      <title>Testing Quantum and Simulated Annealers on the Drone Delivery Packing Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using drones to perform human-related tasks can play a key role in various fields, such as defense, disaster response, agriculture, healthcare, and many others. The drone delivery packing problem (DDPP) arises in the context of logistics in response to an increasing demand in the delivery process along with the necessity of lowering human intervention. The DDPP is usually formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem, aiming to minimize drone usage with specific battery constraints while ensuring timely consistent deliveries with fixed locations and energy budget. In this work, we propose two alternative formulations of the DDPP as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, in order to test the performance of classical and quantum annealing (QA) approaches. We perform extensive experiments showing the advantages as well as the limitations of quantum annealers for this optimization problem, as compared to simulated annealing (SA) and classical state-of-the-art commercial tools for global optimization.</description>

      <title>On Circuit Diameter Bounds via Circuit Imbalances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.07913v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the circuit diameter of polyhedra, introduced by Borgwardt, Finhold, and Hemmecke (SIDMA 2015) as a relaxation of the combinatorial diameter. We show that the circuit diameter of a system $\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n: Ax=b, 0\leq x\leq u\}$ for $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is bounded by $O(m \min\{m, n-m\} \log(m+ \kappa_A)+n \log n)$, where $\kappa_A$ is the circuit imbalance measure of the constraint matrix. This yields a strongly polynomial circuit diameter bound if e.g., all entries of $A$ have polynomially bounded encoding length in $n$. Further, we present circuit augmentation algorithms for LPs using the minimum-ratio circuit cancelling rule. Even though the standard minimum-ratio circuit cancelling algorithm is not finite in general, our variant can solve an LP in $O(mn^2\log(n+\kappa_A))$ augmentation steps.</description>

      <title>Two sided ergodic singular control and mean field game for diffusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a probabilistic mean-field game driven by a linear diffusion an individual player aims to minimize an ergodic long-run cost by controlling the diffusion through a pair of -- increasing and decreasing -- c\`adl\`ag processes, while he is interacting with an aggregate of players through the expectation of a similar diffusion controlled by another pair of c\`adl\`ag processes. In order to find equilibrium points in this game, we first consider the control problem, in which the individual player has no interaction with the aggregate of players. In this case, we prove that the best policy is to reflect the diffusion process within two thresholds. Based on these results, we obtain criteria for the existence of equilibrium points in the mean-field game in the case when the controls of the aggregate of players are of reflection type, and give a pair of nonlinear equations to find these equilibrium points. In addition, we present an approximation result for Nash equilibria of erdogic games with finitely many players to the mean-field game equilibria considered above when the number of players tends to infinity. These results are illustrated by several examples where the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium points depend on the coefficients of the underlying diffusion.</description>

      <title>On the detection of the presence of malicious components in cyber-physical systems in the almost sure sense</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article studies a fundamental problem of security of cyber-physical systems (CPSs): that of detecting, almost surely, the presence of malicious components in the CPS. We assume that some of the actuators may be malicious while all sensors are honest. We introduce a novel idea of separability of state trajectories generated by CPSs in two situations: those under the nominal no-attack situation and those under the influence of an attacker. We establish its connection to security of CPSs in the context of detecting the presence of malicious actuators (if any) in them. As primary contributions we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the aforementioned detection in CPSs modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs). Moreover, we focus on the mechanism of perturbing the pre-determined control policies of the honest agents in CPSs modeled as stochastic linear systems, by injecting a certain class of random process called private excitation; sufficient conditions for detectability and non-detectability of the presence of malicious actuators assuming that the policies are randomized history dependent and randomized Markovian, are established. Several technical aspects of our results are discussed extensively.</description>

      <title>Free Descriptions of Convex Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convex sets arising in a variety of applications are well-defined for every relevant dimension. Examples include the simplex and the spectraplex that correspond to probability distributions and to quantum states; combinatorial polytopes and their relaxations such as the cut polytope and the elliptope in integer programming; and unit balls of regularizers such as the $\ell_p$ and Schatten norms in inverse problems. Moreover, these sets are often specified using conic descriptions that can be obviously instantiated in any dimension. We develop a systematic framework to study such free descriptions of convex sets. We show that free descriptions arise from a recently-identified phenomenon in algebraic topology called representation stability, which relates invariants across dimensions in a sequence of group representations. Our framework yields structural results for free descriptions pertaining to the relations between the sets they describe across dimensions, extendability of a single set in a given dimension to a freely-described sequence, and continuous limits of such sequences. We also develop a procedure to obtain parametric families of freely-described convex sets whose structure is adapted to a given application; illustrations are provided via examples that arise in the literature as well as new families that are derived using our procedure. We demonstrate the utility of our framework in two contexts. First, we develop an algorithm for a free analog of the convex regression problem, where a convex function is fit to input-output data; by searching over our parametric families, we can fit a function to low-dimensional inputs and extend it to any other dimension. Second, we prove that many sequences of symmetric conic programs can be solved in constant time, which unifies and strengthens several results in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain graph theoretic necessary and sufficient conditions for the structural controllability of drift free bilinear systems on the special Euclidean group leveraging results from the existing literature.
  The graph theoretic conditions allow us to check the structural controllability in polynomial time.
  We use these conditions to find the sparsest structures for structural controllability.
  These conditions can also be used to check the structural accessibility of bilinear systems with drift.
  Equivalent conditions using the permutation group are also obtained.
  We consider the problem of link failures within a given structure and obtain equivalent conditions for structural controllability which are polynomial time checkable.
  We show that the problem of finding sparsest structures under $k$ link failures is NP-hard for $k&gt;0$.
  We also discuss the case of structural controllability under probabilistic link failures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present generalizations of Newton's method that incorporate derivatives of an arbitrary order $d$ but maintain a polynomial dependence on dimension in their cost per iteration. At each step, our $d^{\text{th}}$-order method uses semidefinite programming to construct and minimize a sum of squares-convex approximation to the $d^{\text{th}}$-order Taylor expansion of the function we wish to minimize. We prove that our $d^{\text{th}}$-order method has local convergence of order $d$. This results in lower oracle complexity compared to the classical Newton method. We show on numerical examples that basins of attraction around local minima can get larger as $d$ increases. Under additional assumptions, we present a modified algorithm, again with polynomial cost per iteration, which is globally convergent and has local convergence of order $d$.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of Trajectory Optimization (TO) for a general class of stiff and constrained dynamic systems. We establish a set of mild assumptions, under which we show that TO converges numerically stably to a locally optimal and feasible solution up to arbitrary user-specified error tolerance. Our key observation is that all prior works use SQP as a black-box solver, where a TO problem is formulated as a Nonlinear Program (NLP) and the underlying SQP solver is not allowed to modify the NLP. Instead, we propose a white-box TO solver, where the SQP solver is informed with characteristics of the objective function and the dynamic system. It then uses these characteristics to derive approximate dynamic systems and customize the discretization schemes.</description>

      <title>Operator Splitting for Learning to Predict Equilibria in Convex Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.00906v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systems of competing agents can often be modeled as games. Assuming rationality, the most likely outcomes are given by an equilibrium (e.g. a Nash equilibrium). In many practical settings, games are influenced by context, i.e. additional data beyond the control of any agent (e.g. weather for traffic and fiscal policy for market economies). Often the exact game mechanics are unknown, yet vast amounts of historical data consisting of (context, equilibrium) pairs are available, raising the possibility of learning a solver which predicts the equilibria given only the context. We introduce Nash Fixed Point Networks (N-FPNs), a class of neural networks that naturally output equilibria. Crucially, N- FPNs employ a constraint decoupling scheme to handle complicated agent action sets while avoiding expensive projections. Empirically, we find N-FPNs are compatible with the recently developed Jacobian-Free Backpropagation technique for training implicit networks, making them significantly faster and easier to train than prior models. Our experiments show N-FPNs are capable of scaling to problems orders of magnitude larger than existing learned game solvers.</description>

Abstract: TWe establish regret lower bounds for adaptively controlling an unknown linear Gaussian system with quadratic costs. We combine ideas from experiment design, estimation theory and a perturbation bound of certain information matrices to derive regret lower bounds exhibiting scaling on the order of magnitude $\sqrt{T}$ in the time horizon $T$. Our bounds accurately capture the role of control-theoretic parameters and we are able to show that systems that are hard to control are also hard to learn to control; when instantiated to state feedback systems we recover the dimensional dependency of earlier work but with improved scaling with system-theoretic constants such as system costs and Gramians. Furthermore, we extend our results to a class of partially observed systems and demonstrate that systems with poor observability structure also are hard to learn to control.</description>

Abstract: This note studies the exponential convergence of input-output signals of discrete-time nonlinear systems composed of a feedback interconnection of a linear time-invariant system and a nonlinear uncertainty. Both the open-loop subsystems are allowed to be unbounded. Integral-quadratic-constraint-based conditions are proposed for these uncertain feedback systems, including the Lurye type, to exhibit the property that the endogenous input-output signals enjoy an exponential convergence rate for all initial conditions of the linear time-invariant subsystem. The conditions are established via a combination of tools, including integral quadratic constraints, directed gap, and exponential weightings.</description>

In recent literature, taming has been proposed and studied as a method for ensuring stability of Langevin-based numerical schemes in the case of super-linearly growing drift coefficients for the Langevin SDE. In particular, the Tamed Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (TULA) was proposed in [Bro+19] to sample from such target distributions with the gradient of the potential $U$ being super-linearly growing. However, theoretical guarantees in Wasserstein distances for Langevin-based algorithms have traditionally been derived assuming strong convexity of the potential $U$. In this paper, we propose a novel taming factor and derive, under a setting with possibly non-convex potential $U$ and super-linearly growing gradient of $U$, non-asymptotic theoretical bounds in Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 distances between the law of our algorithm, which we name the modified Tamed Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (mTULA), and the target distribution $\pi_\beta$. We obtain respective rates of convergence $\mathcal{O}(\lambda)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^{1/2})$ in Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 distances for the discretisation error of mTULA in step size $\lambda$. High-dimensional numerical simulations which support our theoretical findings are presented to showcase the applicability of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>On $\ell_2$-performance of weakly-hard real-time control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers control systems with failures in the feedback channel, that occasionally lead to loss of the control input signal. A useful approach for modeling such failures is to consider window-based constraints on possible loss sequences, for example that at least r control attempts in every window of s are successful. A powerful framework to model such constraints are weakly-hard real-time constraints. Various approaches for stability analysis and the synthesis of stabilizing controllers for such systems have been presented in the past. However, existing results are mostly limited to asymptotic stability and rarely consider performance measures such as the resulting $\ell_2$-gain. To address this problem, we adapt a switched system description where the switching sequence is constrained by a graph that captures the loss information. We present an approach for $\ell_2$-performance analysis involving linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Further, leveraging a system lifting method, we propose an LMI-based approach for synthesizing state-feedback controllers with guaranteed $\ell_2$-performance. The results are illustrated by a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time mean field Markov decision models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a finite number of $N$ statistically equal agents, each moving on a finite set of states according to a continuous-time Markov Decision Process (MDP). Transition intensities of the agents and generated rewards depend not only on the state and action of the agent itself, but also on the states of the other agents as well as the chosen action. Interactions like this are typical for a wide range of models in e.g. biology, epidemics, finance, social science and queueing systems among others. The aim is to maximize the expected discounted reward of the system, i.e. the agents have to cooperate as a team. Computationally this is a difficult task when $N$ is large. Thus, we consider the limit for $N\to\infty.$ In contrast to other papers we treat this problem from an MDP perspective. This has the advantage that we need less regularity assumptions in order to construct asymptotically optimal strategies than using viscosity solutions of HJB equations. The convergence rate is $1/\sqrt{N}$. We show how to apply our results using two examples: a machine replacement problem and a problem from epidemics. We also show that optimal feedback policies from the limiting problem are not necessarily asymptotically optimal.</description>

      <title>Inclusion and estimates for the jumps of minimizers in variational denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stability and inclusion of the jump set of minimizers of convex denoising functionals, such as the celebrated "Rudin-Osher-Fatemi" functional, for scalar or vectorial signals. We show that under mild regularity assumptions on the data fidelity term and the regularizer, the jump set of the minimizer is essentially a subset of the original jump set. Moreover, we give an estimate on the magnitude of jumps in terms of the data. This extends old results, in particular of the first author (with V. Caselles and M. Novaga) and of T. Valkonen, to much more general cases. We also consider the case where the original datum has unbounded variation, and define a notion of its jump set which, again, must contain the jump set of the solution.</description>

      <title>Predictive Linear Online Tracking for Unknown Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of online tracking in linear control systems, where the objective is to follow a moving target. Unlike classical tracking control, the target is unknown, non-stationary, and its state is revealed sequentially, thus, fitting the framework of online non-stochastic control. We consider the case of quadratic costs and propose a new algorithm, called predictive linear online tracking (PLOT). The algorithm uses recursive least squares with exponential forgetting to learn a time-varying dynamic model of the target. The learned model is used in the optimal policy under the framework of receding horizon control. We show the dynamic regret of PLOT scales with $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{TV_T})$, where $V_T$ is the total variation of the target dynamics and $T$ is the time horizon. Unlike prior work, our theoretical results hold for non-stationary targets. We implement PLOT on a real quadrotor and provide open-source software, thus, showcasing one of the first successful applications of online control methods on real hardware.</description>

      <title>Shifted Interpolation for Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noisy gradient descent and its variants are the predominant algorithms for differentially private machine learning. It is a fundamental question to quantify their privacy leakage, yet tight characterizations remain open even in the foundational setting of convex losses. This paper improves over previous analyses by establishing (and refining) the "privacy amplification by iteration" phenomenon in the unifying framework of $f$-differential privacy--which tightly captures all aspects of the privacy loss and immediately implies tighter privacy accounting in other notions of differential privacy, e.g., $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP and R\'enyi DP. Our key technical insight is the construction of shifted interpolated processes that unravel the popular shifted-divergences argument, enabling generalizations beyond divergence-based relaxations of DP. Notably, this leads to the first exact privacy analysis in the foundational setting of strongly convex optimization. Our techniques extend to many settings: convex/strongly convex, constrained/unconstrained, full/cyclic/stochastic batches, and all combinations thereof. As an immediate corollary, we recover the $f$-DP characterization of the exponential mechanism for strongly convex optimization in Gopi et al. (2022), and moreover extend this result to more general settings.</description>

      <title>Interpolatory model order reduction of large-scale dynamical systems with root mean squared error measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The root mean squared error is an important measure used in a variety of applications such as structural dynamics and acoustics to model averaged deviations from standard behavior. For large-scale systems, simulations of this quantity quickly become computationally prohibitive. Classical model order reduction techniques attempt to resolve this issue via the construction of surrogate models that emulate the root mean squared error measure using an intermediate linear system. However, this approach requires a potentially large number of linear outputs, which can be disadvantageous in the design of reduced-order models. In this work, we consider directly the root mean squared error as the quantity of interest using the concept of quadratic-output models and propose several new model reduction techniques for the construction of appropriate surrogates. We test the proposed methods on a model for the vibrational response of a plate with tuned vibration absorbers.</description>

      <title>Provably Robust Score-Based Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Plug-and-Play Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a great number of tasks in science and engineering, the goal is to infer an unknown image from a small number of measurements collected from a known forward model describing certain sensing or imaging modality. Due to resource constraints, this task is often extremely ill-posed, which necessitates the adoption of expressive prior information to regularize the solution space. Score-based diffusion models, due to its impressive empirical success, have emerged as an appealing candidate of an expressive prior in image reconstruction. In order to accommodate diverse tasks at once, it is of great interest to develop efficient, consistent and robust algorithms that incorporate unconditional score functions of an image prior distribution in conjunction with flexible choices of forward models.
  This work develops an algorithmic framework for employing score-based diffusion models as an expressive data prior in general nonlinear inverse problems. Motivated by the plug-and-play framework in the imaging community, we introduce a diffusion plug-and-play method (DPnP) that alternatively calls two samplers, a proximal consistency sampler based solely on the likelihood function of the forward model, and a denoising diffusion sampler based solely on the score functions of the image prior. The key insight is that denoising under white Gaussian noise can be solved rigorously via both stochastic (i.e., DDPM-type) and deterministic (i.e., DDIM-type) samplers using the unconditional score functions. We establish both asymptotic and non-asymptotic performance guarantees of DPnP, and provide numerical experiments to illustrate its promise in solving both linear and nonlinear image reconstruction tasks. To the best of our knowledge, DPnP is the first provably-robust posterior sampling method for nonlinear inverse problems using unconditional diffusion priors.</description>

      <title>Bisimulation Metrics are Optimal Transport Distances, and Can be Computed Efficiently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new framework for formulating optimal transport distances between Markov chains. Previously known formulations studied couplings between the entire joint distribution induced by the chains, and derived solutions via a reduction to dynamic programming (DP) in an appropriately defined Markov decision process. This formulation has, however, not led to particularly efficient algorithms so far, since computing the associated DP operators requires fully solving a static optimal transport problem, and these operators need to be applied numerous times during the overall optimization process. In this work, we develop an alternative perspective by considering couplings between a flattened version of the joint distributions that we call discounted occupancy couplings, and show that calculating optimal transport distances in the full space of joint distributions can be equivalently formulated as solving a linear program (LP) in this reduced space. This LP formulation allows us to port several algorithmic ideas from other areas of optimal transport theory. In particular, our formulation makes it possible to introduce an appropriate notion of entropy regularization into the optimization problem, which in turn enables us to directly calculate optimal transport distances via a Sinkhorn-like method we call Sinkhorn Value Iteration (SVI). We show both theoretically and empirically that this method converges quickly to an optimal coupling, essentially at the same computational cost of running vanilla Sinkhorn in each pair of states. Along the way, we point out that our optimal transport distance exactly matches the common notion of bisimulation metrics between Markov chains, and thus our results also apply to computing such metrics, and in fact our algorithm turns out to be significantly more efficient than the best known methods developed so far for this purpose.</description>
