      <title>Quantum geometric contribution to the diffusion constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the quantum geometric contribution to the diffusion constant and the DC conductivity in metals and semimetals with linear Dirac dispersion. We demonstrate that, for systems with perfectly linear dispersion, there exists a clear and rigorous separation of the quantum geometric from the ordinary band velocity contributions to the diffusion constant, which turns out to be directly related to the separation of a rank two tensor into transverse and longitudinal parts. We also demonstrate that the diffusion constant of three-dimensional Dirac fermions at charge neutrality is entirely quantum geometric in origin, which is not the case for two-dimensional Dirac fermions. This is the result of an accidental perfect cancellation of the band velocity contribution in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Single-$q$ Cycloid and Double-$q$ Vortex Lattices in Layered Magnetic Semimetal EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a host of exotic magnetic textures such as topologically protected skyrmion lattices has been discovered in several bulk metallic lanthanide compounds. In addition to hosting skyrmion phases, a hallmark of this class of materials is the appearance of numerous spin textures characterized by a superposition of multi-$q$ magnetic modulations: spin moir\'{e} superlattices. The nuanced energy landscape thus motivates detailed studies to understand the underlying interactions. Here, we comprehensively characterize and model the three zero-field magnetic textures present in one such material, EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$. Systematic symmetry breaking experiments using magnetic field and strain determine that the ground state incommensurate magnetic phase (ICM1) is single-$q$. In contrast, ICM2 and ICM3 are both double-$q$, \textit{i.e.}, spin moir\'{e} superlattices. Further, through application of polarized small angle neutron scattering and spherical neutron polarimetry, we demonstrate that ICM1 is a single-$q$ cycloid and ICM2 and ICM3 are double-$q$ vortex lattices, with Eu moments lying in the $ab$-plane in zero field and with a ferromagnetic component at finite field. Despite the quasi-2D nature of EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$, the modulations propagate out of the \textit{ab}-plane, leading to a shift of the spin texture between triangle lattice planes. Further, the ICM3 to ICM2 transition includes an unusual 45$^\circ$ rotation of the magnetic vortex lattice. Motivated by the coexistence of such drastically different phases in this compound, we conclude by developing a phenomenological model to understand the stability of these states. Our experimental probes and theoretical modeling definitively characterize three different and tunable phases in one material, and provide insight for the design of new topological spin-texture materials.</description>

      <title>Cascade of Spin Moir\'e Superlattices with In-Plane Field in Triangle Lattice Semimetal EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$ is a rhombohedral europium triangle lattice material that exhibits a rich phase diagram of spin moir\'{e} superlattices (SMS) and single-$q$ magnetic phases. In this paper, we characterize the incommensurate phases accessible with field applied in the plane with small angle neutron scattering (SANS). A variety of phases with unusual SANS patterns are accessible with magnetic field applied along the $a$ and $a^*$ directions. Many of these phases can be understood to be multi-$q$ phases. One phase in particular, ICM2b (ICM=incommensurate magnetic phase), is rather unconventional in that it is an anisotropic multi-$q$ phase that can rotate freely within the $ab$-plane, dependent on magnetic field direction and history. The stabilization of tunable multi-$q$ incommensurate spin textures \textit{via} in-plane field sets this class of materials apart from conventional skyrmion materials. We further identify that the propagation vectors of the in-plane phases have a significant commensuration with the diameter of the smallest pocket of the Fermi surface ($2k_{\text{F}}$). The multi/single-$q$ nature is also correlated with the enhancement of resistivity, suggesting that a gap opens in the electron bands at $q=2k_{\text{F}}$. We also compare with a phenomenological model of the phase diagram. The richness of phases revealed in this study hint at the frustrated nature of the incommensurate magnetism present in EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$ and motivate further probes of these phases and the origin of the stability of spin moir\'{e} superlattices. Finally, the coupling of the multi-$q$ nature and $q=2k_{\text{F}}$ commensuration condition reveals the key requirements for a strong SMS transport response.</description>

      <title>Shot noise signatures identifying non-Abelian properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes were first proposed in 1976 as topologically protected zero-energy states localized at domain walls in one-dimensional Dirac systems. They have attracted widespread attention in the field of topological quantum computing, as they serve as non-superconducting analogs of Majorana zero modes and support non-Abelian statistics in topological insulator systems. %In the braiding process of the Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes, their braiding properties are closely related to the strength of disorder. However, compared to their Majorana cousins, the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes are vulnerable to the on-site energy deviation between the modes involved in the experiment. In this work, we propose to estimate the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero-modes through measurements of transport signatures, which are readily measurable in current experiments. We find that the fidelity of braiding operation reaches unity when the current noise is fully suppressed, while this braiding fidelity monotonously decreases with the increasing of the current noise. Based on these transport signatures, we further discuss the correspondence between Majorana and Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes, highlighting their similarity in supporting non-Abelian statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of topological defects via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in a polariton supersolid in a liquid crystal microcavity with tunable Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. We predict analytically two different scalings in the slow- and fast-quench regimes, and confirm these predictions numerically. We also present experimental results for the slow-quench regime, demonstrating an original Kibble-Zurek scaling exponent $\eta_{KZM}=1.0\pm 0.2$</description>

      <title>Chiral topological superconductivity in twisted bilayer and double bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the emergence of chiral topological superconductivity in small-angle twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) and twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBLG). Using the low-energy continuum model and incorporating spin-triplet $p_{x}+i p_{y}$ pairing in each graphene layer, we construct the effective models for both tBLG and tDBLG with superconductivity. By varying the chemical potential, superconducting order parameter, and twist angle, we explore the emergence of topological superconducting phases via the calculation of Chern numbers. Our phase diagrams for tBLG and tDBLG (both AB-AB and AB-BA stackings) reveal distinct topological transitions, which are consistently marked by bulk gap-closing points. To gain further insight, we analyze the evolution of Chern numbers by tracking the number and location of gap closings within the moir\'e Brillouin zone. Additionally, we illustrate representative squared amplitude of Bloch states corresponding to different topological phases. In the later part of our study, the effect of trigonal warping on the topological superconducting properties is also discussed. Beyond the quantitative results, our study highlights how the interplay between moir\'e band structure and unconventional pairing symmetries enriches the landscape of possible superconducting states in twisted graphene systems. The framework developed here may also be extended to other multilayer moir\'e materials, offering a route towards engineering exotic topological superconductivity with tunable parameters.</description>

      <title>Theory of electric reactance emerging from spin Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin Hall effect in a heavy metal intercorrelates an AC electric current to the magnetization dynamics in an adjacent ferromagnet, which manifests as an electric reactance in the system's current-voltage response. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis for this emergent reactance contribution in the frequency regime relevant to transport measurements up to a few GHz. Our analysis reveals that the reactance becomes inductor-like at low frequency below the ferromagnetic resonance. Crucially, we find that the sign of the reactance is directly governed by the spin transfer mechanism at the interface, which depends on the competition between its damping-like and field-like components parametrized by the spin mixing conductance. This characteristic behavior in the reactance offers a powerful transport observable in distinguishing the interfacial spin transfer processes in spintronic materials.</description>

      <title>Direct demonstration of time-reversal-symmetry-breaking spin injection from a compensated magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The injection, propagation and detection of spin currents are essential physical processes in spintronics. So far, the separation of charge and spin currents was facilitated by the electrical spin injection from a ferromagnet (FM) or the injection by a relativistic spin Hall effect. The devices employed are lateral spin valves comprising spatially separated injection and detection electrodes, connected by a spin-propagation channel. The time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking FM spin injection is realized in a geometry with an electrical bias applied between the injection electrode and the channel and is modelled by a conserved spin-polarized drift current. In contrast, the spin injection by the T-symmetric relativistic spin Hall mechanism is driven by an electrical bias applied across the injection electrode alone, and is modelled by a non-conserved spin current transverse to the applied bias. In this work, we use a lateral spin valve with a Mn5Si3 injection electrode to directly demonstrate a TRS-breaking spin injection from a compensated magnet with a vanishing net magnetization. Specifically, the TRS-breaking is demonstrated by the fact that switching between time-reversed states of the compensated magnet changes the detected spin signal. Moreover, the TRS-breaking nature of the spin injection is observed in both experimental geometries with the different electrical biasing, while using the same detection electrode. We show that this unconventional spin-injection is consistent with different magnitudes and propagation angles of electrical currents in the spin-up and spin-down channel in a d-wave altermagnet. Here our symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations are based on the compensated collinear altermagnetic order which has provided a comprehensive microscopic interpretation of earlier structural, magnetic, and anomalous Hall and Nernst measurements in Mn5Si3 thin films.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how topological crystalline defects--dislocations--reshape the real-space quantum geometric tensor and act as tunable sources of quantum geometry. We show that dislocations strongly enhance the quantum metric, establishing a direct link between lattice topology and the Hilbert-space geometry of states. We characterize the quantum geometry of topological magnons in ordered arrays of dislocations, demonstrating that defect-induced geometric enhancement controls their localization and topological protection. In disordered arrays, dislocation-driven geometry expands the accessible topological phase space and enables transitions to disorder-induced topological phases. Our results identify the quantum metric as a tunable bridge between crystalline topology, magnonic excitations, and emergent topological matter in aperiodic solid-state and synthetic systems.</description>

      <title>Synergy and Competition of Dual Chirality in the Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity of Supramolecular Helices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in constructing supramolecular assemblies with hierarchical chirality offers new opportunities to investigate the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect and its potential applications. In this work, we systematically examine the CISS effect in such multichiral systems by designing a class of multilayer helical architectures constructed of stacked and interfaced individual helical rings, each possessing well-defined local chirality. Through controlled interlayer twisting, a global helical handedness is further imposed, forming a multichiral tubular helix. Theoretical calculations reveal that these two distinct chiral hierarchies lead to several unprecedented CISS phenomena, such as enhanced spin polarization arising from cooperative dual chirality, along with the simultaneous emergence of transverse and longitudinal CISS signals. Moreover, interlayer torsional competition modulates the system's response to external fields. The dual-chiral geometry breaks the conventional symmetry of single helices, inducing an anomalous angular phase shift in magnetoresistance. Furthermore, Floquet analysis reveals that the interplay between local and global chirality enables controlled spin polarization switching under circularly polarized light. These findings provide a basic theoretical framework for studying the CISS in multichiral superstructures and establish design principles for coupled optical, magnetic, and spin manipulations, thereby facilitating the development of multichiral spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Picosecond localization dynamics following ultrafast nanoscale magnetic switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrashort laser pulses provide the fastest known way to switch magnetic order. Such excitation commonly creates nanometer-scale domains, even after homogeneous illumination when the position of nucleated domains is not externally defined. However, the physics of domain localization during such ultrafast phase transitions remains unresolved. Here, we use shot-resolved pump-probe resonant x-ray scattering together with a material featuring a periodically modulated magnetic anisotropy landscape to track, in real time, the laser-driven nucleation and localization of nanometer-scale spin textures. We find that nucleation and localization are two distinct processes. Nucleation occurs homogeneously via fluctuations at early times, whereas spatially periodic structures emerge only later and, under suitable conditions, localize in less than one nanosecond. Real-space simulations show that this localization is governed by strong lateral variations in spin-texture lifetimes. Our results demonstrate that ultrafast phase-transition dynamics fundamentally differ from conventional transitions, yet still can be controlled through moderate nanometer-scale tailoring of the energy landscape.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Topological Systems and Their Sub-Symmetry-Protected Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry and topology are essential principles in topological physics. Recently, the idea of sub-symmetry-protected topology -- where some of the original symmetries are broken while a remaining subset, called sub-symmetries, continues to protect specific boundary states -- has been developed. Here, we extend sub-symmetry-protected topology to higher-order topological systems from second-order topological insulators to semimetals. By introducing a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation that acts on a single sublattice and selectively preserves specific topological boundary states, we track the evolution of these states and their topological features using numerical and analytical methods, and we show that state-resolved quadrupole moments diagnose which corner or hinge modes remain topological. As a representative example of a second-order topological insulator, we begin with the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model. We demonstrate that, under a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation, sub-symmetry-protected corner states remain pinned at zero energy and maintain quantized state-resolved quadrupole moments. In contrast, corner states on sub-symmetry-broken boundaries shift away from zero energy and lose their quantized character. We further extend this framework to a three-dimensional second-order topological semimetal, constructed by stacking second-order topological insulator layers, and analyze how second-order Fermi arc states -- hinge-localized modes that link the projections of bulk Dirac points, in contrast to conventional surface Fermi arcs -- evolve under a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation. While one second-order Fermi arc becomes dispersive and loses its quadrupolar character under a sub-symmetry-breaking perturbation, the remaining second-order Fermi arcs retain chiral symmetry and preserve quantized quadrupolar characters.</description>

      <title>MOF-derived Fe-doped $\delta$-MnO$_2$ nanoflowers as oxidase mimics: Chromogenic sensing of Hg$^{2+}$ and hydroquinone in aqueous media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure and morphology play a crucial role in enhancing the biomimetic oxidase activity of nanozymes. In this study, a facile \emph{in situ} chemical oxidation strategy was employed to synthesize MOF-derived MnO$_x$, utilizing the structural features of the parent MOF to enhance oxidase-mimicking activity. We systematically investigated the effects of phase evolution, structural modulation, and morphology on the oxidase activity of MnO$_x$ with Fe substitution. The oxidase-like activity was evaluated using the chromogenic substrate 3,3$'$,5,5$'$-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), which produced a blue-colored oxidized TMB (ox-TMB) with an absorption peak at 652~nm upon oxidation. While all Fe-doped MnO$_x$ nanostructures exhibited oxidase-like activity, the 10\% Fe-doped sample (10Fe-MnO$_x$) demonstrated the highest performance, likely due to a synergistic effect of structure, morphology, and the presence of oxygen vacancies. The underlying oxidase mechanism was investigated using steady-state kinetics and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis. In addition, a colorimetric assay was developed for the detection of Hg$^{2+}$ and hydroquinone (HQ) in real water samples collected from industrial and natural sources. The calculated detection limits of the 10Fe-MnO$_x$ colorimetric probe for HQ (1.74~$\mu$M) and Hg$^{2+}$ (0.47~$\mu$M) outperformed those of conventional metal oxide-based nanozymes. These findings pave the way for the development of easily synthesizable, scalable, and highly sensitive oxidase-based MOF-derived metal oxide nanomaterials with significant potential in biological and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>Effective Mass in Dissipative Coupled Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative coupling refers to the effect where two systems interact with each other mediated by dissipation channels. Recent advances in controlling light-matter systems have opened new avenues to explore non-Hermitian effects arising from dissipative coupling, such as level attraction and anomalous dispersions. In this work, we perform a parametric study of these effects in a polariton system, i.e., a light-matter superposition, under both dissipative and coherent coupling. We characterize the effects of different sources of non-Hermitian behavior and analytically identify the conditions for the emergence of negative effective mass, exceptional points, and bound states in the continuum as a function of the light-matter detuning, the coherent-to-dissipative coupling ratio, and the relative decay rate of the non-interacting subsystems. We also analyze the classical limit of the polariton system within a non-Hermitian framework, employing coherent states.</description>

      <title>Stability of (Active) Bilayer Skyrmions in Synthetic Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) skyrmions are nanoscale composite textures that exhibit high-speed, Hall-free current-driven motion and recently demonstrated self-propulsion. These remarkable properties rely on the stability of the SAF skyrmion's topological bound state, whose underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using an atomistic spin model, we analyze the collapse pathways of bilayer SAF skyrmions in homochiral systems, where both ferromagnetic layers share the same Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) vectors, and in heterochiral systems, where the DMI vectors have opposite directions. We find that pair destruction occurs either by decoupling or by sequential collapse into the homogeneous antiferromagnetic state, so the activation energy is set by the smaller of these two barriers. By examining how these barriers vary with DMI strength, anisotropy, magnetic field, and interlayer exchange, we identify regimes of enhanced stability. In particular, increasing interlayer coupling strengthens homochiral skyrmions but weakens heterochiral ones, while reducing the anisotropy constant effectively stabilizes heterochiral SAF skyrmions. These results outline viable strategies to optimize SAF heterostructures for enhanced skyrmion stability in racetrack devices and emerging active skyrmionic systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of exciton polarons in 2D Wigner crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a platform for realizing Wigner crystals and enable their detection via exciton spectroscopy. We develop a microscopic theoretical model for excitons interacting with the localized electrons of the Wigner crystal, including their vibrational motion. In addition to the previously observed exciton-Umklapp feature, the theory reproduces and explains the higher-band attractive-polaron resonances recently reported experimentally. Our model further uncovers that the appearance of two equal-strength and parallel attractive polarons, as commonly observed in WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$, is a signature of strong correlations in the electronic system. Altogether, our results demonstrate that accounting for electronic interactions is essential to reproduce and interpret the exciton-polaron spectra of TMDs.</description>

      <title>A Three-Dimensional Dodecaphenylyne-Derived Carbon Allotrope with Anisotropic and Auxetic-Like Mechanical Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce 3D-DPhyne, a novel three-dimensional (3D) carbon allotrope derived from the dodecaphenylyne framework, and investigate its structural, electronic, optical, and mechanical properties using first-principles calculations. The proposed structure forms a tetragonal, topologically complex network of four-, six-, and twelve-membered carbon rings with mixed sp/sp^2 hybridization and a formation energy of -7.87 eV/atom, comparable to other stable carbon allotropes. Phonon dispersion calculations show no imaginary modes, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at 1000~K confirm robust thermal stability without bond breaking. Electronic structure analysis reveals metallic character, with multiple bands crossing the Fermi level and dominant contributions from carbon p orbitals, consistent with a fully delocalized 3D $\pi$-conjugated network. The optical response is anisotropic, exhibiting strong absorption in the visible and ultraviolet regions and low reflectivity across a broad range of photon energies. Mechanical analysis reveals pronounced elastic anisotropy, with Young's modulus varying from approximately 40 to 490 GPa depending on direction. Poisson's ratio displays unconventional directional behavior, including auxetic-like responses.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Nernst effect in amorphous Tb-Fe-Co thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive study on the compositional dependence of the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) in amorphous (amo.) Tb-Fe-Co thin films. The anomalous Nernst coefficient strongly depends not only on the Tb composition but also on the transition metal composition, reaching a maximum of 1.8 uV/K for amo. Tb11.0(Fe50.0Co50.0) 89.0. By evaluating the electrical and thermoelectric properties, it was clarified that this maximum is achieved by the superposition of two large contributions: S_1 arising from direct transverse electron conduction due to a temperature gradient, and S_2 resulting from the combined Seebeck and anomalous Hall effects. We discovered that the anomalous Nernst conductivity, which is attributed to Berry curvature, varied significantly with the transition metal, even in an amorphous material lacking long-range crystalline order. Our research indicates that it is possible to control the electronic states that influence thermoelectric properties, even in the amorphous state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient transfer of quantum states into a long-lived storage unit such as solid-state spin ensembles is widely recognized as a critical challenge with significant implications for quantum communication, sensing and computing applications. Here, we experimentally investigate the interaction of propagating squeezed microwaves with an electron spin resonance transition in order to evaluate the use of spin ensembles as quantum memories for GHz signals. We generate continuous variable microwave states with a squeezing of up to 5dB below the vacuum level and let this signal interrogate a spin ensemble, which is inductively coupled to a lumped element superconducting microwave resonator with a cooperativity of C=0.3. Analyzing this signal using Wigner tomography, we observe a transfer efficiency of around 61% between the squeezed microwaves and the spin excitation. We successfully model our experimental results with a dedicated steady-state model based on the quantum input-output formalism and provide guidance for design parameters required to enable spin-based quantum memories.</description>

      <title>Refrigeration of a 1D gas of microwave photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a conceptually simple scheme for cooling a one dimensional gas of microwave photons in a superconducting transmission line. By shunting one end of the transmission line by a nonlinear Josephson element, we show how a cooling mechanism can be engineered that transfers photons from high- into low-frequency modes, while preserving their total number. We evaluate the resulting nonequilibrium steady state of the photon gas, which arises from a competition between this engineered cooling process and the natural, number non-conserving thermalization with the surrounding bath. Our analysis predicts that for realistic experimental parameters, this mechanism can be used to prepare photonic gases at sub-millikelvin temperatures, considerably below the typical base temperature of a dilution refrigerator. In addition, the system exhibits a new type of condensation transition that does not occur in the corresponding equilibrium scenario. As an outlook, we discuss potential applications of this cooling approach for quantum simulation schemes with interacting microwave photons.</description>

      <title>Enhanced and directional light emission from two-dimensional excitons using Mie voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling light emission at the nanoscale has important applications in solid-state lighting, displays, and quantum light sources. Achieving this control requires both enhanced local electromagnetic fields to boost emission intensity and engineered radiation patterns to direct photons efficiently. Mie voids, consisting of an air cavity surrounded by a high-index semiconductor, are particularly suited for this purpose because they expose their strongest fields in an accessible region for nearby emitters while supporting resonances that shape directional emission through interference. Here, we demonstrate an all-van der Waals nanophotonic platform that couples excitons in atomically thin WS$_2$ to Mie void resonators formed in WSe$_2$. Guided by electromagnetic simulations, we identify void geometries that maximize photoluminescence through synergistic enhancement of excitation and emission processes. We also develop a two-step fabrication strategy that enables independent control of void diameter and depth, providing a route to systematically tune the optical response. Experimentally, we observe up to a 600-fold increase in photoluminescence intensity from monolayer WS$_2$ placed on individual voids compared to on an unstructured WSe$_2$, along with pronounced out-of-plane beaming of light that yields a forward-to-off-axis enhancement of 2.6 dB. Our results establish Mie voids in van der Waals semiconductors as a new platform for controlling light-matter interactions and realizing compact, directional, and efficient nanoscale light sources.</description>

      <title>Charge fluctuations and topological phases in Kitaev-Heisenberg ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of topological phases in doped Kitaev-Heisenberg ladders by studying the competition with itinerant electrons and the associated charge fluctuations in a Hubbard model on a honeycomb ribbon geometry. We analyze the evolution of string order parameters, spin correlations, and charge fluctuations as functions of hopping amplitude and interaction strength in a half-filled band. Our results from density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations show that increasing electron bandwidth progressively suppresses the topological phases, shifting and narrowing their stability regions in the phase diagram. We identify the critical values of hopping where string order vanishes and characterize the interplay between magnetic order and charge fluctuations. These findings provide insight into the robustness of topological phases against doping and charge dynamics, with implications for candidate Kitaev materials and engineered quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic-enhanced Raman scattering in van der Waals MoOCl2: from Fano resonances to picomolar detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural van der Waals (vdW) crystals with hyperbolic dispersion challenge artificial metamaterials but remain confined to the mid-infrared spectrum. The emergence of MoOCl2, a quasi-one-dimensional metal with in-plane hyperbolicity, overcomes this spectral limit, shifting the focus to the practical visible range. Here, utilizing angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy, we uncover a highly anisotropic vibrational response characterized by pronounced Fano resonances and polarization switching, which serve as signatures of strong coupling between phonons and the metallic continuum. Harnessing this interaction, we demonstrate "Hyperbolic-Enhanced Raman" (HypER) scattering, where MoOCl2 provides polarization-tunable enhancement factors exceeding 10^7 and picomolar-level detection down to 100 pM, without any nanostructuring. These results establish MoOCl2 as a simple, air-stable, wafer-compatible platform for visible-range hyperbolic nanophotonics and lithography-free sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A precise detection of palladium (Pd) ions is a critical challenge with significant socio-economic implications across various industrial and chemical sectors. Due to its widespread use and poor biodegradability, Pd2+ accumulates in environmental ecosystems, posing severe risks to both the environment and living organisms. Consequently, there is a strong demand for selective, sensitive, and user-friendly detection methods. Among emerging strategies, optical detection techniques (both luminescent and colorimetric) using metal-based receptors have gained considerable attention. These sensors offer distinct advantages over traditional organic probes, including large Stokes shifts, long emission lifetimes, exceptional photostability, enhanced water solubility, recyclability, and remarkable chemical versatility. These attributes make them highly suitable for diverse applications in sensing and bioanalytical fields. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in luminescent and colorimetric metal-based probes, including metal complexes and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), for the selective detection of Pd2+. It discusses key design strategies, critical performance factors, and future prospects, offering valuable insights for researchers working on next-generation sensing platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard mean-field treatment of low-temperature superconductors leads to a square-root divergent density of states at the gap value. This feature can lead to unphysical logarithmic divergences in various quantities, such as currents and qubit transition rates. We revisit their possible regularization based on the proximity effect between two superconducting films with different gaps. We derive analytical approximations for the density of states in each superconducting film. We find that the smearing of the density of states grows with the gap asymmetry. As a concrete example, we discuss the regularization of transition rates in qubits with frequency close to resonance with the gap asymmetry between the two films, and the consequent smoothening of the jump discontinuity in the qubit frequency shift.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ge/SiGe heterostructures represent a promising platform for hosting various quantum devices such as hole spin qubits and Andreev spin qubits. However, the compatibility of such heterostructures with high-quality-factor microwave superconducting cavities remains a challenge due to defects in the material stack. In this work, we present an approach to enhance the coherence of cavity modes on a reverse-graded Ge/SiGe heterostructure, which consists of etching the full $\sim 1.6~\mathrm{\mu m}$-thick Ge/SiGe stack down to its starting high-resistivity Si substrate, in order to pattern superconducting cavities directly on it. We engineer the mesa step to be tapered, so that it can be easily climbed by the superconducting cavities to reach the quantum devices potentially hosted in the Ge quantum well. Using this approach, we observe internal quality factors of $Q_\mathrm{i} \approx 10000-20000$ for high-impedance frequency-tunable Josephson junction array resonators, limited by the junctions' fabrication, and $Q_\mathrm{i} \approx 100000$ for $50~\mathrm{\Omega}$ coplanar waveguide Nb lift-off resonators. These $Q_\mathrm{i}$ are preserved despite the overlap with the mesa structure in the climbing region, and are comparable to the ones obtained for identical resonators fabricated on a high-resistivity Si wafer reference. Thereby, this work paves a practical path toward superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices, immediately applicable to emerging technologies on planar Ge.</description>

Abstract: Shot noise at a conductance plateau in a quantum point contact (QPC) can be explained by considering equilibrations at the quantum Hall edges. The indication from recent experiments is that the charge equilibration length is much shorter than the thermal equilibration length. We discuss how this discovery gives rise to different thermal equilibration regimes in the presence of full charge equilibration. In this work, we classify these distinct regimes via dc current-current correlations (electrical shot noise) at definite experimentally found (or possible) QPC conductance plateaus for the edges of integer, particle-like, and hole-like filling fractions in a two dimensional electron gas. Our analyses show that distinct universal features arise among the different thermal equilibration regimes for the edges of particle-like and hole-like states.</description>

Abstract: The electronic properties of solids are determined by the crystal structure and interactions between electrons, giving rise to a variety of collective phenomena including superconductivity, strange metals and correlated insulators. The mechanisms underpinning many of these collective phenomena remain unknown, driving interest in creating artificial crystals which replicate the system of interest while allowing precise control of key parameters. Here we demonstrate the formation of highly tunable artificial crystals by superimposing a periodic electrostatic potential on the 2D electron gas in an ultra-shallow (25 nm deep) GaAs quantum well. The 100 nm period artificial crystal is identified by the formation of a new bandstructure, different from the original cubic crystal and specific to the artificial triangular lattice: transport measurements show the Hall coefficient changing sign as the chemical potential sweeps through the artificial bands. Uniquely, the artificial bandstructure can be continuously tuned to form linear graphene-like and flat kagome-like bands in a single device. A strong insulating state is observed at half filling of the kagome flat band, which is not expected in the absence of strong interactions. This state, unique to the kagome lattice, is consistent with a loop-current Wigner insulator, which arises from long-range Coulomb interaction and delocalised electrons between neighbouring empty sites. The ability to continuously tune the bandstructure and access flat bands through electrical gating within a single device opens a new route to studying collective quantum states.</description>

      <title>Emergent topological re-entrant phase transition in a generalized quasiperiodic modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of the one-dimensional generalized quasiperiodic modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The results reveal that topological re-entrant phase transition emerges. Through the analysis of a real-space winding number , we divide the emergent topological re-entrant phase transitions into two types. The first is the re-entrant phase transition from the traditional topological insulator phase into the topological Anderson insulator phase, and the second is the re-entrant phenomenon from one topological Anderson insulator phase into another topological Anderson insulator phase. These two types of re-entrant phase transition correspond to bounded and unbounded cases of quasiperiodic modulation, respectively. Furthermore, we verify the above topological re-entrant phase transitions by analyzing the Lyapunov exponent and bulk gap. Since Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models have been realized in various artificial systems (such as cold atoms, optical waveguide arrays, ion traps, Rydberg atom arrays, etc.), the two types of topological re-entrant phase transition predicted in this paper are expected to be realized in the near future.</description>

      <title>Magnon Thermal Hall Effect Induced By Symmetric Exchange Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By analyzing the spin-group symmetry of magnons, we establish two generalized Onsager's relations in the magnon thermal Hall effect, which reveals the rich and complicated structures of the magnon Berry curvature in the parameter space of different types of the exchange coupling. As an important consequence, we find that the diagonal and off-diagonal part of the symmetric anisotropic exchange coupling together can support the planar magnon thermal Hall effect without the DM interaction. This removes the local inversion-symmetry-breaking condition for generating the magnon thermal Hall effect. Moreover, we predict an exotic phenomenon that the thermal conductivity exhibits angular dependence with respect to the in-plane magnetization. Our work lays the ground for decoding the coupling between magnon transport and different types of exchange interactions.</description>

Abstract: Phonons are essential quasi-particles of all crystals and play a key role in fundamental properties such as thermal transport and superconductivity. In particular, acoustic phonons can be interpreted as Goldstone modes that emerge due to the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry. In this article, we investigate the quantum geometric contribution to the phonon spectrum in the absence of Holstein phonons. Using graphene as a case study, we decompose the dynamical matrix into distinct terms that exhibit different dependencies on the electron energy and wavefunction. We then examine the role of quantum geometry in shaping the material's phonon spectrum, and we find that removing the nontrivial quantum geometric contribution from the dynamical matrix causes the acoustic phonon modes to behave in a non-analytic fashion.</description>

      <title>Impact of the honeycomb spin-lattice on topological magnons and edge states in ferromagnetic 2D skyrmion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnons have been intensively studied in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion crystals (SkXs) stabilized on Bravais lattices, particularly triangular and square lattices, where the first magnon gaps are topologically trivial and do not support topological edge states (TESs). In this context, antiferromagnetic (AFM) SkXs on the triangular spin lattice have been considered potentially more interesting for applications, since TESs emerge in the first magnon gap. Meanwhile, the magnon topology of SkXs on non-Bravais spin lattices remains largely unexplored. In this work, we theoretically investigate the magnon band structure and TESs in 2D FM SkXs stabilized on the honeycomb spin lattice, including experimentally motivated parameter sets relevant to van der Waals magnets. We show that TESs emerge in the first magnon gap over significant ranges of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and single-ion magnetic anisotropy. Field-induced topological phase transitions modify the number of these TESs before eventually trivializing them, thereby enabling controlled switching of magnonic edge transport. These findings highlight the role of lattice geometry in shaping the magnon topology of noncollinear spin textures.</description>

      <title>"Aftereffects'' phenomenon in $^{111}$In($\rightarrow$$^{111}$Cd)-implanted $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals: Novel approach integrating experimental double-model analysis with density-functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03460v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an experimental double-model analysis, combined with density-functional theory (DFT), to investigate the origin of dynamic hyperfine interactions (HFIs) associated with the electron-capture (EC) decay ``aftereffects'' (ECAE) phenomenon. This electronic phenomenon, which is reversible with temperature, is typically observed in TDPAC experiments on oxides doped with ($^{111}$In (EC) $\rightarrow$)$^{111}$Cd probe atoms and was recently explained within an \emph{ab initio} framework based on fluctuations in the number of trapped electron holes at ^{111}$Cd [Phys. Rev. B $\bf{105}$, 195201 (2022)]. From now on, it is possible to determine, for each measured temperature and observed HFI, the set of \emph{initial} electronic configurations around the probe nucleus and their associated EFGs, whose fluctuations produce these dynamic HFIs, rather than simply identifying the configuration that generates the stable final EFG when the dynamic process ends. We demonstrate the equivalence between the two most used methods for analyzing this type of dynamic HFIs, proposed by B\"averstam \emph{et al.} (BO approach) and Lupascu \emph{et al.} (L approach), successfully connecting the relaxation constant $\lambda$$_r$ (the damping strength of the TDPAC spectra) in the BO approach with the distribution's half-width $\delta$$_i$ of the initial fluctuating EFGs in the L approach. To address this, we perform a comprehensive DFT study of Cd-doped $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ semiconductor and a detailed \emph{ab initio} analysis of defect-formation energies, both as a function of the Cd impurity's charge state, to unravel controversial TDPAC results reported for ^{111}$In-implanted $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals, now revisited. These results quantitatively confirm the physical scenario underlying both the BO and L approaches, and this new method can also be applied to other TDPAC probes without EC.</description>

      <title>Reinterpreting Landauer conductance, solving the quantum measurement problem, grand unification</title>

Abstract: In a series of recent papers we have proved rigorously that time travel is a reality and very much feasible by using quantum mechanical processes. There are plenty of indirect experimental support untill a direct experiment is conducted. The process crucially depend on the reality of a local time as well as a local partial density of states (LPDOS) that can become negative very easily in the quantum regime of mesoscopic systems. Mesoscopic systems are small enough to allow us to experimentally access the intermediate regime between the classical and quantum worlds. This LPDOS is in every sense a hidden variable in quantum mechanics that does not show up in the axiomatic framework of quantum mechanics. It can be inferred through physical clocks obeying quantum dynamics and can be rigorously justified from the properties of the Hilbert space that is uniquely isomorphic to the complex plane. Therefore one can naturally guess that LPDOS will have something important to say about quantum measurement as well as the unification of classical and quantum laws. We therefore undertake the exercise to show that LPDOS can very much allow us to re-interpret the enormously successful phenomenological Landauer-Buttiker formalism for mesoscopic systems and put it on firm theoretical ground as a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics, thereby unifying them. Essentially the local time calculated quantum mechanically can dilate exactly like the proper time of relativity and be consistent with the coordinate time of relativity. Also the measured conductance of mesoscopic samples is a deterministic quantum measurement outcome from a linear superposition of states, essentially because of LPDOS, which solves the quantum measurement problem. For this we analyze the three probe conductance formula in details and give our arguments for the general case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reproducibility and quantization in quantum spin Hall platforms is a persisting challenge, limiting their use in hybrid realizations of topological superconductivity. We report robust and reproducible quantized transport in a graphene quantum Hall topological insulator, stabilized at low magnetic fields by screening long-range Coulomb interactions with a metallic Bi$_2$Se$_3$ back gate. Beyond quantized resistance plateaus, we demonstrate mode-resolved control via gate-defined chiral-helical junctions that selectively transmit or backscatter a single helical channel, a capability inaccessible in time-reversal symmetric quantum spin Hall systems. Targeted experiments and simulations identify contact-induced doping, effectively creating unintended chiral-helical interfaces, as a generic mechanism for quantization breakdown, which is mitigated by large area contacts that enhance edge-channel equilibration. Our findings establish metal screened graphene as a gate-tunable, interaction-driven helical system with quantized transport, spatially separable helical channels, and compatibility with superconducting proximity for topological devices.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Bistability in Coupled Nonlinear Cavity Magnonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09245v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a coupled nonlinear cavity-magnon system, consisting of two cavities, a second-order nonlinear element, and a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere that supports Kerr magnons, to realize the sought-after highly tunable nonreciprocity. We first derive the critical condition for switching between reciprocity and nonreciprocity in the absence of magnon driving, and then numerically demonstrate that strong magnonic nonreciprocity can be achieved by violating this critical condition. When magnons are driven, we show that strong magnonic nonreciprocity can also be attained even within the critical condition. Compared to previous studies, the introduced nonlinear element not only relaxes the critical condition in both the weak and strong coupling regimes, but also offers an alternative means to tune magnonic nonreciprocity. Our work provides a promising avenue for realizing highly tunable nonreciprocal devices based on Kerr magnons.</description>

      <title>From Chiral Topological Dynamics to Chiral Topological Amplification: Real vs Imaginary Parameters in a Hermitian Bosonic Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Hermitian quadratic bosonic model (QBH) whose dynamical matrix exhibits distinct topological and dynamical phenomena depending on whether the hopping and pairing amplitudes are real or purely imaginary. In the real-parameter regime, the dynamical matrix is unitarily equivalent to four decoupled copies of the sublattice-symmetric non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (nSSH2) model, thereby inheriting its topological phases and energy spectrum-including the M\"obius phase, a gapless topological phase with fractional winding number, having no Hermitian counterpart. We show that the dynamics generated by the QBH Hamiltonian naturally reproduce non-Hermitian time evolution, without invoking nonlinear Schr\"odinger dynamics or ad hoc normalization. It is demonstrated by analytically calculating the Loschmidt amplitude and computing the dynamical topological order parameter under periodic boundary conditions, which displays a distinct chiral response in the M\"obius phase. In contrast, when the hopping and pairing terms are taken to be purely imaginary, the dynamical matrix becomes unitarily equivalent to a different version of the sublattice-symmetric non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (nSSH1) model that supports only two topological phases: trivial and non-trivial, and the M\"obius phase disappears. The latter system exhibits sublattice-dependent chiral amplification under open boundary conditions. We show that this amplification arises from the non-trivial topology of the dynamical matrix, establishing a clear link between topological phase and amplification behavior in the imaginary-parameter regime.</description>

Abstract: We study interference effects in the dynamics of a spin $1/2$ particle propagating in two dimensions in a disordered potential and subject to a generalized spin-orbit coupling. With the particle initially in a spin-polarized plane wave state, in the short-time regime, before the spin and momentum distributions reach their steady states, we observe a transient backscattering peak offset from the exact backscattering direction, coexisting with a coherent backscattering dip. We present an intuitive explanation of this momentum offset using a non-Abelian gauge transformation. We also describe the full time evolution of the transient peak, from its buildup to its decay with a precise prediction of the dephasing time within a perturbative framework for multiple scattering. Our results can be applied to general spatially uniform SU(2) gauge fields, including the synthetic gauge field in ultracold atoms.</description>
