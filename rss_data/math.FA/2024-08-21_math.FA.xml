      <title>Concerning semirings of measurable functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a measurable space $(X,\mathcal{A})$, let $\mathcal{M}^+(X,\mathcal{A})$ be the commutative semiring of non-negative real-valued measurable functions with pointwise addition and pointwise multiplication. We show that there is a lattice isomorphism between the ideal lattice of $\mathcal{M}^+(X,\mathcal{A})$ and the ideal lattice of its ring of differences $\mathcal{M}(X,\mathcal{A})$.
  Moreover, we infer that each ideal of $\mathcal{M}^+(X,\mathcal{A})$ is a semiring $z$-ideal.
  We investigate the duality between cancellative congruences on $\mathcal{M}^{+}(X,\mathcal{A})$ and $Z_{\mathcal{A}}$-filters on $X$. We observe that for $\sigma$-algebras, compactness and pseudocompactness coincide, and we provide a new characterization for compact measurable spaces via algebraic properties of $\mathcal{M}^+(X,\mathcal{A})$. It is shown that the space of (real) maximal congruences on $\mathcal{M}^+(X,\mathcal{A})$ is homeomorphic to the space of (real) maximal ideals of the $\mathcal{M}(X,\mathcal{A})$. We solve the isomorphism problem for the semirings of the form $\mathcal{M}^+(X,\mathcal{A})$ for compact and realcompact measurable spaces.</description>

      <title>Characterization of BMO spaces via commutators of fractional maximal function on Lorentz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $0 \leq \alpha&lt;n$ and $b$ be the locally integrable function. In this paper, we consider the maximal commutator of fractional maximal function $M_{b,\alpha}$ and the nonlinear commutator of fractional maximal function $[b, M_{\alpha}]$ on Lorentz spaces. We give some necessary and sufficient conditions for the boundedness of the commutators $M_{b,\alpha}$ and $[b, M_{\alpha}]$ on Lorentz spaces when the function $b$ belongs to BMO spaces, by which some new characterizations of certain subclasses of BMO spaces are obtained.</description>

      <title>Gaussian processes in Non-commutative probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by questions in quantum theory, we study Hilbert space valued Gaussian processes, and operator-valued kernels, i.e., kernels taking values in B(H) (= all bounded linear operators in a fixed Hilbert space H). We begin with a systematic study of p.d. B(H)-valued kernels and the associated of H-valued Gaussian processes, together with their correlation and transfer operators. In our consideration of B(H)-valued kernels, we drop the p.d. assumption. We show that input-output models can be computed for systems of signed kernels taking the precise form of realizability via associated transfer block matrices (of operators analogous to the realization transforms in systems theory), i.e., represented via 2\times2 operator valued block matrices. In the context of B(H)-valued kernels we present new results on regression with H-valued Gaussian processes.</description>

      <title>Variational and numerical aspects of a system of ODEs with concave-convex nonlinerities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we discuss a Hamiltonian system of ordinary differential equations under Dirichlet boundary conditions. The system of equations in consideration features a mixed (concave-convex) power nonlinearity depending on a positive parameter $\lambda$. We show multiplicity of nonnegative solutions of the system for a certain range of the parameter $\lambda$ and we also discuss regularity and symmetry of nonnegative solutions of the system. Besides, we present a numerical strategy aiming at the exploration of the optimal range of $\lambda$ for which multiplicity of solutions holds. The numerical experiments are based on the Poincar\'{e}-Miranda theorem and the shooting method, which have been lesser explored for systems of ODEs. Our work is motivated by the works of Ambrosetti et al., 1994 and Moreira dos Santos, 2009.</description>

      <title>Complex analysis of symmetric operators, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an upgraded version of von Neumann's famous theory on self-adjoint extensions of symmetric operators. As implied in the title, we have incorporated complex analysis (and complex geometry) into this theory in an essential way. The roles played by Hermtian symmetric spaces and modern value distribution theory in the theory are clarified. In doing so, many new concepts are introduced and many new results are obtained.</description>

      <title>Matrix convexity and unitary power dilations of Toeplitz-contractive operator tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using works of T.~Ando and L.~Gurvits, the well-known theorem of P.R.~Halmos concerning the existence of unitary dilations for contractive linear operators acting on Hilbert spaces recast as a result for $d$-tuples of contractive Hilbert space operators satisfying a certain matrix-positivity condition. Such operator $d$-tuples satisfying this matrix-positivity condition are called, herein, Toeplitz-contractive, and a characterisation of the Toeplitz-contractivity condition is presented. The matrix-positivity condition leads to definitions of new distance-measures in several variable operator theory, generalising the notions of norm, numerical radius, and spectral radius to $d$-tuples of operators (commuting, for the spectral radius) in what appears to be a novel, asymmetric way. Toeplitz contractive operators form a noncommutative convex set, and a scaling constant $c_d$ for inclusions of the minimal and maximal matrix convex sets determined by a stretching of the unit circle $S^1$ across $d$ complex dimensions is shown to exist.</description>

      <title>Spectral Function Space Learning and Numerical Linear Algebra Networks for Solving Linear Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider solving a probably ill-conditioned linear operator equation, where the operator is not modeled by physical laws but is specified via training pairs (consisting of images and data) of the input-output relation of the operator. We derive a stable method for computing the operator, which consists of first a Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization of images and a principal component analysis of the data. This two-step algorithm provides a spectral decomposition of the linear operator. Moreover, we show that both Gram-Schmidt and principal component analysis can be written as a deep neural network, which relates this procedure to de-and encoder networks. Therefore, we call the two-step algorithm a linear algebra network. Finally, we provide numerical simulations showing the strategy is feasible for reconstructing spectral functions and for solving operator equations without explicitly exploiting the physical model.</description>

      <title>ABP estimate on metric measure spaces via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using optimal transport theory, we establish a sharp Alexandroff--Bakelman--Pucci (ABP) type estimate on metric measure spaces with synthetic Riemannian Ricci curvature lower bounds, and prove some geometric and functional inequalities including a functional ABP estimate. Our result not only extends the border of ABP estimate, but also provides an effective substitution of Jacobi fields computation in the non-smooth framework, which has potential applications to many problems in non-smooth geometric analysis.</description>

      <title>Spaces of distributions with Sobolev wave front in a fixed conic set: compactness, pullback by smooth maps and the compensated compactness theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the space $\mathcal{D}'^r_L(M;E)$ of distributional sections of the smooth complex vector bundle $E\rightarrow M$ whose Sobolev wave front set of order $r\in\mathbb{R}$ lies in the closed conic subset $L$ of $T^*M\backslash0$. We introduce a locally convex topology on it to study the continuity of the pullback by smooth maps and generalise the result of H\"ormander about the pullback on the space of distributions with $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ wave front set in $L$. We employ an idea of G\'erard [18] to extend the Kolmogorov-Riesz compactness theorem to $\mathcal{D}'^r_L(M;E)$ and we characterise its relatively compact subsets. We study the continuity properties of pseudo-differential operators when acting on $\mathcal{D}'^r_L(M;E)$, $r\in\mathbb{R}$, and we generalise the Rellich's lemma. As an application of our results, we extend the microlocal defect measures of G\'erard and Tartar to sequences in $\mathcal{D}'^0_L(M;E)$ and we show a microlocal variant of the compensated compactness theorem.</description>

      <title>A convenient setting for infinite-dimensional analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a convenient framework for infinite-dimensional analysis (including both real and complex analysis in infinite dimensions), in which differentiation (in some weak sense) and integration operations can be easily performed, integration by parts can be conveniently established under rather weak conditions, and especially some nice properties and consequences obtained by convolution in Euclidean spaces can be extended to infinite-dimensional spaces in some sense by taking the limit. Compared to the existing tools in infinite-dimensional analysis, our setting enjoys more convenient and clearer links with that of finite dimensions, and hence it is more suitable for computation and studying some analysis problems in infinite-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>Sharp and rigid isoperimetric inequality in metric measure spaces with non-negative Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using optimal transport theory, we prove a sharp dimension-free isoperimetric inequality involving the volume entropy, in metric measure spaces with non-negative Ricci curvature in the sense of Lott--Sturm--Villani. We show that this isoperimetric inequality is attained by a non-trivial open set, if and only if the space satisfies a certain foliation property. For metric measure spaces with non-negative Riemannian Ricci curvature, we show that the sharp Cheeger constant is achieved by a non-trivial measurable set, if and only if a one-dimensional space is split off. Our isoperimetric inequality and the rigidity theorems are proved in non-smooth framework, but new even in the smooth setting. In particular, our results provide some new understanding of logarithmically concave measures.</description>
