      <title>When can we get away with using the two-way fixed effects regression?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of the two-way fixed effects regression in empirical social science was historically motivated by folk wisdom that it uncovers the Average Treatment effect on the Treated (ATT) as in the canonical two-period two-group case. This belief has come under scrutiny recently due to recent results in applied econometrics showing that it fails to uncover meaningful averages of heterogeneous treatment effects in the presence of effect heterogeneity over time and across adoption cohorts, and several heterogeneity-robust alternatives have been proposed. However, these estimators often have higher variance and are therefore under-powered for many applications, which poses a bias-variance tradeoff that is challenging for researchers to navigate. In this paper, we propose simple tests of linear restrictions that can be used to test for differences in dynamic treatment effects over cohorts, which allows us to test for when the two-way fixed effects regression is likely to yield biased estimates of the ATT. These tests are implemented as methods in the pyfixest python library.</description>

      <title>Matrix Time Series Modeling: A Hybrid Framework Combining Autoregression and Common Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix-valued time series analysis has gained prominence in econometrics and finance due to the increasing availability of high-dimensional data with inherent matrix structures. Traditional approaches, such as Matrix Autoregressive (MAR) models and Dynamic Matrix Factor (DMF) models, often impose restrictive assumptions that may not align with real-world data complexities. To address this gap, we propose a novel Matrix Autoregressive with Common Factors (MARCF) model, which bridges the gap between MAR and DMF frameworks by introducing common bases between predictor and response subspaces. The MARCF model achieves significant dimension reduction and enables a more flexible and interpretable factor representation of dynamic relationships. We develop a computationally efficient estimator and a gradient descent algorithm. Theoretical guarantees for computational and statistical convergence are provided, and extensive simulations demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the model. Applied to a multinational macroeconomic dataset, the MARCF model outperforms existing methods in forecasting and provides meaningful insights into the interplay between countries and economic factors.</description>

      <title>Tensor PCA for Factor Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern empirical analysis often relies on high-dimensional panel datasets with non-negligible cross-sectional and time-series correlations. Factor models are natural for capturing such dependencies. A tensor factor model describes the $d$-dimensional panel as a sum of a reduced rank component and an idiosyncratic noise, generalizing traditional factor models for two-dimensional panels. We consider a tensor factor model corresponding to the notion of a reduced multilinear rank of a tensor. We show that for a strong factor model, a simple tensor principal component analysis algorithm is optimal for estimating factors and loadings. When the factors are weak, the convergence rate of simple TPCA can be improved with alternating least-squares iterations. We also provide inferential results for factors and loadings and propose the first test to select the number of factors. The new tools are applied to the problem of imputing missing values in a multidimensional panel of firm characteristics.</description>

      <title>Empirical likelihood approach for high-dimensional moment restrictions with dependent data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Economic and financial models -- such as vector autoregressions, local projections, and multivariate volatility models -- feature complex dynamic interactions and spillovers across many time series. These models can be integrated into a unified framework, with high-dimensional parameters identified by moment conditions. As the number of parameters and moment conditions may surpass the sample size, we propose adding a double penalty to the empirical likelihood criterion to induce sparsity and facilitate dimension reduction. Notably, we utilize a marginal empirical likelihood approach despite temporal dependence in the data. Under regularity conditions, we provide asymptotic guarantees for our method, making it an attractive option for estimating large-scale multivariate time series models. We demonstrate the versatility of our procedure through extensive Monte Carlo simulations and three empirical applications, including analyses of US sectoral inflation rates, fiscal multipliers, and volatility spillover in China's banking sector.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference and A/B Testing in Fisher Markets and Paced Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of statistical inference and A/B testing for two market equilibrium models: linear Fisher market (LFM) equilibrium and first-price pacing equilibrium (FPPE). LFM arises from fair resource allocation systems such as allocation of food to food banks and notification opportunities to different types of notifications. For LFM, we assume that the data observed is captured by the classical finite-dimensional Fisher market equilibrium, and its steady-state behavior is modeled by a continuous limit Fisher market. The second type of equilibrium we study, FPPE, arises from internet advertising where advertisers are constrained by budgets and advertising opportunities are sold via first-price auctions. For platforms that use pacing-based methods to smooth out the spending of advertisers, FPPE provides a hindsight-optimal configuration of the pacing method. We propose a statistical framework for the FPPE model, in which a continuous limit FPPE models the steady-state behavior of the auction platform, and a finite FPPE provides the data to estimate primitives of the limit FPPE. Both LFM and FPPE have an Eisenberg-Gale convex program characterization, the pillar upon which we derive our statistical theory. We start by deriving basic convergence results for the finite market to the limit market. We then derive asymptotic distributions, and construct confidence intervals. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic local minimax optimality of estimation based on finite markets. We then show that the theory can be used for conducting statistically valid A/B testing on auction platforms. Synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments verify the validity and practicality of our theory.</description>

      <title>The Risk-Neutral Equivalent Pricing of Model-Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing approaches to asset-pricing under model-uncertainty adapt classical utility-maximisation frameworks and seek theoretical comprehensiveness. We move toward practice by considering binary model-uncertainties and by switching attention from 'preference' to 'constraints'. Economic asset-pricing in this setting is found to decompose into the viable pricing of model-risk and of non-model risk separately such that the former has a unique and intuitive risk-neutral equivalent formulation with convenient properties. Its parameter, a dynamically conserved constant of model-risk inference, allows an integrated representation of ex-ante risk-pricing and bias, such that their ex-post price-effects can be disentangled, through well-known price anomalies such as Moment and Low-Risk.</description>
