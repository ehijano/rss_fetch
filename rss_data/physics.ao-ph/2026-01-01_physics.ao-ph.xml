      <title>When the Earth and Sky Dance: Seismic Shakes Meet Weather Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new modelling approach shows how the Earth's hidden vibrations may drive global weather dynamics and atmospheric pressure variations, hinting that the planet's own beat could be imprinted on our climate. The atmospheric rotational patterns of the mean sea level pressure, in connection to the development of powerful storms, are shown to be caused by Earth's rotational elastic dynamics and earthquake-induced oscillations. These seismic excitations are discussed in relation to storm formation and the global atmospheric patterns of high-pressure regions.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale soil moisture heterogeneity can locally amplify humid heat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soil moisture is a key ingredient of humid heat through supplying moisture and modifying boundary layer properties. Soil moisture heterogeneity due to e.g., antecedent rainfall, can strongly influence weather patterns; yet, its effect on humid heat is poorly understood. Idealized numerical simulations are performed with a cloud-resolving ($\Delta x$=500 m), coupled land-atmosphere model wherein wet patches on length-scales $\lambda \in$ 25-150 km are prescribed. Compared to experiments with uniform soil moisture, humid heat is locally amplified by 1-4$^\circ$C, with maximum amplification for the critical soil moisture length-scale $\lambda_c=$ 50 km. Subsidence associated with a soil moisture-induced mesoscale circulation concentrates warm, humid air in a shallower boundary layer. The background wind and the magnitude of the wet-dry contrast control the relationship between $\lambda_c$ and the humid heat amplification. Based on observed soil moisture patterns, these results will help to predict extreme humid heat at city and county scales across the Tropics.</description>

      <title>Towards mechanistic understanding in a data-driven weather model: internal activations reveal interpretable physical features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large data-driven physics models like DeepMind's weather model GraphCast have empirically succeeded in parameterizing time operators for complex dynamical systems with an accuracy reaching or in some cases exceeding that of traditional physics-based solvers. Unfortunately, how these data-driven models perform computations is largely unknown and whether their internal representations are interpretable or physically consistent is an open question. Here, we adapt tools from interpretability research in Large Language Models to analyze intermediate computational layers in GraphCast, leveraging sparse autoencoders to discover interpretable features in the neuron space of the model. We uncover distinct features on a wide range of length and time scales that correspond to tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, diurnal and seasonal behavior, large-scale precipitation patterns, specific geographical coding, and sea-ice extent, among others. We further demonstrate how the precise abstraction of these features can be probed via interventions on the prediction steps of the model. As a case study, we sparsely modify a feature corresponding to tropical cyclones in GraphCast and observe interpretable and physically consistent modifications to evolving hurricanes. Such methods offer a window into the black-box behavior of data-driven physics models and are a step towards realizing their potential as trustworthy predictors and scientifically valuable tools for discovery.</description>

      <title>Rainfall forecasts in daily use over East Africa improved by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensemble forecasting has proven over the years to be a vital tool for predicting extreme or only partially predictable weather events. In particular life-threatening weather events. Many National Meteorological Services in East Africa do not have the computing resources to enable them to run their local area models in full ensemble mode over the full period of the 2 week medium range. As a result, weather users in these countries are not being given sufficient information about weather risk that is needed to make reliable decisions about taking preventative action. Consequently, society in many parts of the world is not as resilient to weather events as they could be. In this paper we test the performance of our forecast system, cGAN, which is the only high-resolution (10 km) ensemble rainfall product that does real-time, probabilistic correction of global forecasts for East Africa. Compared to existing state-of-the-art AI models, our system offers higher spatial resolution. It is cheap to train/run and requires no additional post-processing. It is run on laptops and can generate many thousands of ensemble members at little computational cost (compared with physical local area models). It is ideally suited to Meteorological Services with limited computational facilities.</description>

      <title>Latent Twins: A Framework for Scene Recognition and Fast Radiative Transfer Inversion in FORUM All-Sky Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FORUM (Far-infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring) mission will provide, for the first time, systematic far-infrared spectral measurements of Earth's outgoing radiation, enabling improved understanding of atmospheric processes and the radiation budget. Retrieving atmospheric states from these observations constitutes a high-dimensional, ill-posed inverse problem, particularly under cloudy-sky conditions where multiple-scattering effects are present. In this work, we develop a data-driven, physics-aware inversion framework for FORUM all-sky retrievals based on latent twins: coupled autoencoders for atmospheric states and spectra, combined with bidirectional latent-space mappings. A lightweight model-consistency correction ensures physically plausible cloud variable reconstructions. The resulting framework demonstrates potential for retrievals of atmospheric, cloud and surface variables, providing information that can serve as a prior, initial guess, or surrogate for computationally expensive full-physics inversion methods. It also enables robust scene classification and near-instantaneous inference, making it suitable for operational near-real-time applications. We demonstrate its performance on synthetic FORUM-like data and discuss implications for future data assimilation and climate studies.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic enhancement of particle collision rates in atmospheric flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisional growth of tiny particles is a fundamental process governing the growth of cloud droplets and the aggregation of ash particles in volcanic plumes, with direct implications for precipitation formation, cloud lifetime, and ash plume dynamics. The particles in these scenarios often carry electric charges. In this study, we investigate the collision dynamics of a pair of like charged dielectric spheres subjected to a uniaxial compressional flow, an important linear flow that captures key features of atmospheric straining motions. Finite particle size leads to electrostatic interactions that deviate from the point charge approximation, resulting in far field repulsion and near-field attraction, which in turn generate nontrivial particle trajectories and critical collision thresholds. For certain combinations of charge and size, the interplay between hydrodynamic and electrostatic forces creates strong radially inward particle relative velocities that substantially alter particle pair dynamics and modify the conditions required for contact. For uncharged particles, collision efficiency increases monotonically with particle size ratio. However, in the presence of electrostatic forces with high charge ratio values, the collision efficiency exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence, attaining a maximum at small size ratios and decreasing as the ratio increases, with a crossover beyond which larger particles become less favorable for collision. These results demonstrate that the same polarity charges on finite sized atmospheric particles do not necessarily inhibit collisions. Instead, they can enhance collisional growth for specific charge and size ratio combinations, revealing counterintuitive pathways relevant to cloud microphysical processes and volcanic ash aggregation in electrified atmospheric environments.</description>

      <title>AODDiff: Probabilistic Reconstruction of Aerosol Optical Depth via Diffusion-based Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality reconstruction of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) fields is critical for Atmosphere monitoring, yet current models remain constrained by the scarcity of complete training data and a lack of uncertainty quantification.To address these limitations, we propose AODDiff, a probabilistic reconstruction framework based on diffusion-based Bayesian inference. By leveraging the learned spatiotemporal probability distribution of the AOD field as a generative prior, this framework can be flexibly adapted to various reconstruction tasks without requiring task-specific retraining. We first introduce a corruption-aware training strategy to learns a spatiotemporal AOD prior solely from naturally incomplete data. Subsequently, we employ a decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy that enables the more effective and integration of heterogeneous observations as constraints to guide the generation process. We validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on Reanalysis data. Results across downscaling and inpainting tasks confirm the efficacy and robustness of AODDiff, specifically demonstrating its advantage in maintaining high spatial spectral fidelity. Furthermore, as a generative model, AODDiff inherently enables uncertainty quantification via multiple sampling, offering critical confidence metrics for downstream applications.</description>

      <title>The Effects of a Constructed Closure of the Bering Strait on AMOC Tipping Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a major tipping element in the present-day climate, and could potentially collapse under sufficient freshwater or CO2-forcing. While the effect of the Bering Strait on AMOC stability has been well studied, it is unknown whether a constructed closure of this Strait can prevent an AMOC collapse under climate change. Here, we show in an Earth system Model of Intermediate Complexity that an artificial closure of the Strait can extend the safe carbon budget of the AMOC, provided that the AMOC is strong enough at the closure time. Specifically, for this model, an equilibrium AMOC with a reduction below (6.1 +/- 0.5)% from pre-industrial has an additional budget up to 500PgC given a sufficiently early closure, while for a weaker AMOC a closure reduces this budget. This indicates that constructing this closure could be a feasible climate intervention strategy to prevent an AMOC collapse.</description>
