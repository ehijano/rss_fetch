      <title>On the application of Visibility Graphs in the Spectral Domain for Speaker Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the potential of visibility graphs in the spectral domain for speaker recognition. Adult participants were instructed to record vocalizations of the five Spanish vowels. For each vocalization, we computed the frequency spectrum considering the source-filter model of speech production, where formants are shaped by the vocal tract acting as a passive filter with resonant frequencies. Spectral profiles exhibited consistent intra-speaker characteristics, reflecting individual vocal tract anatomies, while showing variation between speakers. We then constructed visibility graphs from these spectral profiles and extracted various graph-theoretic metrics to capture their topological features. These metrics were assembled into feature vectors representing the five vowels for each speaker. Using an ensemble of decision trees trained on these features, we achieved high accuracy in speaker identification. Our analysis identified key topological features that were critical in distinguishing between speakers. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of visibility graphs for spectral analysis and their potential in speaker recognition. We also discuss the robustness of this approach, offering insights into its applicability for real-world speaker recognition systems. This research contributes to expanding the feature extraction toolbox for speaker recognition by leveraging the topological properties of speech signals in the spectral domain.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Black-box and Gray-box Modeling of Nonlinear Audio Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio effects are extensively used at every stage of audio and music content creation. The majority of differentiable audio effects modeling approaches fall into the black-box or gray-box paradigms; and most models have been proposed and applied to nonlinear effects like guitar amplifiers, overdrive, distortion, fuzz and compressor. Although a plethora of architectures have been introduced for the task at hand there is still lack of understanding on the state of the art, since most publications experiment with one type of nonlinear audio effect and a very small number of devices.
  In this work we aim to shed light on the audio effects modeling landscape by comparing black-box and gray-box architectures on a large number of nonlinear audio effects, identifying the most suitable for a wide range of devices. In the process, we also: introduce time-varying gray-box models and propose models for compressor, distortion and fuzz, publish a large dataset for audio effects research - ToneTwist AFx https://github.com/mcomunita/tonetwist-afx-dataset - that is also the first open to community contributions, evaluate models on a variety of metrics and conduct extensive subjective evaluation. Code https://github.com/mcomunita/nablafx and supplementary material https://github.com/mcomunita/nnlinafx-supp-material are also available.</description>

      <title>ATRI: Mitigating Multilingual Audio Text Retrieval Inconsistencies by Reducing Data Distribution Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual audio-text retrieval (ML-ATR) is a challenging task that aims to retrieve audio clips or multilingual texts from databases. However, existing ML-ATR schemes suffer from inconsistencies for instance similarity matching across languages. We theoretically analyze the inconsistency in terms of both multilingual modal alignment direction error and weight error, and propose the theoretical weight error upper bound for quantifying the inconsistency. Based on the analysis of the weight error upper bound, we find that the inconsistency problem stems from the data distribution error caused by random sampling of languages. We propose a consistent ML-ATR scheme using 1-to-k contrastive learning and audio-English co-anchor contrastive learning, aiming to mitigate the negative impact of data distribution error on recall and consistency in ML-ATR. Experimental results on the translated AudioCaps and Clotho datasets show that our scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance on recall and consistency metrics for eight mainstream languages, including English. Our code will be available at https://github.com/ATRI-ACL/ATRI-ACL.</description>

      <title>ChunkFormer: Masked Chunking Conformer For Long-Form Speech Transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying ASR models at an industrial scale poses significant challenges in hardware resource management, especially for long-form transcription tasks where audio may last for hours. Large Conformer models, despite their capabilities, are limited to processing only 15 minutes of audio on an 80GB GPU. Furthermore, variable input lengths worsen inefficiencies, as standard batching leads to excessive padding, increasing resource consumption and execution time. To address this, we introduce ChunkFormer, an efficient ASR model that uses chunk-wise processing with relative right context, enabling long audio transcriptions on low-memory GPUs. ChunkFormer handles up to 16 hours of audio on an 80GB GPU, 1.5x longer than the current state-of-the-art FastConformer, while also boosting long-form transcription performance with up to 7.7% absolute reduction on word error rate and maintaining accuracy on shorter tasks compared to Conformer. By eliminating the need for padding in standard batching, ChunkFormer's masked batching technique reduces execution time and memory usage by more than 3x in batch processing, substantially reducing costs for a wide range of ASR systems, particularly regarding GPU resources for models serving in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>SegAug: CTC-Aligned Segmented Augmentation For Robust RNN-Transducer Based Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RNN-Transducer (RNN-T) is a widely adopted architecture in speech recognition, integrating acoustic and language modeling in an end-to-end framework. However, the RNN-T predictor tends to over-rely on consecutive word dependencies in training data, leading to high deletion error rates, particularly with less common or out-of-domain phrases. Existing solutions, such as regularization and data augmentation, often compromise other aspects of performance. We propose SegAug, an alignment-based augmentation technique that generates contextually varied audio-text pairs with low sentence-level semantics. This method encourages the model to focus more on acoustic features while diversifying the learned textual patterns of its internal language model, thereby reducing deletion errors and enhancing overall performance. Evaluations on the LibriSpeech and Tedlium-v3 datasets demonstrate a relative WER reduction of up to 12.5% on small-scale and 6.9% on large-scale settings. Notably, most of the improvement stems from reduced deletion errors, with relative reductions of 45.4% and 18.5%, respectively. These results highlight SegAug's effectiveness in improving RNN-T's robustness, offering a promising solution for enhancing speech recognition performance across diverse and challenging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Pitch Imperfect: Detecting Audio Deepfakes Through Acoustic Prosodic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio deepfakes are increasingly in-differentiable from organic speech, often fooling both authentication systems and human listeners. While many techniques use low-level audio features or optimization black-box model training, focusing on the features that humans use to recognize speech will likely be a more long-term robust approach to detection. We explore the use of prosody, or the high-level linguistic features of human speech (e.g., pitch, intonation, jitter) as a more foundational means of detecting audio deepfakes. We develop a detector based on six classical prosodic features and demonstrate that our model performs as well as other baseline models used by the community to detect audio deepfakes with an accuracy of 93% and an EER of 24.7%. More importantly, we demonstrate the benefits of using a linguistic features-based approach over existing models by applying an adaptive adversary using an $L_{\infty}$ norm attack against the detectors and using attention mechanisms in our training for explainability. We show that we can explain the prosodic features that have highest impact on the model's decision (Jitter, Shimmer and Mean Fundamental Frequency) and that other models are extremely susceptible to simple $L_{\infty}$ norm attacks (99.3% relative degradation in accuracy). While overall performance may be similar, we illustrate the robustness and explainability benefits to a prosody feature approach to audio deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>WavRAG: Audio-Integrated Retrieval Augmented Generation for Spoken Dialogue Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained widespread adoption owing to its capacity to empower large language models (LLMs) to integrate external knowledge. However, existing RAG frameworks are primarily designed for text-based LLMs and rely on Automatic Speech Recognition to process speech input, which discards crucial audio information, risks transcription errors, and increases computational overhead. Therefore, we introduce WavRAG, the first retrieval augmented generation framework with native, end-to-end audio support. WavRAG offers two key features: 1) Bypassing ASR, WavRAG directly processes raw audio for both embedding and retrieval. 2) WavRAG integrates audio and text into a unified knowledge representation. Specifically, we propose the WavRetriever to facilitate the retrieval from a text-audio hybrid knowledge base, and further enhance the in-context capabilities of spoken dialogue models through the integration of chain-of-thought reasoning. In comparison to state-of-the-art ASR-Text RAG pipelines, WavRAG achieves comparable retrieval performance while delivering a 10x acceleration. Furthermore, WavRAG's unique text-audio hybrid retrieval capability extends the boundaries of RAG to the audio modality.</description>

      <title>NeRF-3DTalker: Neural Radiance Field with 3D Prior Aided Audio Disentanglement for Talking Head Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Talking head synthesis is to synthesize a lip-synchronized talking head video using audio. Recently, the capability of NeRF to enhance the realism and texture details of synthesized talking heads has attracted the attention of researchers. However, most current NeRF methods based on audio are exclusively concerned with the rendering of frontal faces. These methods are unable to generate clear talking heads in novel views. Another prevalent challenge in current 3D talking head synthesis is the difficulty in aligning acoustic and visual spaces, which often results in suboptimal lip-syncing of the generated talking heads. To address these issues, we propose Neural Radiance Field with 3D Prior Aided Audio Disentanglement for Talking Head Synthesis (NeRF-3DTalker). Specifically, the proposed method employs 3D prior information to synthesize clear talking heads with free views. Additionally, we propose a 3D Prior Aided Audio Disentanglement module, which is designed to disentangle the audio into two distinct categories: features related to 3D awarded speech movements and features related to speaking style. Moreover, to reposition the generated frames that are distant from the speaker's motion space in the real space, we have devised a local-global Standardized Space. This method normalizes the irregular positions in the generated frames from both global and local semantic perspectives. Through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, it has been demonstrated that our NeRF-3DTalker outperforms state-of-the-art in synthesizing realistic talking head videos, exhibiting superior image quality and lip synchronization.

      <title>Adaptive Convolution for CNN-based Speech Enhancement Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based speech enhancement methods have significantly improved speech quality and intelligibility. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proven to be essential components of many high-performance models. In this paper, we introduce adaptive convolution, an efficient and versatile convolutional module that enhances the model's capability to adaptively represent speech signals. Adaptive convolution performs frame-wise causal dynamic convolution, generating time-varying kernels for each frame by assembling multiple parallel candidate kernels. A Lightweight attention mechanism leverages both current and historical information to assign adaptive weights to each candidate kernel, guiding their aggregation. This enables the convolution operation to adapt to frame-level speech spectral features, leading to more efficient extraction and reconstruction. Experimental results on various CNN-based models demonstrate that adaptive convolution significantly improves the performance with negligible increases in computational complexity, especially for lightweight models. Furthermore, we propose the adaptive convolutional recurrent network (AdaptCRN), an ultra-lightweight model that incorporates adaptive convolution and an efficient encoder-decoder design, achieving superior performance compared to models with similar or even higher computational costs.</description>

      <title>Do Audio-Language Models Understand Linguistic Variations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary audio language models (ALMs), like Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining (CLAP), represent a promising new paradigm for audio-text retrieval using natural language queries. In this paper, for the first time, we perform controlled experiments on various benchmarks to show that existing ALMs struggle to generalize to linguistic variations in textual queries. To address this issue, we propose RobustCLAP, a novel and compute-efficient technique to learn audio-language representations agnostic to linguistic variations. Specifically, we reformulate the contrastive loss used in CLAP architectures by introducing a multi-view contrastive learning objective, where paraphrases are treated as different views of the same audio scene and use this for training. Our proposed approach improves the text-to-audio retrieval performance of CLAP by 0.8%-13% across benchmarks and enhances robustness to linguistic variation.</description>

      <title>MATS: An Audio Language Model under Text-only Supervision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs), built upon powerful Large Language Models (LLMs), have exhibited remarkable audio comprehension and reasoning capabilities. However, the training of LALMs demands a large corpus of audio-language pairs, which requires substantial costs in both data collection and training resources. In this paper, we propose MATS, an audio-language multimodal LLM designed to handle Multiple Audio task using solely Text-only Supervision. By leveraging pre-trained audio-language alignment models such as CLAP, we develop a text-only training strategy that projects the shared audio-language latent space into LLM latent space, endowing the LLM with audio comprehension capabilities without relying on audio data during training. To further bridge the modality gap between audio and language embeddings within CLAP, we propose the Strongly-related noisy text with audio (Santa) mechanism. Santa maps audio embeddings into CLAP language embedding space while preserving essential information from the audio input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MATS, despite being trained exclusively on text data, achieves competitive performance compared to recent LALMs trained on large-scale audio-language pairs.</description>

      <title>MT2KD: Towards A General-Purpose Encoder for Speech, Speaker, and Audio Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17010v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advances in deep learning, the performance of end-to-end (E2E) single-task models for speech and audio processing has been constantly improving. However, it is still challenging to build a general-purpose model with high performance on multiple tasks, since different speech and audio processing tasks usually require different training data, input features, or model architectures to achieve optimal performance. In this work, MT2KD, a novel two-stage multi-task learning framework is proposed to build a general-purpose speech and audio encoder that jointly performs three fundamental tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), audio tagging (AT) and speaker verification (SV). In the first stage, multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD) is applied to align the feature spaces of three single-task high-performance teacher encoders into a single student encoder using the same unlabelled data. In the second stage, multi-task supervised fine-tuning is carried out by initialising the model from the first stage and training on the separate labelled data of each single task. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-task training pipeline significantly outperforms a baseline model trained with multi-task learning from scratch. The final system achieves good performance on ASR, AT and SV: with less than 4% relative word-error-rate increase on ASR, only 1.9 lower mean averaged precision on AT and 0.23% absolute higher equal error rate on SV compared to the best-performing single-task encoders, using only a 66M total model parameters.</description>

      <title>Text2FX: Harnessing CLAP Embeddings for Text-Guided Audio Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces Text2FX, a method that leverages CLAP embeddings and differentiable digital signal processing to control audio effects, such as equalization and reverberation, using open-vocabulary natural language prompts (e.g., "make this sound in-your-face and bold"). Text2FX operates without retraining any models, relying instead on single-instance optimization within the existing embedding space, thus enabling a flexible, scalable approach to open-vocabulary sound transformations through interpretable and disentangled FX manipulation. We show that CLAP encodes valuable information for controlling audio effects and propose two optimization approaches using CLAP to map text to audio effect parameters. While we demonstrate with CLAP, this approach is applicable to any shared text-audio embedding space. Similarly, while we demonstrate with equalization and reverberation, any differentiable audio effect may be controlled. We conduct a listener study with diverse text prompts and source audio to evaluate the quality and alignment of these methods with human perception. Demos and code are available at anniejchu.github.io/text2fx.</description>

      <title>DMOSpeech: Direct Metric Optimization via Distilled Diffusion Model in Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated significant potential in speech synthesis tasks, including text-to-speech (TTS) and voice cloning. However, their iterative denoising processes are computationally intensive, and previous distillation attempts have shown consistent quality degradation. Moreover, existing TTS approaches are limited by non-differentiable components or iterative sampling that prevent true end-to-end optimization with perceptual metrics. We introduce DMOSpeech, a distilled diffusion-based TTS model that uniquely achieves both faster inference and superior performance compared to its teacher model. By enabling direct gradient pathways to all model components, we demonstrate the first successful end-to-end optimization of differentiable metrics in TTS, incorporating Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss and Speaker Verification (SV) loss. Our comprehensive experiments, validated through extensive human evaluation, show significant improvements in naturalness, intelligibility, and speaker similarity while reducing inference time by orders of magnitude. This work establishes a new framework for aligning speech synthesis with human auditory preferences through direct metric optimization.

Abstract: We present TalkPlay, a multimodal music recommendation system that reformulates the recommendation task as large language model token generation. TalkPlay represents music through an expanded token vocabulary that encodes multiple modalities - audio, lyrics, metadata, semantic tags, and playlist co-occurrence. Using these rich representations, the model learns to generate recommendations through next-token prediction on music recommendation conversations, that requires learning the associations natural language query and response, as well as music items. In other words, the formulation transforms music recommendation into a natural language understanding task, where the model's ability to predict conversation tokens directly optimizes query-item relevance. Our approach eliminates traditional recommendation-dialogue pipeline complexity, enabling end-to-end learning of query-aware music recommendations. In the experiment, TalkPlay is successfully trained and outperforms baseline methods in various aspects, demonstrating strong context understanding as a conversational music recommender.</description>
