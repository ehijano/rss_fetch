      <title>Generalized Gaussian Estimates and Local Limit Theorems for Discrete Convolution Powers of Complex Functions: The $d$-dimensional case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish generalized Gaussian bounds and local limit theorems with Gaussian-type error for the convolution powers of certain complex-valued functions on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. These global space-times estimates/error, which are sharp in certain cases, are written in terms of the Legendre-Fenchel transforms of positive-homogeneous polynomials and are mirrored by estimates satisfied by the heat kernels associated to a related class of partial differential operators. The results obtained here enjoy applications to the analysis and stability of numerical difference schemes to partial differential equations. This work extends several recent results, pertaining to one and several dimensions, of P. Diaconis, L. Saloff-Coste, J.-F. Coulombel, G. Faye, L. Coeuret, and the second author.</description>

      <title>Fibers of continuous functions that connect or separate some opposite faces of the unit cube, and a generalization of the Lebesgue Covering Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate and prove a dimension-theoretic generalization of the Lebesgue Covering Theorem. A generalized $n$-dimensional version of the Steinhaus Chessboard Theorem, recently proved by Turza\'nski and Ziajor, is a simple consequence of this result. Moreover, we study two types of sets associated with a continuous function $g \colon I^n \to \mathbb{R}$. Namely, the set of all points $p \in \mathbb{R}$ such that the fiber $g^{-1}[\left\{p\right\}]$ connects $i$th opposite faces of $I^n$, and the set of all points $p \in \mathbb{R}$ such that the fiber $g^{-1}[\left\{p\right\}]$ separates $i$th opposite faces of $I^n$. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a continuous function $g \colon I^n \to \mathbb{R}$ in terms of these sets.</description>

      <title>Kakeya conjecture and High-Rank Lattice von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If the non-commutative L p space of SLn(Z) has the completely bounded approximation property for some non-trivial value of p, then some form of the Kakeya conjecture holds in dimension d, for all d $\le$ n+1  2 . The proof relies on a spherical analogue of the following question in Euclidean harmonic analysis, that we raise and investigate: does a radially symmetric Fourier multiplier that is bounded on Lp(R d ) for some p __ = 2 necessarily have a continuous symbol? We leave the question open, but we prove that the primitive of such function is smooth in the sense of Zygmund, give some necessary conditions for Lp-boundedness in terms of Besov spaces and Littlewood-Paley decomposition for the symbol, and observe that a negative answer implies some form of the Kakeya conjecture in dimension d. We then provide spherical forms of these results, which, when combined with a refinement of Lafforgue's rank 0 reduction, leads to the claimed result.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of the Macdonald Hypergeometric Series ${}_r\Phi_s(x;q,t)$ and ${}_r\Phi_s(x,y;q,t)$ via $q$-Difference Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two widely circulated manuscripts from the 1980s, I. G. Macdonald introduced certain multivariate hypergeometric series ${}_pF_q(x;\alpha)$ and ${}_pF_q(x,y;\alpha)$ and their $q$-analogs ${}_r\Phi_s(x;q,t)$ and ${}_r\Phi_s(x,y;q,t)$. These series are given by explicit expansions in Jack and Macdonald polynomials, and they generalize the hypergeometric functions of one and two matrix arguments from statistics.
  In a recent joint paper with Siddhartha Sahi, we constructed differential operators that characterize the Jack series ${}_pF_q$ thereby answering a question of Macdonald. In this paper we construct analogous $q$-difference operators that characterize the Macdonald series ${}_r\Phi_s$.
  More precisely, we construct three $q$-difference operators $\mathcal A^{(x,y)}$, $\mathcal B^{(x)}$, $C^{(x)}$. The equation $\mathcal A^{(x,y)}(f(x,y))=0$ characterizes ${}_r\Phi_s(x,y;q,t)$, while the equations $\mathcal B^{(x)}(f(x))=0$ and $\mathcal C^{(x)}(f(x))=0$ each characterize ${}_r\Phi_s(x;q,t)$. These characterizations are subject to certain symmetry, boundary and stability condition. In the special case of ${}_2\Phi_1(x;q,t)$, our operator $\mathcal B^{(x)}$ was previously constructed by Kaneko in 1996.</description>

      <title>On Lipschitz equivalence of finite-dimensional linear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two flows on a finite-dimensional normed space $X$ are Lipschitz equivalent if some homeomorphism $h$ of $X$ that is bi-Lipschitz near the origin preserves all orbits, i.e., $h$ maps each orbit onto an orbit. A complete classification by Lipschitz equivalence is established for all linear flows on $X$, in terms of basic linear algebra properties of their generators. Utilizing equivalence instead of the much more restrictive conjugacy, the classification theorem significantly extends known results. The analysis is entirely elementary though somewhat intricate. It highlights, more clearly than does the existing literature, the fundamental roles played by linearity and finite-dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Weighted Poincar\'e-Type Inequalities with Applications to Logarithmic Haj{\l}asz--Besov Spaces on Spaces of Homogeneous Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let ${\mathcal {X}}$ be a space of homogeneous type. In this article, based on the reducing operators of matrix $A_p$-weights, the authors introduce the vector-valued Haj\l asz gradient sequences and establish some related matrix-weighted Poincar\'{e}-type inequalities on ${\mathcal {X}}$. As an application, the authors introduce the matrix-weighted logarithmic Besov spaces on ${\mathcal {X}}$ and establish their pointwise characterization via Haj{\l}asz gradient sequences. The novelty of this article lies in that, by means of both the $A_p$ dimension and its properties of matrix $A_p$-weights and the wavelet reproducing formula with exponential decay of P. Auscher and T. Hyt\"onen, all the main results get rid of the dependence on the reverse doubling conditions of both weights and ${\mathcal {X}}$ under consideration and these results are also completely new even for unweighted logarithmic Besov spaces on ${\mathcal {X}}$.</description>

      <title>Hua-Pickrell diffusions and differential equations related with pseudo-Jacobi polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following Assiotis (2020), we study general $\beta$-Hua-Pickrell diffusions of $N$ particles on $\mathbb R$ as solutions of the stochastic differential equations (SDEs) $$dX_{j,t}=\sqrt{2(1+X_{j,t}^2)}\,dB_{j,t}+\beta\left[b-a X_{j,t}+\sum_{l=1,\ldots, N; \&gt; l\neq j}\frac{X_{j,t}X_{l,t}+1}{X_{j,t}-X_{l,t}}\right]dt\,,\;\; (j=1,\ldots,N)$$ with $\beta\ge 1,\&gt; a,b\in\mathbb R$. These processes form a subclass of the Pearson diffusions which are defined as solutions of algebraic SDEs where the moments of the empirical distributions $\mu_t^N:=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N \delta_{X_{j,t}}$ can be computed inductively. This Pearson class also contains other well known diffusions like Dyson Brownian motions, and multivariate Laguerre and Jacobi processes After the time normalization $t\mapsto t/\beta$, the SDEs above degenerate in the frozen case for $\beta=\infty$ into ordinary differential equations which are related to pseudo-Jacobi polynomials. For $N\to\infty$ and under suitable initial conditions, the empirical distributions $\mu_t^N$ converge weakly almost surely for $t&gt;0$ to some limit which is independent from $\beta\in[1,\infty]$. For $a=-N, b=0$, we describe the limit explicitly via free convolutions. Moreover, if $a=cN$ for some $c&gt;0$, the solutions of our SDEs converge for $t\to\infty$ to stationary distributions, which are Hua-Pickrell (or Cauchy) measures. We thus obtain connections between known results for the empirical distributions of these ensembles and the zeros of the pseudo-Jacobi polynomials. Furthermore, we derive a freezing central limit theorem for $\beta\to\infty$ for the Hua-Pickrell ensembles which is related to these zeros.</description>

      <title>Cheeger's isoperimetric problem for Gaussian mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In any dimension $n$, we determine the Cheeger constant and the Cheeger sets of the Gaussian mixture $\mu(x) = p\gamma(x-a) + (1-p)\gamma(x-b)$, where $p \in [0,1]$, $a,b \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and $\gamma : \mathbb{R}^n \to (0,\infty)$ denotes a Gaussian. In particular, we characterize the Cheeger sets for $\mu$ in terms of specific half-spaces perpendicular to $a-b$, thereby confirming the conjectured solution to the Cheeger problem for Gaussian mixtures. Finally, we study the regime of parameters $p,a,b$ in which $\mu$ admits a unique Cheeger set.</description>

      <title>Heterotopic energy for Sobolev mappings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the notion of heterotopic energy defined as the limit of Sobolev energies of Sobolev mappings in a given homotopy class approximating almost everywhere a given Sobolev mapping. We show that the heterotopic energy is finite if and only if the mappings in the corresponding homotopy classes are homotopic on a codimension one skeleton of a triangulation of the domain. When this is the case, the heterotopic energy of a mapping is the sum of its Sobolev energy and its disparity energy, defined as the minimum energy of a bubble to pass between these homotopy classes. At the more technical level, we rely on a framework that works when the target and domain manifolds are not simply connected and there is no canonical isomorphism between homotopy groups with different basepoints.</description>

      <title>Hyperasymptotics for linear difference equations with an irregular singularity of rank one: Polynomial coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperasymptotics is an analytical method that incorporates exponentially small contributions into asymptotic approximations, thereby expanding their domain of validity, improving accuracy, and providing deeper insight into the underlying singularity structures. It also allows for the computation of problem-specific invariants, such as Stokes multipliers, whose values are often assumed or remain unknown in other approaches. For differential equations, unlike standard asymptotic expansions, hyperasymptotic expansions determine solutions uniquely. In this paper, we extend the hyperasymptotic method to inverse factorial series solutions of certain higher-order linear difference equations and demonstrate that the resulting expansions also determine the solutions uniquely. We further indicate how the connection coefficients appearing in these expansions can be computed numerically using hyperasymptotic techniques. In addition, we give explicit remainder bounds for the inverse factorial series solutions. Our main tool is the Mellin--Borel transform. The expansions are expressed via universal hyperterminant functions, closely related to the hyperterminants familiar from integral and differential equation contexts. The results are illustrated by the Gauss hypergeometric function with a large third parameter and a third-order difference equation.</description>

      <title>Wiman-Valiron method for fractional derivatives and sharp growth estimates of $\alpha$-analytic solutions for linear fractional differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a fractional linear differential equation with successive derivatives given by $ \mathbb{D}_\alpha^{n}y+ p_{n-1}(x) \mathbb{D}_\alpha^{n-1}y+ \dots +p_{1}(x)\mathbb{D}_\alpha y+p_0(x)y=0$, where $\mathbb{D}_\alpha^{j}$ is the $j$th iteration of the Caputo-Djrbashian fractional derivative of order $\alpha&gt;0$, $p_j$ are $\alpha$-analytic functions for $0&lt;x^\alpha &lt;R$. Generalizing a result of Kilbas, Rivero Rodr\'iguez-Germ\'a and Trujillo, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding Cauchy problem in the class of $\alpha$-analytic functions. We establish an exact growth order for the solution when $p_j(x)=P_j(x^\alpha)$, where $P_j$ are polynomials, and $p_0$ dominates in some sense. This is the full counterpart of the classical case of ordinary differential equations. In particular, we demonstrate the sharpness of Kochubei's result and generalize it. To achieve this, we extend the Wiman-Valiron theory to analytic functions and the Djrbashian-Gelfond-Leontiev generalized fractional derivatives.</description>

      <title>Critical values for the $\beta$-transformation with a hole at $0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.10012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given $\beta\in(1,2]$, let $T_\beta$ be the $\beta$-transformation on the unit circle $[0,1)$ such that $T_\beta(x)=\beta x\pmod 1$. For each $t\in[0,1)$ let $K_\beta(t)$ be the survivor set consisting of all $x\in[0,1)$ whose orbit $\{T^n_\beta(x): n\ge 0\}$ never hits the open interval $(0,t)$. Kalle et al. proved in [Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems, 40 (9): 2482--2514, 2020] that the Hausdorff dimension function $t\mapsto\dim_H K_\beta(t)$ is a non-increasing Devil's staircase. So there exists a critical value $\tau(\beta)$ such that $\dim_H K_\beta(t)&gt;0$ if and only if $t&lt;\tau(\beta)$. In this paper we determine the critical value $\tau(\beta)$ for all $\beta\in(1,2]$, answering a question of Kalle et al. (2020). For example, we find that for the Komornik-Loreti constant $\beta\approx 1.78723$ we have $\tau(\beta)=(2-\beta)/(\beta-1)$. Furthermore, we show that (i) the function $\tau: \beta\mapsto\tau(\beta)$ is left continuous on $(1,2]$ with right-hand limits everywhere, but has countably infinitely many discontinuities; (ii) $\tau$ has no downward jumps, with $\tau(1+)=0$ and $\tau(2)=1/2$; and (iii) there exists an open set $O\subset(1,2]$, whose complement $(1,2]\setminus O$ has zero Hausdorff dimension, such that $\tau$ is real-analytic, convex and strictly decreasing on each connected component of $O$. Our strategy to find the critical value $\tau(\beta)$ depends on certain substitutions of Farey words and a renormalization scheme from dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Multiple orthogonal polynomial ensembles of derivative type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the biorthogonal ensembles that are both a multiple orthogonal polynomial ensemble and a polynomial ensemble of derivative type (also called a P\'olya ensemble). We focus on the notions of multiplicative and additive derivative type that typically appear in connection with products and sums of random matrices respectively. Essential in the characterization is the use of the Mellin and Laplace transform: we show that the derivative type structure, which is a priori analytic in nature, becomes algebraic after applying the appropriate transform. Afterwards, we use the characterization to show that the eigenvalue densities of products of JUE and LUE matrices are essentially the only multiple orthogonal polynomial ensembles of multiplicative derivative type. We also show that the eigenvalue densities of sums of dilated LUE and GUE matrices are examples of multiple orthogonal polynomial ensemble of additive derivative type, but provide other examples as well. Finally, we explain how these notions of derivative type can be used to provide a partial solution to an open problem related to orthogonality of the finite finite free multiplicative and additive convolution of polynomials from finite free probability. In particular, we obtain families of multiple orthogonal polynomials that (de)compose naturally using these convolutions.</description>

      <title>From tug-of-war to Brownian Boost: explicit ODE solutions for player-funded stochastic-differential games</title>

Abstract: Brownian Boost is a one-parameter family of stochastic differential games played on the real line in which players spend at rates of their choosing in an ongoing effort to influence the drift of a randomly diffusing point particle~$X$. One or other player is rewarded, at time infinity, according to whether~$X$ tends to plus or minus infinity. Each player's net receipt is the final reward (only for the victor) minus the player's total spend. We characterise and explicitly compute the time-homogeneous Markov-perfect Nash equilibria of Brownian Boost, finding the derivatives of the players' expected payoffs to solve a pair of coupled first-order non-linear ODE. Brownian Boost is a high-noise limit of a two-dimensional family of player-funded tug-of-war games, one of which was studied in~\cite{LostPennies}. We analyse the discrete games, finding them, and Brownian Boost, to exemplify key features studied in the economics literature of tug-of-war initiated by~\cite{HarrisVickers87}: a battlefield region where players spend heavily;
  stakes that decay rapidly but asymmetrically in distance to the battlefield; and an effect of discouragement that makes equilibria fragile under asymmetric perturbation of incentive.
  Tug-of-war has a parallel mathematical literature derived from~\cite{PSSW09}, which solved the scaled fair-coin game in a Euclidean domain via the infinity Laplacian PDE. By offering an analytic solution to Brownian Boost, a game that models strategic interaction and resource allocation, we seek to build a bridge between the two tug-of-war literatures.</description>

      <title>Beyond real blow-up: Masuda detours and complex holonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For real $\mathbf{b}$, consider quadratic heat equations like \begin{equation*} \mathbf{w}_t=\mathbf{w}_{\boldsymbol{\xi}\boldsymbol{\xi}} + \mathbf{b}(\boldsymbol{\xi})\,\mathbf{w}^2 \end{equation*} on $\boldsymbol{\xi}\in(0,\pi)$ with Neumann boundary conditions. For $\mathbf{b}$=1, pioneering work by Ky\^uya Masuda in the 1980s aimed to circumvent PDE blow-up, which occurs in finite real time, by a detour which ventures through complex time. Naive projection onto the first two Galerkin modes $\mathbf{w}=x+y \cos\boldsymbol{\xi}$ leads us to an ODE caricature. As in the PDE, spatially homogeneous solutions $y=0\neq x\in\mathbb{R}$ starting at $x_0$ blow up at finite real time $t=T=1/x_0$. We aim for ODE "linearization at infinity".
  Since iterated complex time loops are not feasible, for parabolic PDEs, our PDE-motivated approach is currently limited to ODEs. On the other hand, all ODE results of the present paper exactly embed into certain PDEs of parabolic type, which possess a PDE-invariant Galerkin subspace.
  In the spirit of Masuda, we extend real analytic ODE solutions to complex time, and to real 4-dimensional $(x,y)\in\mathbb{C}^2$, to circumvent the real blow-up singularity at $t=T$. We therefore study complex foliations of general polynomial ODEs for $(x,y)\in\mathbb{C}^2$, in projective compactifications like $u=1/x,\ z=y/x$, including their holonomy at blow-up $u=0$. We obtain linearizations, at blow-up equilibria of Poincar\'e and Siegel type, based on spectral nonresonance. We discuss the consequences of rational periodic nonresonance, and of irrational quasiperiodic nonresonance of Diophantine type, for iterated Masuda detours in the ODE caricature. We conclude with some comments on global aspects, PDEs, discretizations, and other applications.</description>

      <title>Non-linear parabolic PDEs with rough coefficients and critical data: existence, uniqueness and regularity of weak solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the well-posedness of weak solutions to non-linear parabolic PDEs driven by rough coefficients with rough initial data in critical homogeneous Besov spaces. Well-posedness is understood in the sense of existence and uniqueness of maximal weak solutions in suitable weighted $Z$-spaces in the absence of smallness conditions. We showcase our theory with an application to rough reaction--diffusion equations. Subsequent articles will treat further classes of equations, including equations of Burgers-type and quasi-linear problems, using the same approach. Our toolkit includes a novel theory of hypercontractive singular integral operators (SIOs) on weighted $Z$-spaces and a self-improving property for super-linear reverse H\"older inequalities.</description>

      <title>A formula for the local Heun solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local Heun solution is the unique solution to Heun's equation which is analytic in the unit disk centered at $0\in\mathbb{C}$ and taking the value $1$ at the center of the disk. In this paper, as an application of the theory of orthogonal polynomials, we are able to express the coefficients in the corresponding power series as finite multiple sums. In addition, the obtained formula can be used to derive an explicit estimate on the coefficients giving a hint on their asymptotic behavior for large indices.</description>
