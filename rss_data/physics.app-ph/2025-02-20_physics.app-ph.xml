      <title>Unusual Red Light Emission from Nonmetallic Cu$_2$Te Microdisk for Laser and SERS Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical characteristics of Cu$_2$Te are poorly investigated due to limited Te sources available and unclear atomic positions of crystal structure. Herein, hexagonal Cu$_2$Te microdisks are successfully prepared via chemical vapor deposition procedure using GaTe as Te source. The epitaxial growth mechanism of the Cu$_2$Te hexagonal structures with the orthorhombic phase are rationalized by proposed layer-over-layer growth model. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of Cu$_2$Te microdisks shows a new red emission band in addition to usual infrared light emission due to Cu deficiency. Single Cu$_2$Te microdisk operates as an optical microcavity supporting whispering gallery modes for red lasing around 627.5 nm. This Cu$_2$Te microdisk microcavity exhibits a high quality factor of 1568 and a low lasing threshold of 125 kW cm$^{-2}$ at room temperature. Meanwhile, Cu$_2$Te microdisks have been exhibited as an ideal platform for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) eliminating drawbacks of noble metal substrates with detection limitation to nanomolar level and an enhancement factor of $\sim$1.95$\times$10$^5$. Hexagonal Cu$_2$Te microdisks turn out to be an efficient microcavity for red lasing and low-cost nonmetallic SERS substrates, opening potential applications in photonics and biological detection of aromatic molecules.</description>

      <title>Combined Light Excitation and Scanning Gate Microscopy on Heterostructure Nanowire Photovoltaic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale optoelectronic components achieve functionality via spatial variation in electronic structure induced by composition, defects, and dopants. To dynamically change the local band alignment and influence defect states, a scanning gate electrode is highly useful. However, this technique is rarely combined with photoexcitation by a controlled external light source. We explore a setup that combines several types of light excitation with high resolution scanning gate and atomic force microscopy (SGM/AFM). We apply the technique to InAs nanowires with an atomic scale defined InP segment, that have attracted considerable attention for studies of hot carrier devices. Using AFM we image the topography of the nanowire device. SGM measurements without light excitation show how current profiles can be influenced by local gating near the InP segment. Modelling of the tip and nanowire can well predict the results based on the axial band structure variation and an asymmetric tip. SGM studies including light excitation are then performed using both a white light LED and laser diodes at 515 and 780nm. Both negative and positive photoconductance can be observed and the combined effect of light excitation and local gating is observed. SGM can then be used to discriminate between effects related to the wire axial compositional structure and surface states. The setup explored in the current work has significant advantages to study optoelectronics at realistic conditions and with rapid turnover.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Water Contamination on the Aging of a Dual-Carbon Lithium-Ion Capacitor Employing LiFSI-Based Electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fabricating electrochemical energy storage devices demands significant energy for drying cell components to ensure optimal performance. The development of new, water-tolerant materials would represent a tremendous advance in cost savings and sustainability. Although it is generally established that water deteriorates cell performance, there are few systematic studies on the maximum amount of tolerable water contamination, and most of the studies employed the electrolyte salt $\mathrm{LiPF_6}$, which inevitably decomposes upon exposure to humidity. In this work, the potential of using the non-hydrolyzing salt LiFSI is explored with respect to its performance in Li-ion capacitor cells based on activated carbon (AC) and pre-lithiated graphite (Gr). Water is deliberately added in various amounts (950, 2300, and 6000 ppm), and its effect on the electrochemical performance and aging of AC and Gr electrodes is systematically studied. While the addition of 950 ppm water has no evident impact on capacity retention (96% after 2000 cycles), the addition of 2300 ppm water or 6000 ppm water shows a distinct capacity fade, attributed to a significant loss of lithium inventory and increased resistivity due to irreversible reactions of the water with lithiated Gr. Post-mortem analysis reveals that water promotes the oxidative and reductive decomposition of LiFSI on AC and lithiated Gr, respectively. A significant thickening of the SEI on Gr is observed as the water concentration is increased.</description>

      <title>Searching Axion-like Dark Matter by Amplifying Weak Magnetic Field with Quantum Zeno effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enhancement of weak signals and the detection of hypothetical particles, facilitated by quantum amplification, are crucial for advancing fundamental physics and its practical applications. Recently, it was experimentally observed that magnetic field can be amplified by using nuclear spins under Markovian noise, [H. Su, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 191801 (2024)]. Here, we theoretically propose amplifying the magnetic-field signal by using nuclear spins by the quantum Zeno effect (QZE). Under identical conditions, we demonstrate that compared to the Markovian case the amplification of the weak magnetic field can be enhanced by a factor about $e^{1/2}$ under a Gaussian noise. Moreover, through numerical simulations we determine the optimal experimental parameters for amplification conditions. This work shows that the combination of the QZE and spin amplification effectively enhances the amplification of the weak magnetic field. Our findings may provide valuable guidance for the design of experiments on establishing new constraints of dark matter and exotic interactions in the near future.</description>

      <title>Spiral resonator referenced on-chip low noise microwave generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, miniaturization and integration of photonic microwave oscillators by optical frequency division approach have witnessed rapid progress. In this work, we report on-chip low phase noise photonic microwave generation based on a planar chip design. Dual lasers are co-locked to a silicon nitride spiral resonator and their relative phase noise is measured below the cavity thermal noise limit, resulting in record low on-chip relative optical phase noise. A broadband integrated electro-optic comb up to 3.43 THz (27 nm) bandwidth is utilized to divide down the relative phase noise of the spiral resonator referenced lasers to the microwave domain. All-around record-low phase noise is achieved for planar chip-based photonic microwave oscillators from 10 Hz to 10 kHz offsets. The planar chip design, high technology-readiness level, foundry-ready processing, combined with the exceptional phase noise performance for our work represent a major advance of integrated photonic microwave oscillators.</description>

      <title>Interplay of carrier density and mobility in Al-Rich (Al,Ga)N-Channel HEMTs: Impact on high-power device performance potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite considerable advancements, high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) based on gallium nitride (GaN) channels remain largely limited to power applications below 650 V. For higher power demands, the ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor alloy aluminium gallium nitride, (Al,Ga)N, has emerged as a key contender for next-generation HEMTs. In this theoretical study, we show that Al-rich Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N-channel HEMTs (with $x \geq 0.5$) outperform the GaN-channel counterparts at and above room temperature, across all Al compositions, $x$. This contrasts with recent theory reports which suggest that only Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N HEMTs with high Al content ($x \geq 0.85$) offer comparable performance to GaN-channel devices. Unlike previous assumptions of a constant two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) density across the entire composition range $x$, we show that the 2DEG density is highly sensitive to both the Al content and thickness of the individual layers in a HEMT structure. We demonstrate that the superior performance of Al-rich (Al,Ga)N-channel HEMTs is driven by a competing effect between 2DEG density and electron mobility. This work challenges the assumptions of prior studies, which can result in a significant under or overestimation of the potential of high Al content HEMTs. The insights gained from our work provide a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between device and material parameters, thus help to guide the design of future Al-rich ($x = 0.5-1.0$) Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N-channel HEMTs for high-power applications.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Discovery of High Performance Polymer Electrodes for Next-Generation Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of transition group metals in electric batteries requires extensive usage of critical elements like lithium, cobalt and nickel, which poses significant environmental challenges. Replacing these metals with redox-active organic materials offers a promising alternative, thereby reducing the carbon footprint of batteries by one order of magnitude. However, this approach faces critical obstacles, including the limited availability of suitable redox-active organic materials and issues such as lower electronic conductivity, voltage, specific capacity, and long-term stability. To overcome the limitations for lower voltage and specific capacity, a machine learning (ML) driven battery informatics framework is developed and implemented. This framework utilizes an extensive battery dataset and advanced ML techniques to accelerate and enhance the identification, optimization, and design of redox-active organic materials. In this contribution, a data-fusion ML coupled meta learning model capable of predicting the battery properties, voltage and specific capacity, for various organic negative electrodes and charge carriers (positive electrode materials) combinations is presented. The ML models accelerate experimentation, facilitate the inverse design of battery materials, and identify suitable candidates from three extensive material libraries to advance sustainable energy-storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Mirrors without spatial boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mirrors are one of the most elementary and ubiquitous components of optical systems. They use a sharp refractive index contrast to provide the basic capability of reflecting light. Motivated by recent developments of photonic time-varying media, here we investigate the fundamental question on whether it is possible to have a mirror without any spatial boundary. In this vein, we first discuss how purely temporal mirrors are in general forbidden by the conservation of Minkowski momentum. However, we show that an exotic class of metamaterials, namely, temporal non-Foster left-handed media, exhibit anti-parallel Minkowski momentum and energy flow, thereby enabling mirrors without spatial boundaries. Upon this ground, we put forward some related photonic functionalities, including temporal cavities, pulse freezing, and frequency comb generators, which can be understood as the precursor of temporal lasers.</description>

      <title>Spatially Encoded Polaritonic Ultra-Strong Coupling in Gradient Metasurfaces with Epsilon-Near-Zero Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-strong coupling (USC) is a light-matter interaction regime characterized by coupling strengths that substantially exceed the threshold for strong coupling. It gives rise to novel physical phenomena, such as efficient single-photon coupling and quantum gates, with applications in quantum sensing, nonlinear optics, and low-threshold lasing. Although early demonstrations in plasmonic systems have been realized, achieving USC in dielectric nanophotonic platforms, which offer lower losses and high Q-factors, remains challenging due to typically low mode overlap between the photonic field and the material resonance. Here, we demonstrate ultra-strong coupling to an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) mode in an ultra-thin SiO$_2$ layer. Our approach leverages a dielectric dual-gradient metasurface supporting quasi-bound-states-in-the-continuum (qBIC) consisting of two tapered bars in each unit cell that generate strong out-of-plane electric fields which overlap exceptionally well with those of the ENZ mode. Using dual gradients to encode both the spectral and coupling parameter space, we track the anticrossing behaviour of this coupled system with high experimental precision, revealing a mode splitting equivalent to 19% of the ENZ mode energy; a four-to-five-fold increase compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, varying the position of the SiO$_2$ layer allows for deliberate control of the mode overlap and the coupling between the qBIC and either the ENZ mode or the transverse optical (TO) phonon can be selectively tuned. This allows us to experimentally create an USC three-resonator system, opening new possibilities for compact and scalable polaritonic devices for sensing and nonlinear optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanical objects have been widely used at low temperatures for decades, for various applications; from quantum fluids sensing with vibrating wires or tuning forks, to torsional oscillators for the study of mechanical properties of glasses, and finally micro and nano-mechanical objects with the advent of clean room technologies. These small structures opened up new possibilities to experimentalists, thanks to their small size. We report on the characterization of purely metallic goalpost nano-mechanical structures, which are employed today for both quantum fluids studies (especially quantum turbulence in $^4$He, $^3$He) and intrinsic friction studies (Two-Level-Systems unraveling). Extending existing literature, we demonstrate the analytic modeling of the resonances, in good agreement with numerical simulations, for both first and second mechanical modes. Especially, the impact of the curvature of the whole structure (and therefore, in-built surface stress) is analyzed, together with nonlinear properties. We demonstrate that these are of geometrical origin, and device-dependent. Motion and forces are expressed in meters and Newtons experienced at the level of the goalpost's paddle, for any magnitude or curvature, which is of particular importance for quantum fluids and solids studies.</description>

Abstract: The next generation of photonic circuits will require programmable, ultrafast, and energy-efficient components on a scalable platform for quantum and neuromorphic computing. Here, we present ultrafast electrical control of highly nonlinear light-matter hybrid quasi-particles, called waveguide exciton-dipolaritons, with extremely low power consumption. Our device performs as an optical transistor with a GHz-rate electrical modulation at a record-low total energy consumption $\sim$3 fJ/bit and a compact active area of down to 25 $\mu$m$^2$. This work establishes waveguide-dipolariton platforms for scalable, electrically reconfigurable, ultra-low power photonic circuits for both classical and quantum computing and communication.</description>
