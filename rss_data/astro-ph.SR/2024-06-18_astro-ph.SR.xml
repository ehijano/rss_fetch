      <title>Rotation and H$\alpha$ emission in a young SMC cluster: a spectroscopic view of NGC 330</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of high-resolution optical spectra recorded for 30 stars of the split extended main-sequence turnoff (eMSTO) of the young ($\sim$ 40 Myr) Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) globular cluster NGC 330. Spectra were obtained with the M2FS and MIKE spectrographs located on the Magellan-Clay 6.5m telescope. These spectra revealed the presence of Be stars, occupying primarily the cool side of the split main sequence (MS). Rotational velocity ($v\sin{i}$) measurements for most of the targets are consistent with the presence of two populations of stars in the cluster: one made up of rapidly rotating Be stars ($&lt;v\sin{i}&gt; \approx 200$ $\rm km\,s^{-1}$), and {the other} consisting of warmer stars with slower rotation ($&lt;\!v\sin{i}\!&gt;\approx50$ $\rm km\,s^{-1}$). Core emission in the H$\delta$ photospheric lines was observed for most of the H$\alpha$ emitters. The shell parameter computed for the targets in our sample indicate that most of the observed stars should have inclinations below 75$^{\circ}$. These results confirm the detection of Be stars obtained through photometry, but also reveal the presence of narrow H$\alpha$ and H$\delta$ features for some targets that cannot be detected with low-resolution spectroscopy or photometry. Asymmetry variability of H$\alpha$ line profiles on the timescales of a few years is also observed, and could provide information on the geometry of the decretion disks. Observations revealed the presence of nebular H$\alpha$ emission, strong enough in faint targets to compromise the extraction of spectra and to impact narrow band photometry used to assess the presence of H$\alpha$ emission.</description>

      <title>Extended Cyclotron Resonant Heating of the Turbulent Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circularly polarized, nearly parallel propagating waves are prevalent in the solar wind at ion-kinetic scales. At these scales, the spectrum of turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind steepens, often called the transition-range, before flattening at sub-ion scales. Circularly polarized waves have been proposed as a mechanism to couple electromagnetic fluctuations to ion gyromotion, enabling ion-scale dissipation that results in observed ion-scale steepening. Here, we study Parker Solar Probe observations of an extended stream of fast solar wind ranging from 15-55 solar radii. We demonstrate that, throughout the stream, transition-range steepening at ion-scales is associated with the presence of significant left handed ion-kinetic scale waves, which are thought to be ion-cyclotron waves. We implement quasilinear theory to compute the rate at which ions are heated via cyclotron resonance with the observed circularly polarized waves given the empirically measured proton velocity distribution functions. We apply the Von Karman decay law to estimate the turbulent decay of the large-scale fluctuations, which is equal to the turbulent energy cascade rate. We find that the ion-cyclotron heating rates are correlated with, and amount to a significant fraction of, the turbulent energy cascade rate, implying that cyclotron heating is an important dissipation mechanism in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Dampening Long-Period Doppler Shift Oscillations using Deep Machine Learning Techniques in the Solar Network and Internetwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the Doppler shift at different wavelengths in the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) solar spectrum and implements a comprehensive consideration of Doppler velocity oscillations in the IRIS channels. This comprehensive consideration reveals a propagating periodic perturbation in a large number of chromosphere and transition region (TR) bright points (BPs). To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of the longitudinal oscillations with damping in BPs using comprehensive consideration of the Doppler velocity at various wavelengths. The phenomena of attenuation in the red and blue Doppler shifts of the solar wavelength range were seen several times during the experiments. We utilized deep learning techniques to examine the statistical properties of damping in network and internetwork BPs, as well as active, quiet areas, and coronal hole areas. Our results revealed varying damping rates across different regions, with 80 percent of network BPs exhibiting damping in quiet areas and 72 in coronal hole areas. In active areas, the figure approached 33. For internetwork BPs, the values were 65, 54, and 63 percent for quiet areas, coronal hole areas, and active regions, respectively. The damping rate in active regions is twice as high at Internetwork's BPs. The damping components in this study were computed, and the findings show that the damping at all points is underdamped. The observed damping process suggests the propagation and leaking of energetic waves out of TR bright points, potentially contributing to the energy transport from the bright magnetic footpoints to the upper chromosphere, transition region, and corona.</description>

      <title>Magnetohydrodynamical modeling of star-disk formation: from isolated spherical collapse towards incorporation of external dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of protostars and their disks has been understood as the result of the gravitational collapse phase of an accumulation of dense gas that determines the mass reservoir of the star-disk system. Against this background, the broadly applied scenario of considering the formation of disks has been to model the collapse of a dense core assuming spherical spherical symmetry. Our understanding of the formation of star-disk systems is currently undergoing a reformation though. The picture evolves from interpreting disks as the sole outcome of the collapse of an isolated prestellar core to a more dynamic picture where disks are affected by the molecular cloud environment in which they form. In this review, we provide a status report of the state-of-the-art of spherical collapse models that are highly advanced in terms of the incorporated physics together with constraints from models that account for the possibility of infall onto star-disk systems in simplified test setups, as well as in multi-scale simulations that cover a dynamical range from the Giant Molecular Cloud environment down to the disk. Considering the observational constraints that favor a more dynamical picture of star formation, we finally discuss the challenges and prospects in linking the efforts of tackle the problem of star-disk formation in combined multi-scale, multi-physics simulations.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of the fast-rotating high-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti star V2367 Cygni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the comprehensive analysis of the high-amplitude $\delta$ Sct star V2367 Cygni. Firstly, we perform the frequency analysis for the whole available set of the {\it Kepler} and {\it TESS} photometry. Most of the frequency peaks are harmonics or combinations of the three known independent frequencies with the highest amplitudes, i.e., $\nu_1=5.66106$\,d$^{-1}$, $\nu_2=7.14898$\,d$^{-1}$ and $\nu_3=7.77557$\,d$^{-1}$. The total number of independent frequencies is 26 and 25 from the {\it Kepler} and {\it TESS} light curve, respectively. Then, using the $UBVRI$ time-series photometry, we unambiguously identify the dominant frequency $\nu_1$ as the radial mode, whereas in the case of frequencies $\nu_2$ and $\nu_3$ the most probable mode degrees are $\ell=0$ or $\ell=2$. However, only the frequency $\nu_2$ can be associated with a radial mode, and only if higher order effects of rotation are taken into account. Including the rotational mode coupling, we constructed complex seismic models of V2367\,Cyg, which fit $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$ as radial modes, and reproduce the amplitude of bolometric flux variations (the parameter $f$) for the dominant mode. The empirical values of $f$ are derived from the $UBVRI$ amplitudes and phases. We rely on the Bayesian analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations to derive constraints on evolutionary stage, mass, rotation, overshooting from the convective core and efficiency of convective transport in the envelope. Our seismic analysis clearly indicates that V2367\,Cyg is in a post-MS phase of evolution. This is the first extensive seismic modelling that takes into account the effect of rotational coupling between pulsation modes.</description>

      <title>Parameter effects on the total intensity of H I Ly{\alpha} line for a modelled coronal mass ejection and its driven shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of the H I Ly{\alpha} (121.6 nm) line formation mechanism with ultraviolet (UV) Ly{\alpha} and white-light (WL) observations provides an effective method for determining the electron temperature of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). A key to ensuring the accuracy of this diagnostic technique is the precise calculation of theoretical Ly{\alpha} intensities. This study performs a modelled CME and its driven shock via the 3D MHD simulation. We generate synthetic UV and WL images of the CME and shock to quantify the impact of different assumptions on theoretical Ly{\alpha} intensities, such as the incident intensity of the Ly{\alpha} line (Idisk), the geometric scattering function (p({\theta})), and the kinetic temperature (Tn) assumed to be equal to the proton (Tp) or electron (Te) temperatures. By comparing differences of the Ly{\alpha} intensities under these assumptions, we find that: (1) Using the uniform or Carrington maps of the disk Ly{\alpha} emission underestimates the corona Ly{\alpha} intensity (&lt; 10%) compared to the synchronic map, except for a slight overestimate (&lt; 4%) in the partial CME core. The Carrington map yields lower uncertainties than the uniform disk. (2) The geometric scattering process has a minor impact on the Ly{\alpha} intensity, with a maximum relative uncertainty of &lt; 5%. The Ly{\alpha} intensity is underestimated for the most part but overestimated in the CME core. (3) Compared to the assumption Tn = Tp, using Tn = Te leads to more complex relative uncertainties in CME Ly{\alpha} intensity. The CME core and void are both overestimated, with the maximum uncertainty in the core exceeding 50% and the void remaining below 35%. In the CME front, both over- and under-estimates exist with relative uncertainties of &lt; 35%. The electron temperature assumption has a smaller impact on the shock, with an underestimated relative uncertainty of less than 20%.</description>

      <title>Precise timing of solar flare footpoint sources from mid-infrared observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares are powerful particle accelerators, and in the accepted standard flare model most of the flare energy is transported from a coronal energy-release region by accelerated electrons which stop collisionally in the chromosphere, heating and ionising the plasma, producing a broadband enhancement to the solar radiative output. We present a time-delay analysis of the infrared emission from two chromospheric sources in the flare SOL2014-09-24T17:50 taken at the McMath-Pierce telescope. By cross-correlating the intensity signals, measured with 1s cadence, from the two spatially resolved infrared sources we find a delay of 0.75 $\pm$ 0.07 s at 8.2 $\mu$m, where the uncertainties are quantified by a Monte Carlo analysis. The sources correlate well in brightness but have a time lag larger than can be reasonably explained by the energy transport dominated by non-thermal electrons precipitating from a single acceleration site in the corona. If interpreted as a time-of-flight difference between electrons traveling to each footpoint, we estimate time delays between 0.14 s and 0.42 s, for a reconnection site at the interior quasi-separatrix layer or at the null-point of the spine-fan topology inferred for this event. We employed modelling of electron transport via time-dependent Fokker-Planck and radiative hydrodynamic simulations to evaluate other possible sources of time-delay in the generation of the IR emission, such as differing ionisation timescales under different chromospheric conditions. Our results demonstrate that they are also unable to account for this discrepancy. This flare appears to require energy transport by some means other than electron beams originating in the corona.</description>

      <title>Non-LTE abundances of nitrogen in the Sun and reference A-F type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new model atom of nitrogen was developed using the energy levels of N I from laboratory measurements and also predicted in atomic structure calculations and the most up-to-date atomic data for computing radiative and collisional rates of the transitions. Solar abundance $\log\varepsilon_{\odot,N}$(1D NLTE) = 7.92$\pm$0.03 was determined from lines of N I by applying the synthetic spectrum method with the plane-parallel (1D) MARCS model atmosphere and taking into account the departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE = NLTE effects). Having implemented the 3D-corrections of Amarsi et al. (2020), we obtained $\log\varepsilon_{\odot,N}$(NLTE+3D) = 7.88$\pm$0.03 for the Sun. Based on high spectral resolution spectra, the NLTE abundances of nitrogen were derived for 11 unevolved A-F type stars with reliable atmospheric parameters. Non-LTE leads to strengthened N I lines, and the non-LTE effects grow with increasing effective temperature. For each star, non-LTE leads to smaller abundance error compared to the LTE case. For superficially normal A stars, non-LTE removes the enhancements relative to the solar nitrogen abundance obtained in the LTE case. A $\lambda$ Boo-type star HD 172167 (Vega) also has close-to-solar N abundance. The four Am stars reveal a scatter of the N abundances, from [N/H] = -0.44 to [N/H] = 0.39. The N abundances of the Sun and superficially normal A stars are consistent within 0.09 dex with the nitrogen abundance of the interstellar gas and the early B-type stars.</description>

      <title>Magnetism in LAMOST CP stars observed by TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. A thousand new magnetic candidate CP stars have been identified with LAMOST, among which about 700 prime targets have rotational modulation determined from TESS. Aims. We aim to check for the presence of a magnetic field in a subsample of these LAMOST CP stars, test the viability of the 5200 A depression used to select the mCP candidates in the LAMOST survey as a reliable indicator of magnetism, and expand on the limited database of known magnetic hot stars. The sample includes some pulsators that would be valuable targets for magneto-asteroseismology. Methods. We selected approx. 100 magnetic candidate LAMOST CP stars, presenting a depression at 5200 A in their spectrum and that also display rotational modulation in their TESS photometric lightcurves. We obtained spectropolarimetric observations of 39 targets from this sample with ESPaDOnS at CFHT. We utilise the Least Squares Deconvolution method to generate the mean profile of the Stokes V and I parameters, from which the longitudinal magnetic field strength for each target can be determined. For HD 49198, we performed more in-depth analysis to determine the polar magnetic field strength and configuration. Results. We detect fields in at least 36 of our sample of 39 targets. This success rate in detecting magnetic field (above 92%) is very high compared to the occurrence of magnetic fields in hot stars (about 10%). Four of these newly discovered magnetic stars are magnetic pulsators. In particular, we detect the strongest field around a delta Scuti star discovered to date: a 12 kG dipolar field in HD 49198. Conclusions. From our analysis, we conclude that using the 5200 A depression displayed in the spectra in combination with rotational modulation in photometric data is a very reliable method for identifying magnetic candidates in this population of stars.</description>

      <title>Association between a Failed Prominence Eruption and the Drainage of Mass from Another Prominence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sympathetic eruptions of solar prominences have been studied for decades, however, it is usually difficult to identify their causal links. Here we present two failed prominence eruptions on 26 October 2022 and explore their connections. Using stereoscopic observations, the south prominence (PRO-S) erupts with untwisting motions, flare ribbons occur underneath, and new connections are formed during the eruption. The north prominence (PRO-N) rises up along with PRO-S, and its upper part disappears due to catastrophic mass draining along an elongated structure after PRO-S failed eruption. We suggest that the eruption of PRO-S initiates due to a kink instability, further rises up, and fails to erupt due to reconnection with surrounding fields. The elongated structure connecting PRO-N overlies PRO-S, which causes the rising up of PRO-N along with PRO-S and mass drainage after PRO-S eruption. This study suggests that a prominence may end its life through mass drainage forced by an eruption underneath.</description>

      <title>Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and heating in oscillating loops perturbed by power-law transverse wave drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instabilities in oscillating loops are believed to be essential for dissipating the wave energy and heating the solar coronal plasma. Our aim is to study the development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability in an oscillating loop that is driven by random footpoint motions. Using the PLUTO code, we performed 3D simulations of a straight gravitationally stratified flux tube. The loop footpoints are embedded in chromospheric plasma, in the presence of thermal conduction and an artificially broadened transition region. Using drivers with a power-law spectrum, one with a red noise spectrum and one with the low-frequency part subtracted, we excited standing oscillations and the KH instability in our loops, after one-and-a-half periods of the oscillation. We see that our broadband drivers lead to fully deformed, turbulent loop cross-sections over the entire coronal part of the loop due to the spatially extended KH instability. The low RMS velocity of our driver without the low-frequency components supports the working hypothesis that the KH instability can easily manifest in oscillating coronal loops. We report for the first time in driven transverse oscillations of loops the apparent propagation of density perturbations due to the onset of the KH instability, from the apex towards the footpoints. Both drivers input sufficient energy to drive enthalpy and mass flux fluctuations along the loop, while also causing heating near the driven footpoint of the oscillating loop, which becomes more prominent when a low-frequency component is included in the velocity driver. Finally, our power-law driver with the low-frequency component provides a RMS input Poynting flux of the same order as the radiative losses of the quiet-Sun corona, giving us promising prospects for the contribution of decayless oscillations in coronal heating.</description>

      <title>Coronal energy release by MHD avalanches II. EUV line emission from a multi-threaded coronal loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MHD kink instability can trigger the fragmentation of a twisted magnetic flux tube into small-scale current sheets that dissipate as aperiodic impulsive heating events. This instability propagates as an avalanche to nearby flux tubes and leads to a nanoflare storm. Our previous work was devoted to related 3D MHD numerical modeling with a stratified and realistic atmosphere. This work addresses predictions for the EUV imaging spectroscopy of such structure and evolution of a loop, with an average temperature of 2.5 MK in the solar corona. We set a particular focus on the forthcoming MUSE mission. From the output of the numerical simulations, we synthesized the intensities, Doppler shifts, and non-thermal line broadening in 3 EUV spectral lines in the MUSE passbands: Fe IX 171A, Fe XV 284 A, and Fe XIX 108 A, at 1 MK, 2 MK, and 10 MK, respectively, according to the MUSE expected pixel size, temporal resolution, and temperature response functions. We provide maps showing different view angles and realistic spectra. Finally, we discuss the relevant evolutionary processes from the perspective of possible observations. We find that the MUSE observations might be able to detect the fine structure determined by tube fragmentation. In particular, the Fe IX line is mostly emitted at the loop footpoints, where we track the motions that drive the magnetic stressing and detect the upward motion of evaporating plasma from the chromosphere. In Fe XV, we see the bulk of the loop with increasing intensity. The Fe XIX line is very faint within the chosen simulation parameters; thus, any transient brightening around the loop apex may possibly be emphasized by the folding of sheet-like structure. In conclusion, we show that coronal loop observations with MUSE can pinpoint some crucial features of MHD-modeled ignition processes, such as the related dynamics, helping to identify the heating processes.</description>

      <title>Exploring the archives: A search for novae in UVIT snapshots of M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive multi-wavelength studies of novae have been carried out in our galaxy and in M31 for decades. However, UV studies of extragalactic novae are limited, especially those in quiescence. For the first time, we present a UV catalog of novae in M31 using the archival AstroSat UVIT imaging data. We used two image subtraction techniques to retrieve objects located deep into the M31 central region. We have found 42 novae in total in the UVIT images, 15 of which have been detected in multiple filters in FUV and NUV. The novae detected at quiescence show signatures of accretion disk from their UV spectral energy distributions, whereas those in the outburst phase show signatures of pseudo-photosphere. A few novae were also detected in multiple epochs. Some show a near-constant FUV magnitude at quiescence, while others caught near the outburst reveal pre-eruption dips in their light curves. We conclude with a discussion on the significance of UV surveys in illuminating theoretical predictions for novae systems, including detecting the elusive early UV flash.</description>

      <title>Characterizing planetary systems with SPIRou: a temperate sub-Neptune exoplanet orbiting the nearby fully-convective star GJ 1289 and a candidate around GJ 3378</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of two new exoplanet systems around fully convective stars, found from the radial-velocity (RV) variations of their host stars measured with the nIR spectropolarimeter CFHT/SPIRou over multiple years. GJ 3378 b is a planet with minimum mass of $5.26^{+0.94}_{-0.97}$ Mearth in an eccentric 24.73-day orbit around an M4V star of 0.26 Msun. GJ 1289 b has a minimum mass of $6.27\pm1.25$ Mearth in a 111.74-day orbit, in a circular orbit around an M4.5V star of mass 0.21 Msun. Both stars are in the solar neighbourhood, at respectively 7.73 and 8.86 pc. The low-amplitude RV signals are detected after line-by-line post-processing treatment. These potential sub-Neptune class planets around cool stars may have temperate atmospheres and be interesting nearby systems for further studies. We also recovered the large-scale magnetic field of both stars, found to be mostly axisymmetric and dipolar, and with a polar strength of 20-30 G and 200-240 G for GJ 3378 (in 2019-21) and GJ 1289 (in 2022-23), respectively. The rotation periods measured with the magnetic field differ from the orbital periods, and in general, stellar activity is not seen in the studied nIR RV time series of both stars. GJ 3378 b detection is not confirmed by optical RVs and is therefore considered a candidate at this point.</description>

      <title>Chemical compositions of semi-regular variable red giants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sample of warm low level semi-regular variables chosen from the General Catalogue of Variable Stars is studied for their chemical compositions by analysing high resolution optical spectra. The abundance ratios from Na/Fe to Eu/Fe displayed by these and previously analysed semi-regular variables are quite similar to ratios displayed by normal red giants across the Galactic thin and thick disks and halo populations in the solar neighbourhood suggesting from this perspective that the variables may be among the more photometrically active red giants.</description>

      <title>Four microlensing giant planets detected through signals produced by minor-image perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the nature of the anomalies appearing in four microlensing events KMT-2020-BLG-0757, KMT-2022-BLG-0732, KMT-2022-BLG-1787, and KMT-2022-BLG-1852. The light curves of these events commonly exhibit initial bumps followed by subsequent troughs that extend across a substantial portion of the light curves. We performed thorough modeling of the anomalies to elucidate their characteristics. Despite their prolonged durations, which differ from the usual brief anomalies observed in typical planetary events, our analysis revealed that each anomaly in these events originated from a planetary companion located within the Einstein ring of the primary star. It was found that the initial bump arouse when the source star crossed one of the planetary caustics, while the subsequent trough feature occurred as the source traversed the region of minor image perturbations lying between the pair of planetary caustics. The estimated masses of the host and planet, their mass ratios, and the distance to the discovered planetary systems are $(M_{\rm host}/M_\odot, M_{\rm planet}/M_{\rm J}, q/10^{-3}, \dl/{\rm kpc}) = (0.58^{+0.33}_{-0.30}, 10.71^{+6.17}_{-5.61}, 17.61\pm 2.25,6.67^{+0.93}_{-1.30})$ for KMT-2020-BLG-0757, $(0.53^{+0.31}_{-0.31}, 1.12^{+0.65}_{-0.65}, 2.01 \pm 0.07, 6.66^{+1.19}_{-1.84})$ for KMT-2022-BLG-0732, $(0.42^{+0.32}_{-0.23}, 6.64^{+4.98}_{-3.64}, 15.07\pm 0.86, 7.55^{+0.89}_{-1.30})$ for KMT-2022-BLG-1787, and $(0.32^{+0.34}_{-0.19}, 4.98^{+5.42}_{-2.94}, 8.74\pm 0.49, 6.27^{+0.90}_{-1.15})$ for KMT-2022-BLG-1852. These parameters indicate that all the planets are giants with masses exceeding the mass of Jupiter in our solar system and the hosts are low-mass stars with masses substantially less massive than the Sun.</description>

      <title>Advancing Solar Flare Prediction using Deep Learning with Active Region Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for leveraging shape-based characteristics of magnetograms of active region (AR) patches and provide a novel capability for predicting solar flares covering the entirety of the solar disk (AR patches spanning from -90$^{\circ}$ to +90$^{\circ}$ of solar longitude). We create three deep learning models: (i) ResNet34, (ii) MobileNet, and (iii) MobileViT to predict $\geq$M-class flares and assess the efficacy of these models across various ranges of solar longitude. Given the inherent imbalance in our data, we employ augmentation techniques alongside undersampling during the model training phase, while maintaining imbalanced partitions in the testing data for realistic evaluation. We use a composite skill score (CSS) as our evaluation metric, computed as the geometric mean of the True Skill Score (TSS) and the Heidke Skill Score (HSS) to rank and compare models. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: (i) We introduce a novel capability in solar flare prediction that allows predicting flares for each ARs throughout the solar disk and evaluate and compare the performance, (ii) Our candidate model (MobileNet) achieves a CSS=0.51 (TSS=0.60 and HSS=0.44), CSS=0.51 (TSS=0.59 and HSS=0.44), and CSS=0.48 (TSS=0.56 and HSS=0.40) for AR patches within $\pm$30$^{\circ}$, $\pm$60$^{\circ}$, $\pm$90$^{\circ}$ of solar longitude respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to issue flare forecasts for ARs in near-limb regions (regions between $\pm$60$^{\circ}$ to $\pm$90 $^{\circ}$) with a CSS=0.39 (TSS=0.48 and HSS=0.32), expanding the scope of AR-based models for solar flare prediction. This advancement opens new avenues for more reliable prediction of solar flares, thereby contributing to improved forecasting capabilities.</description>

      <title>Disk Assembly of the Milky Way Suggested from the Time-resolved Chemical Abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both simulations and observations suggest that the disk assembly of galaxies is governed by the interplay between coplanar gas inflow, ex-planar gas outflow and in-situ star formation on the disk, known as the leaky accretion disk. This scenario predicts a strong connection between radial distributions of star formation and chemical abundances. The Milky Way, being the sole galaxy where we can reliably measure star formation histories and the corresponding temporally-resolved chemical abundances with individual stars, provides a unique opportunity to scrutinize this scenario. Based on the recent large spectroscopic and photometric surveys of Milky Way stars, we obtain the radial profiles of magnesium abundance ([Mg/H]) and star formation rate (SFR) surface density at different lookback time. We find the radial profiles of [Mg/H] can be well-reproduced using the leaky accretion disk model with only two free parameters for stars formed within 4 Gyr, as well as the flattening at large radii of metallicity profiles traced by HII regions and Cepheids. Furthermore, the constraint effective yield of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies show broad consistency with the theoretical predictions from stellar chemical evolution model with a mass-loading factor of 0-2. These results support that the recent assembly of the Milky Way adheres to the leaky accretion disk scenario, bridging the disk formation of our home galaxy to the big picture of disk formation in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Binary population synthesis of the Galactic canonical pulsar population</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars that emit radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to gamma-rays. We use the rapid binary population synthesis suite COMPAS to model the Galactic population of canonical pulsars. We account for both radio and gamma-ray selection effects, as well as the motion of pulsars in the Galactic potential due to natal kicks. We compare our models to the catalogs of pulsars detected in the radio, and those detected in gamma-rays by Fermi, and find broad agreement with both populations. We reproduce the observed ratio of radio-loud to radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars. We further examine the possibility of low spin-down luminosity (Edot) pulsars emitting weak, unpulsed gamma-ray emission and attempt to match this with recent stacking results. We demonstrate that the apparent correlation between the latitude of a pulsar and its Edot arises due to natal kicks imparted to pulsars at birth, assuming that all pulsars are born in the Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Seven white dwarfs with circumstellar gas discs II: Tracing the composition of exoplanetary building blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This second paper presents an in-depth analysis of the composition of the planetary material that has been accreted onto seven white dwarfs with circumstellar dust and gas emission discs with abundances reported in Paper I. The white dwarfs are accreting planetary bodies with a wide range of oxygen, carbon, and sulfur volatile contents, including one white dwarf that shows the most enhanced sulfur abundance seen to date. Three white dwarfs show tentative evidence (2-3$\sigma$) of accreting oxygen-rich material, potentially from water-rich bodies, whilst two others are accreting dry, rocky material. One white dwarf is accreting a mantle-rich fragment of a larger differentiated body, whilst two white dwarfs show an enhancement in their iron abundance and could be accreting core-rich fragments. Whilst most planetary material accreted by white dwarfs display chondritic or bulk Earth-like compositions, these observations demonstrate that core-mantle differentiation, disruptive collisions, and the accretion of core-mantle differentiated material are important. Less than one percent of polluted white dwarfs host both observable circumstellar gas and dust. It is unknown whether these systems are experiencing an early phase in the disruption and accretion of planetary bodies, or alternatively if they are accreting larger planetary bodies. From this work there is no substantial evidence for significant differences in the accreted refractory abundance ratios for those white dwarfs with or without circumstellar gas, but there is tentative evidence for those with circumstellar gas discs to be accreting more water rich material which may suggest that volatiles accrete earlier in a gas-rich phase.</description>

      <title>Astrometry as a Tool for Discovering and Weighing Faint Companions to Nearby Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This tutorial covers the use of absolute astrometry, in particular from the combination of the Hipparcos and Gaia missions, to identify faint companions to nearby stars and to measure the masses and orbits of those companions. Absolute astrometry has been used with increasing success to discover new planets and brown dwarfs and to measure masses and orbits for systems with periods as long as centuries. This tutorial summarizes the nature of the underlying astrometric data, the approach typically used to fit orbits, and the assumptions about that data implicit throughout the process. It attempts to provide intuition for the sensitivity of astrometry as a function of stellar and companion properties and how the available constraints depend on the character and quantity of data available. This tutorial is written for someone with some background in astronomy but with no more than a minimal acquaintance with astrometry or orbit fitting.</description>

      <title>Detecting Planetary Oblateness in the Era of JWST: A Case Study of Kepler-167e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets may be rotationally flattened, and their oblateness thus provide useful information on their formation and evolution. Here we develop a new algorithm that can compute the transit light curve due to an oblate planet very efficiently and use it to study the detectability of planet oblateness (and spin obliquity) with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Using the Jupiter analog, Kepler-167e, as an example, we show that observations of a single transit with JWST are able to detect a Saturn-like oblateness ($f=0.1$) with high confidence, or set a stringent upper limit on the oblateness parameter, as long as the planetary spin is slightly misaligned ($\gtrsim 20^\circ$) with respect to its orbital direction. Based on known obliquity measurements and theoretical arguments, it is reasonable to believe that this level of misalignment may be common. We estimate the sensitivity limit of JWST in oblateness detections and highlight the importance of better characterizations of cold planets in planning future JWST transit observations. The potential to detect rings, moons, and atmospheric species of the cold giants with JWST is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from simultaneous FUV and NUV observations of T-Tauri stars (TTSs) in the Taurus molecular cloud with UVIT/AstroSat. This is the very first UVIT study of TTSs. From the spectral energy distribution of TTSs from FUV to near-IR, we show that classical TTSs (CTTSs) emit significantly higher UV excess compared to weak-line TTSs (WTTSs). The equivalent black-body temperatures corresponding to the UV excess in CTTSs ($&gt;10^4$ K) are also found to be relatively higher than that in WTTSs ($&lt;9250$ K). From the UV excess, we have re-classified two WTTSs (BS Tau, V836 Tau) as CTTSs, which has been supported by the follow-up optical spectroscopic study using the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), showing strong H$\alpha$ line emission. We find that CTTSs show strong excess emission in both FUV ($&gt;$10$^7$) and NUV ($&gt;$10$^3$) bands, while WTTSs show strong excess only in the FUV ($\lesssim$10$^5$), suggesting that excess emission in NUV can be used as a tool to classify the TTSs. We also find a linear correlation between UV luminosity (a primary indicator of mass accretion) and H$\alpha$ luminosity (a secondary indicator of mass accretion) with a slope of 1.20$\pm$0.22 and intercept of 2.16$\pm$0.70.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the type-III radiation observed near the Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05984v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\textit{AIMS.}$ (1) To use Parker Solar Probe (PSP) data to test the accepted theory that type-III radiation is produced by counter-streaming Langmuir waves that coalesce to produce the electromagnetic wave at twice the Langmuir frequency. (2) To use the new data obtained from the PSP to improve or modify the model of type-III wave generation.
  $\textit{METHODS.}$ To obtain new properties of the Langmuir wave and its harmonics, their phase velocities and density fluctuations were measured. If the harmonic wave was electromagnetic, as in the accepted theory, these quantities would not be measurable. However, in an electrostatic wave, they would be measurable by the PSP instruments.
  $\textit{RESULTS.}$ The Langmuir wave and its harmonics at frequencies of $n\omega_p$, where $\omega_p = 2\pi\times125$ kHz is the Langmuir frequency and $n \in \{ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$, were measured in an active type-III event. The lowest harmonics contained density fluctuations, so they were electrostatic waves and not type-III emissions. This result was bolstered by measuring their very slow phase velocities ($&lt; 20,000$ km/sec) which are not those of a type-III wave. Thus, the harmonic waves were not a result of the three-wave interaction (as required by the accepted theory) but they were electrostatic antenna waves produced by radiation of the Langmuir wave. As at least the first harmonic wave evolved through density irregularities, its wave number decreased and it became the electromagnetic wave that was the type-III radiation. It is also found that there is no evidence for or against the conventional model for generation of the type-III emissions.</description>

      <title>Type IV-like Solar Radio Burst Consisting of a Series of Spikes Observed by PSP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar and interplanetary radio bursts can reflect the existence and motion of energetic electrons and are therefore a kind of vital phenomenon in solar activities. The present study reported a solar radio burst (SRB) event observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) in its 8th orbital encounter phase, and it lasted about 20 hours in a frequency range of 0.5-15 MHz, called the type IV-like SRB. This type IV-like SRB consists of a series of numerous spikes with the center-frequency drifting slowly from ~5 MHz to ~1 MHz, and each individual spike appears a much faster frequency drifting and has a narrow frequency range of a few MHz and short duration of a few minutes. Based on the empirical models of the solar atmosphere adopted commonly, combining the in-situ measurement by PSP, we propose that these small-scale spikes were generated by a group of solitary kinetic Alfv\'en waves (SKAWs) in a magnetic loop accompanying coronal mass ejection (CME) and moving outwards, in which the frequency drifting of individual spike is caused by the SKAW's propagation and the center-frequency drifting may be attributed to the motion of the magnetic loop.</description>

      <title>Rotation and Abundances of the Benchmark Brown Dwarf HD 33632 Ab from Keck/KPIC High-resolution Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the projected rotational velocity and molecular abundances for HD 33632 Ab obtained via Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer high-resolution spectroscopy. HD 33632 Ab is a nearby benchmark brown dwarf companion at a separation of $\sim$20 au that straddles the L/T transition. Using a forward-modeling framework with on-axis host star spectra, self-consistent substellar atmospheric and retrieval models for HD 33632 Ab, we derive a projected rotational velocity of 53 $\pm$ 3 km/s and carbon/water mass fractions of log CO = $-$2.3 $\pm$ 0.3 and log H$_2$O = $-$2.7 $\pm$ 0.2. The inferred carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O = 0.58 $\pm$ 0.14), molecular abundances, and metallicity ([C/H] = 0.0 $\pm$ 0.2 dex) of HD 33632 Ab are consistent with its host star. Although detectable methane opacities are expected in L/T transition objects, we did not recover methane in our KPIC spectra, partly due to the high $v\sin{i}$ and to disequilibrium chemistry at the pressures we are sensitive to. We parameterize the spin as the ratio of rotation over break-up velocity, and compare HD 33632 Ab to a compilation of &gt;200 very low-mass objects (M$\lesssim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$) that have spin measurements in the literature. There appears to be no clear trend for the isolated field low-mass objects versus mass, but a tentative trend is identified for low-mass companions and directly imaged exoplanets, similar to previous findings. A larger sample of close-in gas giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs will critically examine our understanding of their formation and evolution through rotation and chemical abundance measurements.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project XI. No increase of mass-loss rates over the bistability region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of blue supergiants are key for constraining the end of the main sequence (MS) of massive stars. Whether the observed drop in the relative number of fast-rotating stars below $\sim$21$\,$kK is due to enhanced mass-loss rates at the location of the bistability jump, or the result of the end of the MS is still debated. Here, we combine newly derived estimates of photospheric and wind parameters with Gaia distances and wind terminal velocities from the literature to obtain upper limits on the mass-loss rates for a sample of 116 Galactic luminous blue supergiants. The parameter space covered by the sample ranges between 35-15$\,$kK in $T_{\rm eff}$ and 4.8-5.8$\,$dex in log(L/L$_{\odot}$). Our results show no increase in the mass-loss rates over the bistability jump. Therefore, we argue that the drop in rotational velocities cannot be explained by enhanced mass loss. Since a large jump in the mass-loss rates is commonly included in evolutionary models, we suggest an urgent revision of the currently used default prescriptions.</description>

      <title>M17 MIR: A Massive Star is Forming via Episodic Mass Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyzed the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 6 data for the outbursting massive protostar M17~MIR. The ALMA CO $J=2-1$ data reveal a collimated and bipolar north-south outflow from M17~MIR. The blue-shifted outflow exhibits four CO knots (N1 to N4) along the outflow axis, while the red-shifted outflow appears as a single knot (S1). The extremely high velocity (EHV) emissions of N1 and S1 are jet-like and contain sub-knots along the outflow axis. Assuming the nearest EHV sub-knots trace the ejecta from the accretion outbursts in the past decades, a tangential ejection velocity of $\sim421\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ is derived for M17~MIR. Assuming the same velocity, the dynamical times of the multiple ejecta, traced by the four blue-shifted CO knots, range from 20 to 364 years. The four blue-shifted CO knots imply four clustered accretion outbursts with a duration of tens of years in the past few hundred years. The intervals between the four clustered accretion outbursts are also about tens of years. These properties of the four clustered accretion outbursts are in line with the disk gravitational instability and fragmentation model. The episodic accretion history of M17~MIR traced by episodic outflow suggests that a massive star can form from a lower-mass protostar via frequent episodic accretion events triggered by disk gravitational instability and fragmentation. The first detection of the knotty outflow from an outbursting massive protostar suggests that mass ejections accompanied with accretion events could serve as an effective diagnostic tool for the episodic accretion histories of massive protostars.</description>

      <title>Probing the Dark Matter Capture Rate in a Local Population of Brown Dwarfs with IceCube Gen 2</title>

Abstract: This study explores the potential for dark matter annihilation within brown dwarfs, investigating an unconventional mechanism for neutrino production. Motivated by the efficient accumulation of dark matter particles in brown dwarfs through scattering interactions, we focus on a mass range above 10 GeV, considering dark matter annihilation channels $\chi \chi \rightarrow \nu \bar{\nu} \nu \bar{\nu}$ through long-lived mediators. Using the projected sensitivity of IceCube Generation 2, we assess the detection capability of the local population of brown dwarfs within 20 pc and exclude dark matter-nucleon scattering with cross-sections as low as a few multiples of $10^{-36}~\rm cm^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Temperature inversion in a non-homogeneous collisionless plasma with a thermal boundary: the temporal coarse-graining method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prompted by the relevant problem of temperature inversion (i.e. gradient of density anti-correlated to the gradient of temperature) in astrophysics, we introduce a novel method to model a gravitationally confined multi-component collisionless plasma in contact with a fluctuating thermal boundary. We focus on systems with anti-correlated (inverted) density and temperature profiles, with applications to solar physics. The dynamics of the plasma is analytically described via the coupling of an appropriated coarse-grained distribution function and temporally coarse-grained Vlasov dynamics. We derive a stationary solution of the system and predict the inverted density and temperature profiles of the two-species for scenarios relevant for the corona. We validate our method by comparing the analytical results with kinetic numerical simulations of the plasma dynamics in the context of the two-species Hamiltonian mean-field model (HMF). Finally, we apply our theoretical framework to the problem of the temperature inversion in the solar corona obtaining density and temperature profiles in remarkably good agreement with the observations.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive calculation of the Primakoff process and the solar axion flux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Primakoff process plays a crucial role in axion production in astrophysical environments and laboratories. Given the rising interest in axion physics and many on-going experimental activities, we conduct a comprehensive calculation of this process and carefully examine several aspects that have been neglected in the literature. In particular, our calculation is valid for axions with significantly large masses, which would be of importance to axion searches utilizing crystal and liquid xenon detectors. We present the most updated calculation of the Primakoff solar axion flux, with a simple parametrization that is applicable to a broad range of axion masses up to a few tens of keV. Our code is publicly available at GitHub.</description>

      <title>The Scaling Law in Stellar Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing time series of fluxes from stars, known as stellar light curves, can reveal valuable information about stellar properties. However, most current methods rely on extracting summary statistics, and studies using deep learning have been limited to supervised approaches. In this research, we investigate the scaling law properties that emerge when learning from astronomical time series data using self-supervised techniques. By employing the GPT-2 architecture, we show the learned representation improves as the number of parameters increases from $10^4$ to $10^9$, with no signs of performance plateauing. We demonstrate that a self-supervised Transformer model achieves 3-10 times the sample efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art supervised learning model when inferring the surface gravity of stars as a downstream task. Our research lays the groundwork for analyzing stellar light curves by examining them through large-scale auto-regressive generative models.</description>

      <title>On the Interacting/Active Lifetime of Supernova Fallback Disk around Isolated Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fallback disk model is widely accepted to explain long-period neutron stars (NSs) which can't be simulated by magnetic dipole radiation. However, no confirmed detection of disk was found from the newly discovered long period pulsars GLEAM-X 162759.5-523504.3, GPM J1839-10 and the known slowest isolated NSs 1E 161348-5055. This might be that the disks have either been in noninteracting/inactive state where its emission is too weak to be detected or have been disrupted. In this work, we conduct simulations to examine the lifetime of supernova fallback disks around isolated neutron stars. We assume that the disk's mass varies in a self-similar way and its interaction with the NS occurs only in interacting/active state. Our results reveal that nearly all the interacting lifetimes for the disk are shorter than 0.1 Myr while the existence lifetimes are considerably longer.</description>
