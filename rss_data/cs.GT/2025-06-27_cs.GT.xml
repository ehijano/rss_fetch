      <title>Smoothness Meets Autobidding: Tight Price of Anarchy Bounds for Simultaneous First-Price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online advertising systems have recently transitioned to autobidding, enabling advertisers to delegate bidding decisions to automated agents. Each advertiser directs their agent to optimize a valuation-dependent objective subject to return-on-investment (ROI) or budget constraints. Given their relevance, there has been a surge in literature studying the liquid welfare price of anarchy (POA) of core auction formats in autobidding, among which simultaneous first-price auctions (FPA). These models capture a large range of heterogeneous agent behaviors, requiring advanced proofs to derive tight POA bounds. Recently, Deng et al. (NeurIPS 2024) showed that the POA of FPA for mixed autobidders (i.e., value and utility maximizers) under ROI is 2.18 for additive valuations.
  We extend the smoothness framework of Syrgkanis and Tardos (STOC 2013) to autobidding. A key contribution is a technique to balance smoothness parameters across heterogeneous agent types. Finding the best POA bound reduces to solving a POA-revealing mathematical program. Our approach has three strengths: (1) Simplicity: We prove smoothness for single-item FPA. Results for simultaneous FPA follow via our theorem. For example, by showing smoothness for value and utility maximizers, we obtain the tight POA of 2.18 for mixed autobidding. (2) Extendibility: Our Extension Theorem adapts to simultaneous FPA with reserve prices and agents with fractionally subadditive valuations and heterogeneous payment sensitivities and target ROI parameters. We establish the first (mostly) tight POA bounds for several models beyond the autobidding state of the art. (3) Generality: Our framework bounds the POA of coarse correlated equilibria (CCE), which arise when hybrid agents employ regret-minimizing algorithms. Building on Kolumbus and Nisan (WWW 2022), we show that CCE from such agents have properties that keep their POA low.</description>

      <title>From multi-allocations to allocations, with subadditive valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of fair allocation of $m$ indivisible items to $n$ agents with monotone subadditive valuations. For integer $d \ge 2$, a $d$-multi-allocation is an allocation in which each item is allocated to at most $d$ different agents. We show that $d$-multi-allocations can be transformed into allocations, while not losing much more than a factor of $d$ in the value that each agent receives. One consequence of this result is that for allocation instances with equal entitlements and subadditive valuations, if $\rho$-MMS $d$-multi-allocations exist, then so do $\frac{\rho}{4d}$-MMS allocations. Combined with recent results of Seddighin and Seddighin [EC 2025], this implies the existence of $\Omega(\frac{1}{\log\log n})$-MMS allocations.</description>

      <title>The Devil's Dung? Money as a mechanism of generalized reciprocity in human societies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: St. Francis of Assisi (1181/82-1226) famously called money the devil's dung, and indeed money is often associated with greed, inequality, and corruption. Drawing on Nowak's five rules for the evolution of cooperation, we argue here that money promotes the formation of circuits of generalized reciprocity across human groups that are fundamental to social evolution. In an evolutionary tournament, we show that money exchange is an evolutionary stable strategy that promotes cooperation without relying on the cognitive demands of direct reciprocity or reputation mechanisms. However, we also find that excessive liquidity can be detrimental because it can distort the informational value of money as a signal of past cooperation, making defection more profitable. Our results suggest that, in addition to institutions that promoted trust and punishment, the emergence of institutions that regulated the money supply was key to maintaining generalized reciprocity within and across human groups.</description>

      <title>Rational Miner Behaviour, Protocol Stability, and Time Preference: An Austrian and Game-Theoretic Analysis of Bitcoin's Incentive Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper integrates Austrian capital theory with repeated game theory to examine strategic miner behaviour under different institutional conditions in blockchain systems. It shows that when protocol rules are mutable, effective time preference rises, undermining rational long-term planning and cooperative equilibria. Using formal game-theoretic analysis and Austrian economic principles, the paper demonstrates how mutable protocols shift miner incentives from productive investment to political rent-seeking and influence games. The original Bitcoin protocol is interpreted as an institutional anchor: a fixed rule-set enabling calculability and low time preference. Drawing on the work of Bohm-Bawerk, Mises, and Hayek, the argument is made that protocol immutability is essential for restoring strategic coherence, entrepreneurial confidence, and sustainable network equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Institutional Noise, Strategic Deviation, and Intertemporal Collapse: A Formal Model of Miner Behaviour under Protocol Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a formal game-theoretic model to examine how protocol mutability disrupts cooperative mining behaviour in blockchain systems. Using a repeated game framework with stochastic rule shocks, we show that even minor uncertainty in institutional rules increases time preference and induces strategic deviation. Fixed-rule environments support long-term investment and stable equilibrium strategies; in contrast, mutable protocols lead to short-termism, higher discounting, and collapse of coordinated engagement. Simulation results identify instability zones in the parameter space where rational mining gives way to extractive or arbitrage conduct. These findings support an Austrian economic interpretation: calculability requires rule stability. Institutional noise undermines the informational basis for productive action. We conclude that protocol design must be treated as a constitutional economic constraint, not a discretionary variable, if sustainable cooperation is to emerge in decentralised systems.</description>

      <title>Markets with Heterogeneous Agents: Dynamics and Survival of Bayesian vs. No-Regret Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of heterogeneous learning agents in asset markets with stochastic payoffs. Our main focus is on comparing Bayesian learners and no-regret learners who compete in markets and identifying the conditions under which each approach is more effective. Surprisingly, we find that low regret is not sufficient for survival: an agent can have regret as low as $O(\log T)$ but still vanish when competing against a Bayesian with a finite prior and any positive prior probability on the correct model. On the other hand, we show that Bayesian learning is fragile, while no-regret learning requires less knowledge of the environment and is therefore more robust. Motivated by the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, we propose a balanced strategy for utilizing Bayesian updates that improves robustness and adaptability to distribution shifts, providing a step toward a best-of-both-worlds learning approach. The method is general, efficient, and easy to implement. Finally, we formally establish the relationship between the notions of survival and market dominance studied in economics and the framework of regret minimization, thus bridging these theories. More broadly, our work contributes to the understanding of dynamics with heterogeneous types of learning agents and their impact on markets.</description>

      <title>The Weihrauch degree of finding Nash equilibria in multiplayer games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.00972v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is there an algorithm that takes a game in normal form as input, and outputs a Nash equilibrium? If the payoffs are integers, the answer is yes, and lot of work has been done in its computational complexity. If the payoffs are permitted to be real numbers, the answer is no, for continuity reasons. It is worthwhile to investigate the precise degree of non-computability (the Weihrauch degree), since knowing the degree entails what other approaches are available (eg, is there a randomized algorithm with positive success change?). The two player case has already been fully classified, but the multiplayer case remains open and is addressed here. Our approach involves classifying the degree of finding roots of polynomials, and lifting this to systems of polynomial inequalities via cylindrical algebraic decomposition.</description>

      <title>The Autonomy of the Lightning Network: A Mathematical and Economic Proof of Structural Decoupling from BTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a formal analysis of the Lightning Network as a monetary system structurally diverging from Bitcoin's base-layer settlement model. We demonstrate that under increasing transaction demand, BTC transaction fees rise superlinearly due to throughput constraints, while Lightning Network routing costs approach a bounded asymptote. Using mathematical modeling, game-theoretic proofs, and complexity analysis, we show that Lightning enables indefinite off-chain operation via the emergence of liquidity hub oligopolies. These hubs exhibit properties of unregulated financial intermediaries, including rent extraction, opacity, and systemic fragility. Strategic agent models show that channel closure becomes economically infeasible, and routing problems approach hardness limits in P-Space complexity. We conclude that Lightning does not merely extend Bitcoin, but constitutes a synthetic financial system with shadowbank characteristics, lacking reserve discipline, transparency, or enforceable settlement guarantees.</description>
