      <title>Composable Generation Strategy Framework Enabled Bidirectional Design on Topological Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators show important properties, such as topological phase transitions and topological edge states. Although these properties and phenomena can be simulated by well-designed circuits, it is undoubtedly difficult to design such topological circuits due to the complex physical principles and calculations involved. Therefore, achieving a framework that can automatically to complete bidirectional design of topology circuits is very significant. Here, we propose an effective bidirectional collaborative design framework with strong task adaptability, which can automatically generate specific results according to our requirements. In the framework, a composable generation strategy is employed, which involves building a shared multimodal space by bridging alignment in the diffusion process. For simplicity, a series of two-dimensional (2D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuits are constructed with different structural parameters. The framework at first is applied to find the relationship between the structural information and topological features. Then, the correctness of the results through experimental measurements can be verified by the automatically generated circuit diagram following the manufacture of Printed Circuit Board (PCB). The framework is demonstrated by achieving good results in the reverse design of circuit structures and forward prediction of topological edge states, reaching an accuracy of 94%. Overall, our research demonstrates the enormous potential of the proposed bidirectional deep learning framework in complex tasks and provides insights for collaborative design tasks.</description>

      <title>Complementary two dimensional carrier profiles of 4H-SiC MOSFETs by Scanning Spreading Resistance Microscopy and Scanning Capacitance Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports the results presented in an invited poster during the International Conference on Silicon Carbide and Related Materials (ICSCRM) 2023 held in Sorrento, Italy. The suitability of scanning probe methods based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements is explored to investigate with high spatial resolution the elementary cell of 4H-SiC power MOSFETs. The two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional maps demonstrated a high spatial resolution of about 5 nm using the SSRM capabilities. Furthermore, the SCM capabilities enabled visualizing the fluctuations of charge carrier concentration across the different parts of the MOSFETs elementary cell.</description>

      <title>A new extremely ultrathin metasurface energy harvester and its simple modelling based on resonant half-wave dipole antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel design approach for an ultrathin metasurface energy harvester based on a surrogate model of dipole antenna. A significant advantage of this idea is the reduction of the time of the design process retrieved from a surrogate model of the resonant half-wave dipole antenna embedded in a medium. However, the design of a new electromagnetic energy harvester with a deep-subwavelength thickness (~ 0.004{\lambda}) is the major concern of this work. The proposed structure shows an enhanced level of absorption. Decreasing the thickness of metasurface as a new classification of energy harvester, we have managed to demonstrate the stability of the efficiency. In addition, this metasurface energy harvester proved to maintain a relatively constant performance (efficiency and HPBW more than 85% and 7%, respectively) as the angle of the EM incident wave was changed over a range of 75 degrees in the transverse magnetic (TM) polarization.</description>

      <title>Conformal Wide-Angle Scanning Leaky-Wave Antenna for V-Band On-Body Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable on-body millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars can provide obstacle detection and guidance for visually impaired people. However, their everyday performance is hindered by the rigid form factor and limited scanning range. In this article, we propose a low-profile, fast-scanning leaky-wave antenna (LWA) operating in the unlicensed V-band (57-64 GHz) to be integrated for on-body applications such as lightweight portable frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars. The proposed LWA consists of meandering microstrips that can conform to the human body curvatures while maintaining beam-forming and beam-scanning properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the planar LWA achieves a realized gain above 10 dB with a fan-beam steering range in the H-plane from -40{\deg} to 43{\deg} over the operating frequency band while the half power beam-width (HPBW) is within 20{\deg}. Since for the foreseen application the antenna is supposed to conform to the user's body, the performance is also analyzed for a bent condition. The beam steering range changes to -32{\deg} to 50{\deg} when placed on the knee (corresponding to 80 mm radius). Under bending conditions, the LWA exhibits a maximum degradation of 1.75 dB, while the HPBW increases to 25{\deg}. This shows that due to the small size of the antenna, the impact of bending is low and the beam-forming and beam-scanning property of the designed LWA remain intact. Furthermore, we enable 2-D spatial scanning by employing an array of twelve LWAs with phased excitation, extending the scanning range in the E-plane from -40{\deg} to 40{\deg}, while the HPBW remains below 20{\deg} across the operational frequency range.</description>

      <title>The novel properties of SF$_6$ for directional dark matter experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:1609.05249v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SF$_{6}$ is an inert and electronegative gas that has a long history of use in high voltage insulation and numerous other industrial applications. Although SF$_{6}$ is used as a trace component to introduce stability in tracking chambers, its highly electronegative properties have limited its use in tracking detectors. In this work we present a series of measurements with SF$_{6}$ as the primary gas in a low pressure Time Projection Chamber (TPC), with a thick GEM used as the avalanche and readout device. The first results of an $^{55}$Fe energy spectrum in SF$_{6}$ are presented. Measurements of the mobility and longitudinal diffusion confirm the negative ion drift of SF$_{6}$. However, the observed waveforms have a peculiar but interesting structure that indicates multiple drift species and a dependence on the reduced field ($E/p$), as well as on the level of water vapor contamination. The discovery of a distinct secondary peak in the waveform, together with its identification and use for fiducializing events in the TPC, are also presented. Our measurements demonstrate that SF$_{6}$ is an ideal gas for directional dark matter detection. In particular, the high fluorine content is desirable for spin-dependent sensitivity, negative ion drift ensures low diffusion over large drift distances, and the multiple species of charge carriers allow for full detector fiducialization.</description>

      <title>A study of DC electrical breakdown in liquid helium through analysis of the empirical breakdown field distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.08844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report results from a study on electrical breakdown in liquid helium using near-uniform-field stainless steel electrodes with a stressed area of $\sim$0.725 cm$^2$. The distribution of the breakdown field is obtained for temperatures between 1.7 K and 4.0 K, pressures between the saturated vapor pressure and 626 Torr, and with electrodes of different surface polishes. A data-based approach for determining the electrode-surface-area scaling of the breakdown field is presented. The dependence of the breakdown probability on the field strength as extracted from the breakdown field distribution data is used to show that breakdown is a surface phenomenon closely correlated with Fowler-Nordheim field emission from asperities on the cathode. We show that the results from this analysis provides an explanation for the supposed electrode gap-size effect and also allows for a determination of the breakdown-field distribution for arbitrary shaped electrodes. Most importantly, the analysis method presented in this work can be extended to other noble liquids to explore the dependencies for electrical breakdown in those media.</description>

      <title>Double Etch Method for the Fabrication of Nanophotonic Devices from Van der Waals Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of van der Waals (vdW) materials into photonic devices has laid out a foundation for many new quantum and optoelectronic applications. Despite tremendous progress in the nanofabrication of photonic building blocks from vdW crystals, there are still limitations, specifically with large-area devices and masking. Here, we focus on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as a vdW material and present a double etch method that overcomes problems associated with methods that employ metallic films and resist-based films for masking. Efficacy of the developed protocol is demonstrated by designing and fabricating a set of functional photonic components including waveguides, ring resonators and photonic crystal cavities. The functionality of the fabricated structures is demonstrated through optical characterization over several key spectral ranges. These include the near-infrared and blue ranges, where the hBN boron vacancy (VB-) spin defects and the coherent B center quantum emitters emit, respectively. The double etch method enables fabrication of high-quality factor optical cavities and constitutes a promising pathway toward on-chip integration of vdW materials.</description>

      <title>Atomistic evolution of active sites in multi-component heterogeneous catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-component metal nanoparticles (NPs) are of paramount importance in the chemical industry, as most processes therein employ heterogeneous catalysts. While these multi-component systems have been shown to result in higher product yields, improved selectivities, and greater stability through catalytic cycling, the structural dynamics of these materials in response to various stimuli (e.g. temperature, adsorbates, etc.) are not understood with atomistic resolution. Here, we present a highly accurate equivariant machine-learned force field (MLFF), constructed from ab initio training data collected using Bayesian active learning, that is able to reliably simulate PdAu surfaces and NPs in response to thermal treatment as well as exposure to reactive H$_2$ atmospheres. We thus provide a single model that is able to reliably describe the full space of geometric and chemical complexity for such a heterogeneous catalytic system across single crystals, gas-phase interactions, and NPs reacting with H$_2$, including catalyst degradation and explicit reactivity. Ultimately, we provide direct atomistic evidence that verifies existing experimental hypotheses for bimetallic catalyst deactivation under reaction conditions, namely that Pd preferentially segregates into the Au bulk through aggressive catalytic cycling and that this degradation is site-selective, as well as the reactivity for hydrogen exchange as a function of Pd ensemble size. We demonstrate that understanding of the atomistic evolution of these active sites is of the utmost importance, as it allows for design and control of material structure and corresponding performance, which can be vetted in silico.</description>

      <title>Surface roughening in nanoparticle catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supported metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts are vital for the sustainable production of chemicals, but their design and implementation are limited by the ability to identify and characterize their structures and atomic sites that are correlated with high catalytic activity. Identification of these ''active sites'' has relied heavily on extrapolation to supported NP systems from investigation of idealized surfaces, experimentally using single crystals or supported NPs which are always modelled computationally using slab or regular polyhedra models. However, the ability of these methods to predict catalytic activity remains qualitative at best, as the structure of metal NPs in reactive environments has only been speculated from indirect experimental observations, or otherwise remains wholly unknown. Here, by circumventing these limitations for highly accurate simulation methods, we provide direct atomistic insight into the dynamic restructuring of metal NPs by combining in situ spectroscopy with molecular dynamics simulations powered by a machine learned force field. We find that in reactive environments, NP surfaces evolve to a state with poorly defined atomic order, while the core of the NP may remain bulk-like. These insights prove that long-standing conceptual models based on idealized faceting for small metal NP systems are not representative of real systems under exposure to reactive environments. We show that the resultant structure can be elucidated by combining advanced spectroscopy and computational tools. This discovery exemplifies that to enable faithful quantitative predictions of catalyst function and stability, we must move beyond idealized-facet experimental and theoretical models and instead employ systems which include realistic surface structures that respond to relevant physical and chemical conditions.</description>

      <title>Measuring kinetic inductance and superfluid stiffness of two-dimensional superconductors using high-quality transmission-line resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of van der Waals superconductors in recent years has generated a lot of excitement for their potentially novel pairing mechanisms. However, their typical atomic-scale thickness and micrometer-scale lateral dimensions impose severe challenges to investigations of pairing symmetry by conventional methods. In this report we demonstrate a new technique that employs high-quality-factor superconducting resonators to measure the kinetic inductance -- up to a part per million -- and loss of a van der Waals superconductor. We analyze the equivalent circuit model to extract the kinetic inductance, superfluid stiffness, penetration depth, and ratio of imaginary and real parts of the complex conductivity. We validate the technique by measuring aluminum and finding excellent agreement in both the zero-temperature superconducting gap as well as the complex conductivity data when compared with BCS theory. We then demonstrate the utility of the technique by measuring the kinetic inductance of multi-layered niobium diselenide and discuss the limits to the accuracy of our technique when the transition temperature of the sample, NbSe$_2$ at 7.06 K, approaches our Nb probe resonator at 8.59 K. Our method will be useful for practitioners in the growing fields of superconducting physics, materials science, and quantum sensing, as a means of characterizing superconducting circuit components and studying pairing mechanisms of the novel superconducting states which arise in layered 2D materials and heterostructures.</description>
