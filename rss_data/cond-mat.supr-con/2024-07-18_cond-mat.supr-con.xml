      <title>Optimizing one dimensional superconducting diodes: Interplay of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) refers to the non-reciprocal nature of the critical current (maximum current that a superconductor can withstand before turning into a normal metal) of a superconducting device. Here, we investigate SDE in helical superconductors with broken inversion and time-reversal symmetry, focusing on a prototypical Rashba nanowire device proximitized by an s-wave superconductor and subjected to external magnetic fields. Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field formalism, we analyze the interplay between linear and higher-order spin-orbit coupling (SOC), bulk supercurrents, and external magnetic fields. Our results demonstrate that Rashba nanowires with only linear SOC can achieve incredibly large diode efficiencies &gt; 45% through the interplay of longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields. Notably, higher-order SOC introduces qualitatively different behavior, enabling finite diode efficiency even in the absence of a longitudinal Zeeman field due to inherent energy dispersion asymmetry. We present a comprehensive phase diagram of the device elucidating the emergent Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting state and demonstrate that proximitized Rashba nanowires offer a versatile, practical platform for SDE, with potential realizations in existing material systems. These results provide crucial insights for optimizing SDE in nanoscale superconducting devices, paving the way for next-generation dissipationless quantum electronics.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the quasiparticle behaviour in the pressure-induced high-$T_c$ phase of an iron-chalcogenide superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity of iron chalocogenides is strongly enhanced under applied pressure yet its underlying pairing mechanism remains elusive. Here, we present a quantum oscillations study up to 45 T in the high-$T_c$ phase of tetragonal FeSe$_{0.82}$S$_{0.18}$ up to 22 kbar. Under applied pressure, the quasi-two dimensional multiband Fermi surface expands and the effective masses remain large, whereas the superconductivity displays a three-fold enhancement. Comparing with chemical pressure tuning of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, the Fermi surface enlarges in a similar manner but the effective masses and $T_c$ are suppressed. These differences may be attributed to the changes in the density of states influenced by the chalcogen height, which could promote stronger spin fluctuations pairing under pressure. Furthermore, our study also reveals unusual scattering and broadening of superconducting transitions in the high-pressure phase, indicating the presence of a complex pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Paramagnetic limit of spin-triplet superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase diagram of spin-triplet superconductors, considering the effect of the external magnetic field on the electrons' spins. For a given symmetry of the order parameter and a generic orientation of the field, we find that the paramagnetic limit for superconductivity diverges at low temperatures. Furthermore, we identify a range of temperatures where the transition between normal and superconducting phases becomes of the first order. When two tricritical points exist along the transition line, a first order phase transition between two superconducting phases may develop in vicinity of the tricritical point with lower temperature. We discuss the implications of our findings for the anisotropy of the upper critical field in UPt$_3$, a candidate material for triplet superconductivity, when both the paramagnetic and orbital effects are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Negligible Normal Fluid in Superconducting State of Heavily Overdoped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ Detected by Ultra-Low Temperature Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high temperature cuprate superconductors, it was found that in the overdoped region the superfluid density decreases with the increase of hole doping. One natural question is whether there exists normal fluid in the superconducting state in the overdoped region. In this paper, we have carried out high-resolution ultra-low temperature laser-based angle-resolved photoemission measurements on a heavily overdoped Bi2212 sample with a $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of 48 K. We find that this heavily overdoped Bi2212 remains in the strong coupling regime with $2 \mathit{\Delta}_0 / k_{\mathrm{B}} T_{\mathrm{c}}=5.8$. The single-particle scattering rate is very small along the nodal direction ($\sim$5 meV) and increases as the momentum moves from the nodal to the antinodal regions. A hard superconducting gap opening is observed near the antinodal region with the spectral weight at the Fermi level fully suppressed to zero. The normal fluid is found to be negligibly small in the superconducting state of this heavily overdoped Bi2212. These results provide key information to understand the high $T_\mathrm{c}$ mechanism in the cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>High-quality poor man's Majorana bound states from cavity embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poor man's Majorana Bound States (MBS) arise in minimal Kitaev chains when the parameters are fine-tuned to a sweet spot. We consider an interacting two-site Kitaev chain coupled to a single-mode cavity and show that the sweet spot condition can be controlled with the cavity frequency and the hopping between sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that photon-mediated effective interactions can be used to screen intrinsic interactions, improving the original quality of the MBS. We describe experimental signatures in the cavity transmission to detect their presence and quality. Our work proposes a new way to tune poor man's MBS in a quantum dot array coupled to a cavity.</description>

      <title>Theory of phonon spectroscopy with the quantum twisting microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of probing phonon modes of van-der-Waals materials using the quantum twisting microscope. While elastic tunneling dominates the tunneling current at small twist angles, the momentum mismatch between the K-points of tip and sample at large twist angles can only be bridged by inelastic scattering. This allows for probing phonon dispersions along certain lines in reciprocal space by measuring the tunneling current as a function of twist angle and bias voltage. We illustrate this modality of the quantum twisting microscope by developing a systematic theory for graphene-graphene junctions. We show that beyond phonon dispersions, the tunneling current also encodes the strength of electron-phonon couplings. Extracting the coupling strengths for individual phonon modes requires careful consideration of various inelastic tunneling processes. These processes are associated with the intralayer and interlayer electron-phonon couplings and appear at different orders in a perturbative calculation of the tunneling current. We find that the dominant process depends on the particular phonon mode under consideration. Our results inform the quest to understand the origin of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene and provide a case study for quantum-twisting-microscope investigations of collective modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we conclusively demonstrate that Density Functional Perturbation Theory calculations of phonon linewidths are not affected by overscreening issues. Additionally, we present an exact formula designed to incorporate nonadiabatic and correlation effects while ensuring the positivity of the linewidths. Finally, we extend the treatment to nonequilibrium scenarios and offer a rigorous justification for employing the phononic Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>Fractional Wannier Orbitals and Tight-Binding Gauge Fields for Kitaev Honeycomb Superlattices with Flat Majorana Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional excitations offer vast potential for both fundamental physics and quantum technologies. However, their dynamics under the influence of gauge fields pose a significant challenge to conventional models. Here, we investigate the evolution of low-energy Majorana dispersions across various crystalline phases of the \pi-flux in the Kitaev spin model on a honeycomb lattice. We develop an effective tight-binding description for these low-energy Majorana fermions, introducing a gauge potential through a superexchange-like interaction that systematically eliminates the high-energy spectrum. We identify conditions under which this superexchange interaction acts as a Z2 gauge field, governing the tight-binding hopping of Majorana Wannier orbitals. Our study reveals an intriguing phase transition between two non-trivial topological phases characterized by gapless flat-band (extensive) degeneracy. To further explore flat band physics, we introduce a mean-field theory describing a gauge-invariant Majorana density-wave order within these bands. The resulting split Chern bands facilitate the partial filling of Chern bands, effectively leading to fractional Chern states. Our work, encompassing both the gauge-mediated tight-binding model and the mean-field theory, opens doors for future exploration of $U(1)$, $SU(N)$ gauge-mediated tight-binding approach to other fractional or entangled Wannier excitations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Coulomb Blockade as a Signature of the Sign-Reversing Cooper Pairing Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coulomb blockade occurs for electrons tunneling into nanoislands because of the quantization of charge. Here, using spectroscopy measurements of nonmagnetic islands grown on a high-Tc superconductor [one-unit-cell (1-UC) FeSe], we systematically investigate the dynamical Coulomb blockade (DCB), which is found to reflect the Cooper pairing potential in the superconducting substrate. The tunneling spectra are acquired on single-crystalline Pb nanoislands and show a clear suppression of the tunnel current around zero bias-voltage with a gap-like structure. The observed spectral gaps can be attributed to DCB based on our comprehensive investigations, including experiments with finely varying island sizes and calculations of the spectra using the P(E) theory of DCB. Our detailed analysis suggests that the observed DCB can be related to the sign-reversing pairing potential in the 1-UC FeSe substrate below the islands. The sign reversal is furthermore revealed in a transition of the superconducting gap of FeSe from a U- to a V-like lineshape as the distance between neighboring doublet islands is decreased, indicating the presence of a nodal-like gap as expected for a sign-reversing superconductor. Our configuration of nonmagnetic nanoislands on a high-Tc superconductor for spectroscopy measurements may serve as a local, spatially sensitive, and tunable probe for detecting the sign-reversing order parameter in unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless to BCS-like superconducting transition crossover driven by weak magnetic fields in ultra-thin NbN films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in ultra-thin NbN films is investigated in the presence of weak perpendicular magnetic fields. A jump in the phase stiffness at the BKT transition is detected up to 5 G, while the BKT features are smeared between 5 G and 50 G, disappearing altogether at 100 G, where conventional current-voltage behaviour is observed. Our findings demonstrate that weak magnetic fields, insignificant in bulk systems, deeply affect our ultra-thin system, promoting a crossover from Halperin-Nelson fluctuations to a BCS-like state with Ginzburg-Landau fluctuations, as the field increases. This behavior is related to field-induced free vortices that screen the vortex-antivortex interaction and smear the BKT transition.</description>

Abstract: Optimal choice of spin polarization enables electron injection into the helical edge state at a precise position, despite the uncertainty principle, permitting access to specific nonlocal Green's functions. We show, within 1D effective description, that this fact facilitates a direct identification of odd-frequency pairing through parity measurement (under frequency reversal) of the nonlocal differential conductance in a setup comprising the Josephson junction on the helical edge state of a 2D topological insulator with two spin-polarized probes tunnel-coupled to the junction region. A 2D numerical simulation has also been conducted to confirm theoretical predictions as well as to demonstrate the experimental feasibility of the proposal.</description>

      <title>Influence of trapped magnetic field of Sn-Pb solders on electrical resistivity measurement: an example of superconducting transition of Sn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examined the affection of the flux-trapped states of Sn60-Pb40 solders on superconducting properties of a Sn wire. The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity at H = 0 Oe after zero-field cooling (ZFC) showed a sharp superconducting transition at T = 3.7 K. In contrast, that after field cooling (FC) resulted in broadening of the transition. The difference between ZFC and FC data evidences critical affection of trapped fluxes at solders on superconducting states. We propose that, in electrical measurements where magnetic fields of several hundred Oe are critical, field experience should be seriously considered when using solders.</description>
