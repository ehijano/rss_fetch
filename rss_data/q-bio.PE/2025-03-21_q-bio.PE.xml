      <title>Optimal Vaccination Strategies for an Heterogeneous SIS Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in a general mathematical framework the optimal allocation of vaccine in an heterogeneous population. We cast the problem of optimal vaccination as a bi-objective minimization problem min(C($\eta$),L($\eta$)), where C and L stand respectively for the cost and the loss incurred when following the vaccination strategy $\eta$, where the function $\eta$(x) represents the proportion of non-vaccinated among individuals of feature x.To measure the loss, we consider either the effective reproduction number, a classical quantity appearing in many models in epidemiology, or the overall proportion of infected individuals after vaccination in the maximal equilibrium, also called the endemic state. We only make few assumptions on the cost C($\eta$), which cover in particular the uniform cost, that is, the total number of vaccinated people.The analysis of the bi-objective problem is carried in a general framework, and we check that it is well posed for the SIS model and has Pareto optima, which can be interpreted as the ``best'' vaccination strategies. We provide properties of the corresponding Pareto frontier given by the outcomes (C($\eta$), L($\eta$)) of Pareto optimal strategies.</description>

      <title>Aging and mortality of persons with HIV: a novel Kalman Filtering and DMD framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the widespread availability of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, average lifespans of persons with HIV (PWH) in the United States have increased significantly in recent decades. In turn, the demographic profile of PWH has shifted. Older persons comprise an ever-increasing percentage of PWH, with this percentage expected to further increase in the coming years. This has profound implications for HIV treatment and care, as significant resources are required not only to manage HIV itself, but associated age-related comorbidities and health conditions that occur in aging PWH. Effective management of these challenges in the coming years requires accurate modeling of the PWH age structure. In the present work, we introduce several novel mathematical approaches related to this problem. We present a workflow combining a PDE model for the PWH population age structure, into which publicly-available HIV surveillance data is assimilated using the Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm. This procedure allows us to rigorously reconstruct the age-dependent mortality trends for PWH over the last several decades. To project future trends, we introduce and analyze a novel variant of the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), nonnegative DMD. We show that nonnegative DMD provides physically-consistent projections of mortality and HIV diagnosis while remaining purely data-driven, and not requiring additional assumptions. We then combine these elements to provide forecasts for future trends in PWDH mortality and demographic evolution in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Genome evolution in an endangered freshwater mussel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nearly neutral theory predicts that evolutionary processes will differ in small populations compared to large populations, a key point of concern for endangered species. The nearly-neutral threshold, the span of neutral variation, and the adaptive potential from new mutations all differ depending on N_e. To determine how genomes respond in small populations, we have created a reference genome for a US federally endangered IUCN Red List freshwater mussel, Elliptio spinosa, and compare it to genetic variation for a common and successful relative, Elliptio crassidens. We find higher rates of background duplication rates in E. spinosa consistent with proposed theories of duplicate gene accumulation according to nearly-neutral processes. Along with these changes we observe fewer cases of adaptive gene family amplification in this endangered species. However, TE content is not consistent with nearly-neutral theory. We observe substantially less recent TE proliferation in the endangered species with over 500 Mb of newly copied TEs in Elliptio crassidens. These results suggest a more complex interplay between TEs and duplicate genes than previously proposed for small populations. They further suggest that TEs and duplications require greater attention in surveys of genomic health for endangered species.</description>
