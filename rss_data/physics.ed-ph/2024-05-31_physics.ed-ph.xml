      <title>Bringing Lecture-Tutorials Online: An Analysis of A New Strategy to Teach Planet Formation in the Undergraduate Classroom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies conclusively show that pencil-and-paper lecture-tutorials (LTs) are incredibly effective at increasing student engagement and learning gains on a variety of topics when compared to traditional lecture. LTs in astronomy are post-lecture activities developed with the intention of helping students engage with conceptual and reasoning difficulties around a specific topic with the end goal of them developing a more expert-like understanding of astrophysical concepts. To date, all astronomy LTs have been developed for undergraduate courses taught in-person. Increases in online course enrollments and the COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the need for additional interactive, research-based, curricular materials designed for online classrooms. To this end, we developed and assessed the efficacy of an innovative, interactive LT designed to teach planet formation in asynchronous, online, introductory astronomy courses for undergraduates. We utilized the Planet Formation Concept Inventory to compare learning outcomes between courses that implemented the new online, interactive LT, and those that used either a lecture-only approach or utilized a standard pencil-and-paper LT on the same topic. Overall, learning gains from the standard pencil-and-paper LT were statistically indistinguishable from the in-person implementation of the online LT and both of these conditions outperformed the lecture-only condition. However, when implemented asynchronously, learning gains from the online LT were lower and not significantly above the lecture-only condition. While improvements can be made to improve the online LT in the future, the current discipline ideas still outperform traditional lecture, and can be used as a tool to teach planet formation effectively.</description>

      <title>Teaching the apparent motion of Sun and stars across four European countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the European Erasmus+ project Teaching ASTronomy at the Educational level (TASTE), we investigated the extent to which a learning module at school and a set of activities during a planetarium visit help students to gain insight in the Apparent Motion of the Sun and Stars. Therefore, we have set up a two treatment study with a pretest posttest design. In the four participating countries (Belgium, Germany, Greece and Italy), secondary school students studied the concept of the celestial globe at school using newly designed learning materials. By using a latent class analysis, we identified different classes of student answers on the AMoSS test. We show how students evolve from one class to another between pretest and posttest. Overall the results of the pretest and posttest show that a good understanding of the different aspects of the apparent motion of celestial bodies is difficult to achieve.</description>

      <title>Statistically equivalent models with different causal structures: An example from physics identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a statistical method widely used in educational research to investigate relationships between variables. SEM models are typically constructed based on theoretical foundations and assessed through fit indices. However, a well-fitting SEM model alone is not sufficient to verify the causal inferences underlying the proposed model, as there are statistically equivalent models with distinct causal structures that equally well fit the data. Therefore, it is crucial for researchers using SEM to consider statistically equivalent models and to clarify why the proposed model is more accurate than the equivalent ones. However, many SEM studies did not explicitly address this important step, and no prior study in physics education research has delved into potential methods for distinguishing statistically equivalent models with differing causal structures. In this study, we use physics identity model as an example to discuss the importance of considering statistically equivalent models and how other data can help to distinguish them. Previous research has identified three dimensions of physics identity: perceived recognition, self-efficacy, and interest. However, the relationships between these dimensions have not been thoroughly understood. In this paper, we specify a model with perceived recognition predicting self-efficacy and interest, which is inspired by individual interviews with students in physics courses to make physics learning environments equitable and inclusive. We test our model with fit indices and discuss its statistically equivalent models with different causal inferences among perceived recognition, self-efficacy, and interest. We then discuss potential experiments that could further empirically test the causal inferences underlying the models, aiding the refinement to a more accurate causal model for guiding educational improvements.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Discourse Group Roles in Inquiry-based University Science Labs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group work is commonly adopted in university science laboratories. In this study, we characterize student discourse group roles in inquiry-based science labs. The instructional context for the study was a summer program hosted at a private research university in the eastern United States. The program was designed as a bridge program for matriculating students who were first generation and/or deaf or hard-of-hearing (DHH). Accommodations such as interpreters and technology were provided for DHH students. We analyzed 15 students' discourse moves in five lab activities from the video recordings, resulting in a total of 40 student-lab units. We developed codes to describe student discourse moves: asking a question, proposing an idea, participating in discussion, chatting off-task, and talking to instructor. Through a cluster analysis using those 40 student-lab units on our quantified discourse moves, we identified four discourse styles, high on-task high social, high on-task low social, low on-task low social, and low on-task high social. The results show that individual students tend to demonstrate varying discourse styles in different lab activities; students' discourse styles within the same groups tend to be aligned with their group members. Moreover, no difference was observed in discourse styles between genders, but DHH students were observed to participate significantly less in group discourse. The findings suggest that group-level interventions that specifically target discourse are needed to promote productive and equitable small-group discourse in university science labs.</description>

      <title>Geometric Visualizations of Single and Entangled Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bloch Sphere visualization of the possible states of a single qubit has proved a useful pedagogical and conceptual tool as a one-to-one map between qubit states and points in a 3-D space. However, understanding many important concepts of quantum mechanics, such as entanglement, requires developing intuitions about states with a minimum of two qubits, which map one-to-one to unvisualizable spaces of 6 dimensions and higher. In this paper we circumvent this visualization issue by creating maps of subspaces of 1- and 2-qubit systems that quantitatively and qualitatively encode properties of these states in their geometries. For the 1-qubit case, the subspace approach allows one to visualize how mixed states relate to different choices of measurement in a basis-independent way and how to read off the entries in a density matrix representation of these states from lengths in a simple diagram. For the 2-qubit case, a toroidal map of 2-qubit states illuminates the non-trivial topology of the state space while allowing one to simultaneously read off, in distances and angles, the level of entanglement in the 2-qubit state and the mixed-state properties of its constituent qubits. By encoding states and their evolutions through quantum logic gates with little to no need of mathematical formalism, these maps may prove particularly useful for understanding fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and quantum information at the introductory level. Interactive versions of the visualizations introduced in this paper are available at https://quantum.bard.edu/.</description>
