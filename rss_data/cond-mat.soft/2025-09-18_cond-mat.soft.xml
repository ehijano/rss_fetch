      <title>Stress Response of Jammed Solids: Prestress and Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike classical elasticity, where stresses arise from deformations relative to a stress-free reference configuration, rigidity in amorphous systems is maintained by disordered force networks that generate internal prestress. Previously, we introduced a ''stress-only'' formulation, where mechanical equilibrium resembles Gauss's law in a rank-2 tensor electrostatics with vector charges, and demonstrated that the mechanical response of jammed solids is described by the dielectric response of this gauge-theoretic formulation. Here, we extend this framework by incorporating scale-dependent screening that captures both dielectric and Debye-type behaviour. This introduces a characteristic length scale in stress correlations as well as in the response to external forces. Through numerical simulations of soft-sphere packings, we show that this length scale is set by the particle size, thus providing a natural ultraviolet cutoff while preserving long-wavelength emergent elasticity. We show that this lengthscale remains finite for all pressures, with no evidence for an emergent Debye-like screening near the frictionless unjamming transition. We demonstrate that although individual realisations show strong fluctuations, disorder averaging at fixed macroscopic conditions yields a robust dielectric-like response that persists up to unjamming. Finally, we also provide a physical interpretation of the gauge field within the electrostatic mapping: relative grain displacements in response to localised external perturbations correspond to difference in the gauge field, linking the field-theoretic description to particle-level mechanics.</description>

      <title>How Microplastics cross the Buoyancy Barrier: A multi-scale Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microplastics (MPs), though less dense than water, are frequently recovered from sediments in aqueous environments, indicating they can cross the buoyancy barrier. We quantify eco-corona mediated MP-sediment attraction and MP transport from the nanoscale to the macroscale, linking all scales to a coherent mechanism explaining how MP overcome buoyancy and settle in sediments through interaction with suspended sediment.
  Colloidal probe atomic force microscopy (CP-AFM) detected attractive forces (0.15 - 17 mN/m) enabling heteroaggregation. Microscale tests confirmed aggregation and on larger scales sediment retention more than doubled with an eco-corona. Simulations showed that environmental shear force ($4 \cdot 10^{-4} mN/m$) cannot disrupt aggregates. In sedimentation columns, biofilm-covered MPs settled twice as often as plain MPs in bentonite suspensions. MP retention increased by 32 %. These results demonstrate that eco-corona/biofilm-mediated heteroaggregation is a robust pathway for MP sinking, accumulation, and retention in sediment beds. By identifying physical interaction thresholds and aggregation stability, we provide mechanistic insight into MP fate, highlight probable accumulation hotspots, and offer an evidence base for improved risk assessment and environmental modelling.</description>

      <title>General approach for partitioning and phase separation in macromolecular coexisting phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partitioning of (bio)materials in polymeric mixtures is a key phenomenon both in cellular environments, as well as in industrial applications. In cells, several macromolecules are suspended within different biomolecular phases. On the other hand, the coexistence of polymeric aqueous phases has been exploited for the extraction and purification of (bio)materials suspended in water. Despite its relevance, key physical and chemical properties controlling the phase behavior of these complex systems are still lacking. Here, we have developed a classical density functional theory approach for describing the phase coexistence and partitioning of an arbitrary number of polymers and suspended materials. As a case example, we focus on a binary mixture of phase separating polymers in which a third material is dispersed. We explore the effect of size ratios and affinities between the different materials and address their distribution and coexisting densities, and find optimal conditions for partitioning.</description>

      <title>Gravity-driven flux of particles through apertures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravity-driven discharge of granular material through an aperture is a fundamental problem in granular physics and is classically described by empirical laws with different fitting parameters. In this Letter, we disentangle the mass flux into distinct velocity and packing contributions by combining three-dimensional experiments and simulations. We define a dimensionless flux ratio that captures confinement-driven deviations from a free-fall limit, which is recovered when the aperture is large compared to the grain size. For spherical cohesionless grains, the deviations from the free-fall limit are captured by a single exponential correction factor over a characteristic length scale of $\sim$ 10-15 grain diameters. This is shown to be the scale over which the packing structure is modified due to the boundary. We propose a new kinematic framework that explains the universality of granular discharge beyond empirical descriptions.</description>

      <title>Coupled Interfacial Phenomena Suppress Propulsion in Catalytic Janus Colloids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platinum-coated polystyrene Janus particles exhibit a combination of stochastic and deterministic motion in hydrogen peroxide solutions, making them promising candidates for applications in micro-scale cargo transport, drug delivery, and environmental remediation. The dynamics of Janus particles very near a boundary are dictated by conservative and non-conservative interactions that depend on particle, substrate, and solution properties. This study investigated the influence of orientational quenching by measuring the effect of changes in cap thickness and hydrogen peroxide concentration on particle velocity and maximum displacement. Janus particles with cap thicknesses of 3 nm, 7 nm, 10 nm, 20 nm, and 35 nm were analyzed in 1 wt./vol.% and 3 wt./vol.% hydrogen peroxide solutions near the bottom and top boundaries of the fluid cell. Results indicated that particles with lower cap thicknesses exhibit higher velocities, with faster particles in 3 wt./vol.% peroxide as compared to 1 wt./vol.% peroxide. Furthermore, results suggest a combined influence of activity and gravitational effects influenced whether particles moved along the top boundary i.e. ceiling or bottom boundary i.e. flooring. Heavier cap particles in lower peroxide concentration solution show less ceiling than lighter cap particles in higher peroxide concentration. We also find a global reduction in velocity for when a single surface of the two is plasma cleaned surface. These findings highlight the important interplay between cap weight, hydrodynamic interactions, and propulsion force in determining the dynamics of Janus particles.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery of governing equation for sheared granular materials in steady and transient states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular material has significant implications for industrial and geophysical processes. A long-lasting challenge, however, is seeking a unified rheology for its solid- and liquid-like behaviors under quasi-static, inertial, and even unsteady shear conditions. Here, we present a data-driven framework to discover the hidden governing equation of sheared granular materials. The framework, PINNSR-DA, addresses noisy discrete particle data via physics-informed neural networks with sparse regression (PINNSR) and ensures dimensional consistency via machine learning-based dimensional analysis (DA). Applying PINNSR-DA to our discrete element method simulations of oscillatory shear flow, a general differential equation is found to govern the effective friction across steady and transient states. The equation consists of three interpretable terms, accounting respectively for linear response, nonlinear response and energy dissipation of the granular system, and the coefficients depends primarily on a dimensionless relaxation time, which is shorter for stiffer particles and thicker flow layers. This work pioneers a pathway for discovering physically interpretable governing laws in granular systems and can be readily extended to more complex scenarios involving jamming, segregation, and fluid-particle interactions.</description>

      <title>Rotational dynamics of bound pairs of bacteria-induced membrane tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experiments demonstrating tube formation in giant unilamellar vesicles that are suspended in a bath of swimming E. coli bacteria. We chose the lipids such that the bacteria have no adhereing interaction with the membrane. The tubes are generated by the pushing force exerted by the bacteria on the membrane of the vesicles. Once generated, the bacteria are confined within the tubes, resulting in long-lived tubes that protrude into the vesicle. We show that such tubes interact to form stable bound pairs that orbit each other. We speculate that the tubes are maintained by the persistent pushing force generated by the bacterium, and the rotating pairs are stabilized by a combination of curvature mediated interaction and vorticity generated in the membrane by the rotation of the flagella.</description>

Abstract: Recently published preprint ( A. Ashkinazi, H.Chhabra, A.El.Moumane, M.M.C.Tortora, J.P.K. Doye, ''Chirality transfer in lyotropic twist-bend nematics'', arXiv:2508.03544v1 (2025)) has reawakened also interest to various mechanisms of chirality transfer from microscopic (molecular) level into the macroscopic chirality of the structure. In this communication we present a simple theoretical analysis how the transfer occurs for the Landau model of phase transition between cholesteric and chiral twist-bend liquid crystals. We found that the sign of the chiral heliconical spiral is always opposite to that of the cholesteric. Physics behind this relation is based on the orthogonality of the cholesteric director and vector order parameter of the heliconical phase.</description>

      <title>A General Model for Static Contact Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of contact angle and hysteresis determination has direct implications for engineering applications of wetting, colloid and surface science. Significant technical challenges can arise under real-world operating conditions, because the static contact angle is strongly influenced by contamination at the liquid-solid and liquid-vapor interfaces, chemical aging over long times, and environmental variables such as relative humidity and temperature. Analytical models that account for these real-world effects are therefore highly desirable to guide the rational design of robust applications. This work proposes a unified and simple-to-use model that expands Young's local thermodynamic approach to consider surfaces with topographic features of general geometry and varying degrees of liquid infiltration. The unified model recovers classical wetting limits (Wenzel, Cassie-Baxter, and hemiwicking), accounts for observable intermediate states (e.g., impregnating Cassie), and identifies a new limiting state with potential realizability: a Cassie state accompanied by a precursor film, termed the Inverse Wenzel state.</description>

      <title>Thickness Dependence and Fundamental Limitations for Ion Permeation in Nanoscale Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale films play a central role in biology and osmotic separations. Their water/salt selectivity is often regarded as intrinsic property, favoring thinner membranes for faster permeation. Here we highlight and quantify a fundamental limitation arising from the dependence of ion self-energy on film thickness, governed by its ratio to Bjerrum length. The resulting relation factors out this dependence from intrinsic ion permeability, which agrees well with available data and enables evaluation of dielectric properties of ultrathin films, advancing understanding of ion transport in membranes.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Attraction and Hindered Diffusion Govern First-passage Times of Swimming Microorganisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of microorganisms in their natural habitat is strongly influenced by their propulsion mechanisms, geometrical constraints, and random fluctuations. Here, we study numerically the first-passage-time (FPT) statistics of microswimmers, modeled as force-dipoles, to reach a no-slip wall. Our results demonstrate that hindered diffusion near the wall can increase the median FPT by orders of magnitude compared to "dry" agents, while the intricate interplay of active motion and hydrodynamic attraction speeds up the arrival at large P\'eclet numbers (measuring the importance of self-propulsion relative to diffusion). Strikingly, it leads to a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the dipole strength, where pushers reach the wall significantly faster than pullers. The latter become slower at an intermediate dipole strength and are more sensitive to their initial orientation, displaying a highly anisotropic behavior.</description>

      <title>Generalized invariants meet constitutive neural networks: A novel framework for hyperelastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The major challenge in determining a hyperelastic model for a given material is the choice of invariants and the selection how the strain energy function depends functionally on these invariants. Here we introduce a new data-driven framework that simultaneously discovers appropriate invariants and constitutive models for isotropic incompressible hyperelastic materials. Our approach identifies both the most suitable invariants in a class of generalized invariants and the corresponding strain energy function directly from experimental observations. Unlike previous methods that rely on fixed invariant choices or sequential fitting procedures, our method integrates the discovery process into a single neural network architecture. By looking at a continuous family of possible invariants, the model can flexibly adapt to different material behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using popular benchmark datasets for rubber and brain tissue. For rubber, the method recovers a stretch-dominated formulation consistent with classical models. For brain tissue, it identifies a formulation sensitive to small stretches, capturing the nonlinear shear response characteristic of soft biological matter. Compared to traditional and neural-network-based models, our framework provides improved predictive accuracy and interpretability across a wide range of deformation states. This unified strategy offers a robust tool for automated and physically meaningful model discovery in hyperelasticity.</description>

      <title>Optimal switching strategies for navigation in stochastic settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When navigating complex environments, animals often combine multiple strategies to mitigate the effects of external disturbances. These modalities often correspond to different sources of information, leading to speed-accuracy trade-offs. Inspired by the intermittent reorientation strategy seen in the behavior of the dung beetle, we consider the problem of the navigation strategy of a correlated random walker moving in two dimensions. We assume that the heading of the walker can be reoriented to the preferred direction by paying a fixed cost as it tries to maximize its total displacement in a fixed direction. Using optimal control theory, we derive analytically and confirm numerically the strategy that maximizes the walker's speed, and show that the average time between reorientations scales inversely with the magnitude of the environmental noise. We then extend our framework to describe execution errors and sensory acquisition noise. As a result, we provide a range of testable predictions and suggest new experimental directions. Our approach may be amenable to other navigation problems involving multiple sensory modalities that require switching between egocentric and geocentric strategies.</description>

      <title>From Attraction to Repulsion: Emergent Interactions in Harmonically Coupled Active Binary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergent interactions between two active Brownian particles coupled by an attractive harmonic potential and in contact with a thermal reservoir. By analyzing the stationary distribution of their separation, we demonstrate that the effective interaction can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the interplay between activity, coupling strength, and temperature. Notably, we find that an effective short-range repulsion emerges in the strong and moderate-coupling regimes, when the temperature is below some threshold value, which we characterize analytically. In the strong-coupling regime, the repulsion emerges solely due to the difference in the self-propulsion speeds of the particles. We also compute the short-time position distribution of the centroid of the coupled particles, which shows strongly non-Gaussian fluctuations at low temperatures.</description>
