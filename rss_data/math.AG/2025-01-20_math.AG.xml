      <title>Characteristic-free normalized Nash blowup of toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce conditions on cones of normal toric varieties under which the polyhedron defining the normalized Nash blowup does not depend on the characteristic of the base field. As a consequence, we deduce several results on the resolution of singularities properties of normalized Nash blowups. In particular, we recover all known results of the families that can be resolved via normalized Nash blowups in positive characteristic. We also provide new families of toric varieties whose 23normalized Nash blowup is non-singular in arbitrary characteristic.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Non-Abelian Hodge Theory for curves in prime characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a curve C and a reductive group G in prime characteristic, we relate the de Rham moduli of logarithmic G-connections on C to the Dolbeault moduli of logarithmic G-Higgs bundles on the Frobenius twist of C. We name this result the Log-p-NAHT. It is a logarithmic version of Chen-Zhu's characteristic p Non Abelian Hodge Theorem (p-NAHT). In contrast to the no pole case, the two moduli stacks in the log case are not isomorphic etale locally over the Hitchin base. Instead, they differ by an Artin-Schreier type Galois cover of the base. In contrast to the case over the complex numbers, where some parabolic/parahoric data are needed to specify the boundary behavior of the tame harmonic metrics, no parabolic/parahoric data are needed in Log-p-NAHT. We also establish a semistable version of the Log-p-NAHT, and deduce several geometric and cohomological consequences. In particular, when G=GL_r, the Log-p-NAHT induces an embedding of the intersection cohomology of the degree d Dolbeault moduli to that of the degree pd de Rham moduli, and the embedding is an isomorphism when r is coprime to d and p&gt;r.</description>

      <title>Functoriality of Coulomb branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the affine closure of the cotangent bundle of the parabolic base affine space for GL_n or SL_n is a Coulomb branch, which confirms a conjecture of Bourget-Dancer-Grimminger-Hanany-Zhong. In particular, we show that the ring of functions on the cotangent bundle of the parabolic base affine space of GL_n or SL_n is finitely generated.
  We prove this by showing that, if we are given a map $H \to G$ of complex reductive groups and a representation of $G$ satisfying an assumption we call gluable, then the Coulomb branch for the induced representation of $H$ is obtained from the corresponding Coulomb branch for $G$ by a certain Hamiltonian reduction procedure. In particular, we show that the Coulomb branch associated to any quiver with no loops can be obtained from Coulomb branches associated to quivers with exactly two vertices using this procedure.</description>

      <title>On symplectic automorphisms of a surface with genus two fibration and their action on $\mathrm{CH}_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a complex smooth projective surface with a genus two fibration, and $\mathrm{Aut}_s(S)$ the group of symplectic automorphisms, fixing every holomorphic 2-forms (if any) on $S$. Based on the work of Jin-Xing Cai, we observe in this paper that, if $\chi(\mathcal{O}_S)\geq 5$, then $|\mathrm{Aut}_s(S)|\leq 2$. Then we go on to verify, under some conditions, that $\mathrm{Aut}_s(S)$ acts trivially on the Albanese kernel $\mathrm{CH}_0(S)_{\mathrm{alb}}$ of the 0-th Chow group, which is predicted by a conjecture of Bloch and Beilinson. As a consequence, if an automorphism $\sigma\in \mathrm{Aut}(S)$ acts trivially on $H^{i,0}(S)$ for $0\leq i\leq 2$, then it also acts trivially on $\mathrm{CH}_0(S)_{\mathrm{alb}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a cohomological characterization of the Lefschetz defect of smooth complex projective varieties. As a consequence, we deduce that the Lefschetz defect of a smooth Fano variety is invariant under smooth deformation. We also characterize the Lefschetz defect of an abelian variety in terms of its isogeny factors, and study it in families.</description>

      <title>More varieties of 4-d gauge theories: product representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, we used methods of arithmetic geometry to study the anomaly-free irreducible representations of an arbitrary gauge Lie algebra. Here we generalize to the case of products of irreducible representations, where it is again possible to give a complete description. A key result is that the projective variety corresponding to $m$-fold product representations of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}_n$ is a rational variety for every $m$ and $n$. We study the simplest case of $\mathfrak{su}_3$ (corresponding to the strong interaction) in detail. We also describe the implications of a number-theoretic conjecture of Manin (and related theorems) for the number of chiral representations of bounded size $B$ (measured roughly by the Dynkin labels) compared to non-chiral ones, giving a precise meaning to the sense in which the former, which are those most relevant for phenomenology, are rare compared to the latter. As examples, we show that, for both irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{su}_5$ and once-reducible product representations of $\mathfrak{su}_3$ that are non-anomalous, the number of chiral representations is asymptotically between $B (\log B)^5$ and $B^\frac{4}{3}$, while the number of non-chiral representations is asymptotically $B^2$.</description>

      <title>G-functions, motives, and unlikely intersections -- old and new</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this survey, we outline the role of G-functions in arithmetic geometry, notably their link with Picard-Fuchs differential equations and periods. We explain how polynomial relations between special values of G-functions arising from a pencil of algebraic varieties may occur at a parameter where the fiber has more ``motivic" symmetries; and how Bombieri's principle of global relations can be used to control the height of such parameters (which was also one of the origins of the Andr\'e-Oort conjecture). At the end, we sketch the recent revival of the G-function method in the context of unlikely intersections and the Zilber-Pink conjecture.</description>

      <title>Murmurations and Sato-Tate Conjecture for High Rank Zetas of Elliptic Curves II: Beyond Riemann Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a continuation of our earlier paper, in this one, we offer a new approach to murmurations and Sato-Tate laws for higher rank zetas of elliptic curves. Our approach here does not depend on the Riemann hypothesis for the so-called a-invariant in rank n&gt;2 even for the Sato-Tate law, rather, on a much refined structure. Such a refined structure was already observed by Zagier and the senior author when the rank n Riemann hypothesis was established. Namely, instead of the rank n Riemann hypothesis bounds is based, we use much stronger asymptotic bounds instead. Nevertheless, rank n Sato-Tate law can be established and rank n murmuration can be formulated equally well, similar to the corresponding structures in the abelian framework for Artin zetas of elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>Higher local systems, $n$-affineness and Koszul duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study local systems of $(\infty,n)$-categories on spaces. We prove that categorical local systems are captured by (higher) monodromy data. We show that if $X$ is $(n+1)$-connected, local systems of $(\infty,n)$-categories over $X$ can be described as $\mathbb{E}_{n}$-modules over the iterated loop space $\Omega^{n+1}_*X$. Our main result is a general statement of $\mathbb{E}_n$-Koszul duality for pairs of $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras of the form $\mathrm{C}_{\bullet}(\Omega^{n}_*X;\Bbbk) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk)$ when $X$ satisfies suitable connectedness and finiteness assumptions. This takes the shape of an equivalence of $(\infty,n)$-categories $n\mathbf{ShvCat}^{n-1}(\mathrm{cSpec}(\mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk))) \simeq n\mathbf{LocSysCat}^{n-1}(X;\Bbbk)$, where $\mathrm{cSpec}(\mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk))$ is the cospectrum of the algebra of singular cochains, and $n\mathbf{ShvCat}^{n-1}$ is the $(\infty,n)$-category of quasi-coherent sheaves of $(\infty,n-1)$-categories. Our result is new already in the classical case $n=1$, although it can be seen to recover well known formulations of $\mathbb{E}_1$-Koszul duality as a Morita equivalence of module categories (up to appropriate completions of the $t$-structures).</description>

Abstract: We study the enumeration problem of higher dimensional partitions, a natural generalisation of classical integer partitions. We show that their counting problem is equivalent to the enumeration of simpler classes of higher dimensional partitions, satisfying suitable constraints on their embedding dimension and socle type. We provide exact formulas for the generating functions of several infinite families of such partitions, and design a procedure enumerating them in the general case. As a proof of concept, we determine the number of partitions of size up to 30 in any dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.07490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graded Hecke algebras can be constructed geometrically, with constructible sheaves and equivariant cohomology. The input consists of a complex reductive group G (possibly disconnected) and a cuspidal local system on a nilpotent orbit for a Levi subgroup of G. We prove that every such "geometric" graded Hecke algebra is naturally isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of a certain G x C*-equivariant semisimple complex of sheaves on the nilpotent cone $g_N$.
  From there we provide an algebraic description of the G x C*-equivariant bounded derived category of constructible sheaves on $g_N$. Namely, it is equivalent with the bounded derived category of finitely generated differential graded modules of a suitable direct sum of graded Hecke algebras. This can be regarded as a categorification of graded Hecke algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}_2$ be the Lie algebra of polynomial Hamiltonian vector fields on the symplectic plane. Let $X$ be the moduli space of stable Higgs bundles of fixed relatively prime rank and degree, or more generally the moduli space of stable parabolic Higgs bundles of arbitrary rank and degree for a generic stability condition. Let $H^*(X)$ be the cohomology with rational coefficients. Using the operations of cup-product by tautological classes and Hecke correspondences we construct an action of $\mathcal{H}_2$ on $H^*(X)[x,y]$, where $x$ and $y$ are formal variables. We show that the perverse filtration on $H^*(X)$ coincides with the filtration canonically associated to $\mathfrak{sl}_2\subset \mathcal{H}_2$ and deduce the $P=W$ conjecture of de Cataldo-Hausel-Migliorini.</description>

Abstract: Algebraic techniques in phylogenetics have historically been successful at proving identifiability results and have also led to novel reconstruction algorithms. In this paper, we study the ideal of phylogenetic invariants of the Cavender-Farris-Neyman (CFN) model on a phylogenetic network with the goal of providing a description of the invariants which is useful for network inference. It was previously shown that to characterize the invariants of any level-1 network, it suffices to understand all sunlet networks, which are those consisting of a single cycle with a leaf adjacent to each cycle vertex. We show that the parameterization of an affine open patch of the CFN sunlet model, which intersects the probability simplex factors through the space of skew-symmetric matrices via Pfaffians. We then show that this affine patch is isomorphic to a determinantal variety and give an explicit Gr{\"o}bner basis for the associated ideal, which involves only polynomially many coordinates. Lastly, we show that sunlet networks with at least 6 leaves are identifiable using only these polynomials and run extensive simulations, which show that these polynomials can be used to accurately infer the correct network from DNA sequence data.</description>

      <title>Approximation by perfect complexes detects Rouquier dimension</title>

Abstract: This work explores bounds on the Rouquier dimension in the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on Noetherian schemes. By utilizing approximations, we exhibit that Rouquier dimension is inherently characterized by the number of cones required to build all perfect complexes. We use this to prove sharper bounds on Rouquier dimension of singular schemes. Firstly, we show Rouquier dimension doesn't go up along \'{e}tale extensions and is invariant under \'{e}tale covers of affine schemes admitting a dualizing complex. Secondly, we demonstrate that the Rouquier dimension of the bounded derived category for a curve, with a delta invariant of at most one at closed points, is no larger than two. Thirdly, we bound the Rouquier dimension for the bounded derived category of a (birational) derived splinter variety by that of a resolution of singularities.</description>

      <title>Derived symmetries for crepant contractions to hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a crepant contraction f to a singularity X, we may expect a derived symmetry of the source of f. Under easily-checked geometric assumptions, I construct such a symmetry when X is a hypersurface in a smooth ambient S, using a spherical functor from the derived category of S. I describe this symmetry, relate it to other symmetries, and establish its compatibility with base change.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the properties of motivic homotopy category $\mathcal{SH}_{\operatorname{ext}}(\mathcal{X})$ developed by Chowdhury and Khan-Ravi for $\mathcal{X}$ a Nis-loc Stack. In particular, we compare the above construction with Voevodsky's original construction using NisLoc topology. Using the techniques developed by Liu-Zheng and Mann's notion of $\infty$-category of correspondences and abstract six-functor formalisms, we also extend the exceptional functors and extend properties like projection formula, base change and purity to the non-representable situation.</description>

      <title>A higher-dimensional Van den Essen type formula for projective foliations and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a one-dimensional holomorphic foliation on $\mathbb{P}^n$ such that $W\subset Sing(F)$, where $W$ is a smooth complete intersection variety. We determine and compute the variation of the Milnor number $ \mu(F, W)$ under blowups, which depends on the vanishing order of the pullback foliation along the exceptional divisor, as well as on numerical and topological invariants of $W$. This represents a higher-dimensional version of Van den Essen's formula for projective foliations of dimension one. As an application, we obtain a lower bound for the Milnor number of the foliation. Also, we use this formula to show that for a foliation on $\mathbb{P}^n$ that is singular along a smooth curve, there exists a finite number of blow-ups with centers on smooth curves such that the induced foliation has multiplicity equal to 1 and that for generic points of the curves in the final stage, the singularities are elementary. Moreover, we obtain a bound on the maximum number of blow-ups needed to resolve the foliation, depending on the numerical and topological invariants of the curve.</description>

Abstract: Soprunov and Soprunova introduced the notion of a good infinite family of toric codes. We prove that such good families do not exist by proving a more general Szemer\'edi-type result: for all $c\in(0,1]$ and all positive integers $N$, subsets of density at least $c$ in $\{0,1,\dots,N-1\}^n$ contain hypercubes of arbitrarily large dimension as $n$ grows.</description>

      <title>Non-linear microlocal cut-off functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To any conic closed set of a cotangent bundle, one can associate four functors on the category of sheaves, which are called non-linear microlocal cut-off functors. Here we explain their relation with the microlocal cut-off functor defined by Kashiwara and Schapira, and prove a microlocal cut-off lemma for non-linear microlocal cut-off functors, adapting inputs from symplectic geometry. We also prove two K\"unneth formulas and a functor classification result for categories of sheaves with microsupport conditions.</description>
