      <title>DeepSeq: High-Throughput Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data Labeling via Web Search-Augmented Agentic Generative AI Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI foundation models offer transformative potential for processing structured biological data, particularly in single-cell RNA sequencing, where datasets are rapidly scaling toward billions of cells. We propose the use of agentic foundation models with real-time web search to automate the labeling of experimental data, achieving up to 82.5% accuracy. This addresses a key bottleneck in supervised learning for structured omics data by increasing annotation throughput without manual curation and human error. Our approach enables the development of virtual cell foundation models capable of downstream tasks such as cell-typing and perturbation prediction. As data volume grows, these models may surpass human performance in labeling, paving the way for reliable inference in large-scale perturbation screens. This application demonstrates domain-specific innovation in health monitoring and diagnostics, aligned with efforts like the Human Cell Atlas and Human Tumor Atlas Network.</description>

      <title>Approaches to studying virus pangenome variation graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pangenome variation graphs (PVGs) allow for the representation of genetic diversity in a more nuanced way than traditional reference-based approaches. Here we focus on how PVGs are a powerful tool for studying genetic variation in viruses, offering insights into the complexities of viral quasispecies, mutation rates, and population dynamics. PVGs originated in human genomics and hold great promise for viral genomics. Previous work has been constrained by small sample sizes and gene-centric methods, PVGs enable a more comprehensive approach to studying viral diversity. Large viral genome collections should be used to make PVGs, which offer significant advantages: we outline accessible tools to achieve this. This spans PVG construction, PVG file formats, PVG manipulation and analysis, PVG visualisation, measuring PVG openness, and mapping reads to PVGs. Additionally, the development of PVG-specific formats for mutation representation and personalised PVGs that reflect specific research questions will further enhance PVG applications. Challenges remain, particularly in managing nested variants, optimising error detection, optimising k-mer/minimizer-based approaches for AT-rich genomes, incorporating long read sequencing data, and scalable visualisation approaches. Nevertheless, PVGs offer a new opportunities for viral population genomics, and a testing ground for tool development prior to application to larger eukaryotic genomes. These advances will enable more accurate and comprehensive detection of viral mutations, contributing to a deeper understanding of viral evolution and genotype-phenotype associations.</description>

      <title>PerturBench: Benchmarking Machine Learning Models for Cellular Perturbation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for perturbation response modeling in single cells, aimed at standardizing benchmarking in this rapidly evolving field. Our approach includes a modular and user-friendly model development and evaluation platform, a collection of diverse perturbational datasets, and a set of metrics designed to fairly compare models and dissect their performance nuances. Through extensive evaluation of both published and baseline models across diverse datasets, we highlight the limitations of widely used models, such as mode collapse. We also demonstrate the importance of rank metrics which complement traditional model fit measures, such as RMSE, for validating model effectiveness. Notably, our results show that while no single model architecture clearly outperforms others, simpler architectures are generally competitive and scale well with larger datasets. Overall, this benchmarking exercise sets new standards for model evaluation, supports robust model development, and advances the potential of these models to use high-throughput genetic and chemical screens for disease target discovery.</description>
