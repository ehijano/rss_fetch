      <title>Galaxy Transformation Across the Cosmic Web: Evolution of Stellar Colours and Star Formation Rates in Filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies form and evolve within the diverse environments of the cosmic web. However, disentangling the effects of internal properties, local environments, and large-scale structures (LSS) on galaxy evolution involvessignificant complexities, since these effects are frequently overlapping. The aim of this work is to provide evidence of the imprints left by LSS on galaxy properties by selecting samples of galaxies from different environments, while matching their intrinsic characteristics. We investigate the effects of the LSS on the g-r colour and star formation rate (SFR) in galaxies with stellar mass M $&gt; 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, with the redshift $0.05 \le z \le 0.1$, and selected from the SDSS DR16. We use a catalogue of the LSS available in the literature to define samples of galaxies located in field and filament environments. Galaxies located in the field tend to exhibit bluer g-r stellar colours and higher SFR than those in filaments. These differences persist even in samples of galaxies matched by mass and galaxy local overdensity, indicating that they are not produced by internal processes. These differences cannot be attributed to variations in morphology. There is also a variation in stellar colour and SFR with distance to the filaments (Df). The SFR of galaxies becomes statistically smaller than that of field galaxies for objects located at Df&lt;5 Mpc, while changes in stellar colour occur at smaller distances (Df&lt;1 Mpc). This could indicates that the typical filament width is about 2.5-5 Mpc. The variations in colour and SFR between galaxy samples in the field and in filaments, with matched masses and local overdensities, indicate that large-scale environmental factors drive these transformations rather than local or internal galaxy properties. These transformations are not strong enough to produce changes in galaxy morphology. They could be explained by cosmic web starvation.</description>

      <title>In-situ vs. ex-situ drivers of galaxy quenching: ubiquity of main sequence and critical black hole mass from the FLAMINGO simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting a large sample of 5.3 million galaxies with $M_\ast\,{=}\,10^{10-11}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ from the highest-resolution FLAMINGO simulation, we carry out a statistical analysis of quiescent and star-forming galaxies to explore quenching mechanisms. From redshift $z\,{\simeq}\,7$ to 0, we find that the median star-formation rate of main-sequence galaxies is independent of the environment and of whether a galaxy is a central or satellite, whereas the fraction of quiescent galaxies is highly sensitive to both. By employing Random Forest (RF) classifiers, we demonstrate that black hole (BH) feedback is the most responsible quenching mechanism for both centrals and satellites, while halo mass is the second most significant. For satellites, a notable importance given by RF to stellar mass implies in-situ pre-quenching rather than ex-situ preprocessing prior to infall to the current host halo. In the cosmic afternoon of $z\,{=}\,$0--1, we identify two distinct regimes of evolution: at $M_{\rm BH}\,{\gtrsim}\,10^7\,{\rm M}_\odot$, essentially all galaxies are quenched regardless of their environment; at $M_{\rm BH}\,{\lesssim}\,10^7\,{\rm M}_\odot$, quenching is determined mainly by halo mass. Galaxies undergo a sharp transition from the main sequence to quiescence once their BH mass reaches $M_{\rm BH}\,{\simeq}\,10^7\,{\rm M}_\odot$ (typically when $M_\ast\,{\simeq}\,10^{10.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and $M_{\rm h}\,{\simeq}\,10^{12}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) with a short quenching timescale of ${&lt;}$1 Gyr. This transition is driven by a sudden change in the gas mass in the inner circum-galactic medium. Our results indicate that galaxy quenching arises from a combination of in-situ and ex-situ physical processes.</description>

      <title>Strikingly high fraction of fast rotators in Magellanic Cloud star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been growing evidence that the rich star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds contain significant fractions of rapidly rotating stars. In this work, we aim to constrain these fractions by studying the colour-magnitude diagrams of four star clusters, selected among those with the most striking signatures of fast rotators. Using isochrones derived from PARSEC v2.0 stellar tracks, we generate distinct stellar populations, each covering a limited interval of initial rotation rates $\omega_\mathrm{i}$, referred to as 'Partial Models' (PMs). Using optimization algorithms and Monte Carlo Markov Chains, PMs are combined to create the final best-fitting model. In our analysis, we adopt two key assumptions: a uniform age and an isotropic distribution of stellar spin axes within each cluster. The solutions are allowed to explore the entire range of $\omega_\mathrm{i}$, and different values of age, metallicity, distance and foreground extinction. We find that the rotational velocity distributions in all four clusters reveal a high fraction of stars with $\omega_\mathrm{i}$ close to the break-up value, in all cases. Specifically, the fraction of stars with $\omega_\mathrm{i}&gt;0.7$ exceeds $80\%$ in the clusters NGC 419 of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and NGC 1831 and NGC 1866 of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). For NGC 2203 of the LMC, this fraction is smaller, although it still exceeds $50\%$, confirming that also this cluster is mainly populated by fast-rotating stars.</description>

      <title>Stellar tidal streams around nearby spiral galaxies with deep imaging from amateur telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal interactions between massive galaxies and their satellites are fundamental processes in a Universe with L-Cold Dark Matter cosmology, redistributing material into faint features that preserve records of past galactic interactions. While stellar streams in the Local Group impressively demonstrate satellite disruption, they do not constitute a statistically significant sample. Constructing a substantial catalog of stellar streams beyond the Local Group remains challenging due to the difficulties in obtaining deep, wide-field images of galaxies. Despite their potential to illuminate dark matter distribution and galaxy formation processes, stellar streams remain underutilized as cosmological probes. The Stellar Tidal Stream Survey (STSS) addresses this observational gap by leveraging amateur telescopes to obtain deep, scientific-grade images of galactic outskirts, capable of building a more statistically meaningful sample of stellar streams. Over the last decade, the STSS has acquired deep (up to surface brightness limit 28.3 mag/arcsec^2 in the r-band), wide-field images of 15 nearby Milky Way analog galaxies using a network of robotic amateur telescopes, avoiding the issues associated with "mosaicing" smaller images taken with a professional telescope. Our survey has revealed a diverse range of previously unreported faint features related to dwarf satellite accretion - including stellar streams, shells, and umbrella-like structures. We discover an ultra-diffuse galaxy (NGC150-UDG1), which shows hints of tidal tails. The STSS demonstrates the suitability of modern amateur telescopes to detect and study faint, diffuse structures in large fields around nearby spiral galaxies. Their economic and accessibility advantages enable larger samples with deep imaging, essential for testing galaxy formation models and constraining the properties of minor merger events in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>The Local Group Symbiotic Star Population and its Tenuous Link with Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary stars are gravitationally bound stellar systems where the evolution of each component can significantly influence the evolution of its companion and the system as a whole. In certain cases, the evolution of these systems can lead to the formation of a red giant-white dwarf system, which may exhibit symbiotic characteristics. The primary goal of this work is to contribute in a statistical way to the estimation of the symbiotic system (SySt) population in the Milky Way and in the dwarf galaxies of the Local Group (LG). Additionally, we aim to infer the maximum contribution of SySt to Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) events. Given the significant discrepancies in previous estimates, we propose two distinct approaches to constrain the expected SySt population: one empirical and another theoretical. These approaches are designed to provide a robust estimation of the SySt population. For the Milky Way, we utilized position and velocity data of known SySts to determine their distribution. Based on these properties, we constrained the lower limit for the Galactic SySt population in the range of 800--4,100. Our theoretical approach, which relies on the properties of zero-age main-sequence binaries and known binary evolutionary paths, suggests a SySt population of $(53\pm6)\times10^3$ SySt in the Galaxy. The statistical SySt populations for LG dwarf galaxies are one to four orders of magnitude lower, primarily dependent on the galaxies' bolometric luminosity and, to a lesser extent, their binary fraction and metallicity. In this work, the contribution of the single-degenerate channel of SNe Ia from symbiotic progenitors is estimated to be of the order of 1\% for the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>CHILES VIII: Probing Evolution of Average HI Content in Star Forming Galaxies over the Past 5 Billion Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the COSMOS HI Large Extragalactic Survey (CHILES) dataset, we investigate the evolution of the average atomic neutral hydrogen (HI) properties of galaxies over the continuous redshift range 0.09 $&lt; z &lt;$ 0.47. First, we introduce a simple multi-step, multi-scale imaging and continuum subtraction process that we apply to each observing session. These sessions are then averaged onto a common \textit{uv}-grid and run through a Fourier filtering artifact mitigation technique. We then demonstrate how this process results in science quality data products by comparing to the expected noise and image-cube kurtosis. This work offers the first-look description and scientific analysis after the processing of the entire CHILES database. These data are used to measure the average HI mass in four redshift bins, out to a redshift 0.47, by separately stacking blue cloud (NUV-r= -1 - 3) and red sequence (NUV-r = 3 - 6) galaxies. We find little-to-no change in gas fraction for the total ensemble of blue galaxies and make no detection for red galaxies. Additionally, we split up our sample of blue galaxies into an intermediate stellar mass bin (M$_{*} = 10^{9-10} M_{\odot}$) and a high stellar mass bin (M$_{*} = 10^{10-12.5} M_{\odot}$). We find that in the high mass bin galaxies are becoming increasingly HI poor with decreasing redshift, while the intermediate mass galaxies maintain a constant HI gas mass. We place these results in the context of the star-forming main sequence of galaxies and hypothesize about the different mechanisms responsible for their different evolutionary tracks.</description>

      <title>Study of barred galaxies in IllustrisTNG100: the case of low surface brightness galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we compare the presence of stellar bars in low and high surface brightness (LSB and HSB, respectively) galaxies using the TNG100 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project. The sample consists of $4,244$ disc galaxies at $z=0$ with a stellar mass M${_\star} \geq 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. We find that the bar fraction in LSBs is $24 \pm 1.73 \%$, similar to the $28 \pm 0.74 \%$ found in HSBs, consistent with observations. For a given stellar mass range, HSBs consistently exhibit a higher bar fraction compared to LSBs except for galaxies with M$_{\star} &gt; 10^{11}$ M${\odot}$, where the difference vanishes. To understand the differences in the bar fractions of HSBs and LSBs and the properties of host galaxies, including stellar mass, spin, gas mass fraction, and bulge-to-total mass ratio, we create several control samples. For low stellar masses (M$_{\star}&lt;10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$), the difference in bar fraction between LSBs and HSBs could be attributed to a higher spin parameter and gas mass fraction in LSBs, which are some of the parameters known to inhibit the bar formation/growth. At the high mass end, the bulge-to-total mass fraction is the only parameter able to increase the difference in the bar fraction, although the difference is of low significance. Additionally, we investigate the impact of the local environment through the tidal parameter. Our findings indicate that, in contrast to HSBs, where the bar fraction appears to be unaffected by the tidal parameter, interactions could benefit the bar presence in LSBs, although exerting a lower impact than the other physical parameters. Our findings offer insights into the relevant galaxy properties that influence the presence of bars in LSBs.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Winds Drive Large-Scale Cold Gas Outflows in Quasars during the Reionization Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) regulate the evolution of their host galaxies through powerful outflows and multi-phase feedback. This process plays a crucial role in shaping SMBH-galaxy co-evolution across cosmic time, but direct evidence linking nuclear winds to large-scale cold gas outflows, particularly in high-redshift quasars, has remained elusive. Here we present statistical evidence of a connection between nuclear winds and large-scale cold gas outflows in quasars at $z \sim 5.5$. Using stacked [C II] 158 $\mu$m emission profiles from ALMA observations, which trace galactic-scale neutral gas, we compare broad absorption line (BAL) quasars -- tracing parsec- to sub-kiloparsec-scale nuclear winds -- with non-BAL quasars. The BAL stack reveals a significant (S/N=4.45) broad component in the [C II] emission, indicating high-velocity neutral gas outflows with a velocity offset of $\Delta v_{\rm b} = -2.1 \times 10^2 \, \rm km\,s^{-1}$ and a full width at half maximum of $1.18 \times 10^3 \, \rm km\,s^{-1}$, while the non-BAL stack shows no such feature. We estimate that a few percent up to one-quarter of the BAL wind energy is transferred to neutral gas on kiloparsec scales. These findings provide direct observational evidence that nuclear winds couple with galactic-scale neutral gas flows, supporting multi-phase AGN feedback models. This mechanism may contribute to explaining the diversity of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*$ ratios observed in some luminous AGN recently observed by JWST, compared to the Magorrian relation.</description>

      <title>Globular cluster distributions as a dynamical probe of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) act as massive probe particles traversing the dark matter halos of their host galaxies. Gravitational dynamical friction due to halo particles causes GC orbits to contract over time, providing a beyond-mean field test of the cold dark matter paradigm. We explore the information content of such systems, using N-body and semianalytic simulations and scanning over a range of initial conditions. We consider data from the ultradiffuse galaxies NGC5846-UDG1 and UDG-DF44, and from the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The GC systems of UDG1 and Fornax indicate the presence of dark matter halos, independent of (but consistent with) stellar kinematics data. UDG-DF44 is too diffuse for dynamical friction to give strong constraints. Our analysis can be extended to many additional galaxies.</description>

      <title>Detection of Deuterated Hydrocarbon Nanoparticles in the Whirlpool Galaxy, M51</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deuteration of hydrocarbon material, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), has been proposed to account for the low gas-phase abundances of D in the interstellar medium. JWST spectra of four star-forming regions in M51 show an emission feature, with central wavelength $\sim$4.647$\mu$m and FWHM 0.0265$\mu$m, corresponding to the C-D stretching mode in aliphatic hydrocarbons. The emitting aliphatic material is estimated to have (D/H)$_{\rm aliph}\approx 0.17\pm0.02$ -- a factor $\sim$$10^4$ enrichment relative to the overall interstellar medium (ISM). On $\sim$$50\,$pc scales, deuteration levels toward four H$\,$II regions in M51 are 2-3 times higher than in the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), with implications for the processes responsible for the formation and evolution of hydrocarbon nanoparticles, including PAHs. The deuteration of the aliphatic material is found to anticorrelate with helium ionization in the associated H$\,$II, suggesting that harsh FUV radiation may act to lower the deuteration of aliphatics in PDRs near massive stars. No evidence is found for deuteration of aromatic material, with (D/H)$_{\rm arom} \lesssim 0.016$: deuteration of the aliphatic material exceeds that of the aromatic material by at least a factor 10. The observed levels of deuteration may account for the depletion of D observed in the Galactic interstellar medium. If so, the $4.65\mu$m feature may be detectable in absorption.</description>

      <title>Cosmological gas accretion of Milky Way-type galaxies and the build-up of galactic discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present results on the assembly of stellar discs belonging to Milky Way-type galaxies in the Auriga simulated sample. We study the net accretion of gas onto the disc region as a function of time and radius to assess the feasibility of the so-called inside-out formation of galaxy discs. We found that most of the galaxies in our sample exhibit an inside-out disc growth, with younger stellar populations preferentially formed in the outer regions as accreted material turns into starts. This produces stable discs as long as late-time accretion is free from significant external perturbations.</description>

Abstract: We present the first characterization of the Gunn-Peterson trough in high-redshift galaxies using public JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy. This enables us to derive the first galaxy-based IGM opacity measurements at the end of reionisation. Using galaxy spectra has several advantages over quasar spectra: it enables measurements of the IGM opacity in any extragalactic field over a continuous redshift range $4\lesssim z\lesssim 7$, as well as measurements of the intrinsic Lyman-$\beta$ opacity. Our novel constraints are in good agreement with state-of-the-art ground-based quasar Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations, and will become competitive as the number of JWST $z&gt;5$ galaxy spectra rapidly increases. We also provide the first constraints on the uncontaminated Lyman-$\beta$ opacity at $5&lt;z&lt;6$. Finally, we demonstrate the power of JWST to connect the ionisation state of the IGM to the sources of reionisation in a single extragalactic field. We show that a previously reported galaxy overdensity and an excess of Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters detected with JWST in GOODS-South at $z=5.8-5.9$ coincides with an anomalously low IGM opacity to Lyman-$\alpha$ at this redshift. The local photo-ionisation rate excess can be fully accounted for by the cumulative ionising output of $M_{\rm{UV}}\lesssim -10$ galaxies in the overdensity, provided they have $\log_{10}\langle \xi_{\rm{ion}} f_{\rm{esc}} / \ [\rm{erg}^{-1}\rm{Hz}]\rangle = 24.7$ (or equivalently $\log_{10}\xi_{\rm{ion}} / \ [\rm{erg}^{-1}\rm{Hz}]=25.4$ and $f_{\rm{esc}}=20\%$). Overall, this breakthrough offers a new way to connect the galaxy large-scale structure to the state of the IGM, potentially enabling us to precisely identify the sources of reionisation.</description>

      <title>The MaNGA Dwarf Galaxy Sample (MaNDala): stellar profiles and gradients characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derived radial profiles and inner/outer gradients of various stellar population (SP) properties for 124 bright dwarf galaxies, $10^{7.53}\leq M_*/M_\odot\leq 10^{9.06}$, from the MaNDala sample, using integral field spectroscopy observations. Given the complex structure of dwarf galaxies, we used four different methods to derive SP radial profiles: two based on concentric elliptical rings, and two exploiting the spatially resolved data. For each method, we applied four approaches to calculate the inner ($0 \leq R/R_e \leq 1$) and outer ($0.75 \leq R/R_e \leq 1.5$) gradients of: luminosity- and mass-weighted age and stellar metallicity, dust attenuation, $D_{n4000}$ index, stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) surface densities, and specific SFR. While the PSF has a minor impact on the SP gradients, the methodology for characterizing radial profiles significantly affects them. At fixed property, differences in inner gradients from concentric rings methods are $\sim0.05\text{-}0.1 \text{ dex/}R_e$, while outer gradients can reach $0.5\text{-}1 \text{ dex/}R_e$, relative to the median of all gradients of that property, $\text{med}\left(\{\nabla \mathcal{G}\}_i\right)$. Spatially resolved methods yield smaller differences, $\lesssim0.1 \text{ dex/}R_e$. For some SP gradients, e.g. $\nabla_\text{SFR}$, the dispersion among the methods is comparable to $\text{med}\left(\{\nabla \mathcal{G}\}_i\right)$. While it is not possible to select a single preferred method for determining SP gradients, we suggest to use $\text{med}\left(\{\nabla \mathcal{G}\}_i\right)$ for each SP property. The resulting median age and metallicity suggest that, overall, bright dwarfs experienced moderate inside-out formation, and significant early SF from low-metallicity gas with outward radial migration of old SPs. The derived SP gradients provide strong constraints on feedback mechanisms in dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>ALMA uncovers optically thin and multi-component CO gas in the outflowing circumnuclear disk of NGC1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) influence their host galaxies through winds and jets that can drive molecular outflows, traceable with CO line emissions using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). Recent studies leveraging ALMA data have proposed a three-dimensional outflow geometry in the nearby Seyfert II galaxy NGC 1068, a key target for AGN unification theories. Using ALMA observations of CO(2-1), CO(3-2), and CO(6-5) transitions at roughly 0.1 arcseconds (approximately 7 parsecs) resolution, we analyzed the temperature, density, and kinematics of NGC 1068's circumnuclear disk (CND), focusing on the molecular outflow. Through local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) analysis, we derived column densities and rotational temperatures, indicating optically thin gas and CO-to-H2 (XCO) conversion factors between 4.8 and 9.6 times smaller than the Milky Way value. The inferred molecular mass outflow rate is mostly below 5.5 solar masses per year, with the dominant contribution northeast of the AGN. After subtracting the rotation curve of the CND, we modeled averaged line profiles in each region using single and multi-component Gaussian fits. Several profiles within or near the AGN wind bicone required multiple components with significant velocity shifts, suggesting multi-component complex outflow kinematics. We observe lateral variation in CO kinematics along the AGN wind bicone and a misalignment between the molecular and ionized outflow directions. These results imply that the dynamic impact of the ionized AGN wind on the molecular gas in the CND may be limited. However, the molecular outflow shows a complex, asymmetric structure.</description>

      <title>A 3D view of dwarf galaxies with Gaia and VLT/FLAMES II. The Sextans dwarf spheroidal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy has been challenging to study in a comprehensive way as it is highly extended on the sky, with an uncertain but large tidal radius of between 80-160 arcminutes (or 3-4kpc), and an extremely low central surface brightness of SigmaV = 26.2 mag/arcsec2. Here we present a new homogeneous survey of 41 VLT/FLAMES multi-fibre spectroscopic pointings that contain 2108 individual spectra, and combined with Gaia DR3 photometry and astrometry we present v-los measurements for 333 individual Red Giant Branch stars that are consistent with membership in the Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy. In addition, we provide the metallicity, [Fe/H], determined from the two strongest CaII triplet lines, for 312 of these stars. We look again at the global characteristics of Sextans, deriving a mean line-of-sight velocity of &lt;v-los&gt; = +227.1km/s and a mean metallicity of &lt;[Fe/H]&gt; = -2.37. The metallicity distribution is clearly double peaked, with the highest peak at [Fe/H]= -2.81 and another broader peak at [Fe/H]= -2.09. Thus it appears that Sextans hosts two populations and the superposition leads to a radial variation in the mean metallicity, with the more metal rich population being centrally concentrated. In addition there is an intriguing group of 9 probable members in the outer region of Sextans at higher [Fe/H] than the mean in this region. If this group could be confirmed as members they would eliminate the metallicity gradient. We also look again at the Colour-Magnitude Diagram of the resolved stellar population in Sextans. We also look again at the relation between Sextans and the intriguingly nearby globular cluster, Pal3. The global properties of Sextans have not changed significantly compared to previous studies, but they are now more precise, and the sample of known members in the outer regions is now more complete.</description>

      <title>North+Lone Star Supernova Host Survey I: Local Host-Galaxy H${\alpha}$ Surface Brightness and the Hubble Residuals of Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical integral-field unit (IFU) spectroscopy acquired with the George and Cynthia Mitchell Spectrograph on the Harlan J. Smith telescope at McDonald Observatory of 94 galaxies (0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.058) that have hosted Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We selected host galaxies with star-forming morphology, consistent with the criteria used by Riess et al. (2022). We measured the H${\alpha}$ surface brightness of each host galaxy within 1 kpc of the location of the supernova. Using distances from the Pantheon+ sample, we find a step in Hubble residuals compared to local H${\alpha}$ surface brightness of -0.097 $\pm$ 0.051 mag at 1.9${\sigma}$ significance in a sample of 73 host galaxies, where SNe in environments with smaller H${\alpha}$ surface brightness are, on average, less luminous after correction for light-curve shape and color. Almost all of the SNe in our sample were discovered by targeted surveys. Using an independent sample primarily from the untargeted Nearby Supernova Factory survey, Rigault et al. (2020) found a step of 0.045 $\pm$ 0.029 mag where SNe in passive environments are instead brighter, which is in 2.4${\sigma}$ tension with our measurement. Rigault et al. (2013) designated SNe Ia comparatively small HRs (&lt; -0.1) and faint local H${\alpha}$ surface brightness (SB) (&lt;log10(H${\alpha}$ SB/(erg$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$kpc$^2$))=38.32 as the M$_2$ population. SNe that would be classified as M$_2$ are less highly represented in our sample (7% versus 21%). When we include an additional twelve early-type galaxies, the number of M$_2$ SNe is almost doubled, although the tension with the HR step measured by Rigault et al. (2020) persists at 1.7${\sigma}$.</description>

      <title>The M31-M33 Interaction: Impact on M31's Center of Mass Motion and Satellite Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent studies of the Milky Way--LMC interaction and its implications for the Milky Way's global dynamical history, we investigate how the massive satellite galaxy M33 influences Andromeda's (M31) center of mass (COM) position and velocity as it passes through M31's halo. Using recent 6-dimensional phase space measurements for both galaxies, we use backward integration to revisit M33's orbital history in a massive M31 potential ($3\times10^{12}\,M_{\odot}$) for the first time. As previously concluded, we find that a first infall orbit is still the most statistically significant ($\gtrsim$ 90%) orbital solution for M33, except for a high mass M31 combined with M31 proper motions from HST (as opposed to Gaia), where there is a greater likelihood (~65%) of a previous encounter. However, the minimum distance between M33 and M31 during this passage is typically $\geq$ 100 kpc, two to three times larger than the distance required to explain M33's warped stellar and gaseous disks. We quantify the magnitude and direction of M31's evolving COM position ($R_{COM}$) and velocity ($V_{COM}$) owing to M33, finding $R_{COM}\approx$100-150 kpc at maximum and $V_{COM}\approx$20-40 km s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, we explore the implications of this phenomenon for the M31 satellite system, specifically whether M33's gravitational influence is linked to the lopsided distribution of M31 satellites and whether M33 significantly perturbs the orbits of other M31 satellites. While M33 alone may not explain the lopsided nature of M31's satellite system, its dynamical impact is non-negligible and must be accounted for in future dynamical studies of the M31 system.</description>

      <title>From moving groups to star formation in the Solar Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moving groups in the solar neighborhood are ensembles of co-moving stars, likely originating due to forces from spiral arms, the Galactic bar, or external perturbations. Their co-movement with young clusters indicates recent star formation within these moving groups, but a lack of precise three-dimensional position and velocity measurements has obscured this connection. Using backward orbit integrations of 509 clusters within 1 kpc - based on Gaia DR3 and supplemented with APOGEE-2 and GALAH DR3 radial velocities - we trace their evolution over the past 100 Myr. We find that most clusters separate into three spatial groups that each trace one of the Pleiades, Coma Berenices, and Sirius moving groups. The same trend is not seen for the Hyades moving group. The young clusters of the Alpha Persei, Messier 6, and Collinder 135 families of clusters, previously found to have formed in three massive star-forming complexes, co-move with either the Pleiades (Alpha Persei and Messier 6) or Coma Berenices (Collinder 135). Our results provide a sharper view of how large-scale Galactic dynamics have shaped recent, nearby star formation.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared extinction curve for protostellar envelopes from JWST-detected embedded jet emission: the case of TMC1A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Dust grains are key components of the interstellar medium and play a central role in star formation, acting as catalysts for chemical reactions and as building blocks of planets. Extinction curves are essential for characterizing dust properties, but mid-infrared (MIR) extinction remains poorly constrained in protostellar environments. Gas-phase line ratios from embedded protostellar jets provide a spatially resolved method for probing extinction through protostellar envelopes, complementing background starlight approaches. Aims: We aim to derive MIR extinction curves along sightlines toward a protostellar jet embedded in an envelope and assess whether they differ from those in dense molecular clouds. Methods: We analyze JWST NIRSpec IFU and MIRI MRS observations of four positions along the blue-shifted TMC1A jet. We extract observed [Fe II] line intensities and model intrinsic ratios using the Cloudy spectral synthesis code across a range of electron densities and temperatures. By comparing observed near-IR (NIR) and MIR line ratios to Cloudy predictions, we infer the relative extinction between NIR and MIR wavelengths. Results: Electron densities (ne) derived from NIR [Fe II] lines range from ~5 x 10^4 to ~5 x 10^3 cm^-3 at scales &lt;~350 AU. MIR extinction values show stronger reddening than the empirical dark cloud curve from McClure (2009) at similar ne and temperatures (~10^3 to 10^4 K). If MIR emission arises from cooler, lower-density gas, extinction curves remain consistent with background starlight measurements. Conclusions: This method enables spatially resolved MIR extinction curves in embedded protostellar systems. Results suggest either a change in dust size distribution (e.g., from grain growth) or that MIR emission originates from cooler, less dense regions than NIR emission. (Abstract shortened for arXiv.

      <description>arXiv:2504.02229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistical characteristics of double main-sequence (MS) binaries are essential for investigating star formation, binary evolution, and population synthesis. Our previous study proposed a machine learning-based method to identify MS binaries from MS single stars using mock data from the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). We further utilized detection efficiencies and an empirical mass ratio distribution to estimate the binary fraction within the sample. To further validate the effectiveness of this method, we conducted a more realistic sample simulation, incorporating additional factors such as metallicity, extinction, and photometric errors from CSST simulations. The detection efficiency for binaries with mass ratios between 0.2 and 0.7 reached over 80%. We performed a detailed observational validation using the data selected from the Gaia Sky Survey and Galaxy Evolution Explorer. The detection efficiency for MS binaries in the observed sample was 65%. The binary fraction can be inferred with high precision for a set of observed samples, based on accurate empirical mass ratio distribution.</description>

      <title>Mass, Luminosity, and Stellar Age of Early-type Stars from the LAMOST Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass ($M$) and luminosity ($L$) are fundamental parameters of stars but can only be measured indirectly. Typically, effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$), surface gravity (${\rm log}\ g$) and metallicity ([M/H]) are derived from stellar spectra, then $M$, $L$ and stellar age ($t$) can be obtained by interpolating in the grid of stellar evolutionary models. In this paper, we use the Random Forest (RF) in combination with the evolutionary grid from PARSEC 1.2S to determine $M$, $L$, $t$ and initial mass ($M_{\rm i}$) for early-type main-sequence stars ($T_{\rm eff}\geq 7,000\ {\rm K}$) as identified from the LAMOST survey. The convex hull algorithm is employed to select the main-sequence stars. The results demonstrate that the prediction precision is $32\%$ and $9\%$ for $L$ and $M$, respectively, which is comparable to that achieved by fitting evolutionary tracks. Furthermore, the predicted $L$ also aligns with Gaia's observations, with a relative difference of $36\%$. The prediction for $t$ is relatively less accurate, indicating a difference of 0.44 Gyr for two components in wide binaries. This discrepancy is due to the inconsistent metallicity measurements. For the two sets of atmospheric parameters we used, the relative differences in $L$, $M$, $t$ and $M_{\rm i}$ are $29\%$, $7\%$, $36\%$ and $7\%$, respectively. The influence of metallicity on these parameters is analyzed, with the conclusion that metallicity has the greatest impact on $t$. Consequently, two catalogs are presented, which would be useful for studying stellar populations such as the luminosity function and initial mass function of early-type stars.</description>

      <title>Fluorine production in He-burning regions of massive stars during cosmic history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of fluorine is still a debated question. AGB stars synthesise this element and likely contribute significantly to its synthesis in the present-day Universe. However, it is not clear whether other sources contribute, especially in the early Universe. We discuss variations of the surface abundances of fluorine coming from our massive star models and compare them with available present-day observations. We compute the contribution of massive stars in producing 19F over metallicities covering the whole cosmic history. We used models in the mass range of 9Msol &lt; Mini &lt; 300Msol at metallicities from Pop III up to super-solar while accounting for the required nuclear network to follow the evolution of 19F during the core H- and He-burning phases. Results from models with and without rotational mixing are presented. We find that rotating models predict a slight depletion of fluorine at their surface at the end of the MS phase. In more advanced evolutionary phases, only models with an initial mass larger than 25Msol at metallicities Z &gt; 0.014 show phases where the abundance of fluorine is enhanced. This occurs when the star is a WR star of the WC type. WC stars can show surface abundances of fluorine ten times larger than their initial abundance. However, we obtained that the winds of massive stars at metallicities larger than Z=0.006 do not significantly contribute to fluorine production, confirming previous findings. In contrast, very metal-poor rapidly rotating massive star models may be important sources of fluorine through the mass expelled at the time of their SN explosion. Observations of WC stars at solar or super-solar metallicities may provide very interesting indications on the nuclear pathways that lead to fluorine production in massive stars. The possibility of observing fluorine-rich CEMPs is also a way to put constrains in present models at very low metallicities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectropolarimetric techniques are a mainstay of astrophysical inquiry, ranging from Solar System objects to the Cosmic Background Radiation. This review highlights applications of stellar polarimetry for massive hot stars, particularly in the context of ultraviolet (UV) spaceborne missions. The prevalence of binarity in the massive star population and uncertainties regarding the degree of rotational criticality among hot stars raises important questions about stellar interactions, interior structure, and even the lifetimes of evolutionary phases. These uncertainties have consequences for stellar population synthesis calculations. Spectropolarimetry is a key tool for extracting information about stellar and binary geometries. We review methodologies involving electron scattering in circumstellar envelopes; gravity darkening from rapid rotation; spectral line effects including the (a) "line effect", (b) Ohman effect, and (c) Hanle effect; and the imprint of interstellar polarization on measurements. Finally, we describe the Polstar UV spectropolarimetric SMEX mission concept as one means for employing these diagnostics to clarify the state of high rotation and its impacts for massive stars.</description>

      <title>The mass accretion history of dark matter haloes down to Earth mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take advantage of the unprecedented dynamical range provided by the "Cosmic-Zoom" project to study the mass accretion history (MAH) of present-day dark matter haloes over the entire mass range present in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm when the dark matter is made of weakly interacting massive particles of mass $100\ \mathrm{GeV}$. In particular, we complement previous studies by exploring the MAHs of haloes with mass from $10^8\ h^{-1}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ down to Earth mass, $10^{-6}\ h^{-1}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. The formation redshift of low-mass haloes anti-correlates weakly with mass, peaking at $z=3$ for haloes of mass $10^{-4}\ h^{-1}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Even lower masses are affected by the free-streaming cutoff in the primordial spectrum of density fluctuations and form at lower redshift. We compare MAHs in our simulations with predictions from two analytical models based on the extended Press-Schechter theory (EPS), and three empirical models derived by fitting and extrapolating either results from cosmological $N$-body simulations or Monte Carlo realizations of halo growth. All models fit our simulations reasonably well over the mass range for which they were calibrated. While the empirical models match better for more massive haloes, $M&gt;10^{10}\ h^{-1}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, the analytical models do better when extrapolated down to Earth mass. At the higher masses, we explore the correlation between local environment density and MAH, finding that biases are relatively weak, with typical MAHs for haloes in extremely low-density and in typical regions differing by less than $20$ percent at high redshift. If this result can be extrapolated to lower halo masses, we conclude that EPS theory predicts the hierarchical build-up of dark matter haloes quite well over the entire halo mass range.</description>

      <title>Potential Impact of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy on the Formation of Young O-rich Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Milky Way underwent significant transformations in its early history, characterised by violent mergers and satellite galaxy accretion. However, recent observations reveal notable star formation events over the past 4 Gyr, likely triggered by perturbations from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Here, we present chemical signatures of this accretion event, using the [Fe/H] (metallicity) and [O/Fe] (oxygen abundance) ratios of thin-disc stars. In the normalised age-metallicity plane, we identify a discontinuous V-shape structure at z$_{\rm max}$ (maximum vertical distance from the disc plane) $&lt;$ 0.4 kpc in the local disc, interrupted by a star formation burst between 4 and 2 Gyr ago. This event is characterised by a significant increase in oxygen abundance, resulting in a distinct [O/Fe] gradient and the formation of young O-rich stars. These stars have larger birth radii, indicating formation in the outer disc followed by radial migration to the Solar neighbourhood. Simulations of late satellite infall suggest that the passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy may have contributed to the observed increase in oxygen abundance in the local disc.</description>

      <title>On the Significance of Rare Objects at High Redshift: The Impact of Cosmic Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of extremely luminous galaxies at ultra-high redshifts ($z\gtrsim 8$) has challenged galaxy formation models. Most analyses of this tension have not accounted for the variance due to field-to-field clustering, which causes the number counts of galaxies to vary greatly in excess of Poisson noise. This super-Poissonian variance is often referred to as cosmic variance. Since cosmic variance increases rapidly as a function of mass, redshift, and smaller observing areas, the most massive objects in deep \textit{JWST} surveys are severely impacted by cosmic variance. We construct a simple model, including cosmic variance, to predict the distribution of the mass of the most massive galaxy for different surveys, which increases the tension with observations. The distributions differ significantly from previous predictions using the Extreme Value Statistics formalism, changing the position and shape of the distributions. We test our model using the \texttt{UniverseMachine} simulations, where the predicted effects of cosmic variance are clearly identifiable. We find that the high skew in the distributions of galaxy counts for typical deep surveys imply a high statistical variance on the cosmic variance itself. This impacts the calibration of the cosmic variance, as well as the expected mass of the most massive galaxy. We also find that the impact of cosmic variance dominates the impact of any realistic scatter in the stellar-to-halo-mass relation at $z\gtrsim 12$. It is therefore crucial to accurately account for the impact of cosmic variance in any analysis of tension between early extreme galaxies and galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Connection between galaxy morphology and dark-matter halo structure I: a running threshold for thin discs and size predictors from the dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the connection between galaxy morphology and host dark matter (DM) halo structure using cosmological simulations. Introducing a new kinematic decomposition scheme, we robustly separate thin and thick discs and measure halo properties, including cosmic web locations, internal structures, and assembly histories. In the TNG50 simulation, we find that the orbital-circularity threshold for disc differentiation varies systematically with galaxy mass and redshift. Similarly, the energy threshold between stellar halos and inner galaxies depends on mass and redshift, minimizing at sub-Galactic halo mass where the circularity threshold approaches its peak. Revisiting galaxy size predictors, we show that disc sizes in TNG50 correlate with three structural parameters beyond virial mass and redshift: 1) a positive correlation with halo spin $\lambda$ across redshifts -- stronger than previously reported for zoom-in simulations but still weaker than the simple $r_{1/2}/R_{\rm vir} \propto \lambda$ scaling; 2) an anti-correlation with DM concentration $c$; 3) larger discs in more actively accreting haloes. Disc mass fraction is higher in rounder haloes and in cosmic knots and filaments, implying that disc development needs both stable halo conditions and continuous material supply. Our methodology is public and adaptable to other simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge-on galaxies have many important applications in galactic astrophysics, but they can be difficult to identify in vast amounts of astronomical data. To facilitate the search for them, we have developed a deep learning algorithm designed to identify and extract edge-on galaxies from astronomical images. We utilised a sample of edge-on spiral galaxies from the Galaxy Zoo database, retrieving the corresponding images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our dataset comprises approximately $16,000$ galaxies, which we used to train the YOLOv5 algorithm for detection purposes. To isolate galaxies from their backgrounds, we trained the SCSS-Net neural network to generate segmentation masks. As a result, our algorithm detected $8,000$ edge-on galaxies, for which we compiled a catalogue including their parameters obtained from the SDSS database. We describe the basic properties of our sample, finding that most galaxies have redshifts $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.10$, have low values of $b/a$ and are mostly red, which is expected from edge-on galaxies and is consistent with our training sample, as well as other literature. The cutouts of the detected galaxies can be used for future studies and the algorithm can be applied to data from future surveys as well.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting cosmic filaments in Lyman-alpha emission across redshifts $z=2-5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard $\rm \Lambda$CDM cosmological model predicts that a large amount of diffuse neutral hydrogen distributes in cosmic filaments, which could be mapped through Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emission observations. We use the hydrodynamical simulation Illustris-TNG50 to investigate the evolution of surface brightness and detectability of neutral hydrogen in cosmic filaments across redshifts $z=2-5$. While the HI column density of cosmic filaments decreases with redshift, due to the rising temperature with cosmic time in filaments, the surface brightness of Ly$\alpha$ emission in filaments is brighter at lower redshifts, suggesting that the detection of cosmic filaments is more feasible at lower redshifts. However, most of the Ly$\alpha$ emission from cosmic filaments is around $10^{-21}$ $\rm erg\ s^{-1}cm^{-2}arsec^{-2}$, making it extremely challenging to detect with current observational instruments. We further generate mock images using the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) spectrograph installed on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and a MUSE-like spectrograph on the upcoming Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Our finding indicates that while the VLT can only detect filamentary structures made of dense gas in galactic centers, the ELT is expected to reveal much finer filamentary structures from diffuse neutral hydrogen outside of galaxies. Compared to the VLT, both the number density and the longest length of filaments are greatly boosted with the ELT. Hence the forthcoming ELT is highly promising to provide a clearer view of cosmic filaments in Ly$\alpha$ emission.</description>

      <title>The GHOSDT Simulations (Galaxy Hydrodynamical Simulations with Supernova-Driven Turbulence) -- I. Magnetic Support in Gas Rich Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxies at redshift $z\sim 1-2$ display high star formation rates (SFRs) with elevated cold gas fractions and column densities. Simulating a self-regulated ISM in a hydrodynamical, self-consistent context, has proven challenging due to strong outflows triggered by supernova (SN) feedback. At sufficiently high gas column densities, if magnetic fields or other mitigating measures are not implemented, these outflows can prevent a quasi-steady disk from forming for several 100 Myr. To this end, we present GHOSDT, a suite of magneto-hydrodynamical simulations that implement ISM physics at high resolution. We demonstrate that magnetic pressure is important in the dense ISM of gas-rich star-forming disks. We show that a relation between the magnetic field and gas surface density emerges naturally from our simulations. We argue that the magnetic field in the dense, star-forming gas, may be set by the SN-driven turbulent gas motions. When compared to pure hydrodynamical runs, we find that the inclusion of magnetic fields increases the cold gas fraction by up to 40\%, reduces the disc scale height by up to a factor of $\sim 2$, and reduces the star formation burstiness. In dense ($n&gt;100\;\rm{cm}^{-3}$) gas, we find steady-state magnetic field strengths of 10--40 $\mu$G, comparable to those observed in Galactic molecular clouds. Finally, we demonstrate that our simulation framework is consistent with the Ostriker et al. (2022) Pressure Regulated Feedback Modulated Theory of star formation and stellar feedback.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CHANCES, the CHileAN Cluster galaxy Evolution Survey, will study the evolution of galaxies in and around 100 massive galaxy clusters from the local Universe out to $z = 0.45$, and two superclusters at $z \sim 0.05$ that contain roughly 25 Abell clusters each. CHANCES will use the new 4MOST Spectroscopic Survey Facility on the VISTA 4m telescope to obtain spectra for $\sim$500,000 galaxies with magnitudes $r_\mathrm{AB} &lt; 20.4$, providing comprehensive spectroscopic coverage of each cluster out to $5r_{200}$. Its wide and deep scope will trace massive and dwarf galaxies from the surrounding filaments and groups to the cores of galaxy clusters. This will enable the study of galaxy preprocessing and of the role of the evolving environment on galaxy evolution. In this paper, we present and characterise the sample of clusters and superclusters to be targeted by CHANCES. We used literature catalogues based on X-ray emission and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect to define the cluster sample in a homogeneous way, with attention to cluster mass and redshift, as well as the availability of ancillary data. We calibrated literature mass estimates from various surveys against each other and provide an initial mass estimate for each cluster, which we used to define the radial extent of the 4MOST coverage. We also present an initial assessment of the structure surrounding these clusters based on the redMaPPer red-sequence algorithm as a preview of some of the science CHANCES will enable.</description>

      <title>Photometric vs dynamical stellar masses and their impact on scaling relations in nearby disc galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of scaling relations of disc galaxies and their evolution across cosmic time requires accurate estimates of galaxy stellar masses $M_\star$ over broad redshift ranges. While photometric $M_\star$ estimates ($M_{\rm phot}$) based on spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling methods are employed routinely at high-$z$, it is unclear to what extent these are compatible with dynamical $M_\star$ estimates ($M_{\rm dyn}$), available for nearby galaxies. Here we compare newly determined, SED-model based $M_{\rm phot}$ with previously obtained $M_{\rm dyn}$ inferred via rotation curve decomposition techniques in a sample of $\sim100$ nearby galaxies from the SPARC database. We find that the two mass estimates show a systematic agreement at the $\sim12\%$ ($0.05$ dex) level and a $\sim55\%$ ($0.22$ dex) scatter across almost $5$ dex in $M_\star$. Our $M_{\rm phot}$ estimates correspond to mass-to-light ratios in the $3.6\mu$m band that increase gradually with $3.6\mu$m luminosity, as a consequence of the earlier (later) assembly history of high-mass (low-mass) disc galaxies. The choice of using either $M_{\rm dyn}$ or $M_{\rm phot}$ has only a marginal impact on the slope and zero-point of the Tully-Fisher and Fall relations: the observed orthogonal scatter in both relations is virtually the same for the two methods, and indistinguishable from that derived using a constant mass-to-light ratio in the $3.6\mu$m band. $M_\star$ estimates based on the assumption that discs are marginally stable lead to the largest scatter in the scaling relations.</description>

      <title>Evolution of massive quiescent galaxies via envelope accretion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift are significantly more compact than their present-day counterparts. We investigate the roles, in determining this evolution, of major and minor mergers, and of the accretion of diffuse envelopes of stars and dark matter. We model the evolution in stellar mass ($M_\star$), effective radius ($R_{\rm e}$), and effective stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm e}$) of a representative massive quiescent galaxy from $z\approx 3$ to $z\approx 0$, and compare the model with the observed redshift-dependent $R_{\rm e}$-$M_\star$ and $\sigma_{\rm e}$-$M_\star$ relations. In the model we account for the effects of collisionless (dry) major (satellite-to-main galaxy mass ratio $\xi&gt;1/4$) and minor ($1/10&lt;\xi&lt;1/4$) mergers, using analytic recipes consistent with the results of $N$-body simulations of binary mergers. For the poorly constrained mini mergers ($\xi&lt;1/10$) we explore both a 'standard' model (based on the same assumptions used in the case of higher-$\xi$ mergers), and a heuristic 'envelope accretion' model, aimed at describing the case in which diffuse satellites are completely disrupted in the galaxy outskirts. Major and minor dry mergers, at rates estimated observationally from galaxy-pair counts, induce relatively small variations in $R_{\rm e}$ and $\sigma_{\rm e}$, accounting only for $\approx 6\% $ of the size evolution and $\approx 40\%$ of the velocity-dispersion evolution observed from $z\approx 3$ to $z\approx 0$. As an addition to major and minor dry mergers, envelope accretion performs better than standard mini mergers at reproducing the redshift-dependence of the $R_{\rm e}$-$M_\star$ and $\sigma_{\rm e}$-$M_\star$ relations, being also consistent with plausible evolutionary scenarios of scaling relations involving the mass of the central supermassive black hole.</description>

      <title>Classifying spectra of emission-line regions with neural networks -- An application to integral field spectroscopic data of M33</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emission-line regions are key to understanding the properties of galaxies, as they trace the exchange of matter and energy between stars and the interstellar medium (ISM). In nearby galaxies, individual nebulae can be identified as HII regions, planetary nebulae (PNe), supernova remnants (SNR), and diffuse ionised gas (DIG) with criteria on single or multiple emission-line ratios. However, these methods are limited by rigid classification boundaries, the narrow scope of information they are based upon, and the inability to account for line-of-sight nebular superpositions. In this work, we use artificial neural networks to classify these regions using their optical spectra. Our training set consists of simulated spectra, obtained from photoionisation and shock models, and processed to match observations obtained with MUSE. We evaluate the performance of the network on simulated spectra for a range of signal-to-noise (S/N) levels and dust extinction, and the superposition of different nebulae along the line of sight. At infinite S/N the network achieves perfect predictive performance, while as the S/N decreases, the classification accuracy declines, reaching an average of ~80% at S/N(H$\alpha$)=20. We apply our model to real spectra from MUSE observations of the galaxy M33, where it provides a robust classification of individual spaxels, even at low S/N, identifying HII regions and PNe and distinguishing them from SNRs and diffuse ionized gas, while identifying overlapping nebulae. We then compare the network's classification with traditional diagnostics and find satisfactory agreement. Using activation maximisation maps, we find that at high S/N the model mainly relies on weak lines (e.g. auroral lines of metal ions and He recombination lines), while at the S/N level typical of our dataset the model effectively emulates traditional diagnostic methods by leveraging strong nebular lines.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Relationship Between Stellar Mass, Metallicity, and Star Formation Rate at $z \sim 2.3$ in KBSS-MOSFIRE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10800</link>

Abstract: The metal enrichment of a galaxy is determined by the cycle of baryons in outflows, inflows, and star formation. The relative contribution and timescale of each process sets the relationship between stellar mass, metallicity, and the star formation rate (SFR). In the local universe, galaxies evolve in an equilibrium state where the timescales on which SFR and metallicity vary are comparable, and define a surface in mass-metallicity-SFR space known as the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR). However, high-redshift observations suggest that this state of equilibrium may not persist throughout cosmic time. Using galaxies from the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS) observed with MOSFIRE, we explore the relationship between stellar mass, gas-phase oxygen abundance, and SFR at $z \sim 2.3$. Across strong-line calibrations and SFR calculation methods, KBSS galaxies are inconsistent with the locally-defined FMR. We use both parametric and non-parametric methods of exploring a mass-metallicity-SFR relation. When using a parametric approach, we find no significant reduction mass-metallicity relation scatter when folding in SFR as a third parameter, although a non-parametric approach reveals that there could be a weak, redshift-dependent anticorrelation between residual gas-phase oxygen abundance, and SFR. Injection-recovery tests show that a significant reduction in scatter requires a stronger anticorrelation between SFR and residual metallicity. Our results suggest that the local FMR may not persist to $z \sim 2.3$, implying that $z \sim 2.3$ galaxies may not be in the equilibrium state described by the FMR and are more similar to higher redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>The BLOBs: Enigmatic Diffuse Ionized Gas Structures in a Cluster of Galaxies near Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the massive cluster XMMXCS J2215.9-1738 at z about 1.46 with MUSE and KMOS integral field spectroscopy. Using MUSE spectroscopy we traced the kinematics of the ionized gas using [OII] in the central 500x500 square kpc area of the cluster, which contains 28 spectroscopically identified cluster galaxies. We detected [OII] emission lines in the integrated spectra of 21 galaxies. The remaining seven are passive galaxies. Six of these passive galaxies lie in the central part of the cluster, which has a diameter of 200 kpc and which contains no star-forming objects. In this place star-formation in galaxies is quenched. An interesting discovery in this central area of the cluster are three diffuse ionized [OII] gas structures, which we refer to as [OII] blobs. They extend over areas of some hundred square kpc. The ionization source of one of the gaseous structures that displays two prominent filamentary patterns indicating outflow of gas is an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The KMOS data enabled us to use the BPT diagram to identify this object as a type 2 AGN. The other two diffuse ionized oxygen gaseous structures are more enigmatic. They are located between the stellar components of passive cluster galaxies. One of these blobs lacks a stellar counterpart in the HST optical and near-infrared data, and the other blob has only a very faint counterpart. Ram-pressure stripping of photoionized gas or AGN feedback might be an explanation. Additionally, the galaxy velocity distribution in this high-redshift cluster is bimodal, which indicates that the cluster is probably not fully virialized and that recent and ongoing merging events that produced shocks might provide photoionization sources for the two enigmatic [OII] blobs.</description>

      <title>Identifying Dwarfs of MC Analog GalaxiEs (ID-MAGE): The Search for Satellites Around Low-Mass Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from ID-MAGE (Identifying Dwarfs of MC Analog GalaxiEs), a survey aimed at identifying and characterizing unresolved satellite galaxies around 36~nearby LMC- and SMC-mass hosts (D$=$4$-$10~Mpc). We use archival DESI Legacy Survey imaging data and perform an extensive search for dwarf satellites, extending out to a radius of 150~kpc ($\sim$$R_{vir}$). We identify \tot candidate satellite galaxies, including \new new discoveries. Extensive tests with injected galaxies demonstrate that the survey is complete down to $M_V\sim-$9.0 (assuming the distance of the host) and $\mu_{0,V}\sim$26 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ (assuming a n$=$1 S\'ersic profile). We perform consistent photometry, via S\'ersic profile fitting, on all candidates and have initiated a comprehensive follow-up campaign to confirm and characterize candidates. Through a systematic visual inspection campaign, we classify the top candidates as high-likelihood satellites. On average, we find 4.0$\pm$1.4 high-likelihood candidate satellites per LMC-mass host and 2.0$\pm$0.6 per SMC-mass host which is within the range predicted by cosmological models. We use this sample to establish upper and lower estimates on the satellite luminosity function of LMC/SMC-mass galaxies. ID-MAGE nearly triples the number of low-mass galaxies surveyed for satellites with well-characterized completeness limits, providing a unique dataset to explore small-scale structure and dwarf galaxy evolution around low-mass hosts in diverse environments.</description>

      <title>The Role of Magnetic Fields in the Formation of High-Mass Star-Forming Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are often invoked as playing a primary role in star formation and in the formation of high-mass stars. We investigate the effect of magnetic fields on the formation of high-mass cores using the 3-dimensional smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) code PHANTOM. We follow the collapse of six molecular clouds of mass 1000 M$_{\odot}$, four of which are initially magnetized with mass-to-flux ratios 3, 5, 10 and 100, respectively, and two purely hydrodynamic clouds with varying initial strengths of turbulence. We then apply an in-house clump-finding algorithm to the 3D SPH data in order to quantify the differences in mass and properties of the cores across the degrees of magnetic and turbulent support. We find that although the magnetic fields cause differences in the global cloud evolution, the masses and properties of the cores which form are broadly similar across the different initial conditions. Cores initially form with masses comparable to the initial thermal Jeans mass of the clouds, and then slowly increase in mass with time. We find that regardless of initial magnetization, the fields become dynamically relevant at densities of $\rho &gt; 1\times10^{-17}$ g cm$^{-3}$ - comparable to core densities - and channel material along the field lines, decreasing the stable magnetic Jeans mass, such that the limiting factor for fragmentation is the thermal Jeans mass. We conclude that magnetic fields are not capable of forming and supporting initially high-mass cores against fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sub-resolution star formation models in cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the crucial components in simulating the growth and evolution of galaxies within a cosmological framework is the modeling of star formation (SF) and its corresponding feedback. Traditionally, the implemented SF law follows the empirical Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, which links the SF rate (SFR) in a gas element to the total gas density. More recently, an even stronger correlation has been observed between the SFR and the amount of molecular hydrogen ($\mathrm{H}_2$). This opens up the question of whether molecular hydrogen is a necessary precursor for SF or is instead a tracer of the total amount of gas, both of which would explain the observed correlations. In this study, we examine the impact of using an $\mathrm{H}_2$-based SF law on the formation of Milky Way-mass galaxies using cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the galaxy modeled with our approach exhibits a well-defined, disc-like morphology. Compared to the traditional recipe, our model delays the onset of SF by approximately $500 \, \mathrm{Myr}$ resulting in a lower SFR, a smaller disc size, and a higher proportion of neutral to ionized gas within the disc region. These findings highlight the importance of including sophisticated SF models which can be compared to several observations -- including those related to $\mathrm{H}_2$ -- to better understand the processes affecting galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Revealing EMRI/IMRI candidates with quasiperiodic ultrafast outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first detection of the quasiperiodic ultrafast outflow in the ASASSN-20qc system was reported by Pasham et al. (2024). The outflow is revealed in the soft X-ray spectra as an absorption feature, which is enhanced periodically every $\sim 8.3$ days. The repetitive nature of the ultrafast outflow is tentatively explained by an orbiting massive perturber, possibly an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH), trajectory of which is inclined with respect to the accretion flow around the primary supermassive black hole (SMBH). In this scenario, the orbiting body pushes the disc gas into the outflow funnel, where it is accelerated by the ordered magnetic field (Sukov\'a et al. 2021). Quasiperiodic ultrafast outflows (a.k.a. QPOuts) are thus a novel phenomenon that can help reveal new extreme-/intermediate-mass ratio inspiral (EMRI/IMRI) candidates. These then would be prime candidate sources for a simultaneous detection and monitoring in electromagnetic as well as gravitational wave domains.</description>

      <title>Probing dark matter halo profiles with multi-band observations of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the potential of multiband gravitational wave observations from a deci-Hz space-based detector and third-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors to constrain the properties of dark matter spikes around intermediate-mass ratio inspirals. The presence of dark matter influences the orbital evolution of the secondary compact object through dynamic friction, which leads to a phase shift in the gravitational waveform compared to the vacuum case. Our analysis shows that the proposed Indian space-based detector GWSat, operating in the deciHz frequency band, provides the most stringent constraints on the dark matter spike parameters, as IMRIs spend a significant portion of their inspiral phase within its sensitivity range. While third-generation ground-based detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer offer additional constraints, their contribution is somewhat limited, particularly for higher-mass systems where the signal duration in their frequency bands is shorter. However, for systems with detector-frame total masses $M_z &lt; 400 \rm M_{\odot}$, Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope could improve the estimation of the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, luminosity distance, and dark matter spike power-law index by more than $15\%$. Nonetheless, their impact on the constraint of spike density is minimal. These results highlight the crucial role of deciHz space-based detectors in probing dark matter interactions with gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the origin of fast radio bursts by modeling the stellar mass and star formation distributions of their host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diverse formation channels have been proposed to explain the emergence of fast radio bursts (FRBs), yet their origin remains elusive. With improved localization precision, roughly 90 FRBs are now associated with host galaxies. SED fitting to the host galaxy photometry reveals their stellar masses ($M_\star$) and star formation rates (SFRs), enabling discrimination between various formation channels. We conduct an extensive comparison of the stellar mass, SFR and z distributions of 51 FRB hosts and mock-generated galaxy samples to test whether FRBs trace SFR or $M_\star$. We incorporate a mass-to-light ratio prescription to address optical selection biases. In line with Sharma et al. (2024), we provide evidence in favor of FRB progenitors tracking SF rather than stellar mass. We show that the shape of the assumed $(M_\star/L_r)_{obs}$ distribution affects the predictions, bringing the low mass end of the stellar mass distribution closer to the data when accounting for the $\mathrm{SFR} - (M_\star/L_r)_{obs}$ correlation. The K-correction effect in the $r-$band is minimal for galaxies at $z \lesssim 0.7$. Even if FRBs trace SF, up to $\sim 6\%$ of a flux-limited FRB host sample can reside below the star-forming main sequence. Finally, we examine a hybrid model in which a fraction of FRBs tracks stellar mass rather than SF. This fraction can be as large as $\sim(40-50)\%$, suggesting that multiple formation channels are still consistent with observations. The toolkit developed in this work is publicly available (GALFRB code), offering a straightforward way to generate mock galaxy samples suitable for direct comparisons with future FRB host galaxy data.</description>
