      <title>Non-ideal subthreshold swing in aligned carbon nanotube transistors due to variable occupancy discrete charge traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon nanotube transistors have been experimentally demonstrated to reach performance comparable and even surpassing that of silicon transistors. Further improvement requires addressing non-idealities arising from device fabrication that impact performance and reproducibility. One performance metric that determines energy efficiency is the subthreshold swing which is often observed to be 3-4 times larger than the ideal thermal limit. In this work, we present simulations indicating that a discrete number of variable occupancy hole trapping sites can explain the large subthreshold swing. Our simulations indicate that while three-dimensional trap distributions influence the subthreshold swing, only the traps in close proximity to the nanotubes have a significant impact. The results suggest that a density of trapping sites on the order of 0.5/nm$^2$ near the nanotubes is sufficient to significantly increase the subthreshold swing, requiring the removal or passivation of only a few sites per carbon nanotube.</description>

      <title>Propagating Neutral Modes in an Intervalley Coherent State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of neutral collective modes is a hallmark of correlated quantum phases but is often challenging to probe experimentally. In two-dimensional flatband systems, charge responses have been intensively investigated, yet neutral excitations remain largely unexplored. In particular, intervalley coherent state (IVC) features a neutral Goldstone mode due to spontaneously broken valley U(1) symmetry. While IVC state has been proposed as a unifying theme across graphene- and semiconductor-based systems, its defining feature - the neutral Goldstone mode - remains elusive in experiment. Here we investigate space-and-time-resolved transport of neutral modes in twisted WSe2 moir\'e superlattices through a novel ultrafast imaging technique. We uncover two new propagating collective modes with very different velocities, which emerge near the van Hove singularity (VHS) in both intermediate- (3.5~4 degree) and large-angle (~5 degree) twisted WSe2. The fast-propagating mode has a surprisingly large speed of ~3 km/s and is consistent with a Goldstone mode for an IVC state, while the slow-moving mode is likely a gapped amplitude mode. They can be understood as the spin-valley analogues of collective modes of a superfluid, whose propagation are imaged for the first time in a condensed matter system. Our study sets a new paradigm for probing charge-neutral modes in quantum materials and offers key insights into the interplay between charge and spin-valley physics in moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <title>Topological magneto-optics in the non-coplanar antiferromagnet Co_{1/3}NbS_2: Imaging and writing chiral magnetic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its tiny net magnetization, the antiferromagnetic (AFM) van der Waals material Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ exhibits a large transverse Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ even at zero applied magnetic field, which arises, as recently shown, from the topological nature of its non-coplanar ``tetrahedral'' AFM order. This triple-Q magnetic order can be regarded as the short-lengthscale limit of a magnetic skyrmion lattice, and has an intrinsic spin chirality. Here we show, using optical wavelengths spanning the ultraviolet to infrared (400-1000 nm), that magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) provides an incisive optical probe of the topological AFM order in Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$. Measurements as a continuous function of photon energy are directly compared with first-principles calculations, revealing the influence of the underlying quantum geometry on optical conductivity. Leveraging the power and flexibility of optical methods, we use scanning MCD microscopy to directly image chiral AFM domains, and demonstrate writing of chiral AFM domains.</description>

      <title>Real-space second Chern number using the kernel polynomial method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the real-space second Chern number of four-dimensional Chern insulators using the kernel polynomial method. Our calculations are performed on a four-dimensional system with $30^4$ sites, and the numerical results agree well with theoretical expectations. Moreover, we show that the method is capable of capturing the disorder effects. This is evidenced by the phase diagram obtained for disordered systems, which agrees well with predictions from the self-consistent Born approximation. Furthermore, we extend the method to six dimensions and perform an exploratory real-space calculation of the third Chern number. Although finite-size effects prevent full quantization, the numerical results show qualitative agreement with theoretical expectations. The study represents a step forward in the real-space characterization of higher-dimensional topological phases.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient coherent amplification of zero-field spin waves in YIG nano-waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission and processing of information at the nanoscale using spin waves and their quanta - magnons, offers numerous advantages and opportunities that make it a promising next-generation technology for integrated electronics. The main challenges that still need to be addressed to ensure high competitiveness of magnonic devices include finding ways to efficiently amplify spin waves in nanostructures and developing nanocircuits that can operate without the need for an external bias magnetic field. Here we demonstrate how these two challenges can be solved using nano-waveguides fabricated from a low-loss magnetic insulator. We show that by using local parametric pumping with a power of only a few milliwatts, one can achieve coherent amplification of spin-wave pulses by more than two orders of magnitude at zero bias magnetic field. Our results provide a simple solution to problems that have long prevented the implementation of efficient integrated magnonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Sensing magnonic quantum superpositions using a bosonic mode as the probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing quantum superpositions of a magnonic mode has been accomplished using a superconducting qubit by realizing an effective dispersive interaction between the two systems. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that a seemingly classical bosonic mode can be utilized as a probe for sensing quantum superpositions of a magnon mode, while outperforming a qubit in various regards as the sensor. Considering another magnon mode in an antiferromagnet as the probe mode, we delineate the required dispersive coupling emerging directly from antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. When a phonon is used as the probe mode, we derive the effective dispersive coupling emerging from the lowest-order nonlinear magnon-phonon interactions. Our two considered examples provide the general design principles for identifying and utilizing a bosonic probe mode for sensing quantum superpositions in a physical platform of interest.</description>

      <title>Dirac points annihilation and its obstruction characterized by Euler number and quaternionic charges in kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological phenomenon of Dirac point annihilation and its obstruction in three-band, real symmetric Hamiltonians with time-reversal symmetry, and their relation to the Euler number, a well-known topological invariant. For this purpose, we study the example of the kagome lattice using a simple tight-binding model. By tuning the parameters of the lattice continuously, we illustrate situations where two Dirac points are able to annihilate, and others, where this annihilation is topologically obstructed. For a system with no gaps between the three bands, like in the kagome lattice, the Euler number of two bands is ill-defined on the whole Brillouin zone, which requires the introduction of the so-called ``patch" Euler number on a subregion without additional degeneracies coming from the third band. A non-zero patch Euler number means that the annihilation of the Dirac points is impossible. We also illustrate another point of view, using homotopy theory, associating the Dirac points with quaternionic charges. We prove that the non-abelian braiding of the Dirac points in k-space conjugates their quaternionic charge and explains the possible obstruction to the annihilation of Dirac points. Finally, we show that the proposed deformation of the kagome lattice can be achieved in realistic photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Droplets of Light in Semiconductor Microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum droplets are dilute self-bound configurations of bosons that result from the balance between a mean-field attraction and a repulsion induced by quantum fluctuations. Such droplets have been successfully realized in cold atomic gases and represent a signature of their quantum nature. Here, we predict the existence of a similar droplet phase in a solid-state system, involving polaritons formed from the strong coupling between excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) and photons in a semiconductor microcavity. We consider a spin mixture of exciton-polaritons near a biexciton Feshbach resonance, which allows one to tune the interspecies interactions to be attractive and comparable in magnitude to the intraspecies repulsion. We find that self-bound quantum droplets are achievable for realistic parameters in atomically thin semiconductors, and that they can be detected via their excitation spectrum and spatial profile. This exotic phase could potentially lead to polariton condensation at lower thresholds and it opens an alternative avenue to achieve the long-sought quantum polaritonic regime.</description>

      <title>Measurement and Qualitative Explanation of Decay Lengths of Attractive and Repulsive Forces between Natural and Artificial Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial atoms, such as quantum corrals, offer an excellent platform to study fundamental interactions between localized quantum states and nanoscale probes. We performed atomic force microscopy measurements inside square quantum corrals on Cu(111) using CO- and metal-terminated tips. Using chemically unreactive CO-terminated tips repulsive Pauli forces can be probed, while metallic tips are attracted to the localized quantum states due to chemical bonding. We found distinct exponential decay constants of 46 pm for the repulsive and 66 pm for the attractive forces. Attractive and repulsive interactions between two natural atoms show significantly shorter decay lengths. While natural atoms feature states with a broad range of decay lengths, including very short ones from deeply bound states, quantum corrals are lacking such deeply bound and highly localized states, resulting in longer decay lengths. These results offer a new route to understand and design atomic-scale interactions in low-dimensional quantum structures and devices.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Fingerprint of Chiral Superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral superconductors have long been theorized to break time-reversal symmetry and support exotic topological features such as Majorana modes and spontaneous edge currents, promising ingredients for quantum technologies. Although several unconventional superconductors may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking, clear microscopic evidence of chiral pairing has remained out of reach. In this work, we demonstrate direct real-space signatures of chiral superconductivity in a single atomic layer of tin on Si(111). Using quasiparticle interference imaging, we detected symmetry-locked nodal and antinodal points in the Bogoliubov quasiparticle wavefunction, tightly bound to atomic point defects in the tin lattice. These nodal features, along with their surrounding texture, form a distinct real-space pattern exhibiting a clear and exclusive hallmark of chiral superconductivity. Our findings, reinforced by analytical theory and numerical simulations, offer unambiguous evidence of chiral pairing in a two-dimensional material.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Induced Nonlinear Transport in LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental measurements of the nonlinear longitudinal resistance of the spin-orbit coupled electron gas in the (111) LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces under external in-plane magnetic field [G. Tuvia \emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 146301 (2024)], we formulate a theory of nonlinear electronic transport based on the analysis of the quantum kinetic equation for the Wigner distribution function. Specifically, we evaluate the magnetic field dependence of the second harmonic of the current density at arbitrary values of the magnetic field. The magnitude of the second harmonic increases linearly with the magnetic field at small fields. Upon further increase of the magnetic field, the second harmonic response reaches its maximum value. We find that the position of the peak and its width strongly depend on the relaxation rate due to disorder. Importantly, we discover that the direction of the nonlinear contribution to the current can be completely reversed when the magnetic field reaches a certain critical value.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Heterogeneity of Hydrogen in Metal Hydrides Revealed by Electron Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen plays critical roles in materials science, particularly for advancing technologies in hydrogen storage and phase manipulation, while also posing challenges like hydrogen embrittlement. Understanding its behavior, vital for improving material properties, requires precise determination of atomic-scale distribution-a persistent challenge due to hydrogen's weak electron scattering and high mobility, as well as the limitations of conventional transmission electron microscopy. We demonstrate that multislice electron ptychography (MEP) overcomes these constraints through three key advances: exceptional sensitivity for hydrogen occupancy, three-dimensional quantification, and picometer-level precision in atomic positioning. Experimentally, MEP resolves heterogeneous hydrogen distributions and quantifies hydrogen-induced lattice displacements with picometer precision in multi-principal-element alloy hydrides. This work demonstrates MEP as a transformative method for directly probing hydrogen atoms in solids, unlocking fundamental understanding of hydrogen's impact on material properties.</description>

      <title>The Josephson effect in Fibonacci superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the Josephson effect between two proximized Fibonacci quasicrystals. A quasiperiodic modulation of the chemical potential on a superconducting substrate induces topological gaps and edge modes with energies above the superconducting gap. We reveal that these edge modes develop superconducting correlations which significantly impact the Josephson current, and we term them Fibonacci-Andreev bound states. Notably, the contribution from these edge modes can be controlled by the Fibonacci sequence arrangement, known as phason angle, and can dominate the Josephson effect over the conventional subgap Andreev bound states in short junctions. The interplay between the Josephson effect and nontrivial edge modes in quasiperiodic systems presents new opportunities for exploring exotic superconducting phenomena in quasicrystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The germanium vacancy in diamond (GeV) is a promising candidate for color center based quantum networking. Yet, like for other group-IV vacancy defects in diamond, achieving fast, high-fidelity qubit operations using traditional magnetic resonance techniques is experimentally challenging due to a weak magnetic dipole and susceptibility to thermally induced decoherence. Here, we perform all-optical control of the GeV and realize Rabi frequencies exceeding $\sim 20$~MHz. We do so by driving the two $\Lambda$-systems of the GeV simultaneously and apply this to probe the spin coherence ($T_2^*=224\pm14$~ns, $T_2^{\rm H}=11.9\pm0.3$~$\mu$s). Our control scheme is applicable to other color centers and particularly, other group-IV defects for which, the scheme may be optimized to improve all-optical control in these systems.</description>

Abstract: The combination of superconductivity and quantum Hall (QH) effect is regarded as a key milestone in advancing topological quantum computation in solid-state systems. Recent quantum interference studies suggest that QH edge states can effectively mediate a supercurrent across high-quality graphene weak links. In this work we report the observation of a supercurrent associated with transitions between adjacent QH plateaus, where transport paths develop within the compressible two-dimensional bulk. We employ a back-gated graphene Josephson junction, comprising high-mobility CVD-grown graphene encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) and contacted by Nb leads. Superconducting pockets are detected persisting beyond the QH onset, up to 2.4 T, hence approaching the upper critical field of the Nb contacts. We observe an approximate $\Phi_0=h/2e$ periodicity of the QH-supercurrent as a function of the magnetic field, indicating superconducting interference in a proximitized percolative phase. These results provide a promising experimental platform to investigate the transport regime of percolative supercurrents, leveraging the flexibility of van der Waals devices.</description>

      <title>Wavefunctions and oscillator strengths of Rydberg excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the eigenstates, that is, the wavefunctions of Rydberg excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells and derive expressions relating them to the oscillator strengths of different exciton states. Using the B-spline expansion, we compute the wavefunctions in coordinate space and estimate the oscillator strengths. The symmetry properties of the states and the non-separability of the wavefunctions are illustrated. Wavefunctions associated with resonances above the scattering threshold, in particular those of bound states in the continuum as well as their partner states, are also given.</description>

      <title>Spin current compensation from competing magnon modes in ferrimagnets</title>

Abstract: We investigate thermal spin pumping in gadolinium iron garnet (GdIG), focusing on the mode-resolved dynamics of antiferromagnetic magnons and their impact on spin and heat transport. Antiferromagnets support both right-handed and left-handed magnon modes, which we treat as positive and negative frequency branches, analogous to electrons and holes in semiconductors. Using a two-sublattice model with a minimal exchange interaction scheme, we derive the temperature-dependent spin-wave spectrum and evaluate the associated thermal spin pumping coefficients. Our analysis reveals that the competition between left- and right-handed modes gives rise to a compensation temperature, where the net thermally generated spin current vanishes. Importantly, we show that this compensation point does not necessarily coincide with the crossing of magnon dispersion branches. While previous research considers a detailed microscopic model including all magnetic sublattices and exchange couplings, our approach demonstrates that key features of mode-resolved spin transport can be captured by a simplified and analytically transparent model. These findings advance the understanding of spin-caloritronic phenomena in ferrimagnets and offer new perspectives for the design of chiral magnon-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Dynamic annihilation pathways of magnetic skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The investigation of magnetic solitons often relies on numerical modeling to determine key features such as stability, annihilation, nucleation, and motion. However, as soliton sizes approach atomic length scales, the accuracy of these predictions become increasingly sensitive to the details of the numerical model. Here, we study the annihilation of two-dimensional magnetic skyrmions using a pseudospectral approach and compare its performance to that of conventional micromagnetic simulations. A central distinction between the models lies in their treatment of the exchange interaction, which governs the magnon dispersion relation and plays a crucial role to balance the uniaxial anisotropy to stabilise skyrmions. We demonstrate that both the choice of model and spatial discretisation significantly influence the skyrmion dynamics and the magnetic field required for annihilation. The pseudospectral model provides a consistent description across length scales and captures complex behaviours such as skyrmion breathing on its path to annihilation. Our results have direct implications in the state-of-the-art modeling of skyrmions and other two-dimensional textures and will impact the modeling of three-dimensional textures such as hopfions. More broadly, our approach will contribute to the development seamless multiscale model and optimization machine learning approaches for material discovery.</description>

      <title>Universal cooling of quantum systems via randomized measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing cooling protocols is believed to require knowledge of the system spectrum. In contrast, cooling in nature occurs whenever the system is coupled to a cold bath. How does nature know how to cool? A natural cold bath can be mimicked with a reservoir of "meter" qubits that are initialized in their ground state. We show that a quantum system can be cooled without knowledge of system details when system-meter interactions and meter splittings are chosen randomly. For sufficiently small interaction strengths and long interaction times, the protocol ensures that resonant energy-exchange processes, leading to cooling, dominate over heating. Effectively, the dynamics is then captured by the rotating-wave approximation, which we identify as the basic mechanism for robust and scalable cooling of complex quantum systems through generic, structure-independent protocols. This offers a versatile universal framework for controlling quantum matter far from equilibrium, in particular, for quantum computing and simulation.</description>

      <title>Weyl semimetal engineering by symmetry control in NiTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the emergence of Weyl points in an inversion symmetry-breaking 1T-NiTe$_2$ system. Through first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory combined with tight-binding methods, we find three distinct sets of Weyl crossings under an appropriate symmetry breaking. The first set, composed of four Weyl points, emerges from the Dirac semimetal. Surprisingly, the other two sets result in additional twenty-four Weyl crossings, depending on the weight of the symmetry breaking. We investigate the topological characteristics of the Weyl semimetals by computing the Weyl chirality, Berry curvature, and the evolution of Wannier charge centers. Additionally, the bulk-boundary correspondence has been shown by computing the Fermi arcs. Our results provide a way for creating and manipulating distinct sets of Weyl points with appropriate external control, which can be valuable for applications in Weyltronics.</description>
