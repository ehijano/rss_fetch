      <title>Exploring Thermalization and Multi-Freeze-Out Effects in Pb-Pb collisions Based on Tsallis pT Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates transverse-momentum (pT) distributions of pi-, pi+, K-, K+, p, pbar, K0s, and Lambda in several centrality classes of Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 2.76 TeV. The measured spectra are analyzed with the Tsallis non-extensive distribution, from which the effective temperature T, non-extensive parameter q, and the mean transverse momentum mean_pT are extracted for each particle species and centrality interval. To disentangle thermal and collective effects, the mean kinetic freeze-out temperature T0 is obtained from the intercept of the T-versus-mass relation, while the average transverse flow velocity betaT is extracted from the slope of mean_pT versus the mean moving mass for pions, kaons, and protons.
  The results show that T increases and q decreases with increasing centrality, indicating a hotter and more equilibrated system in central collisions. A clear mass dependence of T supports a multi-freeze-out scenario, with heavier particles decoupling earlier. Both T0 and betaT rise from peripheral to mid-central collisions before saturating toward central events, which may suggest the onset of collective behavior or changes in freeze-out dynamics. These observations provide new insights into the thermal and dynamical properties of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic time evolution of sound modes in Bjorken expanding holographic plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The speed of sound is a key parameter for characterizing equilibrium states. However, sound waves change their properties when propagating through rapidly evolving anisotropic media, such as the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions. This paper uses $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory to numerically study the time evolution of the speed and attenuation of sound modes along with the relaxation time in a plasma undergoing Bjorken expansion from various initial states in a quasi-static approximation. The longitudinal Bjorken expansion breaks the isotropy, resulting in two distinct sound speeds that range from just below the conformal value to the speed of light. An anisotropic hydrodynamic description is constructed and its applicability is discussed. Implications for the analysis of heavy ion data are considered.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Induced Nuclear De-Excitation at SBND with Ab Initio Nuclear Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the sensitivity of the Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND) experiment to light dark matter using MeV-scale electromagnetic activity. Inelastic scattering of dark matter with argon nuclei can excite nuclear states that subsequently de-excite via the emission of MeV-scale photons, producing localized low-energy "blip" signatures in a liquid argon time projection chamber. We perform state-of-the-art ab initio nuclear calculations, including all relevant argon excited states with energies up to 18 MeV, to provide reliable predictions for these signals. After accounting for relevant backgrounds, we find that SBND can probe previously unexplored regions of parameter space for light dark matter.</description>

      <title>Contact interaction treatment of the nucleon Faddeev equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working with a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector $\otimes$ vector contact interaction (SCI), a largely algebraic three-body Faddeev equation treatment of the nucleon bound state problem is introduced and used to deliver results for all nucleon charge and magnetisation distributions and their flavour separation. A strength of the SCI treatment is that it provides for a transparent understanding of this three-body approach to developing predictions for baryon observables. Comparisons of SCI results with predictions obtained in realistic-interaction Faddeev equation studies reveal the sensitivities of given observable to phenomena associated with the emergence of hadron mass.</description>

      <title>Jet-associated Balance Functions of Charged and Identified Hadrons in pp Collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV using PYTHIA8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of charge balance functions inside jets in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV using the PYTHIA8 event generator. The balance function is a differential observable of opposite-charge correlations, which is calculated in the jet frame for inclusive charged hadrons and the identified $\pi$, $K$, and $p$. The results show a clear narrowing of the balancing width with increasing jet charged multiplicity, indicating that particle production becomes more localized in momentum space in high-multiplicity jets.This trend resembles features attributed to collective expansion in heavy-ion collisions. The species dependence highlights sensitivity to the redistribution of strangeness and baryon number during string fragmentation and color reconnection. The new CR tune yields a little broader proton balance-function width in $\Delta\phi^{*}$ than CP5, hinting at enhanced baryon-production dynamics, whereas meson widths differ only mildly. These comparisons suggest that multiparton interactions and color reconnection contribute to the observed trends, potentially generating collective like features inside jets, especially in high multiplicity jets, via nontrivial color dynamics alongside standard fragmentation. Taken together, the results establish identified hadron balance functions in high multiplicity jets as a sensitive probe of hadronization and provide new constraints for models of small system collectivity.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Optimization of Detector-Grade Yield in High-Purity Germanium Crystal Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-purity germanium (HPGe) crystals underpin some of the most sensitive detectors used in fundamental physics and other high-resolution radiation-sensing applications. Despite their importance, the supply of detector-grade HPGe remains limited because achieving high yield in Czochralski growth (CZ) depends on tightly coupled, nonlinear processes, impurity incorporation, thermal gradients, and dynamic control settings that are largely mastered by only a handful of companies with decades of experience. Here we present a data-driven prediction framework based on a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network with multi-head attention, trained on time-resolved growth parameters (e.g., heater power, pull rate, and impurity indicators) from 48 independent crystal runs. The model predicts the final detector-grade fraction for each growth and, using SHAP feature-importance analysis, identifies impurity concentration and growth rate as the dominant factors governing yield, consistent with empirical understanding. By providing a quantitative, interpretable link between in-process signals and post-growth detector quality, this framework offers a practical path toward improving yield, reducing dependence on trial-and-error tuning, and scaling HPGe production for next-generation rare-event detectors.</description>

      <title>Does the suppression shown at LHC in O-O collisions follow the systematics obtained for A-A collisions ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present to what extent recent experimental results obtained for $\pi^{0}$ suppression in O-O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=5.36 TeV fit into the systematics for much heavier systems. The systematics with which the comparison is made was published a few years ago \cite{Pet_1} in terms of charged particles suppression $R_{AA}$ as a function of $\langle N_{part} \rangle$ and $\langle dN_{ch}/d\eta \rangle$. The values of $R_{AA}$ at $\langle dN_{ch}/d\eta\rangle$ and $\langle N_{part} \rangle$ experimentally measured and estimated by Glauber MC, respectively, for O-O collisions
  are in good agreement with the systematics obtained for
  A-A collisions.</description>

      <title>Momentum Flow Mechanisms and Color-Lorentz Forces on Quarks in the Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Momentum conservation in the nucleon is examined in terms of continuous flow of the momentum current density (or in short, momentum flow), which receives contributions from both kinetic motion and interacting forces involving quarks and gluons. While quarks conduct momentum flow through their kinetic motion and the gluon scalar (anomaly) contributes via pure interactions, the gluon stress tensor has both effects. The quarks momentum flow encodes the information of the color-Lorentz force density on them, and the momentum conservation allows to trace its origin to the gluon tensor and anomaly (a ``negative pressure'' potential). From the state-of-the-art lattice calculations and experimental fits on the form factors of the QCD energy-momentum tensor, we exhibit pictures of the momentum flow and the color-Lorentz forces on the quarks in the nucleon. In particular, the anomaly contributes a critical attractive force with a strength similar to that of a heavy-quark confinement potential.</description>
