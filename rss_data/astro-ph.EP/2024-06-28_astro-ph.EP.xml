      <title>HATS-38 b and WASP-139 b join a growing group of eccentric hot Neptunes on polar orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constrain the sky-projected obliquities of two low-density hot Neptune planets HATS-38 b and WASP-139 b orbiting nearby G and K stars using Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) observations with VLT/ESPRESSO, yielding $\lambda = -108_{-16}^{+11}$ deg and $-85.6_{-4.2}^{+7.7}$ deg, respectively. To model the RM effect, we use a new publicly available code, \texttt{ironman}, which is capable of jointly fitting transit photometry, Keplerian radial velocities, and RM effects. The two planets have residual eccentricities ($e= 0.112_{-0.070}^{+0.072}$, and $0.103_{-0.041}^{+0.050}$, respectively), and together with the obliquity constraints, we show that they join a growing group of eccentric hot and low-density Neptunes on polar orbits. We use long-term radial velocities to rule out companions with masses $\sim 0.3-50$ $M_J$ within $\sim$10 au. We show that the orbital architectures of the two Neptunes disfavor an origin from primordial disk misalignment and/or in-situ secular interactions with distant companions and instead favor high-eccentricity migration from $\gtrsim 2$ au driven by a distant companion. Finally, we performed a hierarchical Bayesian modeling of the true obliquity distribution of Neptunes and found suggestive evidence for a higher preponderance of polar orbits of hot Neptunes compared to Jupiters. However, we note that the exact distribution is sensitive to the choice of priors, highlighting the need for additional obliquity measurements of Neptunes to robustly compare the hot Neptune obliquity distribution to Jupiters.</description>

      <title>Absence of a Correlation between White Dwarf Planetary Accretion and Primordial Stellar Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over a quarter of white dwarfs have photospheric metal pollution, which is evidence for recent accretion of exoplanetary material. While a wide range of mechanisms have been proposed to account for this pollution, there are currently few observational constraints to differentiate between them. To investigate the driving mechanism, we observe a sample of polluted and non-polluted white dwarfs in wide binary systems with main-sequence stars. Using the companion stars' metallicities as a proxy for the white dwarfs' primordial metallicities, we compare the metallicities of polluted and non-polluted systems. Because there is a well-known correlation between giant planet occurrence and higher metallicity (with a stronger correlation for close-in and eccentric planets), these metallicity distributions can be used to probe the role of gas giants in white dwarf accretion. We find that the metallicity distributions of polluted and non-polluted systems are consistent with the hypothesis that both samples have the same underlying metallicity distribution. However, we note that this result is likely biased by several selection effects. Additionally, we find no significant trend between white dwarf accretion rates and metallicity. These findings suggest that giant planets are not the dominant cause of white dwarf accretion events in binary systems.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the internal structure and formation history of the three planets transiting HIP 29442 (TOI-469) with CHEOPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplanetary systems spanning the radius valley are ideal testing grounds for exploring the proposed explanations for the observed bimodality in the radius distribution of close-in exoplanets. One such system is HIP 29442 (TOI-469), an evolved K0V star hosting two super-Earths and a sub-Neptune. We observe HIP 29442 with CHEOPS for a total of 9.6 days, which we model jointly with 2 sectors of TESS data to derive planetary radii of $3.410\pm0.046$, $1.551\pm0.045$ and $1.538\pm0.049$ R$_\oplus$ for planets b, c and d, which orbit HIP 29442 with periods of 13.6, 3.5 and 6.4 days. For planet d, this value deviates by more than 3 sigma from the median value reported in the discovery paper, leading us to conclude that caution is required when using TESS photometry to determine the radii of small planets with low per-transit S/N and large gaps between observations. Given the high precision of these new radii, combining them with published RVs from ESPRESSO and HIRES provides us with ideal conditions to investigate the internal structure and formation pathways of the planets in the system. We introduce the publicly available code plaNETic, a fast and robust neural network-based Bayesian internal structure modelling framework. We then apply hydrodynamic models to explore the upper atmospheric properties of these inferred structures. Finally, we identify planetary system analogues in a synthetic population generated with the Bern model for planet formation and evolution. Based on this analysis, we find that the planets likely formed on opposing sides of the water iceline from a protoplanetary disk with an intermediate solid mass. We finally report that the observed parameters of the HIP 29442 system are compatible with both a scenario where the second peak in the bimodal radius distribution corresponds to sub-Neptunes with a pure H/He envelope as well as a scenario with water-rich sub-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity and Inclination of Massive Planets Inside Low-density Cavities: Results of 3D Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of eccentricity and inclination of massive planets in low-density cavities of protoplanetary discs using three-dimensional (3D) simulations. When the planet's orbit is aligned with the equatorial plane of the disc, the eccentricity increases to high values of 0.7-0.9 due to the resonant interaction with the inner parts of the disc. For planets on inclined orbits, the eccentricity increases due to the Kozai-Lidov mechanism, where the disc acts as an external massive body that perturbs the planet's orbit. At small inclination angles, &lt; 30 degrees, the resonant interaction with the inner disc strongly contributes to the eccentricity growth, while at larger angles, eccentricity growth is mainly due to the Kozai-Lidov mechanism. We conclude that planets inside low-density cavities tend to acquire high eccentricity if favorable conditions give sufficient time for growth. The final value of the planet's eccentricity, after the disc dispersal depends on the planet's mass and properties of the cavity and protoplanetary disc.</description>

      <title>Resonant sub-Neptunes are puffier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic, population-level discrepancy exists between the densities of exoplanets whose masses have been measured with transit timing variations (TTVs) versus those measured with radial velocities (RVs). Since the TTV planets are predominantly nearly resonant, it is still unclear whether the discrepancy is attributed to detection biases or to astrophysical differences between the nearly resonant and non resonant planet populations. We defined a controlled, unbiased sample of 36 sub-Neptunes characterised by Kepler, TESS, HARPS, and ESPRESSO. We found that their density depends mostly on the resonant state of the system, with a low probability (of $0.002_{-0.001}^{+0.010}$) that the mass of (nearly) resonant planets is drawn from the same underlying population as the bulk of sub-Neptunes. Increasing the sample to 133 sub-Neptunes reveals finer details: the densities of resonant planets are similar and lower than non-resonant planets, and both the mean and spread in density increase for planets that are away from resonance. This trend is also present in RV-characterised planets alone. In addition, TTVs and RVs have consistent density distributions for a given distance to resonance. We also show that systems closer to resonances tend to be more co-planar than their spread-out counterparts. These observational trends are also found in synthetic populations, where planets that survived in their original resonant configuration retain a lower density; whereas less compact systems have undergone post-disc giant collisions that increased the planet's density, while expanding their orbits. Our findings reinforce the claim that resonant systems are archetypes of planetary systems at their birth.</description>

      <title>Hybrid approach predicts a lower binding energy for benzene on water ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a highly accurate value for the binding energy of benzene to proton-ordered crystalline water ice (XIh), as a model for interstellar ices. We compare our computed value to the latest experimental data available from temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and find that our binding energy value agrees well with data obtained from binding to either crystalline or amorphous ice. Importantly, our new value is lower than that used in most astrochemical networks by about nearly half its value. We explore the impact of this revised binding energy value for both an AGB outflow and a protoplanetary disk. We find that the lower value of the binding energy predicted here compared with values used in the literature (4050 K versus 7587 K) leads to less depletion of gas-phase benzene in an AGB outflow, and leads to a shift outwards in the benzene snowline in the midplane of a protoplanetary disk. Using this new value, the AGB model predicts lower abundances of benzene in the solid phase throughout the outflow. The disk model also predicts a larger reservoir of gas-phase benzene in the inner disk, which is consistent with the recent detections of benzene for the first time in protoplanetary disks with JWST.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Potential Super Jupiter in Alpha Centauri System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of potential exoplanets in binary star systems remains a critical challenge in celestial mechanics. This study investigates the stability of a hypothetical Jupiter-mass planet in the Alpha Centauri AB system by drawing parallels with the recently detected Neptune-mass planet in the GJ65AB system, which shares similar mass ratios and orbital eccentricities. Utilizing the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem and the Mean Exponential Growth of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO) parameter within the REBOUND software package, we perform numerical simulations to identify stable orbital configurations. Our results indicate that a Jupiter-mass planet could theoretically maintain a stable orbit in Alpha Centauri AB, with orbital parameters derived from the stable zones observed in GJ65AB. Despite the absence of observational evidence for such a planet in Alpha Centauri AB, this study suggests that similar binary systems could exhibit analogous stability characteristics. Future observational efforts are recommended to explore this potential and refine our understanding of planetary formation in binary star systems.</description>

      <title>A Contact Binary Satellite of the Asteroid (152830) Dinkinesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroids with diameters less than about 5 km have complex histories because they are small enough for radiative torques, YORP, to be a notable factor in their evolution. (152830) Dinkinesh is a small asteroid orbiting the Sun near the inner edge of the Main Asteroid Belt with a heliocentric semimajor axis of 2.19 AU; its S type spectrum is typical of bodies in this part of the Main Belt. Here we report observations by the Lucy spacecraft as it passed within 431 km of Dinkinesh. Lucy revealed Dinkinesh, which has an effective diameter of only $\sim$720 m, to be unexpectedly complex. Of particular note is the presence of a prominent longitudinal trough overlain by a substantial equatorial ridge, and the discovery of the first confirmed contact binary satellite, now named (152830) Dinkinesh I Selam. Selam consists of two near-equal sized lobes with diameters of $\sim$210 m and $\sim$230 m. It orbits Dinkinesh at a distance of 3.1 km with an orbital period of about 52.7 hr, and is tidally locked. The dynamical state, angular momentum, and geomorphologic observations of the system lead us to infer that the ridge and trough of Dinkinesh are probably the result of mass failure resulting from spin-up by YORP followed by the partial reaccretion of the shed material. Selam probably accreted from material shed by this event.</description>

      <title>Using 3.4-$\mu$m Variability towards White Dwarfs as a Signpost of Remnant Planetary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Roughly 2% of white dwarfs harbor planetary debris disks detectable via infrared excesses, but only a few percent of these disks show a gaseous component, distinguished by their double-peaked emission at the near-infrared calcium triplet. Previous studies found most debris disks around white dwarfs are variable at 3.4 and 4.5 $\mu$m, but they analyzed only a few of the now 21 published disks showing calcium emission. To test if most published calcium emission disks exhibit large-amplitude stochastic variability in the near-infrared, we use light curves generated from the unWISE images at 3.4 $\mu$m that are corrected for proper motion to characterize the near-infrared variability of these disks against samples of disks without calcium emission, highly variable cataclysmic variables, and 3215 isolated white dwarfs. We find most calcium emission disks are extremely variable: 6/11 with sufficient signal-to-noise show high-amplitude variability in their 3.4-$\mu$m light curves. These results lend further credence to the notion that disks showing gaseous debris in emission are the most collisionally active. Under the assumption that 3.4-$\mu$m variability is characteristic of white dwarfs with dusty debris disks, we generate a catalog of 104 high-confidence near-infrared variable white dwarfs, 84 of which are published as variable for the first time. We do near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up of seven new candidate 3.4-$\mu$m variables, confirming at least one new remnant planetary system, and posit that empirical near-infrared variability can be a discovery engine for debris disks showing gaseous emission.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Complex Ionization Environment of the Turbulent DM Tau Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionization drives important chemical and dynamical processes within protoplanetary disks, including the formation of organics and water in the cold midplane and the transportation of material via accretion and magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) flows. Understanding these ionization-driven processes is crucial for understanding disk evolution and planet formation. We use new and archival ALMA observations of HCO+, H13CO+, and N2H+ to produce the first forward-modeled 2D ionization constraints for the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. We include ionization from multiple sources and explore the disk chemistry under a range of ionizing conditions. Abundances from our 2D chemical models are post-processed using non-LTE radiative transfer, visibility sampling, and imaging, and are compared directly to the observed radial emission profiles. The observations are best fit by a modestly reduced CR ionization rate ($\zeta_{CR}$ ~ 10$^{-18}$ s$^{-1}$) and a hard X-ray spectrum (hardness ratio [HR] = 0.3), which we associate with stellar flaring conditions. Our best-fit model under-produces emission in the inner disk, suggesting that there may be an additional mechanism enhancing ionization in DM Tau's inner disk. Overall, our findings highlight the complexity of ionization in protoplanetary disks and the need for high resolution multi-line studies.</description>

      <title>The Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB): 5. End-to-end simulations of polarization aberrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization aberrations originating from the telescope and high-contrast imaging instrument optics introduce polarization-dependent speckles and associated errors in the image plane, affecting the measured exoplanet signal. Understanding this effect is critical for future space-based high-contrast imaging instruments that aim to image the Earth analogs with 1e-10 raw contrast and characterize their atmospheres. We present end-to-end modeling of the polarization aberrations for a high-contrast imaging testbed, SCoOB. We use a vector vortex coronagraph (VVC) as the focal plane mask, incorporate polarization filtering, and estimate the peak contrast in the dark hole region. The dominant polarization aberrations in the system are retardance defocus and tilt due to the OAPs and fold mirrors. Although the mean contrast in the dark hole region remains unaffected by the polarization aberrations, we see brighter speckles limiting the contrast to 1e-9 at smaller inner working angles. We extend the simulations using the measured retardance maps for the VVC. We find that the mean contrast in SCoOB is more sensitive to the VVC and the QWP retardance errors than the polarization aberrations.</description>

      <title>Combining reference-star and angular differential imaging for high-contrast imaging of extended sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-contrast imaging (HCI) is a technique designed to observe faint signals near bright sources, such as exoplanets and circumstellar disks. The primary challenge in revealing the faint circumstellar signal near a star is the presence of quasi-static speckles, which can produce patterns on the science images that are as bright, or even brighter, than the signal of interest. Strategies such as angular differential imaging (ADI) or reference-star differential imaging (RDI) aim to provide a means of removing the quasi-static speckles in post-processing. In this paper, we present and discuss the adaptation of state-of-the-art algorithms, initially designed for ADI, to jointly leverage angular and reference-star differential imaging (ARDI) for direct high-contrast imaging of circumstellar disks. Using a collection of high-contrast imaging data sets, we assess the performance of ARDI in comparison to ADI and RDI based on iterative principal component analysis (IPCA). These diverse data sets are acquired under various observing conditions and include the injection of synthetic disk models at various contrast levels. Our results demonstrate that ARDI with IPCA improves the quality of recovered disk images and the sensitivity to planets embedded in disks, compared to ADI or RDI individually. This enhancement is particularly pronounced when dealing with extended sources exhibiting highly ambiguous structures that cannot be accurately retrieved using ADI alone, and when the quality of the reference frames is suboptimal, leading to an underperformance of RDI. We finally apply our method to a sample of real observations of protoplanetary disks taken in star-hopping mode, and propose to revisit the protoplanetary claims associated with these disks.</description>

Abstract: Equations of a heavy rotating body with one fixed point can be deduced starting from a variational problem with holonomic constraints. When applying this formalism to the particular case of a Lagrange top, in the formulation with a diagonal inertia tensor the potential energy has more complicated form as compared with that assumed in the literature on dynamics of a rigid body. This implies the corresponding improvements in equations of motion. Therefore, we revised this case, presenting several examples of analytical solutions to the improved equations. The case of precession without nutation has a surprisingly rich relationship between the rotation and precession rates, and this is discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Heating and Parallel Heat Flux in Electron-only Magnetic Reconnection with Intense Guide Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10731</link>

Abstract: Electron-only reconnection is a process recently observed in the Earth's magnetosheath, where magnetic reconnection occurs at electron kinetic scales with only electrons involved. Electron-only reconnection is likely to have a significant impact on the energy conversion and dissipation of turbulence cascades at kinetic scales. This paper investigates electron-only reconnection under different intensities of strong guide fields via two-dimensional fully kinetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations, focusing on electron heating. The simulations are initialized with a force-free current sheet equilibrium under various intensities of strong guide fields. The quadrupolar structures of the out-of-plane magnetic field and asymmetric structures of density are found to become narrower in space as the guide field increases. Electron velocities are considerably larger than ion velocities, and the motion of both species is notably affected by the strength of guide fields. Similarly to previous experiments studies, electron temperature anisotropy along separatrices is observed, which is found to be mainly caused by the variations of parallel temperature. Both regions of anisotropy and parallel temperature increase/decrease along separatrices become thinner with increasing guide fields. Besides, we find a transition from a quadrupolar to a six-polar to an eight-polar structure in temperature anisotropy and parallel temperature as the guide field intensifies. Non-Maxwellian electron velocity distribution functions (EVDFs) at different locations in the three simulations are observed. Our results show that parallel electron velocity varies notably with different guide field intensities and strong parallel electron heat flux is observed.</description>
