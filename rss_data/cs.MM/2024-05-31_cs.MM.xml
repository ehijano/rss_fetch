      <title>Exploring the Robustness of Decision-Level Through Adversarial Attacks on LLM-Based Embodied Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied intelligence empowers agents with a profound sense of perception, enabling them to respond in a manner closely aligned with real-world situations. Large Language Models (LLMs) delve into language instructions with depth, serving a crucial role in generating plans for intricate tasks. Thus, LLM-based embodied models further enhance the agent's capacity to comprehend and process information. However, this amalgamation also ushers in new challenges in the pursuit of heightened intelligence. Specifically, attackers can manipulate LLMs to produce irrelevant or even malicious outputs by altering their prompts. Confronted with this challenge, we observe a notable absence of multi-modal datasets essential for comprehensively evaluating the robustness of LLM-based embodied models. Consequently, we construct the Embodied Intelligent Robot Attack Dataset (EIRAD), tailored specifically for robustness evaluation. Additionally, two attack strategies are devised, including untargeted attacks and targeted attacks, to effectively simulate a range of diverse attack scenarios. At the same time, during the attack process, to more accurately ascertain whether our method is successful in attacking the LLM-based embodied model, we devise a new attack success evaluation method utilizing the BLIP2 model. Recognizing the time and cost-intensive nature of the GCG algorithm in attacks, we devise a scheme for prompt suffix initialization based on various target tasks, thus expediting the convergence process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits a superior attack success rate when targeting LLM-based embodied models, indicating a lower level of decision-level robustness in these models.</description>

      <title>NeRF View Synthesis: Subjective Quality Assessment and Objective Metrics Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) are a groundbreaking computer vision technology that enables the generation of high-quality, immersive visual content from multiple viewpoints. This capability holds significant advantages for applications such as virtual/augmented reality, 3D modelling and content creation for the film and entertainment industry. However, the evaluation of NeRF methods poses several challenges, including a lack of comprehensive datasets, reliable assessment methodologies, and objective quality metrics. This paper addresses the problem of NeRF quality assessment thoroughly, by conducting a rigorous subjective quality assessment test that considers several scene classes and recently proposed NeRF view synthesis methods. Additionally, the performance of a wide range of state-of-the-art conventional and learning-based full-reference 2D image and video quality assessment metrics is evaluated against the subjective scores of the subjective study. The experimental results are analyzed in depth, providing a comparative evaluation of several NeRF methods and objective quality metrics, across different classes of visual scenes, including real and synthetic content for front-face and 360-degree camera trajectories.</description>

      <title>Deep Joint Semantic Coding and Beamforming for Near-Space Airship-Borne Massive MIMO Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-space airship-borne communication network is recognized to be an indispensable component of the future integrated ground-air-space network thanks to airships' advantage of long-term residency at stratospheric altitudes, but it urgently needs reliable and efficient Airship-to-X link. To improve the transmission efficiency and capacity, this paper proposes to integrate semantic communication with massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology. Specifically, we propose a deep joint semantic coding and beamforming (JSCBF) scheme for airship-based massive MIMO image transmission network in space, in which semantics from both source and channel are fused to jointly design the semantic coding and physical layer beamforming. First, we design two semantic extraction networks to extract semantics from image source and channel state information, respectively. Then, we propose a semantic fusion network that can fuse these semantics into complex-valued semantic features for subsequent physical-layer transmission. To efficiently transmit the fused semantic features at the physical layer, we then propose the hybrid data and model-driven semantic-aware beamforming networks. At the receiver, a semantic decoding network is designed to reconstruct the transmitted images. Finally, we perform end-to-end deep learning to jointly train all the modules, using the image reconstruction quality at the receivers as a metric. The proposed deep JSCBF scheme fully combines the efficient source compressibility and robust error correction capability of semantic communication with the high spectral efficiency of massive MIMO, achieving a significant performance improvement over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Promptus: Can Prompts Streaming Replace Video Streaming with Stable Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the exponential growth of video traffic, traditional video streaming systems are approaching their limits in compression efficiency and communication capacity. To further reduce bitrate while maintaining quality, we propose Promptus, a disruptive novel system that streaming prompts instead of video content with Stable Diffusion, which converts video frames into a series of "prompts" for delivery. To ensure pixel alignment, a gradient descent-based prompt fitting framework is proposed. To achieve adaptive bitrate for prompts, a low-rank decomposition-based bitrate control algorithm is introduced. For inter-frame compression of prompts, a temporal smoothing-based prompt interpolation algorithm is proposed. Evaluations across various video domains and real network traces demonstrate Promptus can enhance the perceptual quality by 0.111 and 0.092 (in LPIPS) compared to VAE and H.265, respectively, and decreases the ratio of severely distorted frames by 89.3% and 91.7%. Moreover, Promptus achieves real-time video generation from prompts at over 150 FPS. To the best of our knowledge, Promptus is the first attempt to replace video codecs with prompt inversion and the first to use prompt streaming instead of video streaming. Our work opens up a new paradigm for efficient video communication beyond the Shannon limit.</description>
