      <title>Some geometric and spectral aspects of restriction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This texts commemorates the memory of Haim Brezis and explores some aspects of the restriction problem, particularly its connections to spectral and geometric analysis. Our choice of subject is motivated by Brezis' significant contributions to various domains related to this problem, including harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, spectral theory, representation theory, number theory, and many others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish analogs of Miyachi, Cowling-Price, and Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl uncertainty principles in the framework of the linear canonical Dunkl transform. We also obtain some weighted inequalities, such as Nash, Clarkson, Donoho-Stark, and Matolcsi-Szucs type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Non-spectrality of some piecewise smooth curves and unions of line segments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systematic study about the spectrality of measures supported on piecewise smooth curves by studying the support of the tempered distributions arising from the tiling equation of some singular spectral measures. In doing so, we show that the arc-length measures of all closed polygonal lines are not spectral. {In particular, the boundary of a square is not spectral. We also show that the ``plus space'' (two crossing line segments) is not spectral.} Furthermore, our theory also shows that the arc length measures on {smooth} convex curves with finitely many transverse self-intersections are not spectral. Finally, several natural open questions about the spectrality of singular measures and {piecewise} smooth curves will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Bounded common fundamental domains for two lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any two lattices $L, M \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ of the same volume there exists a measurable, bounded, common fundamental domain of them. In other words, there exists a bounded measurable set $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ such that $E$ tiles $\mathbb{R}^d$ when translated by $L$ or by $M$. In fact, the set $E$ can be taken to be a finite union of polytopes. A consequence of this is that the indicator function of $E$ forms a Weyl--Heisenberg (Gabor) orthogonal basis of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ when translated by $L$ and modulated by $M^*$, the dual lattice of $M$.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Proof of Weierstrass's Approximation Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use the Vandermonde matrices and their properties to give a new proof of the classical result of Karl Weierstrass about the approximation of continuous functions $f$ on closed intervals, using a sequence of polynomials. The proof solves linear systems of equations using that the Vandermonde matrices have always non zero determinants, when the entries of the power series of the rows of the matrix are all different. We provide several examples, and we also use our method to observe that the sequence of polynomials that we construct algebraically approaches the Taylor series of a function $f$ which is infinitely differentiable.</description>

      <title>Block structure in boolean matrices of bounded factorization norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A blocky matrix is one that can be obtained (up to permutation of rows and columns) from an identity matrix by successively either adding a copy of a row or column or adding a zero row or column. Blocky matrices are precisely the set of boolean matrices with $|\!|A|\!|_{\gamma_2}= 1$. We show that for any boolean matrix $A$ with $\gamma_2$ norm at most $\lambda$, there exists a blocky matrix $B$ of the same dimensions as $A$ such that $B(i,j) = 1$ only if $A(i,j)=1$, and there are at least $1/2^{2^{O(\lambda)}}$ as many $1$-entries in $B$ as in $A$.</description>

      <title>Special measures of smoothness for approximation by sampling operators in $L_p(\Bbb{R}^d)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional measures of smoothness often fail to provide accurate $L_p$-error estimates for approximation by sampling or interpolation operators, especially for functions with low smoothness. To address this issue, we introduce a modified measure of smoothness that incorporates the local behavior of a function at the sampling points through the use of averaged operators. With this new tool, we obtain matching direct and inverse error estimates for a wide class of sampling operators and functions in $L_p$ spaces. Additionally, we derive a criterion for the convergence of sampling operators in $L_p$, identify conditions that ensure the exact rate of approximation, construct realizations of $K$-functionals based on these operators, and study the smoothness properties of sampling operators. We also demonstrate how our results apply to several well-known operators, including the classical Whittaker-Shannon sampling operator, sampling operators generated by $B$-splines, and those based on the Gaussian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new proof of the result of L.-E.~Persson and V.D.~Stepanov \cite[Theorems 1 and 3]{Per:02}, which provides a characterization of a Hardy integral inequality involving two weights, and which can be applied to an effective treatment of the geometric mean operator. Our approach enables us to extend their result to the full range of parameters, in particular involving the critical case $p=1$, which was excluded in the original work. Our proof avoids all duality steps and discretization techniques and uses solely elementary means.</description>

      <title>On Unitary Monodromy of Second-Order ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a second-order, holomorphic, linear differential equation $Lf=0$ on a Riemann surface, we say that its monodromy group $G\subset\operatorname{GL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ is \emph{unitary} if it preserves a non-degenerate (though not necessarily positive) Hermitian form $H$ on $\mathbb{C}^2$ under the action $g\circ H\doteq g^\dagger H g$. In the present work, we give two sets of necessary and sufficient conditions for a differential operator $L$ to have a unitary monodromy group, and we construct the form $H$ explicitly. First, in the case that the natural representation of $G$ on $\mathbb{C}^2$ is irreducible, we show that unitarity is equivalent to a set of easily-verified trace conditions on local monodromy matrices; in the case that it is reducible, we show that $G$ is unitary if and only if it is conjugate to a subgroup of one of two model subgroups of $\operatorname{GL}(2,\mathbb{C})$. Second, we show that unitarity of $G$ is equivalent to a criterion on the real dimension of the algebra $A$ generated by a rescaled group $G'\subset\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$: that $\dim(A)=1$ if $G\subset S^1$ is scalar, $\dim(A)=2$ if $G$ is abelian, $\dim(A)=3$ if $G$ is non-abelian but its action on $\mathbb{C}^2$ is reducible, and $\dim(A)=4$ otherwise. We leverage these results to extend a conjecture of Frits Beukers on the spectrum of Lam\'e operators -- namely, we give asymptotic and numerical evidence that his conjecture should apply similarly to a wider class of Heun operator. Our work makes progress towards characterizing the spectra of second-order operators on Riemann surfaces, and in particular, towards answering the accessory parameter problem for Heun equations.</description>

      <title>Definable Lipschitz selections for affine-set valued maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whitney's extension problem, i.e., how one can tell whether a function $f : X \to \mathbb R$, $X \subseteq \mathbb R^n$, is the restriction of a $C^m$-function on $\mathbb R^n$, was solved in full generality by Charles Fefferman in 2006. In this paper, we settle the $C^{1,\omega}$-case of a related conjecture: given that $f$ is semialgebraic and $\omega$ is a semialgebraic modulus of continuity, if $f$ is the restriction of a $C^{1,\omega}$-function then it is the restriction of a semialgebraic $C^{1,\omega}$-function. We work in the more general setting of sets that are definable in an o-minimial expansion of the real field. An ingenious argument of Brudnyi and Shvartsman relates the existence of $C^{1,\omega}$-extensions to the existence of Lipschitz selections of certain affine-set valued maps. We show that if a definable affine-set valued map has Lipschitz selections then it also has definable Lipschitz selections. In particular, we obtain a Lipschitz solution (more generally, $\omega$-H\"older solution, for any definable modulus of continuity $\omega$) of the definable Brenner-Epstein-Hochster-Koll\'ar problem. In most of our results we have control over the respective (semi)norms.</description>

      <title>Counting integral points near space curves: a Fourier analytic approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish upper and lower bounds for the number of integral points which lie within a neighbourhood of a smooth nondegenerate curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\geq 3$. These estimates are new for $n\geq 4$, and we recover an earlier result of J. J. Huang for $n=3$. However, we do so by using Fourier analytic techniques which, in contrast with the method of Huang, do not require the sharp counting result for planar curves as an input. In particular, we rely on an Arkhipov--Chubarikov--Karatsuba-type oscillatory integral estimate.</description>

      <title>On the zero sets of harmonic polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider nonzero harmonic functions vanishing on certain subvarieties. Among other things, we give a positive solution to the Problem 151 from the Scottish Book posed by R. Wavre in 1936. In more detail, we construct a nonzero harmonic function in the whole space that vanishes on the edges of the unit cube. Moreover, using harmonic morphisms we construct certain new nontrivial families of harmonic polynomials that vanish at the same set in the unit ball in n-dimensional space for all n greater than or equal to 4. This extends results of Logunov and Malinnikova. We also present some (presumably) new results on harmonic functions in the space whose nodal sets are unions of (affine) subspaces.</description>
