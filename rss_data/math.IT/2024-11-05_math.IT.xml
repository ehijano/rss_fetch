      <title>SKI-SAT: A CMOS-compatible Hardware for Solving SAT Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nature-inspired computation is receiving increasing attention. Various Ising machine implementations have recently been proven to be effective in solving numerous combinatorial optimization problems including maximum cut, low density parity check (LDPC) decoding, and Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. In this paper, a novel method is presented to solve SAT or MAX-SAT problems with a CMOS circuit implementation. The technique solves a SAT problem by mapping the SAT variables onto quantized capacitor voltages generated by an array of nodes that interact through a network of coupling units. The nodal interaction is achieved through coupling currents produced by the coupling units, which charge or discharge capacitor voltages, implementing a gradient descent along the SAT problem's cost function to minimize the number of unsatisfied clauses. The system also incorporates a unique low-complexity perturbation scheme to avoid settling in local minima, greatly enhancing the performance of the system. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SKI-SAT is a high-performance and low-energy alternative that surpasses existing solvers by significant margins, achieving more than 10 times faster solution and 300 times less power.</description>

      <title>Study of Iterative Detection and Decoding for RIS-Aided Multiuser Multi-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel iterative detection and decoding (IDD) scheme for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted multiuser multiple-antenna systems. The proposed approach introduces a joint iterative detection strategy that integrates Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, RIS processing and iterative detection and decoding. In particular, we employ a minimum mean square error receive filter that performs truncation at the RIS and soft interference cancelation at the receiver. Simulation results evaluate the system's overall capacity and bit error rate, and demonstrate substantial improvements in bit error rate across block-fading channels.</description>

      <title>Reducing Data Fragmentation in Data Deduplication Systems via Partial Repetition and Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data deduplication, one of the key features of modern Big Data storage devices, is the process of removing replicas of data chunks stored by different users. Despite the importance of deduplication, several drawbacks of the method, such as storage robustness and file fragmentation, have not been previously analyzed from a theoretical point of view. Storage robustness pertains to ensuring that deduplicated data can be used to reconstruct the original files without service disruptions and data loss. Fragmentation pertains to the problems of placing deduplicated data chunks of different user files in a proximity-preserving linear order, since neighboring chunks of the same file may be stored in sectors far apart on the server. This work proposes a new theoretical model for data fragmentation and introduces novel graph- and coding-theoretic approaches for reducing fragmentation via limited duplication (repetition coding) and coded deduplication (e.g., linear coding). In addition to alleviating issues with fragmentation, limited duplication and coded deduplication can also serve the dual purpose of increasing the robusteness of the system design. The contributions of our work are three-fold. First, we describe a new model for file structures in the form of self-avoiding (simple) paths in specialized graphs. Second, we introduce several new metrics for measuring the fragmentation level in deduplication systems on graph-structured files, including the stretch metric that captures the worst-case "spread" of adjacent data chunks within a file when deduplicated and placed on the server; and, the jump metric that captures the worst-case number of times during the reconstruction process of a file that one has to change the readout location on the server. For the stretch metric, we establish a connection between the level of fragmentation and the bandwidth of the file-graph. In particular, ...</description>

      <title>Protocol Design for Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA With Energy Harvesting to Maintain Information Freshness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an internet-of-things system where energy-harvesting devices send status updates to a common receiver using the irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) protocol. Energy shortages in these devices can cause transmission failures that are unknown to the receiver, halting the decoding process. We resolve this issue by proposing a method for the receiver to perfectly identify these failures. Furthermore, we optimize the degree distribution of the protocol to ensure the freshness of the status updates. The optimized degree distribution offsets the negative impact of the potential transmission failures. Our numerical results show that, despite energy harvesting, IRSA can maintain a level of information freshness comparable to systems with unlimited energy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Locally Recoverable Codes via Good Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locally recoverable codes (LRCs) with locality parameter $r$ can recover any erased code symbol by accessing $r$ other code symbols. This local recovery property is of great interest in large-scale distributed classical data storage systems as it leads to efficient repair of failed nodes. A well-known class of optimal (classical) LRCs are subcodes of Reed-Solomon codes constructed using a special type of polynomials called good polynomials. Recently, Golowich and Guruswami initiated the study of quantum LRCs (qLRCs), which could have applications in quantum data storage systems of the future. The authors presented a qLRC construction based on good polynomials arising out of subgroups of the multiplicative group of finite fields. In this paper, we present a qLRC construction method that can employ any good polynomial. We also propose a new approach for designing good polynomials using subgroups of affine general linear groups. Golowich and Guruswami also derived a lower bound on the minimum distance of their qLRC under the restriction that $r+1$ is prime. Using similar techniques in conjunction with the expander mixing lemma, we develop minimum distance lower bounds for our qLRCs without the $r+1$ prime restriction.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-guided Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Delay-Sensitive Wireless Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01766v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a two-stage intelligent scheduler is proposed to minimize the packet-level delay jitter while guaranteeing delay bound. Firstly, Lyapunov technology is employed to transform the delay-violation constraint into a sequential slot-level queue stability problem. Secondly, a hierarchical scheme is proposed to solve the resource allocation between multiple base stations and users, where the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) gives the user priority and the number of scheduled packets, while the underlying scheduler allocates the resource. Our proposed scheme achieves lower delay jitter and delay violation rate than the Round-Robin Earliest Deadline First algorithm and MARL with delay violation penalty.</description>

      <title>On Energy Efficiency of Hybrid NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to prove the significant superiority of hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) over orthog onal multiple access (OMA) in terms of energy efficiency. In particular, a novel hybrid NOMA scheme is proposed in which a user can transmit signals not only by using its own time slot but also by using the time slots of other users. The data rate maximization problem is studied by optimizing the power allocation, where closed-form solutions are obtained. Further more, the conditions under which hybrid NOMA can achieve a higher instantaneous data rate with less power consumption than OMA are obtained. It is proved that the probability that hybrid NOMA can achieve a higher instantaneous data rate with less power consumption than OMA approaches one in the high SNR regime, indicating the superiority of hybrid NOMA in terms of power efficiency. Numerical results are also provided to verify the developed analysis and also to demonstrate the superior performance of hybrid NOMA.</description>

      <title>IRS-Enhanced Secure Semantic Communication Networks: Cross-Layer and Context-Awared Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-task oriented semantic communication is pivotal in optimizing transmission efficiency by extracting and conveying essential semantics tailored to specific tasks, such as image reconstruction and classification. Nevertheless, the challenge of eavesdropping poses a formidable threat to semantic privacy due to the open nature of wireless communications. In this paper, intelligent reflective surface (IRS)-enhanced secure semantic communication (IRS-SSC) is proposed to guarantee the physical layer security from a task-oriented semantic perspective. Specifically, a multi-layer codebook is exploited to discretize continuous semantic features and describe semantics with different numbers of bits, thereby meeting the need for hierarchical semantic representation and further enhancing the transmission efficiency. Novel semantic security metrics, i.e., secure semantic rate (S-SR) and secure semantic spectrum efficiency (S-SSE), are defined to map the task-oriented security requirements at the application layer into the physical layer. To achieve artificial intelligence (AI)-native secure communication, we propose a noise disturbance enhanced hybrid deep reinforcement learning (NdeHDRL)-based resource allocation scheme. This scheme dynamically maximizes the S-SSE by jointly optimizing the bits for semantic representations, reflective coefficients of the IRS, and the subchannel assignment. Moreover, we propose a novel semantic context awared state space (SCA-SS) to fusion the high-dimensional semantic space and the observable system state space, which enables the agent to perceive semantic context and solves the dimensional catastrophe problem. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed schemes in both enhancing the security performance and the S-SSE compared to several benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Rician Channel Modelling for Super Wideband MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology include packing a large number of antenna elements in a compact array to access the bandwidth benefits provided by higher mutual coupling (MC). The resulting super-wideband (SW) systems require a circuit-theoretic framework to handle the MC and channel models which span extremely large bands. Hence, in this paper, we make two key contributions. First, we develop a physically-consistent Rician channel model for use with SW systems. Secondly, we express the circuit-theoretic models in terms of a standard MIMO model, so that insights into the effects of antenna layouts, MC, and bandwidth can be made using standard communication theory. For example, we show the bandwidth widening resulting from the new channel model. In addition, we show that MC distorts line-of-sight paths which has beamforming implications. We also highlight the interaction between spatial correlation and MC and show that tight coupling reduces spatial correlations at low frequencies.</description>

      <title>Fair Beam Synthesis and Suppression via Transmissive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing phase optimization methods in reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) face significant challenges in achieving flexible beam synthesis, especially for directional beam suppression. This paper introduces a Max-min criterion incorporating non-linear constraints, utilizing optimization techniques to enable multi-beam enhancement and suppression via transmissive RISs. A realistic model grounded in geometrical optics is first presented to characterize the input/output behavior of transmissive RIS, effectively linking explicit beam-forming operations with practical implementation. Subsequently, a highly efficient bisection-based algorithm for constrained Max-min optimization involving quadratic forms is developed, utilizing an auxiliary variable and Moreau envelope to iteratively reach the optimal solution. This approach demonstrates excellent extensibility and is applicable to a wide range of constrained Max-min problems. Numerical simulations validate the proposed methods, confirming that the framework enables beam enhancement or suppression at designated spatial positions.</description>

      <title>Massive MIMO over Correlated Fading Channels: Multi-Cell MMSE Processing, Pilot Assignment and Power Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a multi-cell massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system with correlated Rayleigh fading channels, where pilot reuse is permitted within each cell (to reduce pilot overhead), and each base station (BS) utilizes multi-cell minimum mean square (M-MMSE) precoders and combining. We derive a large-scale approximation of the uplink signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) that is asymptotically tight in the large system limit. By leveraging the derived SINR approximation, we (i) develop a low-complexity multi-cell pilot assignment (PA) scheme aimed at minimizing pilot contamination from pilot-sharing users, via effectively exploiting the channel spatial correlation matrices of all users in the network, (ii) design pilot and data power allocation schemes, using both the weighted sum and max-min spectral efficiency (SE) metrics. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of our multi-cell PA scheme, requiring significantly less pilot overhead. The proposed power allocation schemes also achieve substantial sum SE gains with good fairness among users compared to equal power allocation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing AoI at Query in Multiuser Wireless Uplink Networks: A Whittle Index Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02108v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how to schedule multiple users to optimize information freshness in a pull-based wireless network, where the status updates from users are requested by randomly arriving queries at the destination. We use the age of information at query (QAoI) to characterize the performance of information freshness. Such a decision-making problem is naturally modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), which, however, is prohibitively high to be solved optimally by the standard method due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this issue, we employ Whittle index approach, which allows us to decouple the original MDP into multiple sub-MDPs by relaxing the scheduling constraints. However, the binary Markovian query arrival process results in a bi-dimensional state and complex state transitions within each sub-MDP, making it challenging to verify Whittle indexability using conventional methods. After a thorough analysis of the sub-MDP's structure, we show that it is unichain and its optimal policy follows a threshold-type structure. This facilitates the verification of Whittle indexability of the sub-MDP by employing an easy-to-verify condition. Subsequently, the steady-state probability distributions of the sub-MDP under different threshold-type policies are analyzed, constituting the analytical expressions of different Whittle indices in terms of the expected average QAoI and scheduling time of the sub-MDP. Building on these, we devise an efficient algorithm to calculate Whittle indices for the formulated sub-MDPs. The simulation results validate our analyses and show the proposed Whittle index policy outperforms baseline policies and achieves near-optimal performance.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Generative Multicasting with Intent-aware Semantic Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have recently shown great success in synthesizing multimedia signals with high perceptual quality enabling highly efficient semantic communications in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop an intent-aware generative semantic multicasting framework utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. In the proposed framework, the transmitter decomposes the source signal to multiple semantic classes based on the multi-user intent, i.e. each user is assumed to be interested in details of only a subset of the semantic classes. The transmitter then sends to each user only its intended classes, and multicasts a highly compressed semantic map to all users over shared wireless resources that allows them to locally synthesize the other classes, i.e. non-intended classes, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. The signal retrieved at each user is thereby partially reconstructed and partially synthesized utilizing the received semantic map. This improves utilization of the wireless resources, with better preserving privacy of the non-intended classes. We design a communication/computation-aware scheme for per-class adaptation of the communication parameters, such as the transmission power and compression rate to minimize the total latency of retrieving signals at multiple receivers, tailored to the prevailing channel conditions as well as the users reconstruction/synthesis distortion/perception requirements. The simulation results demonstrate significantly reduced per-user latency compared with non-generative and intent-unaware multicasting benchmarks while maintaining high perceptual quality of the signals retrieved at the users.</description>

      <title>Blind Time-of-Flight Imaging: Sparse Deconvolution on the Continuum with Unknown Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, computational Time-of-Flight (ToF) imaging has emerged as an exciting and a novel imaging modality that offers new and powerful interpretations of natural scenes, with applications extending to 3D, light-in-flight, and non-line-of-sight imaging. Mathematically, ToF imaging relies on algorithmic super-resolution, as the back-scattered sparse light echoes lie on a finer time resolution than what digital devices can capture. Traditional methods necessitate knowledge of the emitted light pulses or kernels and employ sparse deconvolution to recover scenes. Unlike previous approaches, this paper introduces a novel, blind ToF imaging technique that does not require kernel calibration and recovers sparse spikes on a continuum, rather than a discrete grid. By studying the shared characteristics of various ToF modalities, we capitalize on the fact that most physical pulses approximately satisfy the Strang-Fix conditions from approximation theory. This leads to a new mathematical formulation for sparse super-resolution. Our recovery approach uses an optimization method that is pivoted on an alternating minimization strategy. We benchmark our blind ToF method against traditional kernel calibration methods, which serve as the baseline. Extensive hardware experiments across different ToF modalities demonstrate the algorithmic advantages, flexibility and empirical robustness of our approach. We show that our work facilitates super-resolution in scenarios where distinguishing between closely spaced objects is challenging, while maintaining performance comparable to known kernel situations. Examples of light-in-flight imaging and light-sweep videos highlight the practical benefits of our blind super-resolution method in enhancing the understanding of natural scenes.</description>

      <title>Precoded faster-than-Nyquist signaling using optimal power allocation for OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A precoded orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation scheme relying on faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) transmission over doubly selective fading channels is {proposed}, which enhances the spectral efficiency and improves the Doppler resilience. We derive the input-output relationship of the FTN signaling in the delay-Doppler domain. Eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) is used for eliminating both the effects of inter-symbol interference and correlated additive noise encountered in the delay-Doppler domain to enable efficient symbol-by-symbol demodulation. Furthermore, the power allocation coefficients of individual frames are optimized for maximizing the mutual information under the constraint of the derived total transmit power. Our performance results demonstrate that the proposed FTN-based OTFS scheme can enhance the information rate while achieving a comparable BER performance to that of its conventional Nyquist-based OTFS counterpart that employs the same root-raised-cosine shaping filter.</description>

      <title>Flexible Coded Distributed Convolution Computing for Enhanced Fault Tolerance and Numerical Stability in Distributed CNNs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained devices necessitates efficient management of computational resources, often via distributed systems susceptible to latency from straggler nodes. This paper introduces the Flexible Coded Distributed Convolution Computing (FCDCC) framework to enhance fault tolerance and numerical stability in distributed CNNs. We extend Coded Distributed Computing (CDC) with Circulant and Rotation Matrix Embedding (CRME) which was originally proposed for matrix multiplication to high-dimensional tensor convolution. For the proposed scheme, referred to as Numerically Stable Coded Tensor Convolution (NSCTC) scheme, we also propose two new coded partitioning schemes: Adaptive-Padding Coded Partitioning (APCP) for input tensor and Kernel-Channel Coded Partitioning (KCCP) for filter tensor. These strategies enable linear decomposition of tensor convolutions and encoding them into CDC sub-tasks, combining model parallelism with coded redundancy for robust and efficient execution. Theoretical analysis identifies an optimal trade-off between communication and storage costs. Empirical results validate the framework's effectiveness in computational efficiency, fault tolerance, and scalability across various CNN architectures.</description>

      <title>On the phase diagram of extensive-rank symmetric matrix denoising beyond rotational invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix denoising is central to signal processing and machine learning. Its analysis when the matrix to infer has a factorised structure with a rank growing proportionally to its dimension remains a challenge, except when it is rotationally invariant. In this case the information theoretic limits and a Bayes-optimal denoising algorithm, called rotational invariant estimator [1,2], are known. Beyond this setting few results can be found. The reason is that the model is not a usual spin system because of the growing rank dimension, nor a matrix model due to the lack of rotation symmetry, but rather a hybrid between the two. In this paper we make progress towards the understanding of Bayesian matrix denoising when the hidden signal is a factored matrix $XX^\intercal$ that is not rotationally invariant. Monte Carlo simulations suggest the existence of a denoising-factorisation transition separating a phase where denoising using the rotational invariant estimator remains Bayes-optimal due to universality properties of the same nature as in random matrix theory, from one where universality breaks down and better denoising is possible by exploiting the signal's prior and factorised structure, though algorithmically hard. We also argue that it is only beyond the transition that factorisation, i.e., estimating $X$ itself, becomes possible up to sign and permutation ambiguities. On the theoretical side, we combine mean-field techniques in an interpretable multiscale fashion in order to access the minimum mean-square error and mutual information. Interestingly, our alternative method yields equations which can be reproduced using the replica approach of [3]. Using numerical insights, we then delimit the portion of the phase diagram where this mean-field theory is reliable, and correct it using universality when it is not. Our ansatz matches well the numerics when accounting for finite size effects.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Frequency Moment Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the second frequency moment of a stream up to $(1\pm\varepsilon)$ multiplicative error requires at most $O(\log n / \varepsilon^2)$ bits of space, due to a seminal result of Alon, Matias, and Szegedy. It is also known that at least $\Omega(\log n + 1/\varepsilon^{2})$ space is needed. We prove an optimal lower bound of $\Omega\left(\log \left(n \varepsilon^2 \right) / \varepsilon^2\right)$ for all $\varepsilon = \Omega(1/\sqrt{n})$. Note that when $\varepsilon&gt;n^{-1/2 + c}$, where $c&gt;0$, our lower bound matches the classic upper bound of AMS. For smaller values of $\varepsilon$ we also introduce a revised algorithm that improves the classic AMS bound and matches our lower bound. Our lower bound holds also for the more general problem of $p$-th frequency moment estimation for the range of $p\in (1,2]$, giving a tight bound in the only remaining range to settle the optimal space complexity of estimating frequency moments.</description>

      <title>Cooperative and Collaborative Multi-Task Semantic Communication for Distributed Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a multi-task semantic communication (SemCom) system for distributed sources, extending the existing focus on collaborative single-task execution. We build on the cooperative multi-task processing introduced in [1], which divides the encoder into a common unit (CU) and multiple specific units (SUs). While earlier studies in multi-task SemCom focused on full observation settings, our research explores a more realistic case where only distributed partial observations are available, such as in a production line monitored by multiple sensing nodes. To address this, we propose an SemCom system that supports multi-task processing through cooperation on the transmitter side via split structure and collaboration on the receiver side. We have used an information-theoretic perspective with variational approximations for our end-to-end data-driven approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative and collaborative multi-task (CCMT) SemCom system significantly improves task execution accuracy, particularly in complex datasets, if the noise introduced from the communication channel is not limiting the task performance too much. Our findings contribute to a more general SemCom framework capable of handling distributed sources and multiple tasks simultaneously, advancing the applicability of SemCom systems in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Variable Selection in Convex Piecewise Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Sparse Gradient Descent as a solution for variable selection in convex piecewise linear regression where the model is given as $\mathrm{max}\langle a_j^\star, x \rangle + b_j^\star$ for $j = 1,\dots,k$ where $x \in \mathbb R^d$ is the covariate vector. Here, $\{a_j^\star\}_{j=1}^k$ and $\{b_j^\star\}_{j=1}^k$ denote the ground-truth weight vectors and intercepts. A non-asymptotic local convergence analysis is provided for Sp-GD under sub-Gaussian noise when the covariate distribution satisfies sub-Gaussianity and anti-concentration property. When the model order and parameters are fixed, Sp-GD provides an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate given $\mathcal{O}(\max(\epsilon^{-2}\sigma_z^2,1)s\log(d/s))$ observations where $\sigma_z^2$ denotes the noise variance. This also implies the exact parameter recovery by Sp-GD from $\mathcal{O}(s\log(d/s))$ noise-free observations. Since optimizing the squared loss for sparse max-affine is non-convex, an initialization scheme is proposed to provide a suitable initial estimate within the basin of attraction for Sp-GD, i.e. sufficiently accurate to invoke the convergence guarantees. The initialization scheme uses sparse principal component analysis to estimate the subspace spanned by $\{ a_j^\star\}_{j=1}^k$ then applies an $r$-covering search to estimate the model parameters. A non-asymptotic analysis is presented for this initialization scheme when the covariates and noise samples follow Gaussian distributions. When the model order and parameters are fixed, this initialization scheme provides an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate given $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2}\max(\sigma_z^4,\sigma_z^2,1)s^2\log^4(d))$ observations. Numerical Monte Carlo results corroborate theoretical findings for Sp-GD and the initialization scheme.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Multi-UAV Collaborative Sensing Data Collection: A Hybrid TDMA-NOMA-Cooperative Transmission in Cell-Free MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a collaborative sensing and data collection system in which multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) sense an area of interest and transmit images to a cloud server (CS) for processing. To accelerate the completion of sensing missions, including data transmission, the sensing task is divided into individual private sensing tasks for each UAV and a common sensing task that is executed by all UAVs to enable cooperative transmission. Unlike existing studies, we explore the use of an advanced cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network, which effectively manages inter-UAV interference. To further optimize wireless channel utilization, we propose a hybrid transmission strategy that combines time-division multiple access (TDMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and cooperative transmission. The problem of jointly optimizing task splitting ratios and the hybrid TDMA-NOMA-cooperative transmission strategy is formulated with the objective of minimizing mission completion time. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed task allocation and hybrid transmission scheme in accelerating the completion of sensing missions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.12124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When an individual's DNA is sequenced, sensitive medical information becomes available to the sequencing laboratory. A recently proposed way to hide an individual's genetic information is to mix in DNA samples of other individuals. We assume that the genetic content of these samples is known to the individual but unknown to the sequencing laboratory. Thus, these DNA samples act as "noise" to the sequencing laboratory, but still allow the individual to recover their own DNA samples afterward. Motivated by this idea, we study the problem of hiding a binary random variable $X$ (a genetic marker) with the additive noise provided by mixing DNA samples, using mutual information as a privacy metric. This is equivalent to the problem of finding a worst-case noise distribution for recovering $X$ from the noisy observation among a set of feasible discrete distributions. We characterize upper and lower bounds to the solution of this problem, which are empirically shown to be very close. The lower bound is obtained through a convex relaxation of the original discrete optimization problem, and yields a closed-form expression. The upper bound is computed via a greedy algorithm for selecting the mixing proportions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aperiodic autocorrelation is an important indicator of performance of sequences used in communications, remote sensing, and scientific instrumentation. Knowing a sequence's autocorrelation function, which reports the autocorrelation at every possible translation, is equivalent to knowing the magnitude of the sequence's Fourier transform. The phase problem is the difficulty in resolving this lack of phase information. We say that two sequences are equicorrelational to mean that they have the same aperiodic autocorrelation function. Sequences used in technological applications often have restrictions on their terms: they are not arbitrary complex numbers, but come from a more restricted alphabet. For example, binary sequences involve terms equal to only $+1$ and $-1$. We investigate the necessary and sufficient conditions for two sequences to be equicorrelational, where we take their alphabet into consideration. There are trivial forms of equicorrelationality arising from modifications that predictably preserve the autocorrelation, for example, negating a binary sequence or reversing the order of its terms. By a search of binary sequences up to length $44$, we find that nontrivial equicorrelationality among binary sequences does occur, but is rare. An integer $n$ is said to be equivocal when there are binary sequences of length $n$ that are nontrivially equicorrelational; otherwise $n$ is unequivocal. For $n \leq 44$, we found that the unequivocal lengths are $1$--$8$, $10$, $11$, $13$, $14$, $19$, $22$, $23$, $26$, $29$, $37$, and $38$. We pose open questions about the finitude of unequivocal numbers and the probability of nontrivial equicorrelationality occurring among binary sequences.</description>

      <title>An Instance-Based Approach to the Trace Reconstruction Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the trace reconstruction problem, one observes the output of passing a binary string $s \in \{0,1\}^n$ through a deletion channel $T$ times and wishes to recover $s$ from the resulting $T$ "traces." Most of the literature has focused on characterizing the hardness of this problem in terms of the number of traces $T$ needed for perfect reconstruction either in the worst case or in the average case (over input sequences $s$). In this paper, we propose an alternative, instance-based approach to the problem. We define the "Levenshtein difficulty" of a problem instance $(s,T)$ as the probability that the resulting traces do not provide enough information for correct recovery with full certainty. One can then try to characterize, for a specific $s$, how $T$ needs to scale in order for the Levenshtein difficulty to go to zero, and seek reconstruction algorithms that match this scaling for each $s$. We derive a lower bound on the Levenshtein difficulty, and prove that $T$ needs to scale exponentially fast in $n$ for the Levenshtein difficulty to approach zero for a very broad class of strings. For a class of binary strings with alternating long runs, we design an algorithm whose probability of reconstruction error approaches zero whenever the Levenshtein difficulty approaches zero. For this class, we also prove that the error probability of this algorithm decays to zero at least as fast as the Levenshtein difficulty.</description>

      <title>Random Reed-Solomon Codes and Random Linear Codes are Locally Equivalent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02238v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an equivalence between two important random ensembles of linear codes: random linear codes (RLCs) and random Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. Specifically, we show that these models exhibit identical behavior with respect to key combinatorial properties, such as list-decodability and list-recoverability, when the alphabet size is sufficiently large.
  We introduce monotone-decreasing local coordinate-wise linear (LCL) properties, a new class of properties designed for studying the large alphabet regime. This class encompasses list-decodability, list-recoverability, and their average-weight variants. We develop a framework to analyze these properties and prove a threshold theorem for RLCs. Specifically, we identify a threshold rate $ R_P $ for any LCL property $P$, where RLCs are likely to satisfy $P$ when $ R &lt; R_P $ and unlikely to do so when $ R &gt; R_P $. We extend this threshold theorem to random RS codes and prove that they share the same threshold $ R_P $, thereby establishing the equivalence between the two ensembles and enabling unified analysis of list-recoverability and related properties.
  Applying our framework, we compute the threshold rate for list-decodability, proving that both random RS codes and RLCs achieve the generalized Singleton bound. This recovers recent results of Alrabiah, Guruswami, and Li (2023) via elementary methods. Additionally, we provide an upper bound on the list-recoverability threshold and conjecture that this bound is tight. Our approach suggests a plausible pathway for proving this conjecture and thus pinpointing the list-recoverability parameters of both models.</description>

Abstract: The initial 6G networks will likely operate in the upper mid-band (7-24 GHz), which has decent propagation conditions but underwhelming new spectrum availability. In this paper, we explore whether we can anyway reach the ambitious 6G performance goals by evolving the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology from being massive to gigantic. We describe how many antennas are needed and can realistically be deployed, and what the peak user rate and degrees-of-freedom (DOF) can become. We further suggest a new deployment strategy that enables the utilization of radiative near-field effects in these bands for precise beamfocusing, localization, and sensing from a single base station site. Finally, we identify five open research challenges that must be overcome to efficiently use gigantic MIMO dimensions in 6G from hardware, cost, and algorithmic perspectives.</description>

      <title>Assembly Theory Reduced to Shannon Entropy and Rendered Redundant by Naive Statistical Algorithms</title>

Abstract: We respond to arguments against our criticism that claim to show a divergence of Assembly Theory from popular compression. We have proven that any implementation of the concept of `copy number' underlying Assembly Theory (AT) and its assembly index (Ai) is equivalent to Shannon Entropy and not fundamentally or methodologically different from algorithms like ZIP compression. We show that the weak empirical correlation between Ai and LZW, which the authors offered as a defense against the proof that the assembly index calculation method is a compression scheme, is based on an incomplete and misleading experiment. When the experiment is completed, the asymptotic convergence to LZ compression and Shannon Entropy is evident and aligned with the mathematical proof previously offered. Therefore, this completes the theoretical and empirical demonstrations that any variation of the copy-number concept underlying AT, which resorts to counting the number of object repetitions `to arrive at a measure for life,' is equivalent to statistical compression and Shannon Entropy. We demonstrate that the authors' `we-are-better-because-we-are-worse' defense argument against compression does not withstand basic scrutiny and that their empirical results separating organic from inorganic compounds have not only been previously reported -- sans claims to unify physics and biology -- but are also driven solely by molecular length, not a particular feature of life captured by their assembly index. Finally, we show that Ai is a particular case of our BDM introduced almost a decade earlier and that arguments attributing special stochastic properties to Ai are misleading, not unique, and exactly the same as those that Shannon Entropy is already not only equipped with but designed for which we have also proven to be equivalent to Ai making AT redundant even in practice when applied to their own experimental data.</description>

      <title>Identification over Affine Poisson Channels: Applications to Molecular Mixture Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identification capacity has been established as a relevant performance metric for various goal-/task-oriented applications, where the receiver may be interested in only a particular message that represents an event or a task. For example, in olfactory molecular communications (MCs), odors or pheromones, which are often a mixture of various molecule types, may signal nearby danger, food, or a mate. In this paper, we examine the identification capacity with deterministic encoder for the discrete affine Poisson channel which can be used to model MC systems with molecule counting receivers. We establish lower and upper bounds on the identification capacity in terms of features of affinity matrix between the released molecules and receptors at the receiver. As a key finding, we show that even when the number of receptor types scales sub-linearly in the number of molecule types $N,$ the number of reliably identifiable mixtures can grow super-exponentially with the rank of the affinity matrix, $T,$ i.e., $\sim 2^{(T \log T)R},$ where $R$ denotes the coding rate. We further drive lower and upper bounds on $R,$ and show that the proposed capacity theorem includes several known results in the literature as its special cases.</description>

      <title>RSRP Measurement Based Channel Autocorrelation Estimation for IRS-Aided Wideband Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The passive and frequency-flat reflection of IRS, as well as the high-dimensional IRS-reflected channels, have posed significant challenges for efficient IRS channel estimation, especially in wideband communication systems with significant multi-path channel delay spread. To address these challenges, we propose a novel neural network (NN)-empowered framework for IRS channel autocorrelation matrix estimation in wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. This framework relies only on the easily accessible reference signal received power (RSRP) measurements at users in existing wideband communication systems, without requiring additional pilot transmission. Based on the estimates of channel autocorrelation matrix, the passive reflection of IRS is optimized to maximize the average user received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over all subcarriers in the OFDM system. Numerical results verify that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing powermeasurement-based IRS reflection designs in wideband channels.</description>
