      <title>Minimising Interference in Low-Pressure Supersonic Beam Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-jet atomic, cluster &amp; molecular sources are used to produce beams of low-energy, neutral particles and find application in a wide array of technologies, from neutral atom microscopes to instruments for surface processing. However, understanding and maximising the intensity derived from such sources has proven challenging, partly because of the interference of gas in the vacuum chamber with the beam. Here, we describe a semi-analytic method to estimate the resulting attenuation in low-pressure free-jet sources. We explicitly calculate the two contributions to the interference, which arise from the interaction of the beam with (i) background gas and (ii) atoms backscattered from the 'skimmer', a conical aperture designed to extract the centre of the expansion. We demonstrate that at high stagnation temperatures the former dominates, suggesting that the design of the skimmer has an insignificant impact at around room temperature. We also determine a number of scaling relationships and analytic formulae to make it easier to include 'skimmer interference' in future calculations of the centre-line intensity. We present experimental evidence to support our approach. Finally, we apply the theory to develop a number of design recommendations for the skimmer and vacuum chamber to enhance desirable beam properties for spectroscopy and microscopy when using cryogenic-temperature atom or molecular beams.</description>

      <title>Some Theoretical Aspects of Observation of Acceleration Induced Thermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work by M.H.Lynch, E.Cohen, Y.Hadad and I.Kaminer (LCHK), a modified model of the Unruh-DeWitt quantum detector, coupled to a 4-vector current, has been proposed to examine the radiation emitted by high energy positrons channeled into silicon crystal samples. Inspired by their ideas, we analyze theoretical aspects of such a model, its internal consistency, and ignore all questions related to experiments. The two-potential correlation functions for the quantized electromagnetic field in a vacuum state and the corresponding detector radiation power (DRP), considered in proper time formalism, are used as the basis for investigating the radiation observed at an accelerating point detector. The quantum detector is assumed to be moving through an electromagnetic vacuum along a classical hyperbolic trajectory with a constant proper acceleration. The DRP is obtained for three possible cases. First, the DRP is found in a Lorentz-invariant manner. It contains both transverse and non-physical longitudinal polarization modes and is a divergent quantity. Second, the radiation power holds only physical transverse modes but it is non-relativistic and also depends on the detector proper time, which contradicts the fact that there is no preferred time for hyperbolic detector motion. Third, in the case considered by LCHK, for zero detector proper time when its velocity in the lab inertial system is zero, the radiation power with transverse modes shows some signs of thermality which could be associated with a detector acceleration but different from the Bose-Einstein statistics expected for the photon field. If the detector energy gap is zero then, in complete contradiction with what LCHK claim, there is no radiation and no "thermalized Larmor formula". Based on our analysis we do not believe that the LCHK's model can be used to support the idea about thermal effects of uniform acceleration.</description>

      <title>Universality and threshold laws for collision lifetimes at ultralow temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While collision lifetimes are a fundamental property of few-body scattering events, their behavior at ultralow temperatures is not completely understood. We derive a general expression for the Smith lifetime Q-matrix using multichannel quantum defect theory, which allows us to obtain the average time delay in the incident $s$-wave collision channel in the limit of zero collision energy $E$, $Q_{11}=A/\sqrt{E} + B$, where $A$ and $B$ are constants. We show that the time delay is dominated by elastic scattering, and contains an additional multichannel contribution independent of the two-body scattering length. We also obtain the expressions for the collision lifetime using the universal model of Idziaszek and Julienne [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 113202 (2010)]. The lifetime acquires an imaginary part in the presence of inelastic loss due to the lack of unitarity of the S-matrix, and shortens with increasing the short-range loss parameter $y$.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Theory for Optical Cooling of a Trapped Atom with Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooling atoms to the ground-state of optical tweezers is becoming increasingly important for high-fidelity imaging, cooling, and molecular assembly. While extensive theoretical work has been conducted on cooling in free space, fewer studies have focused on cooling in bound states. In this work, we present a unified formalism for optical cooling mechanisms in neutral atom tweezers, including resolved and unresolved sideband cooling with different trapping potentials, polarization gradient cooling, gray molasses cooling, $\Lambda$-enhanced gray molasses cooling, and Raman sideband cooling. We perform simulations and demonstrate good agreement with a simplified spin model. We derive and discuss the fundamental limits of each cooling mechanism and propose new strategies for achieving ground-state cooling in optical tweezers. Our findings provide valuable insights into optimizing cooling schemes for neutral atoms in optical tweezers, paving the way for minimizing thermal decoherence in Rydberg and molecular gates and improving efficiencies of molecular assembly.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Pauli errors on cluster states by weighted distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of evaluating the difference between quantum states before and after being affected by errors encoded in unitary transformations. Standard distance functions, e.g., the Bures length, are not fully adequate for such a task. Weighted distances are instead appropriate information measures to quantify distinguishability of multipartite states. Here, we employ the previously introduced weighted Bures length and the newly defined weighted Hilbert-Schmidt distance to quantify how much single-qubit Pauli errors alter cluster states. We find that different errors of the same dimension change cluster states in a different way, i.e., their detectability is in general different. Indeed, they transform an ideal cluster state into a state whose weighted distance from the input depends on the specific chosen Pauli rotation, as well as the position of the affected qubit in the graph related to the state. As these features are undetected by using standard distances, the study proves the usefulness of weighted distances to monitor key but elusive properties of many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Generation of ultrashort ion pulses from ultrafast electron-stimulated desorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient method to produce laser-triggered proton pulses well below 500 ps pulse width at keV energies. We use femtosecond photoelectron pulses emitted from a cathode to enable ultrafast electron-stimulated desorption of adsorbates on a stainless steel plate under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. While direct photoionization of atoms to form well-timed ion pulses can suffer from a laser-focus-limited large starting volume, in our method the two-dimensional starting plane of the ions is defined with nanometer precision at a solid surface. We clearly outline how the method could be used in the future to efficiently produce ion beam pulses in the (sub)picosecond range for pump-probe experiments with ions.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Dark Matter Search with Space-Time Separated Atomic Clocks and Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We devise and demonstrate a method to search for non-gravitational couplings of ultralight dark matter to standard model particles using space-time separated atomic clocks and cavity-stabilized lasers. By making use of space-time separated sensors, which probe different values of an oscillating dark matter field, we can search for couplings that cancel in typical local experiments. This provides sensitivity to both the temporal and spatial fluctuations of the field. We demonstrate this method using existing data from a frequency comparison of lasers stabilized to two optical cavities connected via a 2220 km fiber link [Schioppo et al., Nat. Commun. 13, 212 (2022)], and from the atomic clocks on board the Global Position System satellites. Our analysis results in constraints on the coupling of scalar dark matter to electrons, d_me, for masses between 1e-19 eV/c^2 and 2e-15 eV/c^2. These are the first constraints on d_me alone in this mass range.</description>

      <title>Constraining CP violating nucleon-nucleon long range interactions in diatomic eEDM searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The searches for CP violating effects in diatomic molecules, such as $\text{HfF}^+$ and ThO, are typically interpreted as a probe of the electron's electric dipole moment ($e\text{EDM}$), a new electron-nucleon interaction, and a new electron-electron interaction. However, in the case of a nonvanishing nuclear spin, a new CP violating nucleon-nucleon long range force will also affect the measurement. Here, we use the $\text{HfF}^+$ $e\text{EDM}$ search and derive a new bound on this hypothetical interaction, which is the most stringent from terrestrial experiments in the 1 eV-10 keV mass range. These multiple new physics sources motivate independent searches in different molecular species for CP violation at low energy that result in model independent bounds, which are insensitive to cancellation among them.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and far-from-equilibrium equation of state of Bogoliubov waves in Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bogoliubov waves are fundamental excitations of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). They emerge from a perturbed ground state and interact nonlinearly, triggering turbulent cascades. Here, we study turbulent BECs theoretically and numerically using the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii model and its wave-kinetic equations. We derive a new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum for short Bogoliubov waves and find a complete analytical expression for the spectrum in the long acoustic regime. We then use our predictions to explain the BEC equation of state reported in [Dora et al. Nature 620,521 (2023)], and to suggest new experimental settings.</description>
