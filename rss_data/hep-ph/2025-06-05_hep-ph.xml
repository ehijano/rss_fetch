      <title>High-energy dynamics of QCD: Theoretical and phenomenological results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the behavior of hadronic matter in the high-energy Regge-Gribov (semi-hard) regime of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), accessible through current and future colliders such as the LHC, EIC, and FCC. Central to the analysis is the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) formalism, with detailed treatment of the BFKL equation in both leading and next-to-leading logarithmic approximations. A major focus is placed on the computation of real next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to the Higgs boson impact factor, incorporating finite top-quark mass effects. These corrections are essential for improving precision in Higgs production processes at large rapidity separations. The study also explores the semi-inclusive production of exotic tetraquark states, employing a hybrid framework that combines collinear and BFKL dynamics within a variable-flavor number scheme. Updated fragmentation functions for bottomonium-like states are provided, offering improved predictions at 14 TeV and 100 TeV. Additionally, the work addresses diffractive di-hadron production in the small-x saturation regime using the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) formalism, presenting preliminary leading-order analytical results.</description>

      <title>Reducing Hadronic Uncertainty in Low-Energy Neutral-Current Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the dominant hadronic uncertainty in low-energy neutral-current (anti)neutrino scattering, estimated at the $3$-$4$ per mille level. This uncertainty arises from limited knowledge of the charge-isospin correlation function of quark currents. We study the charge-charge and charge-isospin correlators within $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). In $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ ChPT, the two correlators are identical to all orders in the chiral and electromagnetic expansions. We further perform a one-loop $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ ChPT calculation and discuss the relevant counterterms. Our findings reduce the hadronic uncertainty in neutral-current processes such as (anti)neutrino-electron and coherent elastic (anti)neutrino-nucleus scattering to the sub-permille level, $\lesssim 1$ per mille.</description>

      <title>Effective description of Nelson-Barr models and the theta parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nelson-Barr theories solve the strong CP problem with CP spontaneously broken at \Lambda_{CP} and transmitted to the CP conserving version of the SM through vector-like quarks (VLQs). For an arbitrary number of CP breaking scalars and VLQs, we perform the full one-loop matching calculations at \Lambda_{CP} up to dimension five operators and the relevant matching calculations at the VLQ scale relevant to tracking the contributions to the parameter \bar{\theta}. In the EFT after the CP breaking scalars have been integrated out, we confirm that the running of \bar{\theta} at one-loop is induced by CP violating dimension five operators and similarly by dimension six operator after matching to the SMEFT. In the latter, an additional contribution enters in the matching to \bar{\theta} at tree-level due to a dimension five operator. Analyzing the experimental constraint from \bar{\theta} for generic settings, we see that a large separation between \Lambda_{CP} and the VLQ scale already suppresses the one-loop contribution to \bar{\theta} sufficiently. We confirm that a simple extension based on a nonconventional CP has a vanishing one-loop contribution to \bar{\theta}. Part of our results can be also applied to generic VLQ extensions of the SM.</description>

      <title>Multi-step Strong First-Order Electroweak Phase Transitions in the Inverted Type-I 2HDM: Parameter Space, Gravitational Waves, and Collider Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the electroweak phase transition (EWPT) in the Type-I two-Higgs-doublet model under the inverted Higgs scenario, where the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson corresponds to the heavier \textit{CP}-even scalar. We systematically map the parameter space viable for strong first-order EWPTs (SFOEWPTs) under current theoretical and experimental constraints, revealing that such transitions can occur through one-step, two-step, and rarely three-step pathways with distinct phenomenological characteristics. One-step transitions confine $m_{H^\pm}$ to $[295, 441]{\;{\rm GeV}}$ and $\tan\beta$ to $[4.2, 8.8]$, whereas two-step transitions allow broader ranges: $m_{H^\pm} \in [100, 350]{\;{\rm GeV}}$ and $\tan\beta \in [2.5, 45.4]$. Notably, SFOEWPTs involving negative $\sin (\beta-\alpha)$ appear almost exclusively in the one-step case, offering a potential discriminator. This study also provides the first detailed calculation of LISA gravitational wave (GW) signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for multi-step SFOEWPTs in this scenario, finding that detectable GW signals (SNR $&gt;10$) predominantly arise from two-step transitions. Furthermore, we show that while a correlation between the vacuum uplifting measure $\Delta {F}_0$ and EWPT strength $\xi_c$ is affirmed for one-step transitions, this correlation breaks down for multi-step pathways. Finally, we conduct the first dedicated collider analysis at the 1.5 TeV CLIC for representative benchmark points supporting an SFOEWPT, identifying $e^+ e^- \to H^+H^- \to W^+ W^- hh$ as a promising discovery channel. We emphasize the enhancement of $\text{Br}(h \to \gamma\gamma)$ for negative $\sin(\beta-\alpha)$ and propose two golden final states, $W^+ W^- b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$ and $W^+ W^- b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$, with negligible backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Modelling Coincident Particle Production in Ultraperipheral Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of coincident particle production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions. In particular, we present the first detailed and differential predictions for coincident $\rho^0$ meson production in association with muon pair production, motivated by the recent ATLAS measurement of this process. These are found to describe the data well, including the dependence of the coincidence fraction on the ZDC selection and/or other kinematic constraints on the muons. Differential predictions at the level of various kinematic variables are presented, and the calculation is made publicly available in the SuperChic MC generator. We also present general results for coincident two photon-initiated production, focussing on muon and electron pair production; while the former is rather suppressed, the latter will be ubiquitous near threshold. The impact of coincident production on exclusivity vetos in ultraperipheral measurements is discussed.</description>

      <title>Parametric Coincidence in the Baryon to Dark Matter Ratio from Affleck-Dine Baryogenesis and UV Freeze-in Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We highlight that the observed concurrence between the baryon and dark matter relic densities can be explained via a parametric coincidence between two distinct production mechanisms: Affleck-Dine baryogenesis and dark matter UV freeze-in. In the Affleck-Dine mechanism, the baryon asymmetry is naturally proportional to the inflationary reheating temperature $T_{\rm rh}$, which also plays a critical role in setting the relic abundance of UV freeze-in dark matter. Since Affleck-Dine baryogenesis requires flat directions in the potential, the framework is inherently supersymmetric, offering compelling UV freeze-in dark matter candidates such as the gravitino. We outline scenarios in which $T_{\rm rh}$ simultaneously determines both relic abundances, resulting in a baryon-to-dark matter ratio of order unity that is largely insensitive to $T_{\rm rh}$. We also discuss the conditions required to avoid Q-ball formation or dark matter production by other mechanisms, such as NLSP decays, to preserve the parametric coincidence between baryon and dark matter abundances.</description>

      <title>Local-equilibrium theory of neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miscidynamics describes coarse-grained neutrino transport under the assumption that flavor mixing is in local equilibrium. Here we introduce the concept of turbulent flavor-wave viscosity and develop techniques for including it in miscidynamics. This extension of the theory is necessary when neutrinos develop weak flavor instabilities as a result of astrophysical driving. The flavor-wave dispersion relation is obtained using a new and more general form of linear analysis, which does not require small flavor coherence. Flavor-wave transport is then approximated using wave kinetics and geometric optics. We hypothesize that the dynamical emergence of local oscillation invariants restricts the extent of flavor thermalization. In this view, flavor evolution is sculpted by both entropy-increasing and order-promoting factors.</description>

      <title>Stringent Constraints on New Pseudoscalars from Precision Hyperfine Splitting Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles and similar new pseudoscalar bosons coupled to nucleons and electrons are predicted to lead to spin-dependent forces in atoms and ions. We argue that hyperfine structure measurements in the hydrogen- and lithium-like charge states are a sensitive probe to this effect. Employing specific differences of these splittings reduces uncertainties due to nuclear effects in hyperfine structure calculations and measurements. Using this, we show that existing measurements on Be provide competitive limits in the region $m_{\phi}\gtrsim 100\,{\rm keV}$, improving upon existing constraints by up to a factor of $8$. We also find that future measurements on Cs and In have a further order of magnitude improved discovery potential when compared with existing bounds.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Isocurvature Bounds on the Minimal QCD Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QCD axion has important connections to early universe cosmology. For example, it is often said that isocurvature limits rule out a combination of high axion decay constant, $f_a$, and high inflationary Hubble scale, $H_I$. High scales are theoretically motivated, so it is important to ask how robust this constraint is. We demonstrate that this constraint is naturally evaded when the quartic coupling of the complex $U(1)_\mathrm{PQ}$-breaking field is small. In this case, $f_a$ changes from a larger value during inflation to a smaller value in the later universe, suppressing isocurvature perturbations. Importantly, we show that in large parts of parameter space this solution is not jeopardised by overproduction of the axion through parametric resonance. The isocurvature bounds are thus dependent on UV physics. We have found that, even for the minimal QCD axion, large parts of UV parameter space at both high $f_a$ and high $H_I$ are in fact allowed, not ruled out by isocurvature constraints.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network Approach to Quark-Antiquark Color Flux Tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a physics-informed neural network (PINNs) framework for modelling the spatial distribution of chromodynamic fields induced by quark-antiquark pairs, based on lattice Monte Carlo simulations. In contrast to conventional neural networks, PINNs incorporate physical laws--expressed here as differential equations governing type-II superconductivity--directly into the training objective. By embedding these equations into the loss function, we guide the network to learn physically consistent solutions. Adopting an inverse problem approach, we extract the parameters of the superconducting equations from lattice QCD data and subsequently solve them. To accommodate physical boundary conditions, we recast the system into an integro-differential form and extend the analysis within the fractional PINNs framework. The accuracy of the reconstructed field distribution is assessed via relative $L_2$-error norms. We further extract physical observables such as the string tension and the mean width of the flux tube, offering quantitative insight into the confinement mechanism. This method enables the reconstruction of colour field profiles as functions of quark-antiquark separation without recourse to predefined parametric models. Our results illuminate aspects of the dual Meissner effect and highlight the promise of data-driven strategies in addressing non-perturbative challenges in quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Imaginary Rotating Gluonic Matter at Strong Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We write down an effective theory of the Polyakov loop to investigate the deconfinement phase transition of imaginary-rotating gluonic matter using the strong-coupling expansion. We find the strength of the nearest-neighbor Polyakov-loop interaction modified by the sum of contributions involving the chair-type loops along the temporal direction. Our results show that the deconfinement transition temperature increases with increasing imaginary angular velocity, which agrees with the predictions from the models and the high-temperature perturbative calculations.</description>

      <title>Off-shell ambiguities in correlation functions: strategies to minimize them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We face here the problem of uncertainties in correlation functions due to the freedom in the off-shell dependence of the wave functions, or equivalently, off-shell ambiguities in the scattering matrices. We make the study for the case of meson baryon interaction, choosing the $K\Lambda$, $K \Sigma$, $\eta N$ coupled channels, which are related to the $N^*(1535)$ resonance. We find that using realistic interactions based on chiral dynamics the uncertainties are small, of the order of $2-3$~\%, but could be much bigger if other methods are used. However, our study shows the way to optimally overcome these uncertainties in the analysis of correlation functions, and we provide a series of recommendations for any general analysis.</description>

Abstract: Contribution of photon inverse emission to the dilepton production process in hadron collisions for Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experimental program is calculated in details. Numerical analysis of inverse emission effects on observable quantities (cross sections and forward-backward asymmetry) is performed in a wide kinematical region including the CMS LHC experiment in Run3/HL regime which corresponds to ultra-high energies and dilepton invariant masses. Effective technics of additive relative corrections is applied for analysis of the influence of different radiative contributions on forward-backward asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Fermionic decay of light charged pseudoscalar in Georgi Machacek model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Georgi Machacek (GM) model is a triplet extension of the scalar sector of the Standard Model (SM) containing charged and neutral scalars and pseudoscalars with alluring phenomenology. The CMS and ATLAS collaborations of the LHC at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV already searched for various decays of the charged Higgs boson in low as well as high mass region. The low mass charged Higgs are produced by the decay of top quarks or antiquarks. $H^{\pm}\rightarrow \tau\nu,\, cs$ are the main fermionic decay channels of light charged scalars or pseudoscalars. For low mass region of the charged pseudoscalars, the triplet vev is restricted from above from the indirect search coming from the $b\rightarrow s \gamma$ decay. Here, I consider the observed data from the ATLAS and CMS both for the light charged Higgs decaying into $cs$ and $\tau\nu$. The ATLAS data observed for $H^{\pm}\rightarrow \tau\nu$ offers a more stringent bound on $v_2$ for GM model pseudoscalar mass below $160$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Event Topology Classifiers at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event classifiers are the most fundamental observables to probe the system size and event topology of high-energy collisions. Significant progress has been made to establish suitable event classifiers to probe different physics processes occurring in elementary $e^{+}e^{-}$ to heavy-ion collisions in a range of center of mass energies. One of the major motivations to revisit event classifiers at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) originates from the recent measurements of high multiplicity proton-proton collisions, which have revealed that these small collision systems exhibit features similar to the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), traditionally believed to be only achievable in heavy nucleus-nucleus collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. To pinpoint the origin of these QGP-like phenomena with substantially reduced auto-correlation and selection biases, and to bring all collision systems on equal footing, along with charged-particle multiplicity, lately several event topology classifiers such as transverse sphericity, transverse spherocity, relative transverse activity classifier, and charged-particle flattenicity have been used extensively in experiments as well as in the phenomenological front. In this review article, we extensively discuss the purpose, coverage, and usage guidelines of these event shape classifiers, which can be crucial given the upcoming measurements in a precision era during Runs 3 and 4 of the LHC. In most cases, the event shape observables are found to be better probes in understanding the heavy-ion-like behavior seen at the LHC, while making a multi-differential study of multihadron production dynamics in hadronic and nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>SuSAM-v2: improved superscaling description of electron and CC neutrino quasielastic scattering using effective mass dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an improved version of the Superscaling Analysis with Relativistic Effective Mass, denoted as SuSAM-v2. In the original SuSAM model, a universal scaling function was fitted to a selected set of quasielastic electron scattering (e,e') cross section data, using a phenomenological ansatz inspired by the Relativistic Mean Field model of nuclear matter. In this work, we refine the procedure by first fitting a longitudinal scaling function directly to experimental longitudinal response data. Subsequently, a separate transverse scaling function is extracted from purely transverse data, after subtracting the longitudinal contribution already determined. We find that the resulting transverse scaling function must exhibit an explicit dependence on the momentum transfer q in order to reproduce all kinematics consistently. The resulting SuSAM-v2 model simultaneously describes inclusive quasielastic cross sections and both longitudinal and transverse response functions in electron scattering. The model is then applied to neutrino-nucleus scattering, showing an improved prediction compared to the previous SuSAM-v1 version, due to a more accurate treatment of the relative contributions of the longitudinal and transverse weak nuclear responses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The seesaw type II mechanism is considered within the framework of a left-right chiral model with a gauge group $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)$, the lepton sector of which includes three generations of heavy Majorana neutrinos. The dependence of the mixing parameters of the lightest sterile neutrino as a dark matter particle on the scales of left-right symmetry breaking in the case of direct and inverse hierarchies of active neutrino masses is analyzed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sensitivity to the decay of a heavy neutral lepton into $e^+e^-$-pairs using the solar boron-8 neutrino flux as source. We provide a fully differential cross section for this process including the interference of neutral and charged current amplitudes. We revisit a previous bound from Borexino and make predicitions for the expected sensitivity in future large liquid noble gas detectors, like XLZD, Argo and DUNE, as well as high-resolution scintillator detectors based on the LiquidO technology. We find that more than two orders of magnitude improvement in mixing angle reach is possible relative to existing bounds.</description>

      <title>From Bjorken Scaling to Scaling Violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper traces the historical and conceptual journey from Bjorken scaling to the discovery of scaling violations in deep inelastic scattering, culminating in the development of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Beginning with the challenges faced by early strong interaction theories in the 1950s, we explore the emergence of agnostic approaches such as the bootstrap philosophy and current algebra, which sought to describe hadronic phenomena without relying on specific field theories. The pivotal role of experimental results from SLAC in the late 1960s is highlighted, leading to Bjorken's proposal of scaling in deep inelastic scattering and Feynman's parton model. We then delve into the theoretical breakthroughs of the 1970s, including Wilson's operator product expansion and the renormalization group, which provided the framework for understanding scaling violations. The discovery of asymptotic freedom in non-Abelian gauge theories by Gross, Wilczek, and Politzer marked a turning point, establishing QCD as the theory of strong interactions. Finally, we discuss the formulation of the Altarelli-Parisi equations, which elegantly describe the evolution of parton distribution functions and scaling violations, and their profound impact on the study of hard processes in particle physics. This paper not only recounts the key developments but also reflects on the interplay between theory and experiment that drove the field forward.</description>

      <title>Physics and Computing Performance of the EggNet Tracking Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle track reconstruction is traditionally computationally challenging due to the combinatorial nature of the tracking algorithms employed. Recent developments have focused on novel algorithms with graph neural networks (GNNs), which can improve scalability. While most of these GNN-based methods require an input graph to be constructed before performing message passing, a one-shot approach called EggNet that directly takes detector spacepoints as inputs and iteratively apply graph attention networks with an evolving graph structure has been proposed. The graphs are gradually updated to improve the edge efficiency and purity, thus providing a better model performance. In this work, we evaluate the physics and computing performance of the EggNet tracking pipeline on the full TrackML dataset. We also explore different techniques to reduce constraints on computation memory and computing time.</description>

      <title>Eye of the vortex: bound spectra in tunable horizonless rotational analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog gravity experiments are making remarkable strides in unveiling both the classical and quantum nature of black holes. By harnessing diverse states of matter, contemporary tabletop setups now replicate strong-field phenomena typically confined to the enigmatic regions surrounding black holes. Through these modern gravity simulators, physical processes once considered elusive may finally be brought into experimental reach. In this work, we investigate the bound spectrum of massless scalar excitations propagating within the effective geometry of a rotating acoustic metric. Specifically, we utilize an analog vortex endowed with a tunable parameter that emulates the spacetime of a rotating gravitational background. This model accommodates both the presence of a sonic horizon--characteristic of an acoustic black hole--for non-zero tuning parameters, and its absence when the parameter vanishes, yielding a horizonless, purely rotational vortex flow devoid of radial inflow. We focus on the latter case, where the vortex flow is purely rotational, and compute the spectral properties of the analog system. The resulting bound-state spectrum is found to be qualitatively consistent with that observed in recent experimental realizations of superfluid Helium giant quantum vortices featuring solid or hollow cores. This correspondence suggests that the analog spacetime geometry used here holds significant potential to replicate the phenomenology of cutting-edge laboratory experiments. In doing so, it offers new insight into the intricate landscape of analog black hole spectroscopy and, potentially, the physical topography of bounded, rotating astrophysical environments around black holes.</description>

      <title>The precision measurement of the electron anti-neutrino spectrum in beta-decay of $\rm{^{144}Pr}$ nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\rm{^{144}Ce - ^{144}Pr}$ electron antineutrino source is one of the most suitable radiochemical sources for experiments searching for the oscillations of active neutrinos to the light sterile state. In the current work the $\beta$-spectra of $\rm{^{144}Ce - ^{144}Pr}$ source have been measured by two types of $\beta$-spectrometers based on silicon Si(Li) detectors in order to determine the energy spectrum of electron anti-neutrino emitted in the $\beta$-decay of $\rm{^{144}Pr}$ nuclei. The nuclear form factor of the ground state beta transition in $\rm{^{144}Pr - ^{144}Nd}$ has been obtained with high precision: $C(W) = 1 + (-0.0279\pm 0.0003)W + (-0.076\pm 0.003)W^{-1}$. The reduced cross section for the inverse beta decay reaction on hydrogen for the $\rm{{^{144}Pr}}$ electron anti-neutrino source has been defined as $\rm{(4.7448 \pm 0.0006_{stat} \pm 0.012_{syst}) \times 10^{-44}~cm^2 {decay}^{-1}}$ that provides sufficient sensitivity to search for a sterile neutrino with a mass of $m_4 \sim 1$~eV and a mixing angle $Sin^2(2\theta_{14}) \sim 0.005$ using standard disappearance method.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement in cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss recent progress in the study of entanglement within cosmological frameworks, focusing on both momentum and position-space approaches and also reviewing the possibility to directly extract entanglement from quantum fields. Entanglement generation in expanding spacetimes can be traced back to the phenomenon of gravitational particle production, according to which the background gravitational field may transfer energy and momentum to quantum fields. The corresponding entanglement amount and its mode dependence are both sensitive to the field statistics and to the details of spacetime expansion, thus encoding information about the background. Gravitational production processes also play a key role in addressing the quantum-to-classical transition of cosmological perturbations. In order to directly extract entanglement from quantum fields, local interactions with additional quantum systems, working as detectors, have been suggested, leading to the formulation of the entanglement harvesting protocol. Despite harvesting procedures are currently unfeasible from an experimental point of view, various proposals for implementation exist and a proper modeling of detectors and local interactions is crucial to address entanglement extraction via realistic setups. In the final part of the work, we address entanglement characterization in position space, primarily focusing on black hole spacetimes. We first investigate a possible interpretation of Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy in terms of the entanglement entropy arising in discrete quantum field theories, on account of the area law. Then, we discuss the resolution of the black hole information paradox via the gravitational fine-grained entropy formula, which provides a new way to compute the entropy of Hawking radiation and allows to preserve unitarity in black hole evaporation processes.</description>

      <title>Accessing proton number fluctuations in limited regions of phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In heavy ion collisions particle distributions fluctuate from event to event. It is interesting to study local fluctuations of a specific particle specie, e.g. baryons, in the transverse plane. Fluctuations of the harmonic flow provide an integrated measure of such fluctuations. An alternative approach is to study proton number fluctuations measured in a relatively narrow azimuthal angle window. Due to the transverse flow, particles registered in a narrow azimuthal angle window are emitted predominantly from a region of the fireball located at the same azimuthal angle. Similarly, it is informative to measure the covariance of the number of protons emitted in two opposite windows of azimuthal angles. The main difficulty lies in distinguishing effects of local baryon density fluctuations in the transverse plane from global particle density and collective flow fluctuations. These global volume and flow fluctuations can be estimated using some reference particles, e.g. charged mesons. Reliable estimates of such fluctuations can be constructed both for the second factorial cumulant of the proton number in an azimuthal angle window and for the covariance between two such windows. The simultaneous measurement of both quantities provides a sensitive probe of local baryon number fluctuations superimposed on top of a fluctuating fireball background density.</description>

Abstract: When Anderson localization entered the QCD landscape, it was almost immediately thought about in connection with thermal phases, namely as a factor in the chiral transition. However, recent developments revealed an additional structure that made Anderson-like features central to the genesis of the entirely new thermal phase: the IR phase.

      <title>Stability of domain walls with inflationary fluctuations under potential bias, and gravitational wave signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent study has shown that domain walls with inflationary initial fluctuations exhibit remarkable stability against population bias due to long-range correlations, challenging the claims of prior research. In this paper, we study the dynamics of these domain walls in the presence of potential bias and show that they collapse with a lifetime several times longer than that due to thermal fluctuations. This is interpreted as a difference in the average distance between domain walls, leading us to derive a new formula for the domain wall lifetime which depends on the area parameter in a qualitatively different way from previous studies. In addition, we compute the spectrum of gravitational waves generated by such domain walls and find that both the peak frequency and the peak abundance are lowered in a manner that depends on the area parameter. Based on these findings, we also determine the necessary degree of vacuum degeneracy for axion domain walls to explain the isotropic cosmic birefringence.</description>

Abstract: We present the first detailed study of Standard Model neutrino tridents involving tau leptons at the near detectors of accelerator neutrino facilities. The rates of these processes were previously thought to be negligible, even at future facilities. Our full $2\to 4$ calculation, including both coherent and incoherent scatterings, reveals that the DUNE near detector could observe a considerable number of tau tridents, which is an important background to new physics searches. We identify promising kinematic features that may allow distinction of tau tridents from the usual neutrino charged-current background at DUNE, and thus establish the observation of tau tridents for the first time. We also comment on the detection prospects at other accelerator and collider neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Phenomenology of Identified Particle Spectra in Heavy-Ion Collisions at LHC Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the Zubarev approach of the non-equilibrium statistical operator to investigate the enhancement of the low-$p_T$ region of pion spectra, introducing an effective pion chemical potential to describe the overpopulation of low-energy pion states. We test a corresponding freeze-out approach by analyzing the transverse-momentum spectra of identified particles measured recently with high precision by the ALICE Collaboration in Pb+Pb collisions at CERN LHC. A blast-wave model and a blast-wave-based particle generator, coupled to a hadronic transport model, are utilized. Bayesian inference methods are applied to extract the most probable sets of thermodynamic parameters at the chemical freeze-out hypersurface. Both models for the overpopulated pion states, the hadronic transport model and the thermal model with a nonzero pion chemical potential, provide a satisfactory description of the observed pion spectra. However, both approaches contain approximations which can be improved within a systematic nonequilibrium approach. We demonstrate that the introduction of a nonequilibrium pion chemical potential offers an efficient alternative to the conventional explanation of the low-$p_T$ enhancement, typically attributed to resonance decays with subsequent thermalization. A similar discussion holds also for the kaon spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss modular domain walls and gravitational waves in a class of supersymmetric models where quark and lepton flavour symmetry emerges from modular symmetry. In such models a single modulus field $\tau$ is often assumed to be stabilised at or near certain fixed point values such as $\tau = {\rm i}$ and $\tau = \omega$ (the cube root of unity), in its fundamental domain. We show that, in the global supersymmetry limit of certain classes of potentials, the vacua at these fixed points may be degenerate, leading to the formation of modular domain walls in the early Universe. Taking supergravity effects into account, in the background of a fixed dilaton field $S$, the degeneracy may be lifted, leading to a bias term in the potential allowing the domain walls to collapse. We study the resulting gravitational wave spectra arising from the dynamics of such modular domain walls, and assess their observability by current and future experiments, as a window into modular flavour symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We study the $\Lambda_{b}\to\Lambda_{c}\bar{D}^{0}K^{-}$ and $\Lambda_{b}\to \Lambda_{c}D^{-}\bar{K}^{0}$ decays which proceed via a Cabibbo and $N_c$ favored process of external emission, and we determine the $\bar{D}^{0}K^{-}$ and $D^{-}\bar{K}^{0}$ mass distributions close to the $\bar{D} \bar{K}$ threshold. For this, we use the tree level contribution plus the rescattering of the meson-meson components, using the extension of the local hidden gauge approach to the charm sector that produces the $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ resonance. We observe a large enhancement of the mass distributions close to threshold due to the presence of this resonance below threshold. Next we undertake the inverse problem of extracting the maximum information on the interaction of the $\bar{D} \bar{K}$ channels from these distributions, and using the resampling method we find that from these data one can obtain precise values of the scattering lengths and effective ranges, the existence of an $I=0$ bound state with a precision of about $4 \;\rm MeV$ in the mass, plus the $\bar{D} \bar{K}$ molecular probability of this state with reasonable precision. Given the fact that the $\Lambda_{b}\to\Lambda_{c}\bar{D}^{0}K^{-}$ decay is already measured by the LHCb collaboration, it is expected that in the next runs with more statistics of the decay, these mass distributions can be measured with precision and the method proposed here can be used to determine the nature of the $D^*_{s0}(2317)$, which is still an issue of debate.</description>

      <title>Coupled-channel study of $4S$-$3D$ mixing dynamics in $\psi(4220)$ and $\psi(4380)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among charmoniumlike $XYZ$ states, the $\psi(4220)$ and $\psi(4380)$ states have emerged as key candidates for exploring the charmonium spectrum. In this work, we propose a $4S$-$3D$ charmonium mixing scheme for the $\psi(4220)$ and $\psi(4380)$, induced by coupled-channel effects. By constructing a coupled-channel model, we identify the dynamical mechanism responsible for the large mixing angle observed in previous studies, which cannot be explained by conventional potential models alone. Our analysis reveals that the $DD_1$ channel significantly influences the lower state ($\psi(4220)$), while the $D^*D_1$ channel primarily affects the higher state ($\psi(4380)$). Furthermore, we investigate the two-body Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI)-allowed strong decay behaviors of these states, providing insights into their total widths. This study not only supports the $4S$-$3D$ mixing scheme but also offers a deeper understanding of the role of coupled channels in shaping the charmonium spectrum above 4 GeV. Our results align with experimental observations and provide a framework for interpreting future data on charmonium states.</description>

      <title>Exploring fully-heavy tetraquarks through the CGAN framework: Mass and width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully-heavy tetraquark states, $QQ\bar{Q}\bar{Q} (Q=c,b)$, have garnered significant attention both experimentally and theoretically, due to their unique properties and potential to provide new insights into Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In this study, we employ Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) to predict the masses and decay widths of fully-heavy tetraquarks. To deepen our understanding of heavy multiquark structures, we prepare datasets based on two distinct approaches and train the CGAN model using both. The CGAN framework allows us to capture the complex relationships between input features, such as quark content, quantum numbers, and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, and output properties, including mass and decay width. Our predictions, based on the CGAN framework, are consistent with existing data. By combining fundamental knowledge of QCD with advanced machine learning techniques, this work represents a significant step forward in the theoretical understanding of fully-heavy tetraquark states. Our CGAN approach has the potential to become a strong contender for future studies in heavy tetraquark systems, complementing existing theoretical models to deliver more precise results. Additionally, our findings could assist in the search for fully-heavy tetraquark systems in future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we develop the framework of light-front holographic QCD in the presence of a minimal length scale by incorporating the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) into the QCD Lagrangian. From this modified theory, we derive a GUP-corrected light-front holographic QCD (LFH QCD) equation and obtain the corresponding hadronic mass spectrum. Our results show that the hadronic mass spectrum acquires an additional GUP-dependent term that increases the masses. This mass enhancement leads to significantly improved agreement between the theoretical predictions and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Pion Phenomenology from the Thermal Soft-Wall Model of Holographic QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the temperature dependence of the electromagnetic form factor of the pion, its generalized parton distribution $H_{\pi}(T)$, effective mass $m_{\pi}(T)$, radius $r_{\pi}(T)$, electromagnetic charge density $\rho_{\pi}(b, T)$, pion-nucleon coupling constant $g_{\pi NN}(T)$, and the pion-$\Delta$ coupling $g_{\pi \Delta \Delta}(T)$ within the thermal soft-wall model of AdS/QCD. The thermal pion form factor is extrapolated from the zero-temperature case, and based on this, the generalized parton distribution, charge density, and radius are studied at finite temperature. These quantities were analyzed using a thermal dilaton field in the five-dimensional action. Moreover, we determine the theoretical expression for the temperature-dependent pion-nucleon, as well as pion-$\Delta$ coupling, using thermal profile functions of nucleons, $\Delta$ baryons, and the pion. Our results show that the values of these quantities decrease with increasing temperature and vanish near the critical temperature. Our results reproduce expected features of low-energy hadron dynamics, thus validating the phenomenological utility of the thermal soft-wall model.</description>

      <title>First-order phase transitions in the cores of neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05637v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I explore various scenarios for the phase transition within neutron-star matter. I do so by generating large model-agnostic ensemble using Gaussian processes, both with and without explicit inclusion of first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). The ensemble is conditioned with state-of-the-art astrophysical and theoretical inputs in a fully Bayesian approach. I study how the current data affect the posterior probability of the location and the strength of FOPT. I find that the previously observed peak structure of the sound speed remains stable against inclusion of FOPTs. While the current data cannot differentiate between a smooth crossover and a first-order phase transition, 91% of the total evidence consists of equations of state with some form of phase changes, such as FOPT occurring within or terminating the stable branch of neutron stars, or an indication of a crossover to quark matter.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity from Weyl conformal geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review recent developments in physical implications of Weyl conformal geometry. The associated Weyl quadratic gravity action is a gauge theory of the Weyl group of dilatations and Poincar\'e symmetry. Weyl conformal geometry is defined by equivalence classes of the metric and Weyl gauge field ($\omega_\mu$), related by Weyl gauge transformations. Weyl geometry can be seen as a covariantised version of Riemannian geometry with respect to Weyl gauge symmetry (of dilatations). This Weyl gauge-covariant formulation of Weyl geometry is metric, which avoids century-old criticisms on the physical relevance of this geometry, that ignored its gauge symmetry. Weyl quadratic gravity and its geometry have interesting properties: a) Weyl gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken and Einstein-Hilbert gravity and Riemannian geometry are recovered, with $\Lambda&gt;0$; b) this is the only true gauge theory of a space-time symmetry i.e. with a physical (Weyl) gauge boson ($\omega_\mu$); c) all fields and masses have geometric origin (with no added scalar fields); d) the theory has a Weyl gauge invariant geometric regularisation (by $\hat R$) in $d$ dimensions and it is Weyl-anomaly free; this anomaly is recovered in the broken phase after massive $\omega_\mu$ decouples; e) the theory is the leading order of the general Weyl gauge invariant Dirac-Born-Infeld (WDBI) action of Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions; f) in the limit of vanishing Weyl gauge current, one obtains conformal gravity; g) finally, Standard Model (SM) has a natural embedding in conformal geometry with no new degrees of freedom, with successful Starobinsky-Higgs inflation. Briefly, Weyl conformal geometry generates a (quantum) gauge theory of gravity, given by Weyl quadratic gravity, and leads to a unified description, by the gauge principle, of Einstein-Hilbert gravity and SM interactions.</description>

      <title>Extended $\delta N$ formalism: Nonspatially Flat Separate Universe Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\delta N$ formalism is a powerful approach to compute non-linearly the large-scale evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation $\zeta$. It assumes a set of FLRW patches that evolve independently, but in doing so, all the gradient terms are discarded, which are not negligibly small in models beyond slow-roll. In this Letter, we extend the formalism to capture these gradient corrections by encoding them in a homogeneous-spatial-curvature contribution assigned to each FLRW patch. For a concrete example, we apply this formalism to the ultra-slow-roll inflation, and find that it can correctly describe the large-scale evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation from the horizon exit. We also briefly discuss non-Gaussianities in this context.</description>

      <title>Stiffening of matter in quark-hadron continuity: a mini-review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of neutron stars, combined with causality, thermodynamic stability, and nuclear constraints, indicate a rapid stiffening of QCD matter at densities slightly above nuclear saturation density ($n_0 \simeq 0.16\,{\rm fm}^{-3}$). The evolution of the stiffening is faster than expected from purely nucleonic models with many-body repulsion. Taking into account the quark substructure of baryons, we argue that the saturation of quark states occurs at $\sim$ 2-3$n_0$, driving quark matter formation even before baryonic cores of radius $\sim$0.5 fm spatially overlap. We describe the continuous transitions from hadronic to quark matter within a quarkyonic matter model in which gluons are assumed to remain confining at densities of interest. To obtain analytic insight into the transient regime, we construct an ideal model of quarkyonic matter, the {\it IdylliQ} model, in which one can freely switch from baryonic to quark descriptions and vice versa.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the production of Hydrogen and Helium isotopes in heavy-ion collisions in the incident energy range between 80 and 150 MeV/nucleon. We compare their inclusive multiplicities emitted in the transverse plane of the reaction with the predictions given by the thermal model. As a first step, we validate the choice of this approach to describe the experimental measurements. We also show that the transient states have to be explicitly taken into account for a good statistical description of the experimental multiplicities. From the thermodynamical parameter values obtained we complete the existing database built with the use of thermal-statistical models to reproduce particle production in the (ultra-)relativistic-energy measurements. We then proposed a new constraint on the so-called freeze-out region in the temperature (T) versus baryonic chemical potential (muB) phase diagram of the quantum chromodynamics. These new results indicate that there is a common framework to describe the hadron production and nuclear clustering processes in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Modeling frequency instability in high-quality resonant experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern resonant sensing tools can achieve increasingly high quality factors, which correspond to extremely narrow linewidths. In such systems, time-variation of the resonator's natural frequency can potentially impact its ability to accumulate power and its resulting sensitivity. One such example is the Dark SRF experiment, which utilizes superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities with quality factors of $Q\sim10^{10}$. Microscopic deformations of the cavity lead to stochastic jittering of its resonant frequency with amplitude 20 times its linewidth. Naively, one may expect this to lead to a large suppression in accumulated power. In this work, we study in detail the effects of frequency instability on high-quality resonant systems, utilizing the Dark SRF experiment as a case study. We show that the timescale of jittering is crucial to determining its effect on power accumulation. Namely, when the resonant frequency varies sufficiently quickly, the system accumulates power as if there were no jittering at all. This implies that the sensitivity of a jittering resonator is comparable to that of a stable resonator. In the case of Dark SRF, we find that jittering only induces a $\sim 10\%$ loss in power. Our results imply that the dark-photon exclusion bound from Dark SRF's pathfinder run can potentially be refined to be an order of magnitude stronger.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the symmetric mass generation paradigm for lattice chiral gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the symmetric mass generation (SMG) approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories, one attempts to use interactions to render mirror fermions massive without symmetry breaking, thus obtaining the desired chiral massless spectrum. If successful, the gauge field can be turned on, and thus a chiral gauge theory can be constructed in the phase in which SMG takes place. In this paper we argue that the zeros that often replace the mirror poles of fermion two-point functions in an SMG phase are ``kinematical'' singularities, which can be avoided by choosing an appropriate set of interpolating fields that contains both elementary and composite fields. This allows us to apply general constraints on the existence of a chiral fermion spectrum which are valid in the presence of (non-gauge) interactions of arbitrary strength, including in any SMG phase. Using a suitably constructed one-particle lattice hamiltonian describing the fermion spectrum, we discuss the conditions for the applicability of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to this hamiltonian. If these conditions are satisfied, the massless fermion spectrum must be vector-like. We add some general observations on the strong coupling limit of SMG models. Finally, we elaborate on the qualitative differences between four-dimensional and two-dimensional theories that limit the lessons that can be drawn from two-dimensional models.</description>
