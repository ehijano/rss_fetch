      <title>Cosmic censorship in a (dual) collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate cosmic censorship in anti-de Sitter space in holographic models in which the ground state is described by a good singularity. These include supersymmetric truncations of string/M-theory, for which a positive-energy theorem holds. At the boundary, our solutions describe a boost-invariant fluid in which the temperature decreases monotonically with time. On the gravity side, they correspond to black-brane spacetimes with a receding horizon. In classical gravity, curvature invariants at the horizon grow without bound. In the full theory this regime may or may not be reached. In some cases it is avoided by a phase transition to a regular geometry. In others it is reached but the boundary hydrodynamic evolution can be continued, provided the equation of state at parametrically small energies is known. Both cases require the inclusion of finite-$N$ or finite-coupling effects.</description>

      <title>Transdimensional Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note introduces a novel paradigm for conformal defects with continuously adjustable dimensions. Just as the standard $\varepsilon$ expansion interpolates between integer spacetime dimensions, a new parameter, $\delta$, is used to interpolate between different integer-dimensional defects. The ensuing framework is explored in detail for defects of dimension $p=2+\delta$ in both free and interacting $O(N)$ bulk conformal field theories (CFTs) in $d=4-\varepsilon$. Comprehensive calculations are performed to first and second order in $\varepsilon$ and to high or all orders in $\delta$. Additionally, in the large-$N$ limit, the interpolation between defects of dimensions $p=1$ and $p=2$ is analysed for spacetime dimensions $4\leq d\leq 6$. The new parameter $\delta$ provides a natural enrichment of the space of defect CFTs and allows to find new integer dimension or co-dimension defects.</description>

      <title>BRST Noether Theorem and Corner Charge Bracket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a proof of the BRST Noether 1.5th theorem, conjecture in [JHEP 10 (2024) 055], for a broad class of rank-1 BV theories including supergravity and 2-form gauge theories. The theorem asserts that the BRST Noether current of any BRST invariant gauge fixed Lagrangian decomposes on-shell into a sum of a BRST-exact term and a corner term that defines Noether charges. This extends the holographic consequences of Noether's second theorem to gauge fixed theories and, in particular, offers a universal gauge independent Lagrangian derivation of the invariance of the S-matrix under asymptotic symmetries. Furthermore, we show that these corner Noether charges are inherently non-integrable. To address this non-integrability, we introduce a novel charge bracket that accounts for potential symplectic flux and anomalies, providing an honest canonical representation of the asymptotic symmetry algebra. We also highlight a general origin of a BRST cocycle associated with asymptotic symmetries.</description>

      <title>Even More On Twisted $A_{2n}$ Class-S Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our investigation into the Coulomb branches of twisted $A_{2n}$ of class-S. In arXiv:2411.17675, we found predictions for the contributions of twisted punctures to the graded dimensions of the Coulomb branch, based on the behaviour under nilpotent Higgsings and S-duality. While surprisingly powerful, these arguments were indirect. Here, we take a different approach: we define precisely the nature of the automorphism under which the twisted punctures are twisted (in particular, it is order-4, not order-2). From that, we find the local constraints satisfied by the Laurent coefficients of the invariant polynomials in the Higgs field, for all twisted punctures in $A_{2n}$, for all n. A crucial role is played by a new (at least, new in physics) order-reversing map on the set of nilpotent orbits in sp(n). Finally, we construct several examples of Seiberg-Witten curves for 3-punctured spheres in these theories.</description>

      <title>Long lived quasi normal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider magnetically charged AdS black branes with vanishing entropy at zero temperature. We argue that in the presence of a large enough Chern-Simons coupling the quasi normal modes of the brane will have a diminishing imaginary part. Since our result is agnostic to the matter content of the theory it implies that, generically, the boundary theory will possess long lived modes which should be observable in a proper setting.</description>

      <title>SymTFT Approach to 2D Orbifold Groupoids: `t Hooft Anomalies, Gauging, and Partition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the 3D SymTFT approach to study the generalized symmetries and partition functions of 2D CFTs in various orbifolded and fermionic phases. These phases can be realized by the sandwich construction in the associated 3D SymTFTs with different gaped boundaries that encode the data of symmetries in the 2D CFTs. We demonstrate that the gaped boundaries can all be identified with the (fermionic) Lagrangian algebra in the 3D SymTFT, and thus use them to establish webs of dualities of the boundary CFTs in different phases on the level of partition functions. In addition, we introduce the concept of ``para-fermionic Lagrangian algebra" which enables us to construct the partition functions of para-fermionized CFTs on the 2D boundary. Finally, we provide many important examples, including a 3D SymTFT viewpoint on gauging non-invertible symmetries in 2D CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we study a holographic diffeomorphism invariant higher-derivative extension of Bergshoeff-Hohm-Townsend (BHT) cosmological gravity in the context of Wald's formalism. We calculate the entropy, mass and angular momentum of warped anti-de Sitter (WAdS$_3$) black holes in ghost-free BHT massive gravity and its extension using the covariant phase space method. We also compute the central charges of the dual boundary conformal field theories (CFT) from the thermodynamics method.</description>

      <title>Detecting Standard Model Gauge Group from Generalized Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics stands as one of the most profound and successful frameworks for describing the fundamental workings of nature. The global form of the Standard Model gauge group, however, remains an open question: it can be $\left(SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y\right)/\Gamma$ with $\Gamma=1,\mathbb{Z}_2,\mathbb{Z}_3$ or $\mathbb{Z}_6$. The work introduces the fractional topological transport coefficient $\xi$ involving the $U(1)$ B-L symmetry and the $U(1)$ one-form magnetic symmetry of the renormalizable Standard Model, and show that it distinguishes the global form of the Standard Model gauge group. The gauge group is fully determined for specific values of $\xi$, which also depends on the choice of action of the B-L symmetry on the Standard Model known as a fractionalization class. This transport coefficient can be measured in a contact term for the two-point function of the B-L symmetry current with the magnetic one-form symmetry current of the Standard Model. This parallels topological transport in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect, with quarks and the B-L symmetry playing the role of anyons and the $U(1)$ electromagnetic global symmetry respectively.</description>

      <title>RPST-Inspired Formalism for Black Holes in Flat Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel formalism for the thermodynamics of flat black holes, inspired by the Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics (RPST) framework. Our construction is motivated by the observed similarities in the thermodynamic behavior of flat black holes within the R\'enyi entropy framework and that of AdS black holes described by the Bekenstein entropy regime. The RPST framework is, by construction, exclusive to AdS black holes because it depends on the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, which is linked to the central charge $C$ of the dual conformal field theory (CFT). However, for non-AdS black holes, where $\Lambda$ is absent, we introduce a deformation parameter $\lambda$ to replace the central charge $C$. This RPST-inspired formalism incorporates $\lambda$ and its conjugate variable, the response potential $\zeta$, as a new pair of thermodynamic variables, analogous to the central charge $C$ and chemical potential $\mu$ in the AdS case. To illustrate the applicability of this formalism, we analyze two examples: the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) flat black hole and the Kerr black hole.</description>

      <title>N=8 superconformal mechanics: direct construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we constructed the supercharges and Hamiltonians for all variants of superconformal mechanics associated with the superalgebras $osp(8|2), F(4), osp(4^*|4)$, and $su(1,1|4)$. The fermionic and bosonic fields involved were arranged into generators spanning $so(8), so(7), so(5) \oplus su(2)$ and $su(4) \oplus u(1)$ $R$-symmetries of the corresponding superconformal algebras. The bosonic and fermionic parts of these $R$-symmetry generators separately define the constants of motion and form the same algebras. The angular part of the supercharges defining the system have the structure ``$(R-symmetry\; generators)\, \times\, fermions$'' while the angular part of Hamiltonian is just a proper sum of full Casimir operators and its purely bosonic and fermionic parts.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Polarization Energy of a Proca Soliton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an extended Proca model with one scalar field and one massive vector field in one space and one time dimensions. We construct the soliton solution and subsequently compute the vacuum polarization energy (VPE) which is the leading quantum correction to the classical energy of the soliton. For this calculation we adopt the spectral methods approach which heavily relies on the analytic properties of the Jost function. This function is extracted from the interaction of the quantum fluctuations with a background potential generated by the soliton. Particularly we explore eventual non-analytical components that may be induced by mass gaps and the unconventional normalization for the longitudinal component of the vector field fluctuations. By numerical simulation we verify that these obstacles do actually not arise and that the real and imaginary momentum formulations of the VPE yield equal results. The Born approximation to the Jost function is crucial when implementing standard renormalization conditions. In this context we solve problems arising from the Born approximation being imaginary for real momenta associated with energies in the mass gap.</description>

      <title>Holographic (Eternal) Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a minisuperspace of complex deformations of ABJM theory for which the partition function specifies the amplitude of an eternally inflating universe. The boundary theory predicts that the bosonic bulk is effectively in the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary state, with a subleading 'tunneling' contribution. This holographic model of inflation also reveals a close connection between the swampland distance and cobordism conjectures, and the condition for the asymptotic wave function to predict classical behavior in geometry and fields.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lanczos algorithm offers a method for constructing wave functions for both closed and open systems based on their Hamiltonians. Given that the entire early universe is fundamentally an open system, we apply the Lanczos algorithm to investigate Krylov complexity across different phases of the early universe, including inflation, the radiation dominated period (RD), and the matter dominated period (MD). Notably, we find that Krylov complexity differs between the closed and open system approaches. To effectively capture the impact of potentials during the RD and MD phases, we analyze various inflationary potentials, including the Higgs potential, the $R^2$ inflationary potential, and chaotic inflationary potential, taking into account the violations of slow roll conditions. This analysis is conducted in terms of conformal time through the preheating process. Our numerical results indicate that the evolution of Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy is remarkably similar across both methods, regardless of the potential under consideration. Additionally, we rigorously construct what is referred to as an open two-mode squeezed state, utilizing the second kind of Meixner polynomials. Based on this construction, we are the first to calculate the evolution equations for $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ as they relate to the scale factor. Our findings suggest that dissipative effects lead to a rapid decoherence like behavior. Moreover, our results indicate that inflation behaves as a strongly dissipative system, while both the RD and MD phases exhibit characteristics of weak dissipation. This research provides new insights into exploring the universe from the perspective of quantum information.</description>

      <title>False vacuum decay beyond the quadratic approximation: summation of non-local self-energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the 2PI effective action formalism, we study false vacuum decay beyond the quadratic approximation of the path integral. We derive a coupled system of equations for the bounce and the propagator, and we compute a semi-analytic expression for the self-energy of a real scalar field with cubic and quartic interactions from the 2PI effective action truncated at two loops and without further approximations. Deriving numerical results, we can show that the Hartree approximation, where non-local contributions to the self-energy are neglected, is generally not justified. We find significant corrections to the negative eigenvalue and conclude that the summation of quantum corrections can have dramatic effects on the evaluation of the nucleation rate.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled PT-Symmetric Models in Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum field theories are a promising tool to study open quantum systems. These theories preserve unitarity if PT-symmetry is respected, and in that case an equivalent Hermitian description exists via the so-called Dyson map. Generically, PT-symmetric non-Hermitian theories can also feature phases where PT-symmetry is broken and unitarity is lost. We review the construction of holographic duals to strongly coupled PT-symmetric quantum field theories and the study of their phase diagram. We next focus on spacetime-dependent non-Hermitian couplings: non-Hermitian quenches and lattices. They violate the null energy condition in the gravity dual. The lattices realize phases supporting an imaginary current that breaks PT-symmetry spontaneously. Remarkably, these non-Hermitian lattices flow to a PT-symmetric fixed point in the IR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a concrete and computable realization of the $ER=EPR$ conjecture, by deriving the Einstein-Rosen bridge from the quantum entanglement in the thermofield double CFT. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the wormhole is explicitly identified as an entanglement entropy between subsystems of the thermofield double state. Furthermore, our results provide a quantitative verification of Van Raamsdonk's conjecture about spacetime emergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain inflationary models can feature periods of preheating - an era preceding reheating during which parametric resonance triggers an exponential production of bosons. This non-perturbative process can have significant impact on the history of our universe, with consequences ranging from altered reheating channels to overproduction of dark radiation to overclosure. In this work, we study parametric resonance production of axions in string models of inflation. We find that the kinetic couplings and moduli-dependent axion masses give rise to generalizations of the Mathieu equation. We study these generalizations and determine the strength of parametric resonance created by such couplings. We then apply this technology to fibre inflation models in Type IIB orientifold compactifications. We find that heavy axions can be copiously produced and avoidance of overclosure results in constraints on the typical fibre inflation parameter space.</description>

      <title>The large $N$ vector model on $S^1\times S^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method to evaluate the partition function and energy density of a massive scalar on a 2-sphere of radius $r$ and at finite temperature $\beta$ as power series in $\frac{\beta}{r}$. Each term in the power series can be written in terms of polylogarithms. We use this result to obtain the gap equation for the large $N$, critical $O(N)$ model with a quartic interaction on $S^1\times S^2$ in the large radius expansion. Solving the gap equation perturbatively we obtain the leading finite size corrections to the expectation value of stress tensor for the $O(N)$ vector model on $S^1\times S^2$. Applying the Euclidean inversion formula on the perturbative expansion of the thermal two point function we obtain the finite size corrections to the expectation value of the higher spin currents of the critical $O(N)$ model. Finally we show that these finite size corrections of higher spin currents tend to that of the free theory at large spin as seen earlier for the model on $S^1\times R^2$.</description>

      <title>Holographic Timelike Entanglement Entropy in Non-relativistic Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timelike entanglement entropy is a complex measure of information that is holographically realized by an appropriate combination of spacelike and timelike extremal surfaces. This measure is highly sensitive to Lorentz invariance breaking. In this work, we study the timelike entanglement entropy in non-relativistic theories, focusing on theories with hyperscaling violation and Lifshitz-like spatial anisotropy. The properties of the extremal surfaces, as well as the timelike entanglement entropy itself, depend heavily on the symmetry-breaking parameters of the theory. Consequently, we show that timelike entanglement can encode, to a large extent, the stability and naturalness of the theory. Furthermore, we find that timelike entanglement entropy identifies Fermi surfaces either through the logarithmic behavior of its real part or, alternatively, via its constant imaginary part, with this constant value depending on the theory's Lifshitz exponent. This provides a novel interpretation for the imaginary component of this pseudoentropy. Additionally, we examine temporal entanglement entropy, an extension of timelike entanglement entropy to Euclidean space, and provide a comprehensive discussion of its properties in these theories.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reinterpret the Nieh-Yan anomaly using holography, finding that the $U(1)$ axial symmetry remains unbroken and the axial current coupling to an external gauge field is conserved. Instead, the anomaly arises from a breakdown of Hodge duality relations between fermion bilinears due to symmetry constraints on one-form currents. We also compute the thermal response of the Nieh-Yan term, revealing its characteristic $T^2$ dependence.</description>

      <title>Constraining model parameters in f(Q,C) gravity: Observational analysis and geometric diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of $f(Q,C)$ gravity with $f(Q,C)=\alpha Q+\beta C$, where $Q$ is the non-metricity scalar and $C$ encapsulates cosmological expansion terms. Three parameterizations of the EoS for dark energy, $\omega=\omega_{0}+\omega_{1}z$, $\omega=\omega_{0}+\frac{\omega_{1}z(1+z)}{1+z^{2}}$ and $\omega=\omega_{0}+\frac{\omega_{1}z^{2}}{1+z^{2}}$ are tested using the Hubble, Hubble plus BAO, and Hubble plus BAO plus Pantheon datasets to constrain model parameters. The resulting Hubble and deceleration parameters reveal a transition from deceleration to acceleration, supporting current cosmic acceleration observations. Analysis of the energy density and pressure confirms positive energy density and a negative pressure for dark energy, potentially driving the late-time acceleration. We examine energy conditions, showing compliance with NEC, WEC and DEC, while SEC remains negative, supporting an accelerated expansion. Statefinder diagnostics suggest that two of the EoS parameterizations lead to Quintessence-like behavior with a time-varying dark energy component, while the third closely approaches $\Lambda$CDM showing slight deviations consistent with recent observations. Sound speed analysis demonstrates the physical stability of all parameterizations.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model using time-dependent disorder in optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a paradigm for extreme quantum chaos, non-Fermi-liquid behavior, and holographic matter. Yet, the dense random all-to-all interactions that characterize it are an extreme challenge for realistic laboratory realizations. Here, we propose a general scheme for densifying the coupling distribution of random disorder Hamiltonians, using a Trotterized cycling through sparse time-dependent disorder realizations. To diagnose the convergence of sparse to dense models, we introduce an information-theory inspired diagnostic. We illustrate how the scheme can come to bear in the realization of the complex SYK$_4$ model in cQED platforms with available experimental resources, using a single cavity mode together with a fast cycling through independent speckle patterns. The simulation scheme applies to the SYK class of models as well as spin glasses, spin liquids, and related disorder models, bringing them into reach of quantum simulation using single-mode cavity-QED setups and other platforms.</description>

      <title>Extremal Kerr-Schild Form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel ansatz, where the full black hole geometry is written as a linear in mass perturbation of the associated extremal black hole base. Contrary to its "standard" version, the corresponding "extremal Kerr-Schild form" is no longer restricted to special algebraic type spacetimes, and is applicable to numerous black hole solutions with matter, such as the charged Kerr-NUT-(A)dS spacetimes, black holes of $D=5$ minimal gauged supergravity, or the charged dilaton-axion rotating solutions. This ansatz is likely to find its applications in black hole perturbation theory, shed new light on the CFT description of non-extremal black holes, as well as be useful for constructing new exact solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the values of observables in chiral eigenstates of the XX quantum spin chain that were introduced in in our recent work and compare the form of the result with the respective expressions obtained in the more familiar eigenbasis of states with fixed magnetization in $z$-direction. We carry out the diagonalization of the XY spin chain in the chiral basis. We calculate the norm of the chiral XY eigenstates, and the values of the one-point functions and some neighbor two-point correlation functions. We interpret the spectrum and the particle content of the XY chain in terms of scattering states of an even number of kink and anti-kink excitations that are created over a reduced Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Space-borne Interferometers to Detect Thousands of Memory Signals Emitted by Stellar-mass Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational memory effect manifests the nonlinearity of the gravitation, reflects the degenerate gravitational vacua, and indicates the types of the asymptotic symmetries. However, by the received wisdom, it would be challenging to detect it. In this Letter, we envisioned employing the space-borne interferometer, especially DECIGO, to detect memory signals generated by the stellar-mass binary black hole (BBHs) systems, the conventional targets of the ground-based detectors. We estimated that during its 5 years' observation, DECIGO could detect nearly 2,258 loud enough memory signals. Among them, 102 have signal-to-noise ratios greater than 8. Our prediction was obtained with the BBH population model constrained by the recent gravitational wave observations in GWTC-3. The Power Law + Peak mass model and the DEFAULT spin model were employed, and the merger rate was chosen to be proportional to the Madau-Dickinson formation rate. In the analysis, the impact of the orbital eccentricity was also considered. The high rate is due to the sufficiently strong memory signal right at the bandwidth of DECIGO, and also because of the humongous number of the surely existing stellar-mass BBHs. The substantial, and yet conservative, number of detections enables to leverage statistical approaches to harness the memory effect for fundamental physics and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid induced by U(1) gauge field interactions: a functional renormalization group analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-Fermi-liquid state formed by an isotropic, degenerate Fermi gas in two spatial dimensions interacting with a U(1) gauge field. Our calculation uses the functional renormalization group (fRG) with a soft frequency cutoff for the fermions. The fRG scheme we employ takes account of the gauge symmetry, which imposes relations (modified Ward-Takahashi identities) between the couplings which constrain the RG flow. The critical exponents and couplings we find for the resulting non-Fermi liquid are mostly insensitive to whether or not we enforce the gauge symmetry constraints, which signifies either that the constraints are superfluous or that the frequency-cutoff scheme is particularly robust. The exception is the gauge-boson mass term, which is RG-relevant about the fixed point without the constraints, but is irrelevant when they are enforced. The latter is physically accurate, as a gauge symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken. In addition, we find $z=2$ and $\Sigma(\omega,k_F)\sim\omega^{1/2}$ for the boson dynamical exponent and scaling of the fermion self-energy, respectively. These results differ considerably from those of past works on the model, though we argue for their plausibility.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the possible existence of a strangeness $S=-3$, isospin $I=1$ pentaquark state $P_{sss}$ generated dynamically from the $\bar{K}\Xi$ interaction. We employ a unitarized scheme in coupled channels based on the chiral Lagrangian expanded up to next-to-leading order (NLO), and show that the inclusion of the NLO terms is crucial to provide the necessary attraction that favors the existence of such triply strange pentaquark. The $\bar{K}\Xi$ femtoscopic correlation functions are calculated as example of a possible experimental measurement in which a direct signal of the $P_{sss}$ state could be observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory for computing the Renyi entropy with general multiple disjoint intervals from the swapping operations. Our theory is proposed based on the fact that we have observed the resemblance between the replica trick in quantum field theory and the swapping operation. Consequently, the Renyi entropy can be obtained by evaluating the expectation values of the swapping operator. As an application, we study the Renyi entropy of a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model for two, three and four disjoint intervals. As the system is at the critical point, our computations of the Renyi entropy are consistent with the analytical results from the conformal field theory. Moreover, our methods can go beyond the critical regime of the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly and internode scatterings in multifold semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our quest to unravel the topological properties of nodal points in three-dimensional semimetals, one hallmark property which warrants our attention is the chiral anomaly. In the Brillouin zone (BZ), the sign of the Berry-curvature field's monopole charge is referred to as the chirality ($\chi$) of the node, leading to the notion of chiral quasiparticles sourcing chiral currents, induced by internode scatterings proportional to the chiral anomaly. Here, we derive the generic form of the chiral conductivity when we have multifold nodes. Since the sum of all the monopole charges in the BZ are constrained to vanish, the nodes appear in pairs of $\chi =\pm 1$. Hence, the presence of band-crossing degeneracies of order higher than two make it possible to have two distinct scenarios -- the pair of conjugate nodes in question comprise bands of the same pseudospin variety or of two distinct pseudospin-representations. Covering these two possibilities, we apply our derived formula to semimetals harbouring triple-point (threefold-degenerate) and Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (fourfold-degenerate) nodes, and show the resulting expressions for the conductivity featuring the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>Statistical features of quantum chaos using the Krylov operator complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently the Krylov operator complexity is proposed to evaluate the operator growth in quantum systems, and the variance of its Lanzcos coefficients is used as an important parameter for chaos. In this paper, we generate samples of random initial operators from given probability distribtions (GOE, GUE and the uniform distribution). For the Sinai billiard model, we study the statistical properties of the variance of Lanzcos coefficients in the associated Krylov space. Depending on whether the system is chaotic or not, the resulting distribution of the variance have different behaviors. In the nonchaotic case, the resulting distributions are almost overlapping together. In the chaotic case, they split into two well-separated groups. Besides, all the resulting distributions of the variance are the normal distribution, as long as the matrix size of the initial operator is large enough. This overlap-to-separation behavior, in the resulting distribution of the variance of Lanczos coefficients, may be a characteristics to distinguish chaotic and nonchaotic dynamics.</description>

  We will go through a brief review on $f(R)$ theories (in the metric approach) and the usual requirements for successful modifications of General Relativity. Then we will open a large parenthesis to talk about a non-standard approach to Phase Transitions: the Catastrophe Theory. Finally, we will connect the previous lectures to introduce a new Thermodynamic interpretation of $f(R)$ theories.</description>

      <title>The Solvay Councils, de Broglie's brothers, and the development of wave-particle duality</title>

Abstract: The meeting patronized by Ernest Solvay in 1911, the first Solvay Council, marked the beginning of what can be called the first quantum revolution. Maurice de Broglie was one of the secretaries of the Council. He participated in the two following conferences and contributed to the third Council with his work. Louis de Broglie collaborated and discussed with his elder brother. Departing from Maurice's achievements, Louis developed his approach to the wave-particle duality of light and extended it to other particles. He presented it at the fifth meeting in 1927. This paper investigates the connection between the two scientists and the Solvay Councils, arguing that this link was essential in developing the first quantum revolution, a process that ended, according to Werner Heisenberg, at the fifth Solvay Physics Council.</description>

      <title>Renormalized one-Loop Corrections in Power Spectrum in USR Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of one-loop corrections on long CMB scale modes in models of single field inflation incorporating an intermediate USR phase is under debate. In this work, we investigate the regularization and renormalization of the one-loop corrections of curvature perturbation power spectrum. Employing the UV-IR regularizations and performing the in-in analysis, we calculate the regularized one-loop corrections, including tadpole, in the power spectrum associated with cubic and quartic Hamiltonians. We show that the fully regularized and renormalized fractional loop correction in the power spectrum is controlled by the peak of the power spectrum at the end of USR phase, scaling like $ e^{6 \Delta {\cal N}}$ in which $\Delta {\cal N} $ is the duration of the USR phase. This confirms the original conclusion that the loop corrections can get out of perturbative control if the transition from the intermediate USR phase to the final SR phase is instantaneous and sharp.</description>

      <title>Mimicking a rotating black hole with nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exhibit the first analogue model of a rotating black hole constructed in the framework of nonlinear electrodynamics. The background electromagnetic field is assumed to be algebraically special and adapted to a geodesic shear-free congruence of null rays in Minkowski spacetime, the Kerr congruence. The corresponding optical metric has a Kerr-Schild form and, it is shown to be characterized by three parameters, thus predicting the existence of an ergosurface, a horizon, and a slice identical to one also present in the Kerr metric.</description>

      <title>Modular invariant inflation, reheating and leptogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use modular symmetry as an organizing principle that attempts to simultaneously address the lepton flavor problem, inflation, post-inflationary reheating, and baryogenesis. We demonstrate this approach using the finite modular group $A_4$ in the lepton sector. In our model, neutrino masses are generated via the Type-I see-saw mechanism, with modular symmetry dictating the form of the Yukawa couplings and right-handed neutrino masses. The modular field also drives inflation, providing an excellent fit to recent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. The corresponding prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio is very small, $r \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$, while the prediction for the running of the spectral index, $\alpha \sim -\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, could be tested in the near future. An appealing feature of the setup is that the inflaton-matter interactions required for reheating naturally arise from the expansion of relevant modular forms. Although the corresponding inflaton decay rates are suppressed by the Planck scale, the reheating temperature can still be high enough to ensure successful Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We find that the same couplings responsible for reheating also contribute to generating part of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through non-thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Yukawa-Lorentz Symmetry of Tilted Non-Hermitian Dirac Semimetals at Quantum Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dirac materials, hosting linearly dispersing quasiparticles at low energies, exhibit an emergent Lorentz symmetry close to a quantum critical point (QCP) separating semimetallic state from a strongly-coupled gapped insulator or superconductor. This feature appears to be quite robust even in the open Dirac systems coupled to an environment, featuring non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac fermions: close to a strongly coupled QCP, a Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry emerges in terms of a unique terminal velocity for both the fermion and the bosonic order parameter fluctuations, while the system can either retain non-Hermiticity or completely decouple from the environment thus recovering Hermiticity as an emergent phenomenon. We here show that such a Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry can emerge at the quantum criticality even when the NH Dirac Hamiltonian includes a tilt term at the lattice scale. As we demonstrate by performing a leading order $\epsilon=3-d$ expansion close to $d=3$ upper critical dimension of the theory, a tilt term becomes irrelevant close to the QCP separating the NH Dirac semimetal and a gapped (insulating or superconducting) phase. Such a behavior also extends to the case of the linear-in-momentum non-tilt perturbation, introducing the velocity anisotropy for the Dirac quasiparticles, which also becomes irrelevant at the QCP. These predictions can be numerically tested in quantum Monte Carlo lattice simulations of the NH Hubbard-like models hosting low-energy NH tilted Dirac fermions.</description>

      <title>The Character Map in Equivariant Twistorial Cohomotopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.06533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental notion of non-abelian generalized cohomology gained recognition in algebraic topology as the non-abelian Poincar\'e-dual to "factorization homology", and in theoretical physics as providing flux-quantization for non-linear Gauss laws. However, already the archetypical example -- unstable Cohomotopy, first studied almost a century ago by Pontrjagin -- may remain underappreciated as a cohomology theory.
  In illustration and amplification of its cohomological nature, we construct the non-abelian generalization of the Chern character map on $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariantized 7-Cohomotopy -- in fact on its "twistorial" version classified by complex projective 3-space -- essentially by computing its equivariant Sullivan model, and we highlight some interesting integral cohomology classes which are extracted this way.
  We end with an outlook on the application of this result to the rigorous deduction of anyonic quantum states on M5-branes wrapped over Seifert 3-orbifolds.</description>

      <title>The commensurate state and lock-in in a holographic model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a holographic model in which the striped structure of charge density is spontaneously formed over an ionic lattice which breaks the translational symmetry explicitly. The effect of commensurate lock-in between the spontaneous stripes and the ionic lattice is observed when the lattice amplitude is large enough. We investigate the optical conductivity as a function of frequency in commensurate state and compare its characteristics during the phase transition from metallic phase to insulating phase. Notably, we find that the DC resistivity in lock-in state increases algebraically with lowering temperature, which is in line with the phenomenon observed in the holographic model for simulating the experimental behavior of Mott insulator in [Nature Phys. 14, no.10, 1049-1055 (2018)]. In addition, at lower temperature the pinning effect is observed for both unlock-in and lock-in states. This holographic model successfully demonstrates the commensurate lock-in signatures, and provides more information for understanding the interplay between ionic lattices and electronic lattices by holography.</description>

      <title>Trans-series from condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (SVZ) sum rules provide a method to obtain trans-series expansions in many quantum field theories, in which exponentially small corrections are calculated by combining the operator product expansion with the assumption of vacuum condensates. In some solvable models, exact expressions for trans-series can be obtained from non-perturbative results, and this makes it possible to test the SVZ method by comparing its predictions to these exact trans-series. In this paper we perform such a precision test in the example of the fermion self-energy in the Gross-Neveu model. Its exact trans-series expansion can be extracted from the large $N$ solution, at the first non-trivial order in $1/N$. It is given by an infinite series of exponentially small corrections involving factorially divergent power series in the 't Hooft parameter. We show that the first two corrections are associated to two-quark and four-quark condensates, and we reproduce the corresponding power series exactly, and at all loops, by using the SVZ method. In addition, the numerical values of the condensates can be extracted from the exact result, up to order $1/N$.</description>

      <title>Critical spin chains and loop models with $U(n)$ symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting with the Ising model, statistical models with global symmetries provide fruitful approaches to interesting physical systems, for example percolation or polymers. These include the $O(n)$ model (symmetry group $O(n)$) and the Potts model (symmetry group $S_Q$). Both models make sense for $n,Q\in \mathbb{C}$ and not just $n,Q\in \mathbb{N}$, and both give rise to a conformal field theory in the critical limit.
  Here, we study similar models based on the unitary group $U(n)$. We focus on the two-dimensional case, where the models can be described either as gases of non-intersecting orientable loops, or as alternating spin chains. This allows us to determine their spectra either by computing a twisted torus partition function, or by studying representations of the walled Brauer algebra.
  In the critical limit, our models give rise to a CFT with global $U(n)$ symmetry, which exists for any $n\in\mathbb{C}$. Its spectrum is similar to those of the $O(n)$ and Potts CFTs, but a bit simpler. We conjecture that the $O(n)$ CFT is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of the $U(n)$ CFT, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ acts as complex conjugation.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we embark on the thermodynamic investigation concerning a family of primary charged black holes within the context of shift and parity symmetric Beyond Horndeski gravity. Employing the Euclidean approach, we derive the functional expression for the free energy and derive the first thermodynamic law, offering a methodology to address the challenge of extracting the thermal quantities in shift-symmetric scalar tensor theories characterized by linear time dependence in the scalar field. Following the formal analysis, we provide some illustrative examples focusing on the thermal evaporation of these fascinating objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotational Freudenthal duality (RFD) relates two extremal Kerr-Newman (KN) black holes (BHs) with different angular momenta and electric-magnetic charges, but with the same Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Through the Kerr/CFT correspondence (and its KN extension), a four-dimensional, asymptotically flat extremal KN BH is endowed with a dual thermal, two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) such that the Cardy entropy of the CFT is the same as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the KN BH itself. Using this connection, we study the effect of the RFD on the thermal CFT dual to the KN extremal (or doubly-extremal) BH. We find that the RFD maps two different thermal, two-dimensional CFTs with different temperatures and central charges, but with the same asymptotic density of states, thereby matching the Cardy entropy. We also discuss the action of the RFD on doubly-extremal rotating BHs, finding a spurious branch in the non-rotating limit, and determining that for this class of BH solutions the image of the RFD necessarily over-rotates.</description>

Abstract: We review recent progress regarding the double scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and other $p$-local quantum mechanical random Hamiltonians. These models exhibit an expansion using chord diagrams, which can be solved by combinatorial methods. We describe exact results in these models, including their spectrum, correlation functions, and Lyapunov exponent. In a certain limit, these techniques manifest the relation to the Schwarzian quantum mechanics, a theory of quantum gravity in $AdS_2$. More generally, the theory is controlled by a rigid algebraic structure of a quantum group, suggesting a theory of quantum gravity on non-commutative $q$-deformed $AdS_2$. We conclude with discussion of related universality classes, and survey some of the current research directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-holography, originally proposed as a model for conducting lattice electrons coupled to a holographic critical sector, leads to an effective theory of non-Fermi liquids with only a few relevant interactions on the Fermi surface in the large $N$ limit. A refined version of such theories has only two effective couplings which give holographic and Fermi-liquid-like contributions to the self-energy, respectively. We show that a low co-dimension sub-manifold exists in the space of refined semi-holographic theories in which strange metallic behavior is manifested, and which can be obtained just by tuning the ratio of the two couplings. On this sub-manifold, the product of the spectral function and the temperature is approximately independent of the critical exponent, the Fermi energy, and the temperature at all frequencies and near the Fermi surface when expressed in terms of suitably scaled momentum and frequency variables. This quasi-universal behavior leads to linear-in-$T$ dc resistivity and Planckian dissipation over a large range of temperatures, and we also obtain $T^{-3}$ scaling of the Hall conductivity at higher temperatures. The quasi-universal spectral function also fits well with photoemission spectroscopic data without varying the critical exponent with the doping. Combining with the results for optical conductivity, we construct a generalized version of Drude phenomenology for strange-metallic behavior which satisfies non-trivial consistency tests. Finally, we discuss a possible dynamical mechanism for the fine-tuning of the ratio of the two couplings necessary to realize the strange metallic behavior in a typical state.</description>

Abstract: In a recent study, Wei et al. [Phys. Rev. D 110, L081501 (2024)] proposed a universal classification scheme that interprets black hole solutions as topological defects within the thermodynamic parameter space, and then divides black hole solutions into four distinct classes, denoted as $W^{1-}$, $W^{0+}$, $W^{0-}$, and $W^{1+}$, offering insights into deeper aspects of black hole thermodynamics and gravity. In this paper, we investigate the universal thermodynamic topological classification of the singly rotating Kerr black holes in all dimensions, as well as the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole. We show that the innermost small black hole states of the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes are thermodynamically unstable, while those of the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole and the $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes are thermodynamically stable. On the other hand, the outermost large black holes exhibit unstable behavior in all these cases. At the low-temperature limit, the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes have one large thermodynamically unstable black hole, while the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole and the $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes feature one large unstable branch and one small stable branch. Conversely, at the high-temperature limit, the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes exhibit a small unstable black hole state, while the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole and the $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes have no black hole states at all. Consequently, we demonstrate that the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes belong to the class $W^{1-}$, whereas the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman and $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes belong to the class $W^{0+}$, thereby further support the conjecture proposed in [Phys. Rev. D 110, L081501 (2024)].</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Ground State Correlators in Matrix Theory, Part I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The D0-brane/Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind matrix theory is a strongly coupled quantum system with an interesting gravity dual. We develop a scheme to derive bootstrap bounds on simple correlators in the matrix theory at infinite $N$ at zero energy by imposing the supercharge equations of motion. By exploiting SO(9) symmetry, we are able to consider single-trace operators involving words of length up to 9 using very modest computational resources. We interpret our initial results as strong evidence that the bootstrap method can efficiently access physics in the strongly coupled, infinite $N$ regime.</description>

      <title>Einstein Equation Governs the Dynamics of Entanglement Entropy in CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The {\it finiteness} of the mixed state entanglement entropy $S_{\text{vN}}$ in CFT$_2$ enables us to show that, the dynamical equation of the coincidence limit of $(\frac{1}{2} S_{vN}^2);_{ij}$ is precisely three dimensional Einstein equation. A profound relation between the cosmological constant and CFT$_2$ entanglement entropy is given. Thus entanglement entropies induce internal gravitational geometries in CFT$_2$. Deriving the dual metric from an entanglement entropy becomes a trivial procedure. Remarkably, we show that the renormalization group equation is a geometric identity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use large-$N$ diagrammatic techniques to calculate the relative entropy of symmetric random states drawn from the Wishart ensemble. These methods are specifically designed for symmetric sectors, allowing us to determine the relative entropy for random states exhibiting $U(1)$ symmetry. This calculation serves as a measure of distinguishability within the symmetry sectors of random states. Our findings reveal that the symmetry-resolved relative entropy of random pure states displays universal statistical behavior. Furthermore, we derive the symmetry-resolved Page curve. These results deepen our understanding of the properties of these random states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently a one-dimensional Schwarzian type theory was proposed as an effective dual theory of pure gravity in (2+1) dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes \cite{Bhattacharjee:2023sfd}. This codimension-two `celestial' dual captures the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of bulk flat cosmologies in semiclassical limit. In this paper, we extend this analysis beyond semiclassical approximation and evaluate the one-loop exact partition function of this celestial dual theory. Our analysis results in novel nontrivial logarithmic corrections to the area term of entropy, appearing from the one-loop path integral.</description>

      <title>Exact large $N$ expansion of mass deformed ABJM theory on squashed sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the partition function of the mass deformed ABJM theory on a squashed three sphere. In particular, we focus on the case with the Chern-Simons levels being $\pm 1$ and apply a duality between this theory and the $\mathcal{N}=4$ $\mathrm{U}\left(N\right)$ super Yang-Mills theory with an adjoint hypermultiplet and a fundamental hypermultiplet. For a special mass parameter depending on the squashing parameter, we find that the partition function can be written as that of an ideal Fermi gas with a non-trivial density matrix. By studying this density matrix, we analytically derive the all order perturbative expansion of the partition function in $1/N$, which turns out to take the form of the Airy function. Our results not only align with previous findings and conjectures but also lead to a new formula for the overall constant factor of the partition function. We also study the exact values of the partition function for small but finite values of $N$.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in the Schr\"odinger Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Krylov complexity in the context of Schr\"odinger field theory in the grand canonic ensemble for the bosonic and fermionic cases. Specifically, we find that the Lanczos coefficients $\{a_{n}\}$ and $\{b_{n}\}$ satisfy the linear relations with respect to $n$. It is found that $\{b_n\}$ is independent of the chemical potentials while $\{a_n\}$ depends on the chemical potentials. The resulting Krylov complexities for both bosonic and fermionic cases behave similarly, which is due to the similar profiles of the square of the absolute values of the auto-correlation functions. In the late time, the Krylov complexity exhibits exponential growth with the asymptotic scaling significantly smaller than the twice of the slope of $\{b_n\}$, which is different from that in the relativistic field theory. We argue that this is because the Lanczos coefficients $\{a_n\}$ also contributes to the Krylov complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive soft theorems for on-shell scattering amplitudes from non-linearly realised global space-time symmetries, arising from the flat and decoupling limits of the effective field theories (EFTs) of inflation, while taking particular care of on-shell limits, soft limits, time-ordered correlations, momentum derivatives, energy-momentum conserving delta functions and $i\varepsilon$ prescriptions. Intriguingly, contrary to common belief, we find with a preferred soft hierarchy among the soft momentum $q$, on-shell residue $p_a^0 \pm E_a$, and $\varepsilon$, the soft theorems do not have dependence on off-shell interactions, even in the presence of cubic vertices. We also argue that the soft hierarchy is a natural choice, ensuring the soft limit and on-shell limit commute. Our soft theorems depend solely on on-shell data and hold to all orders in perturbation theory. We present various examples including polynomial shift symmetries, non-linear realisation of Lorentz boosts and dilatations on how the soft theorems work. We find that the collection of exchange diagrams, where the soft momentum is associated with a cubic vertex, exhibits an enhanced soft scaling. The enhanced soft scaling explains why the sum of such diagrams do not enter the soft theorems non-trivially. We further apply the soft theorems to bootstrap the scattering amplitudes of the superfluid and scaling superfluid EFTs, finding agreement with the Hamiltonian analysis.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part I. Limits on orientable Euclidean manifolds from circle searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02603v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Einstein field equations of general relativity constrain the local curvature at every point in spacetime, but say nothing about the global topology of the Universe. Cosmic microwave background anisotropies have proven to be the most powerful probe of non-trivial topology since, within $\Lambda$CDM, these anisotropies have well-characterized statistical properties, the signal is principally from a thin spherical shell centered on the observer (the last scattering surface), and space-based observations nearly cover the full sky. The most generic signature of cosmic topology in the microwave background is pairs of circles with matching temperature and polarization patterns. No such circle pairs have been seen above noise in the WMAP or Planck temperature data, implying that the shortest non-contractible loop around the Universe through our location is longer than 98.5% of the comoving diameter of the last scattering surface. We translate this generic constraint into limits on the parameters that characterize manifolds with each of the nine possible non-trivial orientable Euclidean topologies, and provide a code which computes these constraints. In all but the simplest cases, the shortest non-contractible loop in the space can avoid us, and be shorter than the diameter of the last scattering surface by a factor ranging from 2 to at least 6. This result implies that a broader range of manifolds is observationally allowed than widely appreciated. Probing these manifolds will require more subtle statistical signatures than matched circles, such as off-diagonal correlations of harmonic coefficients.</description>

Abstract: The authors studied in [Ann. Inst. Henri Poincar\'e D 9, 367-433, (2022)], a complex multi-matrix model with $\mathrm{U}(N)^2 \times \mathrm{O}(D)$ symmetry, and whose double scaling limit where simultaneously the large-$N$ and large-$D$ limits were taken while keeping the ratio $N/\sqrt{D}=M$ finite and fixed. In this double scaling limit, the complete recursive characterization of the Feynman graphs of arbitrary genus for the leading order grade $\ell=0$ was achieved. In this current study, we classify the higher order graphs in $\ell$. More specifically, $\ell=1$ and $\ell=2$ with arbitrary genus, in addition to a specific class of two-particle-irreducible (2PI) graphs for higher $\ell \geqslant 3$ but with genus zero. Furthermore, we demonstrate that each 2PI graph with a single $\mathrm{O}(D)$-loop with an arbitrary $\ell$ corresponds to a reduced alternating knot diagram with $\ell$ crossings as listed in the Rolfsen knot table, or a resulting alternating knot diagram obtained after performing the Tait flyping moves. We generalize to 2PR by considering the connected sum and the Reidemeister move I.</description>

Abstract: We conjecture a relation between the local dimension $d$ of a local nearest-neighbor critical Hamiltonian in one spatial dimension and the maximum central charge, $c_{\text{max}}$, that it can yield. Specifically, we propose that $c_{\text{max}} \leq d-1$, establishing a link between the short-distance lattice realization of a model and its emerging long-distance entanglement properties. This inequality can be viewed as a general form of a $c$-theorem establishing the reduction of effective degrees of freedom between the UV lattice and the IR conformal field theory. We support this conjecture with numerous examples.</description>

      <title>Power law coupling Higgs-Palatini inflation with a congruence between physical and geometrical symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a power law coupling Higgs inflationary model in which the background geometry is determined by the Palatini's variational principle. The geometrical symmetries of the background geometry determine the invariant form of the action of the model and the background geometry resulted is of the Weyl-integrable type. The invariant action results also invariant under the $U(1)$ group, which in general is not compatible with the Weyl group of invariance of the background geometry. However, we found compatibility conditions between the geometrical and physical symmetries of the action in the strong coupling limit. We found that if we start with a non-minimally coupled to gravity action, when we impose the congruence between the both groups of symmetries we end with an invariant action of the scalar-tensor type. We obtain a nearly scale invariant power spectrum for the inflaton fluctuations for certain values of some parameters of the model. Also we obtain va\-lues for the tensor to scalar ratio in agreement with PLANCK and BICEP observational data: $r&lt;0.032$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model at unphysical pion masses and high temperatures. II. The vacuum structure and thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory with cross-channel improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11313v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective potential of the $O(N)$ model at large $N$ limit is reinvestigated with varying pion mass and temperature. For large pion masses and high temperatures, we find the phenomenologically favored vacuum, located on the upper branch of the double-branched effective potential for physical $m_\pi$, moves to the lower branch and becomes no longer a local minimum but a saddle point. The existence and running of the tachyon pole are also discussed. These phenomena indicate that the applicable energy range of $O(N)$ model is more and more limited as $m_\pi$ becoming larger and temperature going higher. With the effective coupling constant defined from the effective potential, the possible correspondence between the two branches of the effective potential and the two phases of the theory (distinguished by positive or negative coupling) is verified even with nonzero explicit symmetry breaking and at finite temperature. Also, we generalize the $N/D$ modified $O(N)$ model to study the thermal trajectory of the $\sigma$ pole with the cross-channel contributions considered and find the thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory resembles its counterpart with varying pion mass at zero temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study spherically symmetric static solutions of the most general sixth-derivative gravity using series expansions. Specifically, we prove that the only solutions of the complete theory (i.e., with generic coupling constants) that possess a Frobenius expansion around the origin, $r=0$, are necessarily regular. When restricted to specific branches of theories (i.e., imposing particular constraints on the coupling constants), families of potentially singular solutions emerge. By expanding around $r=r_0 \neq 0$, we identify solutions with black hole horizons. Finally, we argue that, unlike in fourth-derivative gravity, the conditions $R=0$ and $g_{tt}g_{rr}=-1$ are too restrictive for sixth-derivative gravity solutions.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the quasinormal mode spectrum for Kerr black holes surrounded by an asymptotically uniform magnetic field, modeled with the Ernst-Wild geometry. A perturbative expansion in both the rotation parameter $a$ and the magnetic field $B$ allows the analysis of perturbations with Kerr-like asymptotics well inside the Melvin radius, and we obtain the spectrum for a variety of scalar quasinormal modes over a range of parameters using the continued fraction method. We then interpolate the low-lying mode spectrum to construct an Ernst-Wild template for the ringdown, and use the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA analysis tool pyRing to assess the impact of the magnetosphere on the extraction of ringdown signatures from several observed binary black hole mergers.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group-Improved Gravitational Action: A Lagrangian Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new approach to embedding the renormalization group running of Newton's constant and the cosmological constant in gravity is proposed. This approach is based on a gravitational Lagrangian that gives rise to a new class of modified gravity theories where $G$ and $\Lambda$ are spacetime-dependent functions. The Lagrangian formulation can be interpreted as an effective gravitational action that encapsulates the scale dependence of $G$, arising from quantum effects in the early universe. We show that the new formalism can be discussed in the framework of Horndeski modified gravity and apply to explore a non-singular cosmology featuring power-law inflation. In particular, we discuss the generation of scalar and tensor perturbations within this framework.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian observables for aligned-spin binaries to sixth order in spin from gravitational self-force and Compton amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of compact binaries is essential for gravitational-wave detection and parameter estimation, with spin being an important effect to include in waveform models. In this paper, we derive new post-Newtonian (PN) results for the conservative aligned-spin dynamics at next-to-next-to-leading order for the spin$^3$ and spin$^4$ contributions, in addition to the next-to-leading order (NLO) spin$^5$ and spin$^6$ contributions. One approach we follow is the Tutti Frutti method, which relates PN and gravitational self-force results through the redshift and spin-precession invariants, by making use of the simple dependence of the scattering angle on the symmetric mass ratio. However, an ambiguity arises at the NLO spin$^5$ contribution, due to transcendental functions of the Kerr spin in the redshift; this is also the order at which Compton amplitudes calculations are affected by spurious poles. Therefore, we follow an additional approach to determine the NLO spin$^5$ and spin$^6$ dynamics: using on-shell Compton amplitudes obtained from black hole perturbation theory. The Compton amplitude used in this work is composed of the unambiguous tree-level far-zone part reported in [Phys. Rev. D 109, 084071 (2024)], as well as the full, non-interfering with the far-zone, $\ell=2$ partial wave contributions from the near zone, which are responsible for capturing Kerr finite-size effects. Other results in this paper include deriving the scattering angle of a spinning test body in a Kerr background from a parametrized worldline action, and computing the redshift and spin-precession invariants for eccentric orbits without an eccentricity expansion.</description>

      <title>Finite time path field theory perturbative methods for local quantum spin chain quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss local magnetic field quenches using perturbative methods of finite time path field theory (FTPFT) in the following spin chains: Ising and XY in a transverse magnetic field. Their common characteristics are: (i) they are integrable via mapping to a second quantized noninteracting fermion problem; and (ii) when the ground state is nondegenerate (true for finite chains except in special cases), it can be represented as a vacuum of Bogoliubov fermions. By switching on a local magnetic field perturbation at finite time, the problem becomes nonintegrable and must be approached via numeric or perturbative methods. Using the formalism of FTPFT based on Wigner transforms (WTs) of projected functions, we show how to: (i) calculate the basic ``bubble'' diagram in the Loschmidt echo (LE) of a quenched chain to any order in the perturbation; and (ii) resum the generalized Schwinger--Dyson equation for the fermion two-point retarded functions in the ``bubble'' diagram, hence achieving the resummation of perturbative expansion of LE for a wide range of perturbation strengths under certain analyticity assumptions. Limitations of the assumptions and possible generalizations beyond it and also for other spin chains are further discussed.</description>

      <title>Generalized uncertainty principle corrections in Rastall-Rainbow Casimir wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore wormhole solutions sourced by Casimir energy density involving generalized uncertainty principle corrections within the framework of Rastall-Rainbow gravity. The questions of traversability and stability, as well as the presence of exotic matter, are carefully investigated. In particular, the stability issue is addressed via an approach that has not been previously employed in the context of wormholes. This method, which represents an improved version of the so-called Herrera cracking technique, has the potential to yield novel insights in the field of wormhole geometries.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we compute the overlaps of the ground states for the open spin chains after a change of one of the boundary magnetic fields. It can be considered as the first step toward the study of the boundary quench problem: behaviour of an open spin chain after an abrupt change of one boundary magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of high order correction for Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in non-commutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under the premise that quantum gravity becomes non-negligible, higher-order corrections of non-commutative geometry dominate. In this paper, we studied the thermodynamics of high-order corrections for Schwarzschild-AdS black hole with Lorentz distribution in the framework of non-commutative geometry. Our results indicate that when high-order corrections dominate, the thermodynamic behavior of Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in non-commutative geometry will gradually approach that of ordinary Schwarzschild-AdS black hole. In addition, we also studied the Joule-Thomson effect of Schwarzschild-AdS black hole under high-order corrections.</description>

      <title>Superconnections in AdS/QCD and the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider hard-wall AdS/QCD models extended by a string-theory inspired Chern-Simons action in terms of a superconnection involving a bi-fundamental scalar field which corresponds to the open-string tachyon of brane-antibrane configurations and which is naturally identified with the holographic dual of the quark condensate in chiral symmetry breaking. This realizes both the axial and chiral anomalies of QCD with a Witten-Veneziano mechanism for the $\eta'$ mass in addition to current quark masses, but somewhat differently than in the Katz-Schwartz AdS/QCD model used previously by us to evaluate pseudoscalar and axial vector transition form factors and their contribution to the HLBL piece of the muon $g-2$. Compared to the Katz-Schwartz model, we obtain a significantly more realistic description of axial-vector mesons with regard to $f_1$-$f_1'$ mixing and equivalent photon rates. Moreover, predictions of the $f_1\to e^+e^-$ branching ratios are found to be in line with a recent phenomenological study. However, pseudoscalar transition form factors compare less well with experiment; in particular the $\pi^0$ transition form factor turns out to be overestimated at moderate non-zero virtuality. For the combined HLBL contribution to the muon $g-2$ from the towers of axial vector mesons and excited pseudoscalars we obtain, however, a result very close to that of the Katz-Schwartz model.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravitational decoherence of a mechanical oscillator from spacetime fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the scenario of a fluctuating spacetime due to a deformed commutation relation with a fluctuating deformation parameter, or to a fluctuating metric tensor. By computing the resulting dynamics and averaging over these fluctuations, we find that a system experiences a decoherence in the momentum basis. We studied the predictions of the model for a free particle and an harmonic oscillator. Using experimental data taken from a mechanical oscillator prepared in quantum states of motion, we put a bound on the free parameters of the considered model. In addition, we comment on how these measurements can also provide bounds to other phenomenological quantum gravity models, such as the length scale for nonlocal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Is there any Trinity of Gravity, to start with?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, it has been rather fashionable to talk about geometric trinity of gravity. The main idea is that one can formally present the gravity equations in different terms, those of either torsion or nonmetricity instead of curvature. It starts from a very erroneous claim that the Levi-Civita connection, and therefore the (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry itself, are nothing but an arbitrary choice. The point is that, as long as we admit the need of having a metric for describing gravity, the standard approach does not involve any additional independent geometric structures on top of that. At the same time, any other metric-affine model does go for genuinely new stuff. In particular, the celebrated teleparallel framework introduces a notion of yet another parallel transport which is flat. It gives us curious new ways of modifying gravity, even though very often quite problematic. However, in GR-equivalent models, we only get a new language for describing the same physics, in terms of absolutely unobservable and unpredictable geometrical inventions. For sure, one can always safely create novel constructions which do not influence the physical equations of motion, but in itself it does not make much sense and blatantly goes against the Occam's razor.</description>

      <title>Towards a parameter-free determination of critical exponents and chiral phase transition temperature in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to quantify the universal properties of the chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD, we make use of an improved, renormalized order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking which is obtained as a suitable difference of the $2$-flavor light quark chiral condensate and its corresponding light quark susceptibility. Having no additive ultraviolet as well as multiplicative logarithmic divergences, we use ratios of this order parameter constructed from its values for two different light quark masses. We show that this facilitates determining in a parameter-independent manner, the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ and the associated critical exponent $\delta$ which, for sufficiently small values of the light quark masses, controls the quark mass dependence of the order parameter at $T_c$. We present first results of these calculations from our numerical analysis performed with staggered fermions on $N_\tau=8$ lattices.</description>
