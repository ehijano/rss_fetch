      <title>On the weak reducing pairs in critical Heegaard splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A weak reducing pair in a Heegaard splitting M = V \cup_S W is a pair of disjoint essential disks D \in V and E \in W. The weakly reducible Heegaard splitting contains at least one weak reducing pair. Critical Heegaard splitting is a special case of weakly reducible Heegaard splitting which contains at least two weak reducing pairs satisfying some special conditions. In this paper, we discuss the properties of weak reducing pairs in a critical Heegaard splitting and give a necessary condition for Heegaard surface to be critical.</description>

      <title>Contact surgery numbers of Sigma(2,3,11) and L(4m+3,4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify all contact structures with contact surgery number one on the Brieskorn sphere Sigma(2,3,11) with both orientations. We conclude that there exist infinitely many non-isotopic contact structures on each of the above manifolds which cannot be obtained by a single rational contact surgery from the standard tight contact 3-sphere. We further prove similar results for some lens spaces: We classify all contact structures with contact surgery number one on lens spaces of the form L(4m+3,4). Along the way, we present an algorithm and a formula for computing the Euler class of a contact structure from a general rational contact surgery description and classify which rational surgeries along Legendrian unknots are tight and which ones are overtwisted.</description>

      <title>Unbounded $\mathfrak{sl}_3$-laminations around punctures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue to study the unbounded $\mathfrak{sl}_3$-laminations [IK22], with a focus on their structures at punctures. A key ingredient is their relation to the root data of $\mathfrak{sl}_3$. After giving a classification of signed $\mathfrak{sl}_3$-webs around a puncture, we describe the tropicalization of the Goncharov--Shen's Weyl group action in detail. We also clarify the relationship with several other approaches by Shen--Sun--Weng [SSW23] and Fraser--Pylyavskyy [FP21]. Finally, we discuss a formulation of unbounded $\mathfrak{g}$-laminations for a general semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ in brief.</description>

      <title>Unbounded $\mathfrak{sl}_3$-laminations and their shear coordinates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing the work of Fock--Goncharov on rational unbounded laminations, we give a geometric model of the tropical points of the cluster variety $\mathcal{X}_{\mathfrak{sl}_3,\Sigma}$, which we call unbounded $\mathfrak{sl}_3$-laminations, based on the Kuperberg's $\mathfrak{sl}_3$-webs. We introduce their tropical cluster coordinates as an $\mathfrak{sl}_3$-analogue of the Thurston's shear coordinates associated with any ideal triangulation. As a tropical analogue of gluing morphisms among the moduli spaces $\mathcal{P}_{PGL_3,\Sigma}$ of Goncharov--Shen, we describe a geometric gluing procedure of unbounded $\mathfrak{sl}_3$-laminations with pinnings via ``shearings''. We also investigate a relation to the graphical basis of the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$-skein algebra [IY23], which conjecturally leads to a quantum duality map.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter Discrete Morse Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to extend Morse-Forman theory to vector-valued functions. This is mostly motivated by the need to develop new tools and methods to compute multiparameter persistence. To generalize the theory, in addition to adapting the main definitions and results of Forman to this vectorial setting, we use concepts of combinatorial topological dynamics studied in recent years. This approach proves to be successful in the following ways. First, we establish a result which is more general than that of Forman regarding the sublevel sets of a multidimensional discrete Morse function. Second, we find a way to induce a Morse decomposition in critical components from the critical points of such a function. Finally, we deduce a set of Morse equation and inequalities specific to the multiparameter setting.</description>

      <title>Two-tone colorings and surjective dihedral representations for links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that a knot is Fox $n$-colorable for a prime $n$ if and only if the knot group admits a surjective homomorphism to the dihedral group of degree $n$. However, this is not the case for links with two or more components. In this paper, we introduce a two-tone coloring on a link diagram, and give a condition for links so that the link groups admit surjective representations to the dihedral groups. In particular, it is shown that the link group of any link with at least 3 components admits a surjective homomorphism to the dihedral group of arbitrary degree.</description>

      <title>Invariants of flat connections on 4-manifolds from Hopf group-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given group $G$, we construct an invariant of flat $G$-connections on 4-manifolds from a finite type involutory quasitriangular Hopf $G$-algebra. Hopf $G$-algebras are generalizations of Hopf algebras, equipped with gradings by $G$. In our construction, we color the dotted components of a Kirby diagram with elements of $G$ and employ the Hennings-type procedure. When $G$ is finite, we also define an invariant of 4-manifolds by summing the invariants over all flat $G$-connections.</description>

      <title>Trisections of the doubles of some Mazur type 4-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that certain two kinds of trisection diagrams of the doubles of the Mazur type 4-manifolds introduced by Akbulut and Kirby are standard. One is constructed by doubling a certain relative trisection diagram of the Mazur type. The other is constructed by using an algorithm taking Kirby diagrams to trisection diagrams.</description>

      <title>On knot types of clean Lagrangian intersections in $T^*\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09912v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K_0$ and $K$ be knots in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Suppose that by a compactly supported Hamiltonian isotopy on $T^*\mathbb{R}^3$, the conormal bundle of $K_0$ is isotopic to a Lagrangian submanifold which intersects the zero section cleanly along $K$. In this paper, we prove some constraints on the pair of knot types of $K_0$ and $K$. One example is that if $K_0$ is the unknot, then $K$ is also the unknot. We also consider some cases where $K_0$ and $K$ have specific knot types, such as torus knots and connected sums of trefoil knots. The key step is finding a DGA map between the Chekanov-Eliashberg DGAs of the unit conormal bundles of knots. The main results are deduced from a relation between the augmentation varieties of $K_0$ and $K$ determined by these DGAs.</description>

      <title>A Kodaira type conjecture on almost complex 4 manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14690v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Not long ago, Cirici and Wilson defined a Dolbeault cohomology on almost complex manifolds to answer Hirzebruch's problem. In this paper, we define a refined Dolbeault cohomology on almost complex manifolds. We show that the condition $\tilde h^{1,0}=\tilde h^{0,1}$ implies a symplectic structure on a compact almost complex $4$ manifold, where $\tilde h^{1,0}$ and $\tilde h^{0,1}$ are the dimensions of the refined Dolbeault cohomology groups with bi-degrees $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ respectively. Combining the partial answer to Donaldson's tameness conjecture, we offer a sufficient condition for a compact almost complex $4$ manifold to become an almost K\"ahler one.
  Moreover, we prove that the condition $\tilde{h}^{1,0}=\tilde h^{0,1}$ is equivalent to the generalized $\partial\bar\partial$-lemma. This can be regarded as an analogue of the Kodaira's conjecture on almost complex $4$ manifolds. As an application, we show that the Kodaira-Thurston manifold satisfies the $\partial\bar\partial$-lemma. Meanwhile, we show that the Fr\"olicher-type equality does not hold on a general almost complex $4$ manifold, which is different to the case of compact complex surfaces.</description>
