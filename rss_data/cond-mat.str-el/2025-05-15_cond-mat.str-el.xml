      <title>Collective excitations and stability of a non-Fermi liquid state near a quantum-critical point of a metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the spectral properties of collective excitations with finite angular momentum $l$ for a system of interacting fermions near a Pomeranchuk quantum critical point, both in the Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid regimes. Previous studies found that deep in the Fermi liquid regime, the spectral functions for even and odd $l$ behave differently - the latter is suppressed compared to the former because of kinematic constraints on scattering processes. The main focus of our paper is to understand how the spectral functions for even and odd $l$ evolve as the system enters the non-Fermi liquid regime. We obtain the full scaling function for the electron polarization bubble at arbitrary $l$, which interpolates between the Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid regimes. We show that collective excitations for all $l$ remain stable and causal throughout the crossover and right at the quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model coupled with an optical cavity, which describes an interplay of the effect of vacuum fluctuation of light and the quantum phase transition between the charge- and spin-density-wave phases. The ground state and excitation spectrum of the model are calculated by numerically exact tensor-network methods. We find that the photon number of the ground state is enhanced (suppressed) along the quantum phase transition line when the light-matter coupling is comparable to (much smaller than) the cavity frequency. We also show that the exciton peak in the optical conductivity and photon spectrum that exists without the cavity exhibits the vacuum Rabi splitting at resonance due to the light-matter interaction. This behavior is in contrast to the case without excitons, where the photon spectrum is merely broadened without splitting due to the lack of a sharp resonance.</description>

      <title>Tunable Hilbert space fragmentation and extended critical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems exhibiting the Hilbert-space fragmentation are nonergodic, and their Hamiltonians decompose into exponentially many blocks in the computational basis. In many cases, these blocks can be labeled by eigenvalues of statistically localized integrals of motion (SLIOM), which play a similar role in fragmented systems as local integrals of motion in integrable systems. While a nonzero perturbation eliminates all nontrivial conserved quantities from integrable models, we demonstrate for the $t$-$J_z$ chain that an appropriately chosen perturbation may gradually eliminate SLIOMs (one by one) by progressively merging the fragmented subspaces. This gradual recovery of ergodicity manifests as an extended critical regime characterized by multiple peaks of the fidelity susceptibility. Each peak signals a change in the number of SLIOMs and blocks, as well as an ultra-slow relaxation of local observables.</description>

      <title>Field-induced electronic correlations and superconductivity in UTe$_2$ beyond 40~T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several superconducting phases have been discovered close to a metamagnetic transition in the heavy-fermion compound UTe$_2$, unveiling a close relation between its superconducting and magnetic properties. Although suspected to be of magnetic nature, the mechanisms stabilizing these superconducting phases remain mysterious. Here, we present electrical-resistivity measurements on UTe$_2$, with a current $\mathbf{I}\parallel\mathbf{a}$ and under pulsed magnetic fields up to 60~T rotating in the ($\mathbf{b}$,$\mathbf{c}$) plane. The Fermi-liquid coefficient $A$ of the electrical resistivity reaches its maximal values at the metamagnetic transition in fields tilted by $30-40~^\circ$ from $\mathbf{b}$ to $\mathbf{c}$, and it becomes asymmetric with higher values above the metamagnetic field than below. The enhancement of $A$ is interpreted as resulting from enhanced magnetic fluctuations, in a regime which coincides with a domain of stabilization of superconductivity beyond $40$~T. These results show that the magnetic fluctuations probed here probably play a key role in stabilizing high-field superconductivity in UTe$_2$ and may provide further insight into the superconducting mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Spin Nernst and thermal Hall effects of topological triplons in quantum dimer magnets on the maple-leaf and star lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the topological properties of triplon excitations in spin-1/2 dimer-singlet ground states defined on the maple leaf and star lattices. Our analysis is based on a model that includes Heisenberg interactions, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, and an external magnetic field. In the absence of an in-plane DM vector, we demonstrate that the triplon Hamiltonian maps onto the magnon Hamiltonian of the Kagome lattice, inheriting its nontrivial topological characteristics, including Berry curvature and topological invariants such as the Z2 invariant and Chern numbers. This correspondence enables us to derive analytical expressions for the spin Nernst and thermal Hall conductivities at low temperatures. Furthermore, we explore the effects of realistic finite in-plane DM interactions, uncovering multiple topological transitions and a complex thermal Hall conductivity behavior, including potential sign reversals as functions of magnetic field and temperature. Using layer groups, we also provide a symmetry classification of the star and maple leaf lattices.</description>

      <title>Exchange-driven giant magnetoelastic coupling in Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of electronic and structural degrees of freedom is at the heart of some of the most astonishing phenomena found in condensed matter physics, for example, the condensation of electron pairs into a macroscopically coherent ground state in superconductors. In magnetic materials, magnetic interactions couple to lattice degrees of freedom resulting in magnetoelastic coupling - an effect that is typically small and only detectable on macroscopic samples. Here, we demonstrate giant magnetoelastic coupling in the correlated itinerant ferromagnet Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$. We establish control of the magnetism in the surface layer and use this control to probe the impact of the magnetism on its electronic and structural properties. By using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we reveal subtle changes in the electronic structure dependent on ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic alignment between the surface and subsurface layers. We determine the consequences of the exchange force on the relaxation of the surface layer, exhibiting a giant magnetostriction. Our results provide a direct measurement of the impact of exchange interactions and correlations on structural details in a quantum material, reveal how electronic correlations result in strong electron-lattice coupling and establish Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$ as a system to study magnetism in 2D.</description>

      <title>Emerging axion detection in artificial magnetoelectric materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of dark matter is a fundamental problem in physics. Axions are considered a key component of dark matter, characterized by very weak Chern-Simons couplings to electromagnetism, gravity, and fermions. We propose a novel symmetry-breaking detection mechanism in magnetoelectric materials, allowing for a linear axionic coupling between magnetism and ferroelectric polarization. We focus on strain gradient Sr2IrO4, where the breaking of space-inversion symmetry results in an emergent polar phase and out-of-plane magnetic moment, exhibiting a flexomagnetoelectric effect. In this material, the linear P||M enables direct coupling between the external axion field and the intrinsic axion-like field within the material. This mechanism amplifies the weak electromagnetic signals induced by axions, paving the way for pioneering axion detection. These signals can be detected by monitoring changes in macroscopic physical quantities, such as the magnetoelectric and magnetic responses. In contrast to conventional detection techniques, this mechanism significantly enhances the sensitivity of the axion-electron and axion-photon coupling, providing a novel platform for axion detection and advancing the study of dark matter through the magnetoelectric effect.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern insulator states in an isolated flat band of zero Chern number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A flat band with zero Chern number, and well isolated from the rest of Hilbert space by a gap much larger than interaction strength, is a context that has not been regarded as relevant for fractional quantum Hall physics. In this work, we present a numerical study to demonstrate the emergence of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in such isolated flat band with zero Chern number, which is hosted by a fluxed dice lattice with anisotropic hopping strength. While being topologically trivial, this flat band features an intriguing quantum geometry: the difference between the trace of quantum metric tensor and the Berry curvature is a constant. We consider nearest-neighbor repulsion that is weak enough to ensure that the isolated band limit is always satisfied, where band renormalization by interaction leaves the flat band quantum geometry unchanged and introduce a tiny band width only. At $2/3$ filling of the isolated flat band, our exact diagonalization calculations show unambiguous evidences for the FCI states, both from the many-body spectra and the many-body Chern number that demonstrates a fractionally quantized Hall conductance of $e^2/3h$. And the 3-fold ground state degeneracy on torus suggests that band-folding Hall crystal scenario is not compatible with the observed $1/3$ quantized Hall conductance at $2/3$ filling. We find the finite dispersion acquired from interaction renormalization, albeit tiny in the isolated band limit, is necessary for FCI to emerge. With anisotropy getting stronger towards the disconnected-chains limit, the FCI undergoes a topological phase transition to inter-chain charge density wave.</description>

      <title>Extended Dynamical Kubo-Toyabe Relaxation for $\mu$SR study of Ion Dynamics: An Introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the analysis of the ion diffusion in metal oxides based on muon spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR), the dynamical Kubo-Toyabe (dKT) function has been routinely used to deduce the jump frequency of ions. This is based on the two beliefs: (1) the fluctuations of the internal magnetic field ${\bm H}(t)$ are determined solely by the relative motion of the muons to the surrounding ions, and (2) the muons are immobile due to bonding to the oxygen. However, these are not necessarily trivial, and we addressed their credibility by developing an extended dKT function corresponding to the realistic situation that only a part of the ions surrounding muon are involved in a single fluctuation of ${\bm H}(t)$ in the ion diffusion, and investigated its behavior in detail. The results show that the new function exhibits qualitatively different behavior from the dKT function, and that it provides a way to determine whether muons or ions are in motion, as well as a means for quantitative analysis based on the assumption of immobile muons. As a typical example, we examine the earlier $\mu^\pm$SR results on Na$_x$CoO$_2$ and demonstrate that the internal field fluctuations observed in $\mu^+$SR are dominated by muon self-diffusion, in contrast to previous interpretations.</description>

      <title>Functional approach to superfluid stiffness: Role of quantum geometry in unconventional superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-trivial quantum geometry of electronic bands has been argued to facilitate superconductivity even for the case of flat dispersions where the conventional contribution to the superfluid weight is suppressed by the large effective mass. However, most previous work focused on the case of conventional superconductivity while many contemporary superconducting quantum materials are expected to host unconventional pairing. Here, we derive a generalized expression for the superfluid weight employing mean-field BCS theory for systems with time-reversal symmetry in the normal state and arbitrary unconventional superconducting order with zero-momentum intraband pairing. Our derivation reveals the necessity of incorporating functional derivatives of the grand potential with respect to the superconducting gap function. Through perturbative analysis in the isolated narrow-bands limit, we demonstrate that this contribution arises from quantum geometrical effects, specifically due to a non-trivial Wilczek-Zee connection. Utilizing the newly obtained expressions for the superfluid weight, we apply our framework to an extended Kane-Mele model, contrasting conventional $s$-wave superconductivity with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Spin phase detection by spin current in a chiral helimagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Helimagnets, characterized by a helical arrangement of magnetic moments, possess unique internal degrees of freedom, including the spin phase, defined by the phase of the helical magnetic structure. Electrical detection of the spin phase is essential for both practical applications and fundamental research in helimagnets. Here, we demonstrate the electrical detection of the spin phase in a van der Waals nanoscale chiral helimagnet CrNb$_3$S$_6$ using nonlocal spin valve measurements. Due to the short spin diffusion length in CrNb$_3$S$_6$ ($\sim5$~nm), the surface magnetic moment direction, which corresponds to the spin phase, can be detected via spin currents. The experimentally observed magnetic field dependence of the nonlocal spin valve signal is consistent with that of the surface magnetic moment in the helical magnetic structure, as supported by micromagnetic simulations. Our results establish spin currents as a powerful tool for detecting the spin phase in helimagnets, opening avenues for utilizing the spin phase as a novel internal degree of freedom in nanoscale spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Origin of local magnetic exchange interaction in infiite-layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant magnetic exchange interactions have been observed in infinite-layer nickelates RNiO2 (R = La, Pr, Nd), which exhibit unconventional superconductivity upon hole doping. Despite their structural and Fermi surface similarities to cuprates, infinite-layer nickelates possess a larger charge transfer gap, which influences their magnetic exchange interactions via oxygen. In this work, we performed 17O nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on LaNiO2 and Sr-doped LaNiO2, revealing glassy spin dynamics originating from Ni-O planes. This indicates that infinite-layer nickelates are in proximity to magnetic ordering and that magnetic correlations play a crucial role in their physics. More importantly, our analysis of the Knight shift and hyperfine coupling of 17O nuclei revealed that the Ni-Ni superexchange interaction, mediated by the {\sigma} bond between the Ni-dx2-y2 and O-p orbitals, is one order of magnitude weaker than that in cuprates. This alone cannot account for the total magnetic exchange interaction observed in nickelates. First-principles many-body calculations indicate that an interstitial s orbital near the Fermi level, coupled with the Ni-d3z2-r2 orbital, significantly enhances the superexchange interaction. This contrasts with cuprates, where magnetic interactions are predominantly governed by Cu-dx2-y2 superexchange via oxygen. Our findings provide new insights into the distinct magnetic interactions in infinite-layer nickelates and their potential role in unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental evidence of 3D superinsulation in a nanopatterned slab of NbTiN, given by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) scaling of the conductance when approaching the critical temperature from above and by the vanishing of the conductance below the transition. In the electric Meissner state, we find polar nematic order arising from ferroelectric alignement of short electric strings excited by external electromagnetic fields. Our results prove that superinsulation appears also in ordered structures provided that these are large enough, thereby confirming the origin of superinsulation as electric confinement, independent of disorder.</description>

Abstract: We study the one-dimensional spin-1/2 Kitaev-Gamma model with a bond-dependent Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, which can be induced by an electric field applied in the third direction where the first and second directions refer to the two bond directions in the model. By a combination of field theory and symmetry analysis, an extended gapless phase with an emergent SU(2)$_1$ conformal symmetry is found in the phase diagram of the spin-1/2 Kitaev-Gamma-DM chain. The analytic predictions are in good agreements with numerical results obtained from density matrix renormalization group simulations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore magnet Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_{7}$ in applied magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently discovered dipole-octupole pyrochlore magnet Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ is a promising three-dimensional quantum spin liquid candidate which shows no signs of ordering at low temperature. The low energy effective pseudospin-1/2 description in a magnetic field is characterized by the XYZ Hamiltonian and a Zeeman term where the dipolar local $z$-component of the pseudospin couples to the local $z$-component of the applied magnetic field, while the local $x$- and $y$-components of the pseudospin remain decoupled as a consequence of their octupolar character. Using effective Hamiltonian parameters determined in V. Poree et al., arXiv:2305.08261 (2023), remarkable experimental features can be reproduced, as for instance the specific heat and magnetization data as well as the continuum of states seen in neutron scattering. Here we investigate the thermodynamic response to magnetic fields applied along the global [110] direction using specific heat measurements and fits using numerical methods, and solve the corresponding magnetic structure using neutron diffraction. Specific heat data in moderate fields are reproduced well, however, at high fields the agreement is not satisfactory. We especially observe a two-step release of entropy, a finding that demands a review of both theory and experiment. We address it within the framework of three possible scenarios, including an analysis of the crystal field Hamiltonian not restricted to the two-dimensional single-ion doublet subspace. We conclusively rule out two of these scenarios and find qualitative agreement with a simple model of field misalignment with respect to the crystalline direction. We discuss the implications of our findings for [111] applied fields and for future experiments on Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ and its sister compounds.</description>

      <title>Parafermionic representation of Potts-based cluster chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cluster chain with $\mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order is decomposed into two distinct bilinear parafermionic chains, each possessing intrinsic topological order. These chains are formed by standard parafermions and time-reversal parafermions, respectively. Each subsystem retains its own $\mathbb{Z}_p$ symmetry component, which characterizes the total parity of constituent particles. Their topological orders are inherited from the two SPT orders of the cluster model. The transformations of particles under reflection, translation, and time reversal are derived. In the open chain, four zero-energy parafermionic edge modes are identified, and their structure is analyzed. For the closed system, the boundaries are twisted by the total parafermion parity. It is shown that the open chain is reflection-invariant when the number of spins is even, and $\mathcal{PT}$-invariant when the number of spins is odd. Meanwhile, the closed model exhibits a symmetry characterized by an antiunitary analog of the dihedral group.</description>

      <title>Stacking disorder in novel ABAC-stacked brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, weak interactions or slight changes to the structure can tip the delicate balance of exchange interactions, sending the system into a different ground state. Brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$, has a copper sublattice composed of distorted triangles, making it a likely host for frustrated magnetism, but exhibits stacking disorder. The lack of synthetic single crystals has limited research on the magnetism in brochantite to powders and natural mineral crystals. We grew crystals which we find to be a new polytype with a tendency toward ABAC stacking and some anion disorder, alongside the expected stacking disorder. Comparison to previous results on natural mineral specimens suggests that cation disorder is more deleterious to the magnetism than anion and stacking disorder. Our specific heat data suggest a double transition on cooling into the magnetically ordered state.</description>

      <title>Platforms for the realization and characterization of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) has been established as a fundamental theory for the understanding of one-dimensional quantum systems. Originally formulated as a replacement for Landau's Fermi-liquid theory, which accurately predicts the behaviour of most 3D metals but fails dramatically in 1D, the TLL description applies to a even broader class of 1D systems,including bosons and anyons. After a certain number of theoretical breakthroughs, its descriptive power has now been confirmed experimentally in different experimental platforms. They extend from organic conductors, carbon nanotubes, quantum wires, topological edge states of quantum spin Hall insulators to cold atoms, Josephson junctions, Bose liquids confined within 1D nanocapillaries and spin chains. In the ground state of such systems, quantum fluctuations become correlated on all length scales, but, counter-intuitively, no long-range order exists. In this respect, this review will illustrate the validity of conformal field theory for describing real-world systems, establishing the boundaries for its application and, on the other side will discuss the spectacular demonstration of how the quantum-critical TLL state governs the properties of many-body systems in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Symmetry constrained field theories for chiral spin liquid to spin crystal transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the spin rotationally invariant Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid (CSL) in systems with broken time-reversal symmetry and explore symmetry constraints on possible conventional spin crystal states accessible via a direct transition. These constraints provide a framework to identify topological invariants of the magnetically ordered state. We show that the existence of a direct transition from a CSL requires a precise compatibility condition between the topological invariants of the ordered state and the anomaly of the CSL. The lattice symmetries also constrain the functional form of the low-energy theory to describe these transitions. This allows us to construct explicit Chern-Simons-matter field theories for the transition into a class of noncoplanar orders identified as candidates directly accessible from the CSL, including the octahedral spin crystal on the kagom\'e lattice, and the tetrahedral order on the triangular and honeycomb lattice. These transitions can either be described using coupled fractionalized $ \mathbb{CP}^1 $ theories or fractionalized matrix principal chiral models. We also discuss extensions to more general magnetic ordering transitions out of the CSL.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Two-Dimensional $\mathrm{U(1)}$ Gauge Theory in Rydberg and Rydberg-Dressed Atom Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating $\mathrm{U(1)}$ quantum gauge theories with spatial dimension greater than one is of great physical significance yet has not been achieved experimentally. Here we propose a simple realization of $\mathrm{U(1)}$ gauge theory on triangular lattice Rydberg atom arrays. Within experimentally accessible range, we find that the effective model well simulates various aspects of the $\mathrm{U(1)}$ gauge theory, such as emergence of topological sectors, incommensurability, and the deconfined Rokhsar-Kivelson point. Our proposal is easy to implement experimentally and exhibits pronounced quantum dynamics compared with previous proposals realizing $\mathrm{U(1)}$ and $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theories.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for extracting entanglement entropy in interacting fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy probing novel phases and phase transitions numerically via quantum Monte Carlo has made great achievements in large-scale interacting spin/boson systems. In contrast, the numerical exploration in interacting fermion systems is rare, even though fermion systems attract more attentions in condensed matter. The fundamental restrictions is that the computational cost of fermion quantum Monte Carlo ($\sim \beta N^3$) is much higher than that of spin/boson ($\sim \beta N$). Here, $N$ is the total number of sites and $\beta$ is the inverse temperature or projection length. To tackle this problem, we propose a fermionic quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the incremental technique along physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency of extracting entanglement entropy. We benchmark the developed algorithm by calculating the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional square lattice Hubbard model. The obtained phase diagram including Fermi surface and Goldstone modes validates the correctness of the algorithm. Remarkably, our method shows the high-efficiency with respect to the existing algorithms, while keeping the high computation precision. We proceed to apply this algorithm to explore the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy and particularly its derivative at Gross-Neveu criticality. Our results elucidate that such critical behavior can be quantified by the correlation length exponent.</description>

      <title>Efficient Detection of Strong-To-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking via the R\'enyi-1 Correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) has recently emerged as a universal feature of quantum mixed-state phases of matter. While various information-theoretic diagnostics have been proposed to define and characterize SWSSB phases, relating these diagnostics to observables which can be efficiently and scalably probed on modern quantum devices remains challenging. Here we propose a new observable for SWSSB in mixed states, called the R\'enyi-1 correlator, which naturally suggests a route toward scalably detecting certain SWSSB phases in experiment. Specifically, if the canonical purification (CP) of a given mixed state can be reliably prepared, then SWSSB in the mixed state can be detected via ordinary two-point correlation functions in the CP state. We discuss several simple examples of CP states which can be efficiently prepared on quantum devices, and whose reduced density matrices exhibit SWSSB. The R\'enyi-1 correlator also satisfies several useful theoretical properties: it naturally inherits a stability theorem recently proven for the closely related fidelity correlator, and it directly defines SWSSB as a particular pattern of ordinary spontaneous symmetry breaking in the CP state.</description>

      <title>Explicit Pfaffian Formula for Amplitudes of Fermionic Gaussian Pure States in Arbitrary Pauli Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The explicit computation of amplitudes for fermionic Gaussian pure states in arbitrary Pauli bases is a long-standing challenge in quantum many-body physics, with significant implications for quantum tomography, experimental studies, and quantum dynamics. These calculations are essential for analyzing complex properties beyond traditional measures, such as formation probabilities, global entanglement, and entropy in non-standard bases, where exact and computationally efficient methods remain underdeveloped. In addition to these physical applications, having explicit formulas is crucial for optimizing negative log-likelihood functions in quantum tomography, a key task in the NISQ era. In this work, we present an explicit Pfaffian formula (Theorem 1) for determining these amplitudes in arbitrary Pauli bases, utilizing a matrix whose structure reflects the qubit parity. Additionally, we introduce a recursive relation (Theorem 2) that connects amplitudes for systems with varying qubit numbers, enabling scalable computations for large systems. Together, these results provide a versatile framework for studying global entanglement, Shannon-R\'enyi entropies, formation probabilities, and performing efficient quantum tomography, thereby significantly expanding the computational toolkit for analyzing complex quantum systems. Finally, we utilize our formalism to determine the post-measurement entanglement entropy, reflecting how local measurements alter entanglement, and compare the outcomes with conformal field theory predictions.</description>

Abstract: Quantum complexity quantifies the difficulty of preparing a state or implementing a unitary transformation with limited resources. Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter physics and quantum gravity. We seek to bridge the approaches of these fields, which define and study complexity using different frameworks and tools. We describe several definitions of complexity, along with their key properties. In quantum information theory, we focus on complexity growth in random quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), we discuss a geometric definition of complexity in terms of geodesics on the unitary group. In dynamical systems, we explore a definition of complexity in terms of state or operator spreading, as well as concepts from tensor-networks. We also outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models, and QFTs including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we explain the proposed relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the holographic anti-de Sitter (AdS)/CFT correspondence.</description>
