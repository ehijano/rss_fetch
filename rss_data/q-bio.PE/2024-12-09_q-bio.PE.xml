      <title>Metrics for classes of semi-binary phylogenetic networks using $\mu$-representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are useful in representing the evolutionary history of taxa. In certain scenarios, one requires a way to compare different networks. In practice, this can be rather difficult, except within specific classes of networks. In this paper, we derive metrics for the class of \emph{orchard networks} and the class of \emph{strongly reticulation-visible} networks, from variants of so-called \emph{$\mu$-representations}, which are vector representations of networks. For both network classes, we impose degree constraints on the vertices, by considering \emph{semi-binary} networks.</description>

      <title>Cross-feeding Creates Tipping Points in Microbiome Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key unresolved question in microbial ecology is how the extraordinary diversity of microbiomes emerges from the behaviour of individual populations. This process is driven by the cross-feeding networks that structure these communities, but are hard to untangle due to their inherent complexity. We address this problem using the tools of network science to develop a model of microbial community structure. We discover tipping points at which diversity abruptly declines due to the catastrophic collapse of cross-feeding networks. Our results are a rare example of an ecological tipping point in diversity and provide insight into the fundamental processes shaping microbiota and their robustness. We illustrate this by showing how the unculturability of microbial diversity emerges as an inherent property of their microbial cross-feeding networks.</description>

      <title>Mutation mitigates finite-size effects in spatial evolutionary games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based simulations are essential for studying cooperation on spatial networks. However, finite-size effects -- random fluctuations due to limited network sizes -- can cause certain strategies to unexpectedly dominate or disappear, leading to unreliable outcomes. While enlarging network sizes or carefully preparing initial states can reduce these effects, both approaches require significant computational resources. In this study, we demonstrate that incorporating mutation into simulations on limited networks offers an effective and resource-efficient alternative. Using spatial optional public goods games and a more intricate tolerance-based variant, we find that rare mutations preserve inherently stable equilibria. When equilibria are affected by finite-size effects, introducing moderate mutation rates prevent finite-size-induced strategy dominance or extinction, producing results consistent with large-network simulations. Our findings position mutation as a practical tool for improving the reliability of agent-based models and emphasize the importance of mutation sensitivity analysis in managing finite-size effects across spatial networks.</description>

      <title>Chromosomal rearrangements and transposable elements in locally adapted island Drosophila</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.09801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chromosomal rearrangements, particularly those mediated by transposable elements (TEs), can drive adaptive evolution by creating chimeric genes, inducing de novo gene formation, or altering gene expression. Here, we investigate rearrangements evolutionary role during habitat shifts in two locally adapted populations, Drosphila santomea and Drosphila yakuba, who have inhabited the island S\~ao Tom\'e for 500,000 and 10,000 years respectively. Using the D. yakuba- D. santomea species complex, we identified 16,480 rearrangements in the two island populations and the ancestral mainland African population of D. yakuba. We find a disproportionate association with TEs, with 83.5% of rearrangements linked to TE insertions or TE-facilitated ectopic recombination. Using significance thresholds based on neutral expectations, we identify 383 and 468 significantly differentiated rearrangements in island D. yakuba and D. santomea, respectively, relative to the mainland population. Of these, 99 and 145 rearrangements also showed significant differential gene expression, highlighting the potential for adaptive solutions from rearrangements and TEs. Within and between island populations, we find significantly different proportions of rearrangements originating from new mutations versus standing variation depending on TE association, potentially suggesting adaptive genetic mechanisms differ based on the timing of habitat shifts. Functional analyses of rearrangements most likely driving local adaptation revealed enrichment for stress response pathways, including UV tolerance and DNA repair, in high-altitude D. santomea. These findings suggest that chromosomal rearrangements may act as a source of genetic innovation, and provides insight into evolutionary processes that SNP-based analyses might overlook.</description>

      <title>A Coupled Two-Tier Mathematical Transmission Model to Explore Virulence Evolution in Vector-Borne Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12148v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence or adaptation of pathogens may lead to epidemics, highlighting the need for a thorough understanding of pathogen evolution. The tradeoff hypothesis suggests that virulence evolves to reach an optimal transmission intensity relative to the mortality caused by the disease. This study introduces a mathematical model that incorporates key factors such as recovery times and mortality rates, focusing on the diminishing effects of parasite growth on transmission, with a focus on vector-borne diseases. The analysis reveals conditions under which heightened virulence occurs in hosts, indicating that these factors can support vector-host transmission of a pathogen, even if the host-only component is insufficient for sustainable transmission. This insight helps explain the significant presence of pathogens with high fatality rates, such as those in vector-borne diseases. The findings underscore an elevated risk for future outbreaks involving such diseases. Enhanced surveillance of mortality rates and techniques to monitor pathogen evolution are vital to effectively control future epidemics. This study provides essential insights for epidemic preparedness and highlights the need for ongoing research into pathogen evolution.</description>

      <title>Bridging Wright-Fisher and Moran models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wright-Fisher model and the Moran model are both widely used in population genetics. They describe the time evolution of the frequency of an allele in a well-mixed population with fixed size. We propose a simple and tractable model which bridges the Wright-Fisher and the Moran descriptions. We assume that a fixed fraction of the population is updated at each discrete time step. In this model, we determine the fixation probability of a mutant and its average fixation and extinction times, under the diffusion approximation. We further study the associated coalescent process, which converges to Kingman's coalescent, and we calculate effective population sizes. We generalize our model, first by taking into account fluctuating updated fractions or individual lifetimes, and then by incorporating selection on the lifetime as well as on the reproductive fitness.</description>

      <title>Transformations to simplify phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolutionary relationships between species are typically represented in the biological literature by rooted phylogenetic trees. However, a tree fails to capture ancestral reticulate processes, such as the formation of hybrid species or lateral gene transfer events between lineages, and so the history of life is more accurately described by a rooted phylogenetic network. Nevertheless, phylogenetic networks may be complex and difficult to interpret, so biologists sometimes prefer a tree that summarises the central tree-like trend of evolution. In this paper, we formally investigate methods for transforming an arbitrary phylogenetic network into a tree (on the same set of leaves) and ask which ones (if any) satisfy a simple consistency condition. This consistency condition states that if we add additional species into a phylogenetic network (without otherwise changing this original network) then transforming this enlarged network into a rooted phylogenetic tree induces the same tree on the original set of species as transforming the original network. We show that the LSA (lowest stable ancestor) tree method satisfies this consistency property, whereas several other commonly used methods (and a new one we introduce) do not. We also briefly consider transformations that convert arbitrary phylogenetic networks to another simpler class, namely normal networks.</description>
