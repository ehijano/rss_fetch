      <title>Make the most of what you have: Resource-efficient randomized algorithms for matrix computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, randomized algorithms have established themselves as fundamental tools in computational linear algebra, with applications in scientific computing, machine learning, and quantum information science. Many randomized matrix algorithms proceed by first collecting information about a matrix and then processing that data to perform some computational task. This thesis addresses the following question: How can one design algorithms that use this information as efficiently as possible, reliably achieving the greatest possible speed and accuracy for a limited data budget?
  The first part of this thesis focuses on low-rank approximation for positive-semidefinite matrices. Here, the goal is to compute an accurate approximation to a matrix after accessing as few entries of the matrix as possible. This part of the thesis explores the randomly pivoted Cholesky (RPCholesky) algorithm for this task, which achieves a level of speed and reliability greater than other methods for the same problem.
  The second part of this thesis considers the task of estimating attributes of an implicit matrix accessible only by matrix-vector products. This thesis describes the leave-one-out approach to developing matrix attribute estimation algorithms and develops optimized trace, diagonal, and row-norm estimation algorithms.
  The third part of this thesis considers randomized algorithms for overdetermined linear least squares problems. Randomized algorithms for linear-least squares problems are asymptotically faster than any known deterministic algorithm, but recent work has raised questions about the accuracy of these methods in floating point arithmetic. This thesis shows these issues are resolvable by developing fast randomized least-squares problem achieving backward stability, the gold-standard stability guarantee for a numerical algorithm.</description>

      <title>Time-Frequency Analysis for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a quantitative approximation theory for shallow neural networks using tools from time-frequency analysis. Working in weighted modulation spaces $M^{p,q}_m(\mathbf{R}^{d})$, we prove dimension-independent approximation rates in Sobolev norms $W^{n,r}(\Omega)$ for networks whose units combine standard activations with localized time-frequency windows. Our main result shows that for $f \in M^{p,q}_m(\mathbf{R}^{d})$ one can achieve \[ \|f - f_N\|_{W^{n,r}(\Omega)} \lesssim N^{-1/2}\,\|f\|_{M^{p,q}_m(\mathbf{R}^{d})}, \] on bounded domains, with explicit control of all constants. We further obtain global approximation theorems on $\mathbf{R}^{d}$ using weighted modulation dictionaries, and derive consequences for Feichtinger's algebra, Fourier-Lebesgue spaces, and Barron spaces. Numerical experiments in one and two dimensions confirm that modulation-based networks achieve substantially better Sobolev approximation than standard ReLU networks, consistent with the theoretical estimates.</description>

      <title>A divergence-free parametric finite element method for 3D Stokes equations on curved domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stokes equations play an important role in the incompressible flow simulation. In this paper, a novel divergence-free parametric mixed finite element method is proposed for solving three-dimensional Stokes equations on domains with piecewise smooth boundaries. The flow velocity and pressure are discretized with high-order parametric Brezzi-Douglas-Marini elements and volume elements, respectively, on curved tetrahedral meshes. Utilizing the interior-penalty discontinuous Galerkin (IPDG) technique, we prove the inf-sup condition for the mixed finite element pair, and high-order optimal error estimates in the energy norm, with the help of the extension and transformation of the true solution to computational domain. Moreover, the discrete velocity is exactly divergence-free, meaning that div uh = 0 holds in the curved computational domain. Numerical experiments are conducted to support the theoretical analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical framework for reconstructing the potential in two dimensional semilinear elliptic PDEs with power type nonlinearities from the nonlinear Dirichlet to Neumann map. By applying higher order linearization method, we compute the Fourier data of the unknown potential and then invert it to recover $q$.

      <title>A Locally Divergence-Free Local Characteristic Decomposition Based Path-Conservative Central-Upwind Scheme for Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a locally divergence-free local characteristic decomposition based path-conservative central-upwind (LCD-PCCU) scheme for ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The proposed method is a low-dissipation extension of the recently proposed locally divergence-free PCCU scheme. To reduce the numerical dissipation, we incorporate the LCD into the PCCU framework. The resulting LCD-PCCU method enhances the resolution of numerical solutions as demonstrated through a series of benchmark tests.</description>

      <title>Conserving mass, momentum, and energy for the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony, Korteweg-de Vries, and nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study a class of arbitrarily high order numerical discretizations that preserve multiple invariants and are essentially explicit (they do not require the solution of any large systems of algebraic equations). In space, we use Fourier Galerkin methods, while in time we use a combination of orthogonal projection and relaxation. We prove and numerically demonstrate the conservation properties of the method by applying it to the Benjamin-Bona-Mahoney, Korteweg-de Vries, and nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) PDEs as well as a hyperbolic approximation of NLS. For each of these equations, the proposed schemes conserve mass, momentum, and energy up to numerical precision. We show that this conservation leads to reduced growth of numerical errors for long-term simulations.</description>

      <title>New Fully Discrete Active Flux Methods with Truly Multi-Dimensional Evolution Operators and WENO Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new fully discrete third-order accurate Active Flux and WENO methods based on truly multidimensional evolution operators for the two-dimensional acoustic equations. Building on the method of bicharacteristics, several approximate evolution operators are derived that yield an improved stability of the resulting schemes. A linear stability analysis is applied to determine the maximal CFL number. The schemes are tested extensively on both continuous and discontinuous problems, confirming their robustness and accurate approximation even on coarse grids.</description>

      <title>An Euler scheme for BSDEs via the Wiener chaos decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euler scheme is a standard time discretization for BSDEs, but its implementation hinges on approximating conditional expectations and the associated martingale terms at each time step. We propose an implementation based on the Wiener chaos decomposition to approximate these quantities. In contrast to many numerical schemes that rely on a forward-backward (Markovian) structure, our approach accommodates arbitrary $\mathcal{F}_T$-measurable square-integrable terminal conditions. We provide a comprehensive convergence analysis and illustrate the method on several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A non-negativity-preserving cut-cell discontinuous Galerkin method for the diffusive wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-negativity-preserving cut-cell discontinuous Galerkin method for the degenerate parabolic diffusive wave approximation of the shallow water equation is presented. The method can handle continuous and discontinuous bathymmetry as well as general triangular meshes. It is complemented by a finite volume method on Delauney triangulations which is also shown to be non-negativity preserving. Both methods feature an upwind flux and can handle Manning's and Chezy's friction law. By numerical experiment we demonstrate the discontinuous Galerkin method to be fully second-order accurate for the Barenblatt analytical solution on an inclined plane. In constrast, the finite volume method is only first-order accurate. Further numerical experiments show that three to four mesh refinements are needed for the finite volume method to match the solution of the discontinuous Galerkin method.</description>

      <title>Landscape Analysis of Excited States Calculation over Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most promising algorithms for low-lying eigenstates calculation on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. Specifically, VQE has achieved great success for ground state calculations of a Hamiltonian. However, excited state calculations arising in quantum chemistry and condensed matter often requires solving more challenging problems than the ground state as these states are generally further away from a mean-field description, and involve less straightforward optimization to avoid the variational collapse to the ground state. Maintaining orthogonality between low-lying eigenstates is a key algorithmic hurdle. In this work, we analyze three VQE models that embed orthogonality constraints through specially designed cost functions, avoiding the need for external enforcement of orthogonality between states. Notably, these formulations possess the desirable property that any local minimum is also a global minimum, helping address optimization difficulties. We conduct rigorous landscape analyses of the models' stationary points and local minimizers, theoretically guaranteeing their favorable properties and providing analytical tools applicable to broader VQE methods. A comprehensive comparison between the three models is also provided, considering their quantum resource requirements and classical optimization complexity.</description>

      <title>Obstacle Mean Curvature Flow: Efficient Approximation and Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient numerical method to compute mean curvature flow with obstacles. The method augments the Merrimam-Bence-Osher scheme with a pointwise update that enforces the constraint and therefore retains the computational complexity of the original scheme. Remarkably, this naive scheme inherits both crucial structural properties of obstacle mean curvature flow: a geometric comparison principle and a minimizing movements interpretation. The latter immediately implies the unconditional stability of the scheme. Based on the comparison principle we prove the convergence of the scheme to the viscosity solution of obstacle mean curvature flow. Moreover, using the minimizing movements interpretation, we show convergence of a spatially discrete model. Finally, we present numerical experiments for a physical model that inspired this work.</description>

      <title>TENG++: Time-Evolving Natural Gradient for Solving PDEs With Deep Neural Nets under General Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are central to modeling complex systems across physical, biological, and engineering domains, yet traditional numerical methods often struggle with high-dimensional or complex problems. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient alternative by embedding physics-based constraints into deep learning frameworks, but they face challenges in achieving high accuracy and handling complex boundary conditions. In this work, we extend the Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG) framework to address Dirichlet boundary conditions, integrating natural gradient optimization with numerical time-stepping schemes, including Euler and Heun methods, to ensure both stability and accuracy. By incorporating boundary condition penalty terms into the loss function, the proposed approach enables precise enforcement of Dirichlet constraints. Experiments on the heat equation demonstrate the superior accuracy of the Heun method due to its second-order corrections and the computational efficiency of the Euler method for simpler scenarios. This work establishes a foundation for extending the framework to Neumann and mixed boundary conditions, as well as broader classes of PDEs, advancing the applicability of neural network-based solvers for real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Sparse Operator-Adapted Wavelet Decomposition Using Polygonal Elements for Multiscale FEM Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a sparse multiscale operator-adapted wavelet decomposition-based finite element method (FEM) on unstructured polygonal mesh hierarchies obtained via a coarsening procedure. Our approach decouples different resolution levels, allowing each scale to be solved independently and added to the entire solution without the need to recompute coarser levels. At the finest level, the meshes consist of triangular elements which are geometrically coarsened at each step to form convex polygonal elements. Smooth field regions of the domain are solved with fewer, larger, polygonal elements, whereas high-gradient regions are represented by smaller elements, thereby improving memory efficiency through adaptivity. The proposed algorithm computes solutions via sequences of hierarchical sparse linear-algebra operations with nearly linear computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance: hierarchical MCMC sampling for Bayesian inverse problems combining multiple solvers through deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks such as parameter estimation are computationally demanding whenever dealing with physics-based models, and typically require repeated evaluations of complex numerical solvers. When partial differential equations are involved, full-order models such as those based on the Finite Element Method can make traditional sampling approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computationally infeasible. Although data-driven surrogate models may help reduce evaluation costs, their utility is often limited by the expense of generating high-fidelity data. In contrast, low-fidelity data can be produced more efficiently, although relying on them alone may degrade the accuracy of the inverse UQ solution.
  To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme for Bayesian inverse problems. Extending the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance framework, the method introduces multi-fidelity neural networks that combine the predictions of solvers of varying fidelity, with high fidelity evaluations restricted to an offline training stage. During the online phase, likelihood evaluations are obtained by evaluating the coarse solvers and passing their outputs to the trained neural networks, thereby avoiding additional high-fidelity simulations.
  This construction allows heterogeneous coarse solvers to be incorporated consistently within the hierarchy, providing greater flexibility than standard Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance. The proposed approach improves the approximation accuracy of the low fidelity solvers, leading to longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated on two benchmark inverse problems involving (i) steady isotropic groundwater flow, (ii) an unsteady reaction-diffusion system, for which substantial computational savings are obtained.</description>

      <title>Polyharmonic Spline Packages: Composition, Efficient Procedures for Computation and Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper it was shown that a machine learning regression problem can be solved within the framework of random function theory, with the optimal kernel analytically derived from symmetry and indifference principles and coinciding with a polyharmonic spline. However, a direct application of that solution is limited by O(N^3) computational cost and by a breakdown of the original theoretical assumptions when the input space has excessive dimensionality. This paper proposes a cascade architecture built from packages of polyharmonic splines that simultaneously addresses scalability and is theoretically justified for problems with unknown intrinsic low dimensionality. Efficient matrix procedures are presented for forward computation and end-to-end differentiation through the cascade.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and analyze a numerical approximation of the porous medium equation with fractional potential pressure introduced by Caffarelli and V\'azquez: \[ \partial_t u = \nabla \cdot (u^{m-1}\nabla (-\Delta)^{-\sigma}u) \qquad \text{for} \qquad m\geq2 \quad \text{and} \quad \sigma\in(0,1). \] Our scheme is for one space dimension and positive solutions $u$. It consists of solving numerically the equation satisfied by $v(x,t)=\int_{-\infty}^xu(x,t)dx$, the quasilinear non-divergence form equation \[ \partial_t v= -|\partial_x v|^{m-1} (- \Delta)^{s} v \qquad \text{where} \qquad s=1-\sigma, \] and then computing $u=v_x$ by numerical differentiation. Using upwinding ideas in a novel way, we construct a new and simple, monotone and $L^\infty$-stable, approximation for the $v$-equation, and show local uniform convergence to the unique discontinuous viscosity solution. Using ideas from probability theory, we then prove that the approximation of $u$ converges weakly-$*$, or more precisely, up to normalization, in $C(0,T; P(\mathbb{R}))$ where $P(\mathbb{R})$ is the space of probability measures under the Rubinstein-Kantorovich metric.The analysis include also fundamental solutions where the initial data for $u$ is a Dirac mass. Numerical tests are included to confirm the results. Our scheme seems to be the first numerical scheme for this type of problems.</description>

      <title>Hadamard Langevin dynamics for sampling the l1-prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Priors with non-smooth log-densities, such as the l1-prior, are widely used in Bayesian inverse problems for their sparsity-inducing properties. Existing Langevin-based sampling methods typically rely on proximal mappings or smooth approximations, which alter the target distribution. We propose an alternative approach based on a Hadamard product parameterization of the l1-norm, leading to a smooth but nonconvex and non-globally Lipschitz potential whose marginal law exactly recovers the desired posterior. The resulting Hadamard Langevin dynamics (HLD) defines a diffusion process that is analytically distinct from proximal or mirror-type Langevin schemes. Our main contribution is a rigorous well-posedness theory for both the continuous and discrete HLD. We establish existence and uniqueness of strong solutions, geometric ergodicity of the continuous dynamics, and convergence of the discretized scheme as the step size tends to zero. These results provide the first theoretical foundation for sampling from nonconvex, nonsmooth posteriors through overparameterized Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flow Finite Element Discretisations with Energy-Based $hp$-Adaptivity for the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation with Angular Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article deals with the stationary Gross-Pitaevskii non-linear eigenvalue problem in the presence of a rotating magnetic field that is used to model macroscopic quantum effects such as Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). In this regime, the ground-state wave-function can exhibit an a priori unknown number of quantum vortices at unknown locations, which necessitates the exploitation of adaptive numerical strategies. To this end, we consider the conforming finite element method in combination with a discrete Sobolev gradient descent, which is guided by the energy-topology of the problem, to address the nonlinearity. In addition, a key novelty of this work is an $hp$-adaptive strategy that is solely based on energy decay rather than a posteriori error estimators for the refinement process. Numerical results demonstrate that the $hp$-adaptive strategy is highly efficient in terms of accuracy to compute the ground-state wave function and energy for several test problems where we observe exponential convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The new class of alternating-conjugate splitting methods is presented and analyzed. They are obtained by concatenating a given composition involving complex coefficients with the same composition but with the complex conjugate coefficients. We show that schemes of this type exhibit a good long time behavior when applied to linear unitary and linear Hamiltonian systems, in contrast with other methods based on complex coefficients, and study in detail their preservation properties. We also present new schemes within this class up to order 6 that exhibit a better efficiency than state-of-the-art splitting methods with real coefficients for some classes of problems.</description>

      <title>A numerical Bernstein splines approach for nonlinear initial value problems with Hilfer fractional derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hilfer fractional derivative generalizes and interpolates between the commonly used Riemann-Liouville and Caputo fractional derivative. In general, solutions to Hilfer fractional derivative initial value problems are singular for $t \downarrow t_0$, providing a challenge in numerical approximation. In this work, we present a Bernstein splines method to obtain accurate approximations to solutions of nonlinear Hilfer fractional derivative initial value problems, including solutions with singular behavior. We provide explicit convergence requirements and asymptotic convergence rates to analytical solutions. Moreover, the method is efficiently implemented, using a vectorized approach and parallelization in polynomial order. Numerical experiments show empirical convergence corresponding to analytical results and a significantly higher accuracy compared to the commonly used fractional Adams-Bashforth-Moulton predictor-corrector method. Furthermore, our method is able to simulate nonlinear systems with Hilfer fractional derivatives, as demonstrated by the application to the fractional Van der Pol oscillator.</description>

      <title>Adaptive FEM with explicit time integration for the wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from a recent a posteriori error estimator for the finite element solution of the wave equation with explicit time-stepping [Grote, Lakkis, Santos, 2024], we devise a space-time adaptive strategy which includes both time evolving meshes and local time-stepping [Diaz, Grote, 2009] to overcome any overly stringent CFL stability restriction on the time-step due to local mesh refinement. Moreover, at each time-step the adaptive algorithm monitors the accuracy thanks to the error indicators and recomputes the current step on a refined mesh until the desired tolerance is met; meanwhile, the mesh is coarsened in regions of smaller errors. Leapfrog based local time-stepping is applied in all regions of local mesh refinement to incorporate adaptivity into fully explicit time integration with mesh change while retaining efficiency. Numerical results illustrate the optimal rate of convergence of the a posteriori error estimators on time evolving meshes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a locally conservative enriched Galerkin scheme that preserves the physical bounds for an elliptic problem. To this end, we use a substantial over-penalization of the discrete solution's jumps to obtain optimal convergence. To avoid the ill-conditioning issues that arise in over-penalized schemes, we introduce an involved splitting approach that separates the system of equations for the discontinuous solution part from the system of equations for the continuous solution part, yielding well-behaved subproblems. We prove the existence of discrete solutions and optimal error estimates, which are validated numerically.</description>

      <title>A new data-driven energy-stable Evolve-Filter-Relax model for turbulent flow simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to define the filter and relax steps in the evolve-filter-relax (EFR) framework for simulating turbulent flows. The EFR main advantages are its ease of implementation and computational efficiency. However, as it only contains two parameters (one for the filter step and one for the relax step) its flexibility is rather limited. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach in which the optimal filter is found based on DNS data in the frequency domain. The optimization step is computationally efficient and only involves one-dimensional least-squares problems for each wavenumber. Across both decaying turbulence and Kolmogorov flow, our learned filter decisively outperforms the standard differential filter and the Smagorinsky model, yielding significantly improved accuracy in energy spectra and in the temporal evolution of both energy and enstrophy. In addition, the relax parameter is determined by requiring energy and/or enstrophy conservation, which enforces stability of the method and reduces the appearance of numerical wiggles, especially when the filter is built in scarce data regimes. Applying the learned filter is also more computationally efficient compared to traditional differential filters, as it circumvents solving a linear system.</description>

Abstract: We consider sets of fixed CP, multilinear, and TT rank tensors, and derive conditions for when (the smooth parts of) these sets are smooth homogeneous manifolds. For CP and TT ranks, the conditions are essentially that the rank is sufficiently low. These homogeneous structures are then used to derive Riemannian metrics whose geodesics are both complete and efficient to compute.</description>

      <title>Optimization of gridding algorithms for FFT by vector optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is widely used in applications such as MRI, CT, and interferometry; however, because of its dependence on uniformly sampled data, it requires the use of gridding techniques for practical implementation. The performance of these algorithms strongly depends on the choice of the gridding kernel, with the first prolate spheroidal wave function (PSWF) regarded as optimal. This work redefines kernel optimality through the lens of vector optimization (VO), introducing a rigorous framework that characterizes optimal kernels as Pareto-efficient solutions of an error shape operator. We establish the continuity of such operator, study the existence of solutions, and propose a novel methodology to construct kernels tailored to a desired target error function. The approach is implemented numerically via interior-point optimization. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed kernels outperform both the PSWF and the state-of-the-art methods (MIRT-NUFFT) in specific regions of interest, achieving orders-of-magnitude improvements in mean absolute errors. These results confirm the potential of VO-based kernel design to provide customized accuracy profiles aligned with application-specific requirements. Future research will extend this framework to multidimensional cases and relative error minimization, with potential integration of machine learning for adaptive target error selection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was proved that group equivariance emerges in ensembles of neural networks as the result of full augmentation in the limit of infinitely wide neural networks (neural tangent kernel limit). In this paper, we extend this result significantly. We provide a proof that this emergence does not depend on the neural tangent kernel limit at all. We also consider stochastic settings, and furthermore general architectures. For the latter, we provide a simple sufficient condition on the relation between the architecture and the action of the group for our results to hold. We validate our findings through simple numeric experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control theory of dynamical systems offers a powerful framework for tackling challenges in deep neural networks and other machine learning architectures. We show that concepts such as simultaneous and ensemble controllability offer new insights into the classification and representation properties of deep neural networks, while the control and optimization of static systems can be employed to better understand the performance of shallow networks. Inspired by the classical concept of turnpike, we also explore the relationship between dynamic and static neural networks, where depth is traded for width, and the role of transformers as mechanisms for accelerating classical neural network tasks. We also exploit the expressive power of neural networks (exemplified, for instance, by the Universal Approximation Theorem) to develop a novel hybrid modeling methodology, the Hybrid-Cooperative Learning (HYCO), combining mechanics and data-driven methods in a game-theoretic setting. Finally, we describe how classical properties of diffusion processes, long established in the context of partial differential equations, contribute to explaining the success of modern generative artificial intelligence (AI). We present an overview of our recent results in these areas, illustrating how control, machine learning, numerical analysis, and partial differential equations come together to motivate a fertile ground for future research.</description>

      <title>A preconditioned second-order convex splitting algorithm with extrapolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonconvex optimization problems are widespread in modern machine learning and data science. We introduce an extrapolation strategy into a class of preconditioned second-order convex splitting algorithms for nonconvex optimization problems. The proposed algorithms combine second-order backward differentiation formulas (BDF2) with an extrapolation method. Meanwhile, the implicit-explicit scheme simplifies the subproblem through a preconditioned process. As a result, our approach solves nonconvex problems efficiently without significant computational overhead. Theoretical analysis establishes global convergence of the algorithms using Kurdyka-\L ojasiewicz properties. Numerical experiments include a benchmark problem, the least squares problem with SCAD regularization, and an image segmentation problem. These results demonstrate that our algorithms are highly efficient, as they achieve reduced solution times and competitive performance.</description>
