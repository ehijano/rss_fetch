      <title>Behavior-induced oscillations in epidemic outbreaks with distributed memory: beyond the linear chain trick using numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We considered a model for an infectious disease outbreak, when the depletion of susceptible individuals is negligible, and assumed that individuals adapt their behavior according to the information they receive about new cases. In line with the information index approach, we supposed that individuals react to past information according to a memory kernel that is continuously distributed in the past. We analyzed equilibria and their stability, with analytical results for selected cases. Thanks to the recently developed pseudospectral approximation of delay equations, we studied numerically the long-term dynamics of the model for memory kernels defined by gamma distributions with a general non-integer shape parameter, extending the analysis beyond what is allowed by the linear chain trick. In agreement with previous studies, we showed that behavior adaptation alone can cause sustained waves of infections even in an outbreak scenario, and notably in the absence of other processes like demographic turnover, seasonality, or waning immunity. Our analysis gives a more general insight into how the period and peak of epidemic waves depend on the shape of the memory kernel and how the level of minimal contact impacts the stability of the behavior-induced positive equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Approximate Bayesian Computation Made Easy: A Practical Guide to ABC-SMC for Dynamical Systems with \texttt{pymc}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanistic models are essential tools across ecology, epidemiology, and the life sciences, but parameter inference remains challenging when likelihood functions are intractable. Approximate Bayesian Computation with Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) offers a powerful likelihood-free alternative that requires only the ability to simulate data from mechanistic models. Despite its potential, many researchers remain hesitant to adopt these methods due to perceived complexity. This tutorial bridges that gap by providing a practical, example-driven introduction to ABC-SMC using Python. From predator-prey dynamics to hierarchical epidemic models, we illustrate by example how to implement, diagnose, and interpret ABC-SMC analyses. Each example builds intuition about when and why ABC-SMC works, how partial observability affects parameter identifiability, and how hierarchical structures naturally emerge in Bayesian frameworks. All code leverages PyMC's modern probabilistic programming interface, ensuring reproducibility and easy adaptation to new problems. The code its fully available for download at \href{https://github.com/mariocastro73/ABCSMC_pymc_by_example}{mariocastro73/ABCSMC\_pymc\_by\_example}</description>

      <title>Quantifying Broken Detailed Balance in Transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the canonical two-state model of transcription, we derive exact analytic expressions for the entropy production rate of transcription at steady state, and assess detailed balance breaking in transcription. Our analytics allow us to easily evaluate the entropy production rate of thousands of genes across seven datasets of two-state model parameters without needing to evaluate the entropy production rate from trajectory-based computation. A data-driven approach then exposes that most genes avoid parameter regimes associated with large entropy production rates, akin to a mesoscopic version of energy expenditure minimization. Importantly, we show that this is not a thermodynamic phenomenon, since the entropy production rate from the two state gene model provides only a weak bound on the housekeeping energy needed to power transcription. Finally, we show that cell-to-cell variability can make mRNA expression seem more or less irreversible than a ``representative cell'' would imply.</description>

      <title>Lotka-Volterra-type kinetic equations for interacting species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine a kinetic framework for modeling the time evolution of size distribution densities of two populations governed by predator-prey interactions. The model builds upon the classical Boltzmann-type equations, where the dynamics arise from elementary binary interactions between the populations. The model uniquely incorporates a linear redistribution operator to quantify the birth rates in both populations, inspired by wealth redistribution operators. We prove that, under a suitable scaling regime, the Boltzmann formulation transitions to a system of coupled Fokker-Planck-type equations. These equations describe the evolution of the distribution densities and link the macroscopic dynamics of their mean values to a Lotka-Volterra system of ordinary differential equations, with parameters explicitly derived from the microscopic interaction rules. We then determine the local equilibria of the Fokker-Planck system, which are Gamma-type densities, and investigate the problem of relaxation of its solutions toward these kinetic equilibria, in terms of their moments' dynamics. The results establish a bridge between kinetic modeling and classical population dynamics, offering a multiscale perspective on predator-prey systems.</description>

      <title>Control strategies and trends to equilibrium for kinetic models of opinion dynamics driven by social activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce new kinetic equations modeling opinion dynamics inside a population of individuals, whose propensity to interact with each other is described by their level of social activity. We show that opinion polarization can arise among agents with a low activity level, while active ones develop a consensus, highlighting the importance of social interactions to prevent the formation of extreme opinions. Moreover, we present a realistic control strategy aimed at reducing the number of inactive agents and increasing the number of socially active ones. At last, we prove several (weak and strong) convergence to equilibrium results for such controlled model. In particular, by considering additional interactions between individuals and opinion leaders capable of steering the average opinion of the population, we use entropy method-like techniques to estimate the relaxation toward equilibrium of solutions to a Fokker--Planck equation with degenerate time-dependent coefficients.</description>

      <title>A Compartmental Model for Epidemiology with Human Behavior and Stochastic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01046v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a compartmental model for epidemiology wherein the population is split into groups with either comply or refuse to comply with protocols designed to slow the spread of a disease. Parallel to the disease spread, we assume that noncompliance with protocols spreads as a social contagion. We begin by deriving the reproductive ratio for a deterministic version of the model, and use this to fully characterize the local stability of disease free equilibrium points. We then append the deterministic model with stochastic effects, specifically assuming that the transmission rate of the disease and the transmission rate of the social contagion are uncertain. We prove global existence and nonnegativity for our stochastic model. Then using suitably constructed stochastic Lyapunov functions, we analyze the behavior of the stochastic system with respect to certain disease free states. We demonstrate all of our results with numerical simulations.</description>
