      <title>Dynamic Synchronization and Resonance as a Universal Origin of 1/f Fluctuations -- Amplitude Modulation Across Music and Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a universal physical mechanism for the emergence of 1/f fluctuations, observed across a wide range of systems. In particular, we verify this on acoustic cases. The mechanism is based on amplitude modulation (AM) and demodulation (DM), where the 1/f spectral law arises not in the raw waveform but in its demodulated amplitude envelope. Two distinct yet complementary processes generate the required AM: (i) stochastic synchronization among oscillators, modeled via an extended Kuramoto framework that captures perpetual synchronization-desynchronization cycles, and (ii) frequency-selective resonance, modeled by spectral accumulation of eigenmodes in acoustic or structural environments. Numerical simulations demonstrate that both mechanisms, acting separately or in combination, robustly produce 1/f spectra over several decades when DM is applied, and that the classical Kuramoto critical point is not necessary for their emergence. We demonstrate the cross-domain relevance of this AM/DM framework through analyses of musical performances, seismic records, and astrophysical time series, revealing a common underlying structure. This work establishes demodulation as a general route to 1/f fluctuations, providing a simple and scalable explanation for its ubiquity in both natural and engineered systems.

      <title>Observable Optimization for Precision Theory: Machine Learning Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The practice of collider physics typically involves the marginalization of multi-dimensional collider data to uni-dimensional observables relevant for some physics task. In any cases, such as classification or anomaly detection, the observable can be arbitrarily complicated, such as the output of a neural network. However, for precision measurements, the observable must correspond to something computable systematically beyond the level of current simulation tools. In this work, we demonstrate that precision-theory-compatible observable space exploration can be systematized by using neural simulation-based inference techniques from machine learning. We illustrate this approach by exploring the space of marginalizations of the energy 3-point correlator to optimize sensitivity to the the top quark mass. We first learn the energy-weighted probability density from simulation, then search in the space of marginalizations for an optimal triangle shape. Although simulations and machine learning are used in the process of observable optimization, the output is an observable definition which can be then computed to high precision and compared directly to data without any memory of the computations which produced it. We find that the optimal marginalization is isosceles triangles on the sphere with a side ratio approximately $1:1:\sqrt{2}$ (i.e. right triangles) within the set of marginalizations we consider.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional maximum-entropy phase space tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing 4D or 6D phase space distributions from 1D or 2D measurements is a challenging inverse problem encountered in particle accelerators. Entropy maximization is an established method to incorporate prior information in the reconstruction, but it is typically infeasible in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, I review two recent approaches to high-dimensional entropy maximization. The first approach utilizes differentiable simulations and a class of generative models known as \textit{normalizing flows}, whereas the second approach employs the method of Lagrange multipliers and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. My aim is to provide a short explanation of each method using a common notation. I conclude by mentioning several unsolved problems in phase space tomography.</description>

      <title>Approximating the universal thermal climate index using sparse regression with orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores novel data-driven modeling approaches for analyzing and approximating the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), a physiologically-based metric integrating multiple atmospheric variables to assess thermal comfort. Given the nonlinear, multivariate structure of UTCI, we investigate symbolic and sparse regression techniques as tools for interpretable and efficient function approximation. In particular, we highlight the benefits of using orthogonal polynomial bases-such as Legendre polynomials-in sparse regression frameworks, demonstrating their advantages in stability, convergence, and hierarchical interpretability compared to standard polynomial expansions. We demonstrate that our models achieve significantly lower root-mean squared losses than the widely used sixth-degree polynomial benchmark-while using the same or fewer parameters. By leveraging Legendre polynomial bases, we construct models that efficiently populate a Pareto front of accuracy versus complexity and exhibit stable, hierarchical coefficient structures across varying model capacities. Training on just 20% of the data, our models generalize robustly to the remaining 80%, with consistent performance under bootstrapping. The decomposition effectively approximates the UTCI as a Fourier-like expansion in an orthogonal basis, yielding results near the theoretical optimum in the L2 (least squares) sense. We also connect these findings to the broader context of equation discovery in environmental modeling, referencing probabilistic grammar-based methods that enforce domain consistency and compactness in symbolic expressions. Taken together, these results illustrate how combining sparsity, orthogonality, and symbolic structure enables robust, interpretable modeling of complex environmental indices like UTCI - and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approximation in both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Recurrence Patterns Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrence plots (RPs) are powerful tools for visualizing time series dynamics; however, traditional Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) often relies on global metrics, such as line counting, that can overlook system-specific, localized structures. To address this, we introduce Recurrence Pattern Correlation (RPC), a quantifier inspired by spatial statistics that bridges the gap between qualitative RP inspection and quantitative analysis. RPC is designed to measure the correlation degree of an RP to patterns of arbitrary shape and scale. By choosing patterns with specific time lags, we visualize the unstable manifolds of periodic orbits within the Logistic map bifurcation diagram, dissect the mixed phase space of the Standard map, and track the unstable periodic orbits of the Lorenz '63 system's 3-dimensional phase space. This framework reveals how long-range correlations in recurrence patterns encode the underlying properties of nonlinear dynamics and provides a more flexible tool to analyze pattern formation in RPs.</description>

      <title>infomeasure: A Comprehensive Python Package for Information Theory Measures and Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information theory, i.e. the mathematical analysis of information and of its processing, has become a tenet of modern science; yet, its use in real-world studies is usually hindered by its computational complexity, the lack of coherent software frameworks, and, as a consequence, low reproducibility. We here introduce infomeasure, an open-source Python package designed to provide robust tools for calculating a wide variety of information-theoretic measures, including entropies, mutual information, transfer entropy and divergences. It is designed for both discrete and continuous variables; implements state-of-the-art estimation techniques; and allows the calculation of local measure values, $p$-values and $t$-scores. By unifying these approaches under one consistent framework, infomeasure aims to mitigate common pitfalls, ensure reproducibility, and simplify the practical implementation of information-theoretic analyses. In this contribution, we explore the motivation and features of infomeasure; its validation, using known analytical solutions; and exemplify its utility in a case study involving the analysis of human brain time series.</description>

      <title>Particle identification in the GlueX detector with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In particle physics experiments, identifying the types of particles registered in a detector is essential for the accurate reconstruction of particle collisions. At Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab), the GlueX experiment performs particle identification (PID) by setting specific thresholds, known as cuts, on the kinematic properties of tracks and showers obtained from detector hits. Our research aims to enhance this cut-based method by employing machine-learning algorithms based on multi-layer perceptrons and boosted decision trees. Similar approaches have been applied in other particle physics experiments and offer an opportunity to increase PID accuracies using reconstructed kinematic data. Our study illustrates that both MLPs and BDTs can identify charged and neutral particles in Monte Carlo (MC) simulated GlueX data with significantly improved accuracy over the current cuts-based PID method.</description>
