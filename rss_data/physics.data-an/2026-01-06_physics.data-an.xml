      <title>Neighbourhood topology unveils pathological hubs in the brain networks of epilepsy-surgery patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathological hubs in the brain networks of epilepsy patients are hypothesized to drive seizure generation and propagation. In epilepsy-surgery patients, these hubs have traditionally been associated with the resection area (RA): the region removed during the surgery with the goal of stopping the seizures, and which is typically used as a proxy for the epileptogenic zone. However, recent studies hypothesize that pathological hubs may extend to the vicinity of the RA, potentially complicating post-surgical seizure control. Here we propose a neighbourhood-based analysis of brain organization to investigate this hypothesis. We exploit a large dataset of pre-surgical magnetoencephalography-derived whole-brain networks from 91 epilepsy-surgery patients. Our neighbourhood focus is 2-fold. Firstly, we propose a partition of the brain regions into three sets, namely resected nodes, their neighbours and the remaining network nodes. Secondly, we introduce generalized centrality metrics that describe the neighbourhood of each node, providing a regional measure of hubness. Our analyses reveal that both the RA and its neighbourhood present large hub status, but with significant variability across patients. For some, hubs appear in the RA; for others, in its neighbourhood. Moreover, this variability does not correlate with surgical outcome. These results highlight the potential of neighbourhood-based analyses to uncover novel insights into brain connectivity in brain pathologies, and the need for individualized studies, with large enough cohorts, that account for patient-specific variability.</description>

      <title>Robust Lifetime Estimation from HPGe Radiation-Sensor Time Series Using Pairwise Ratios and MFV Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-purity germanium (HPGe) gamma-ray detectors are core instruments in nuclear physics and astrophysics experiments, where long-term stability and reliable extraction of decay parameters are essential. However, the standard exponential decay analyses of the detector time-series data are often affected by the strong correlations between the fitted parameters and the sensitivity to detector-related fluctuations and outliers. In this study, we present a robust analysis framework for HPGe detector decay data based on pairwise ratios and the Steiner's most frequent value (MFV) statistic. By forming point-to-point ratios of background-subtracted net counts, the dependence on the absolute detector response is eliminated, removing the amplitude-lifetime correlation inherent to conventional regression. The resulting pairwise lifetime estimates exhibit heavy-tailed behavior, which is efficiently summarized using the MFV, a robust estimator designed for such distributions. For the case study, a long and stable dataset from an HPGe detector was used. This data was gathered during a low-temperature nuclear physics experiment focused on observing the 216 keV gamma-ray line in 97-Ru. Using measurements spanning approximately 10 half-lives, we obtain a mean lifetime of tau = 4.0959 +/- 0.0007 (stat) +/- 0.0110 (syst) d, corresponding to a half-life of T1/2 = 2.8391 +/- 0.0005 (stat) +/- 0.0076 (syst) d. These results demonstrate that the pairwise-MFV approach provides a robust and reproducible tool for analyzing long-duration HPGe detector data in nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics experiments, particularly for precision decay measurements, detector-stability studies, and low-background monitoring.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical topological clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological methods have the potential of exploring data clouds without making assumptions on their the structure. Here we propose a hierarchical topological clustering algorithm that can be implemented with any distance choice. The persistence of outliers and clusters of arbitrary shape is inferred from the resulting hierarchy. We demonstrate the potential of the algorithm on selected datasets in which outliers play relevant roles, consisting of images, medical and economic data. These methods can provide meaningful clusters in situations in which other techniques fail to do so.</description>

      <title>From Random Walks to Thermal Rides: Universal Anomalous Transport in Soaring Flights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-country soaring flights rely on intermittent atmospheric updrafts to cover long distances, producing trajectories that alternate between rapid relocation and local exploration. From a large dataset of paraglider, hang glider, and sailplane flights, we uncover a universal transport law: beyond short ballistic times, horizontal motion is persistently sub-ballistic, with a Hurst exponent $\approx 0.88$ largely independent of aircraft type. Phase-resolved analysis using a probabilistic segmentation method shows that this scaling arises from the fundamentally intermittent, two-dimensional, and directionally correlated nature of soaring transport, in which successive ballistic segments do not add coherently. We find that learning, in the sense of experience-driven improvements in exploration and decision-making, manifests primarily in the search phase, enhancing the ability to efficiently probe the air mass and locate the next thermal. Overall, our results suggest that atmospheric structure and the generic organization of the transition-search-climb cycle dominate transport properties, placing human soaring alongside biological and physical systems where anomalous transport emerges from intermittency and persistence.</description>

      <title>Warming-driven rise in soil moisture entropy signals destabilization of the Asian Water Tower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01534v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as the "Asian Water Tower," is currently undergoing a rapid wetting trend. While this moisture increase is often viewed as beneficial for water availability, it remains unclear whether the hydrological system itself is becoming more resilient or drifting toward instability. Here, we apply an entropy-based framework to quantify the changing structural organization of the TP's soil moisture system. We show that from 2000 to 2024, regional wetting has driven a long-term decline in entropy, reflecting an increase in system order and stability due to enhanced hydrological buffering capacity. This stability is modulated by the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which regulates regional heterogeneity via a distinct spatial dipole. Crucially, however, CMIP6 climate projections reveal an alarming reversal: future warming triggers a rise in entropy. This transition signals a loss of systemic resilience, characterized by intensified spatial disorder and potential abrupt regime shifts by the mid-century. Our findings suggest that while current wetting provides a stabilizing buffer, continued warming is projected to amplify spatial heterogeneity, thereby destabilizing the Asian Water Tower, with significant risks for downstream water security.</description>

      <title>Development of a high-resolution indoor radon map using a new machine learning-based probabilistic model and German radon survey data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11143v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate knowledge of indoor radon concentration is crucial for assessing radon-related health effects or identifying radon-prone areas. Indoor radon concentration at the national scale is usually estimated on the basis of extensive measurement campaigns. However, characteristics of the sampled households often differ from the characteristics of the target population owing to the large number of relevant factors that control the indoor radon concentration, such as the availability of geogenic radon or floor level. We propose a model-based approach that allows a more realistic estimation of indoor radon distribution with a higher spatial resolution than a purely data-based approach. A modeling approach was used by applying a quantile regression forest to estimate the probability distribution function of indoor radon for each floor level of each residential building in Germany. Based on the estimated probability distribution function,a probabilistic Monte Carlo sampling technique was applied, enabling the combination and population weighting of floor-level predictions. In this way,the uncertainty of the individual predictions is effectively propagated into the estimate of variability at the aggregated level. The results show an approximate lognormal distribution of indoor radon in dwellings in Germany with an arithmetic mean of 63 Bq/m3, a geometric mean of 41 Bq/m3, and a 95th percentile of 180 Bq/m3. The exceedance probabilities for 100 and 300 Bq/m3 are 12.5% (10.5 million people affected) and 2.2 % (1.9 million people affected), respectively. The advantages of our approach are that it yields a) an accurate estimation of indoor radon concentration even if the survey is not fully representative with respect to floor level and radon concentration in soil, and b) an estimate of the indoor radon distribution with a much higher spatial resolution than basic descriptive statistics.</description>

      <title>Climatic Extremes in Brazil: a parallel analysis of Historical Trends and Socioeconomical Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important consequence of human induced climate change is the increase in extreme weather events. This study contributes to the understanding of Brazil's climate change by examining historical temperature and precipitation patterns. Extreme events of temperature and precipitation are identified using data from the Brazilian Institute of Meteorology, which includes records from 634 meteorological stations operating intermittently since 1961. Using the first 30 years (1961 to 1990) as the reference period, our results show a significant increase in warm days and a corresponding decrease in cold days over the last 30 years (1991 to 2020), in agreement with previous works. In terms of precipitation, it indicates a trend toward drier conditions in the Northeast region of Brazil, whereas the South is experiencing wetter conditions, with an increase in the number of heavy precipitation days in South and in the extremely dry periods in the Northeast. These results have been verified for consistency with several extreme climate indices measured in this study. Additionally, data from S2iD is analyzed, an official database that records natural disasters in Brazil, to estimate their impact in terms of human losses and financial costs over the past decade. Our findings indicate that drought events are the most economically costly, with multiple instances causing damages exceeding a billion USD, whereas storms have the greatest impact on people. Although it is not possible to directly attribute the natural disasters recorded in the S2iD database to the extreme weather events identified through meteorological data, discussion is done on potential implications of these events in the frequency and location of the disasters.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient recurrence quantification analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) is a widely used tool for studying complex dynamical systems, but its standard implementation requires computationally expensive calculations of recurrence plots (RPs) and line length histograms. This study introduces strategies to compute RQA measures directly from time series or phase space vectors, avoiding the need to construct RPs. The calculations can be further accelerated and optimised by applying a random sampling procedure, in which only a subset of line structures is evaluated. These modifications result in shorter run times, less memory use and access, and lower overall energy consumption during analysis while maintaining accuracy. This makes them especially appealing for large-scale data analysis and machine learning applications. The ideas are not limited to diagonal line measures, but can likewise be applied to vertical line-based measures and to recurrence network measures. By lowering computational costs, the proposed strategies contribute to energy saving and sustainable data analysis, and broaden the applicability of recurrence-based methods in modern research contexts.</description>

      <title>Bridging Visual Intuition and Chemical Expertise: An Autonomous Analysis Framework for Nonadiabatic Dynamics Simulations via Mentor-Engineer-Student Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing nonadiabatic molecular dynamics trajectories traditionally heavily relies on expert intuition and visual pattern recognition, a process that is difficult to formalize. We present VisU, a vision-driven framework that leverages the complementary strengths of two state-of-the-art large language models to establish a "virtual research collective." This collective operates through a "Mentor-Engineer-Student" paradigm that mimics the collaborative intelligence of a professional chemistry laboratory. Within this ecosystem, the Mentor provides physical intuition through visual reasoning, while the Engineer adaptively constructs analysis scripts, and the Student executes the pipeline and manages the data and results. VisU autonomously orchestrates a four-stage workflow comprising Preprocessing, Recursive Channel Discovery, Important-Motion Identification, and Validation/Summary. This systematic approach identifies reaction channels and key nuclear motions while generating professional academic reports. By bridging visual insight with chemical expertise, VisU establishes a new paradigm for human-AI collaboration in the analysis of excited-state dynamics simulation results, significantly reducing dependence on manual interpretation and enabling more intuitive, scalable mechanistic discovery.</description>
