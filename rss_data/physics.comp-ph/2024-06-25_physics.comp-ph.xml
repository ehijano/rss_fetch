      <title>Formulation of perfect-crystal diffraction from Takagi-Taupin equations. Numerical implementation in the crystalpy library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Takagi-Taupin equations are solved in their simplest form (zero deformation) to obtain the Bragg-diffracted and transmitted complex amplitudes. The case of plane-parallel crystal plates is discussed using a matrix model. The equations are implemented in an open-source python library crystalpy adapted for numerical applications such as crystal reflectivity calculations and ray tracing.</description>

      <title>Efficient real space formalism for hybrid density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient real space formalism for hybrid exchange-correlation functionals in generalized Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT). In particular, we develop an efficient representation for any function of the real space finite-difference Laplacian matrix by leveraging its Kronecker product structure, thereby enabling the time to solution of associated linear systems to be highly competitive with the fast Fourier transform scheme, while not imposing any restrictions on the boundary conditions. We implement this formalism for both the unscreened and range-separated variants of hybrid functionals. We verify its accuracy and efficiency through comparisons with established planewave codes for isolated as well as bulk systems. In particular, we demonstrate up to an order-of-magnitude speedup in time to solution for the real space method. We also apply the framework to study the structure of liquid water using ab initio molecular dynamics, where we find good agreement with literature. Overall, the current formalism provides an avenue for efficient real space DFT calculations with hybrid density functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of deep learning and ab initio materials calculations is emerging as a trending frontier of materials science research, with deep-learning density functional theory (DFT) electronic structure being particularly promising. In this work, we introduce a neural-network method for modeling the DFT density matrix, a fundamental yet previously unexplored quantity in deep-learning electronic structure. Utilizing an advanced neural network framework that leverages the nearsightedness and equivariance properties of the density matrix, the method demonstrates high accuracy and excellent generalizability in multiple example studies, as well as capability to precisely predict charge density and reproduce other electronic structure properties. Given the pivotal role of the density matrix in DFT as well as other computational methods, the current research introduces a novel approach to the deep-learning study of electronic structure properties, opening up new opportunities for deep-learning enhanced computational materials study.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Product State Model for Simultaneous Classification and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a rapidly expanding field that merges the principles of quantum computing with the techniques of machine learning. One of the powerful mathematical frameworks in this domain is tensor networks. These networks are used to approximate high-order tensors by contracting tensors with lower ranks. Originally developed for simulating quantum systems, tensor networks have become integral to quantum computing and, by extension, to QML. Their ability to efficiently represent and manipulate complex, high-dimensional data makes them suitable for various machine learning tasks within the quantum realm. Here, we present a matrix product state (MPS) model, where the MPS functions as both a classifier and a generator. The dual functionality of this novel MPS model permits a strategy that enhances the traditional training of supervised MPS models. This framework is inspired by generative adversarial networks and is geared towards generating more realistic samples by reducing outliers. Additionally, our contributions offer insights into the mechanics of tensor network methods for generation tasks. Specifically, we discuss alternative embedding functions and a new sampling method from non-normalized MPSs.</description>

      <title>Towards Hypernuclei from Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the strong interactions within baryonic systems beyond the up and down quark sector is pivotal for a comprehensive description of nuclear forces. This study explores the interactions involving hyperons, particularly the $\Lambda$ particle, within the framework of nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT). By incorporating $\Lambda$ hyperons into the NLEFT framework, we extend our investigation into the $S = -1$ sector, allowing us to probe the third dimension of the nuclear chart. We calculate the $\Lambda$ separation energies ($B_{\Lambda}$) of hypernuclei up to the medium-mass region, providing valuable insights into hyperon-nucleon ($YN$) and hyperon-nucleon-nucleon ($YNN$) interactions. Our calculations employ high-fidelity chiral interactions at N${}^3$LO for nucleons and extend it to $\Lambda$ hyperons with leading-order S-wave $YN$ interactions as well as $YNN$ forces constrained only by the $A=4,5$ systems. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the SU(3) symmetry breaking and establish a foundation for future improvements in hypernuclear calculations.</description>

      <title>Simulating moir\'e quantum matter with neural network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials provide an ideal platform for exploring quantum phases of matter. However, solving the many-electron problem in moir\'e systems is challenging due to strong correlation effects. We introduce a powerful variational representation of quantum states, many-body neural Bloch wavefunction, to solve many-electron problems in moir\'e materials accurately and efficiently. Applying our method to the semiconductor heterobilayer WSe2/WS2 , we obtain a generalized Wigner crystal at filling factor n = 1/3, a Mott insulator n = 1, and a correlated insulator with local magnetic moments and antiferromagnetic spin correlation at n = 2. Our neural network approach improves the simulation accuracy of strongly interacting moir\'e materials and paves the way for discovery of new quantum phases with variational learning principle in a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Alignment-Induced Self-Organization of Autonomously Steering Microswimmers: Turbulence, Vortices, and Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems of motile microorganisms exhibit a multitude of collective phenomena, including motility-induced phase separation and turbulence. Sensing of the environment and adaptation of movement plays an essential role in the emergent behavior. We study the collective motion of wet self-steering polar microswimmers, which align their propulsion direction hydrodynamically with that of their neighbors, by mesoscale hydrodynamics simulations. The simulations of the employed squirmer model reveal a distinct dependence on the swimmer flow field, i.e., pullers versus pushers. The collective motion of pushers is characterized by active turbulence, with nearly homogeneous density and a Gaussian velocity distribution. Pullers exhibit a strong tendency for clustering and display velocity and vorticity distributions with fat exponential tails; their dynamics is chaotic, with a temporal appearance of vortex rings and fluid jets. Our results show that the collective behavior of intelligent microswimmers is very diverse and still offers many surprises to be discovered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A deterministic-stochastic coupling scheme is developed for simulating rarefied gas flows, where the key process is the alternative solving of the macroscopic synthetic equations [Su et al., J. Comput. Phys., 407 (2020) 109245] and the mesoscopic equation via the asymptotic-preserving time-relaxed Monte Carlo scheme [Fei, J. Comput. Phys., 486 (2023) 112128]. Firstly, the macroscopic synthetic equations are exactly derived from the Boltzmann equation, incorporating not only the Newtonian viscosity and Fourier thermal conduction laws but also higher-order constitutive relations that capture rarefaction effects; the latter are extracted from the stochastic solver over a defined sampling interval. Secondly, the macroscopic synthetic equations, with the initial field extracted from the stochastic solver over the same sampling interval, are solved to the steady state or over certain iteration steps. Finally, the simulation particles in the stochastic solver are updated to match the density, velocity, and temperature obtained from the macroscopic synthetic equations. Moreover, simulation particles in the subsequent interval will be partly sampled according to the solutions of macroscopic synthetic equations. As a result, our coupling strategy enhances the asymptotic-preserving characteristic of the stochastic solver and substantially accelerates convergence towards the steady state. Several numerical tests are performed, and it is found that our method can reduce the computational cost in the near-continuum flow regime by two orders of magnitude compared to the direct simulation Monte Carlo method.</description>

Abstract: The development of turbulence closure models, parametrizing the influence of small non-resolved scales on the dynamics of large resolved ones, is an outstanding theoretical challenge with vast applicative relevance. We present a closure, based on deep recurrent neural networks, that quantitatively reproduces, within statistical errors, Eulerian and Lagrangian structure functions and the intermittent statistics of the energy cascade, including those of subgrid fluxes. To achieve high-order statistical accuracy, and thus a stringent statistical test, we employ shell models of turbulence. Our results encourage the development of similar approaches for 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence.</description>

      <title>Quantifying local and global mass balance errors in physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) have recently become attractive for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe physics laws. By including PDE-based loss functions, physics laws such as mass balance are enforced softly in PINN. This paper investigates how mass balance constraints are satisfied when PINN is used to solve the resulting PDEs. We investigate PINN's ability to solve the 1D saturated groundwater flow equations for homogeneous and heterogeneous media and evaluate the local and global mass balance errors. We compare the obtained PINN's solution and associated mass balance errors against a two-point finite volume numerical method and the corresponding analytical solution. We also evaluate the accuracy of PINN in solving the 1D saturated groundwater flow equation with and without incorporating hydraulic heads as training data. We demonstrate that PINN's local and global mass balance errors are significant compared to the finite volume approach. Tuning the PINN's hyperparameters, such as the number of collocation points, training data, hidden layers, nodes, epochs, and learning rate, did not improve the solution accuracy or the mass balance errors compared to the finite volume solution. Mass balance errors could considerably challenge the utility of PINN in applications where ensuring compliance with physical and mathematical properties is crucial.</description>

      <title>Local primordial non-Gaussianity from the large-scale clustering of photometric DESI luminous red galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use angular clustering of luminous red galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging surveys to constrain the local primordial non-Gaussianity parameter $\fnl$. Our sample comprises over 12 million targets, covering 14,000 square degrees of the sky, with redshifts in the range $0.2&lt; z &lt; 1.35$. We identify Galactic extinction, survey depth, and astronomical seeing as the primary sources of systematic error, and employ linear regression and artificial neural networks to alleviate non-cosmological excess clustering on large scales. Our methods are tested against simulations with and without $\fnl$ and systematics, showing superior performance of the neural network treatment. The neural network with a set of nine imaging property maps passes our systematic null test criteria, and is chosen as the fiducial treatment. Assuming the universality relation, we find $\fnl = 34^{+24(+50)}_{-44(-73)}$ at 68\%(95\%) confidence. We apply a series of robustness tests (e.g., cuts on imaging, declination, or scales used) that show consistency in the obtained constraints. We study how the regression method biases the measured angular power-spectrum and degrades the $\fnl$ constraining power. The use of the nine maps more than doubles the uncertainty compared to using only the three primary maps in the regression. Our results thus motivate the development of more efficient methods that avoid over-correction, protect large-scale clustering information, and preserve constraining power. Additionally, our results encourage further studies of $\fnl$ with DESI spectroscopic samples, where the inclusion of 3D clustering modes should help separate imaging systematics and lessen the degradation in the $\fnl$ uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) plays an important role in quantum chemistry, providing fast-to-evaluate predictive models for various properties of molecules. However, most existing ML models for molecular electronic properties use density functional theory (DFT) databases as ground truth in training, and their prediction accuracy cannot surpass that of DFT. In this work, we developed a unified ML method for electronic structures of organic molecules using the gold-standard CCSD(T) calculations as training data. Tested on hydrocarbon molecules, our model outperforms DFT with the widely-used hybrid and double hybrid functionals in computational costs and prediction accuracy of various quantum chemical properties. As case studies, we apply the model to aromatic compounds and semiconducting polymers on both ground state and excited state properties, demonstrating its accuracy and generalization capability to complex systems that are hard to calculate using CCSD(T)-level methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning of Structural Morphology Imaged by Scanning X-ray Diffraction Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scanning X-ray nanodiffraction microscopy is a powerful technique for spatially resolving nanoscale structural morphologies by diffraction contrast. One of the critical challenges in experimental nanodiffraction data analysis is posed by the convergence angle of nanoscale focusing optics which creates simultaneous dependency of the far-field scattering data on three independent components of the local strain tensor - corresponding to dilation and two potential rigid body rotations of the unit cell. All three components are in principle resolvable through a spatially mapped sample tilt series however traditional data analysis is computationally expensive and prone to artifacts. In this study, we implement NanobeamNN, a convolutional neural network specifically tailored to the analysis of scanning probe X-ray microscopy data. NanobeamNN learns lattice strain and rotation angles from simulated diffraction of a focused X-ray nanobeam by an epitaxial thin film and can directly make reasonable predictions on experimental data without the need for additional fine-tuning. We demonstrate that this approach represents a significant advancement in computational speed over conventional methods, as well as a potential improvement in accuracy over the current standard.</description>

      <title>Catalysis in Extreme Field Environments: The Case of Strongly Ionized $SiO_{2}$ Nanoparticle Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High electric fields can significantly alter catalytic environments and the resultant chemical processes. Such fields arise naturally in biological systems but can also be artificially induced through localized excitations at nanoscale. Recently, strong field excitation of dielectric nanoparticles has emerged as an avenue for studying catalysis in highly ionized environments producing extreme electric fields. While the dynamics of surface ion emission driven by ultrafast laser ionization has been heavily explored, understanding the molecular dynamics leading to fragmentation has remained elusive. To address this, we employed a multiscale approach utilizing non-adiabatic quantum molecular dynamics (NAQMD) simulations on hydrogenated silica surfaces in both bare and wetted environments under field conditions mimicking those of an ionized nanoparticle. Our findings indicate that hole localization drives fragmentation dynamics, leading to surface silanol dissociation within 50 fs and charge transfer-induced water splitting in wetted environments within 150 fs. Further insight into such ultrafast mechanisms is critical for advancement of catalysis on the surface of charged nanosystems.</description>
