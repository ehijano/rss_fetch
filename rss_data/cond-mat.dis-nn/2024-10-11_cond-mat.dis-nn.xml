      <title>Phases and Phase Transitions of the Disordered Quantum Clock Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phases and phase transitions of a disordered one-dimensional quantum $q$-state clock Hamiltonian using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Making contact with earlier results, we confirm that the clean, translational invariant version of the model, for $q=6$, hosts an intermediate emergent quasi-long-range ordered (QLRO) phase between the symmetry-broken true long-range ordered (TLRO) phase and the disordered (paramagnetic) phase. With increasing disorder strength, the quasi-long-range ordered phase shrinks and finally vanishes at a multi-critical point, beyond which there is a direct transition from the TLRO phase to the paramagnetic phase. After establishing the phase diagram, we characterize the critical behaviors of the various quantum phase transitions in the model. We find that weak disorder is an irrelevant perturbation of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions that separate the QLRO phase from the TLRO and paramagnetic phases. For stronger disorder, some of the critical exponents become disorder-dependent already before the system reaches the multicritical point. We also show that beyond the multicritical point, the direct transition from the TLRO phase to the paramagnetic phase is governed by an infinite-randomness critical point in line with strong-disorder renormalization group predictions. While our numerical results are for $q=6$, we expect the qualitative features of the behavior to hold for all $q&gt;4$.</description>

      <title>Gaussian disorder and its applications in one-dimensional chain and sys-env environment models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Gaussian disorder, characterized by two parameters:the expected value and the standard deviation.Studying this type of disorder enhances our understanding of how many-body localization (MBL) transition is influenced by the central value and breadth of disorder.We apply Gaussian disorder to a one-dimensional spin-1/2 chain to reveal its features.Our findings indicate that the crucial parameter driving localization transitions is the standard deviation; as it increases, the system transitions from the ergodic phase to the localized phase, while the expected value has no effect,so the critical factor influencing MBL transition is the breadth of disorder rather than its central value.We then explore Gaussian disorder in two system-environment models (ladder and staggered configurations),analyzing the mutual influence when they are coupled.We extensively explore the impacts brought about by system disorder,environment disorder,initial state,and the strength of the sys-env interaction.Finally,for theses two different models,we consider the system and environment as a whole,studying how the localization properties of the entire system are influenced by the disorder strength of each chain and the interaction strength between the two chains.In the ladder configuration, we observe a strong dependence on the initial state,which can lead to either the loss or retention of information,whereas no such dependence on the initial state is found in the staggered configuration.We emphasize that when using dynamic indicators to analyze system characteristics, it is essential to consider the influence of different initial states,as this may lead to significant differences under certain structural conditions,and not all initial states can accurately reflect the localization properties of the many-body system.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Emergence of Nodal-Knot Transitions by Disorder"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper arXiv:2409.01034, Gong et al. studied the disorder effects in nodal-knot semimetal through Wilson momentum-shell renormalization group (RG) method. They stated that various nodal-knot transitions emerge driven by disorders. However, we notice that there are serious problems in this paper. First, in this paper, the RG analysis is not performed in the momentum space around the Fermi surface but in an incorrect momentum space around the point $k=0$. Accordingly, the RG equations are completely unreliable. Second, the criterion for phase transition employed in this paper is invalid. Accroding to the criterion in this paper, we can find that the various phase transitions stated in this paper even emerge in clean nodal-knot semimetal system! Thus, the conclusions in this paper are unfounded.</description>

      <title>Single-Particle Universality of the Many-Body Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider systems of fermions evolved by non-interacting unitary circuits with correlated on-site potentials. When these potentials are drawn from the eigenvalue distribution of a circular random matrix ensemble, the spectral form factor (SFF) of the resulting circuit ensemble can be computed exactly without numerical sampling. In the case of the circular unitary ensemble (CUE) we report an exact closed form for the SFF, valid for arbitrary system sizes, and show that it grows through a sequence of exponential ramps. Using exact numerical methods, we find that the circular orthogonal and symplectic ensembles (COE and CSE, respectively) also lead to exponential growth of the SFF. This exponential growth is characteristic of non-interacting systems with random matrix statistics at the $\textit{single-particle}$ level and, upon introducing interactions, crosses over to a linear ramp consistent with many-body random matrix universality. Our exact results for the SFF provide a baseline for future studies of the crossover between single-particle and many-body random matrix behavior.</description>

      <title>Field theory of monitored, interacting fermion dynamics with charge conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge-conserving dynamics of non-interacting fermions monitored by local charge measurements have been shown to possess in 1D space only an area-law-entangled phase, with no measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). This phenomenon was elegantly explained by an effective replica field theory given by a non-linear sigma model featuring large replica symmetries. In this work, we focus on the charge-conserving monitored dynamics of interacting fermions in 1D. Using a unifying replica Keldysh field theory, we show that more dynamical phases and transitions emerge owing to the reduction of replica symmetry when interactions are introduced. The reduced symmetry combines a discrete replica permutation symmetry and the charge-conservation within each replica. The former and its spontaneous breaking govern the MIPT between area-law and volume-law entanglement scalings, which can be described by a separatrix in the weak-coupling renormalization group flow. The replica-resolved charge conservation dictates the Kosterlitz-Thouless type ``charge-sharpening" transition between the two kinds of dynamics where the global charge information is either hidden or reconstructible from the local measurements. All the relevant phases and transitions can be understood within the same unifying field theory. Additionally, this field theory provides insight into why the charge-sharpening transition should only happen in the presence of volume-law entanglement scaling. Moreover, we show that our field theory, despite being constructed using the Keldysh formalism, is equivalent to a statistical mechanics model that describes the (replicated) time-evolution of the system's density matrix mapped to a doubled Hilbert space under the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. This equivalence is the result of the trivialization of the fermion distribution function by measurement-induced heating effects.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced transitions for interacting fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effect of measurements on interacting fermionic systems with particle-number conservation, whose dynamics is governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian, is studied. We develop Keldysh field-theoretical framework that provides a unified approach to observables characterizing entanglement and charge fluctuations. Within this framework, we derive a replicated Keldysh non-linear sigma model (NLSM), which incorporates boundary conditions specifically designed to produce generating functions for charge cumulants and entanglement entropies directly in the NLSM language. By using the renormalization-group approach for the NLSM, we determine the phase diagram and the scaling of physical observables. Crucially, the interaction-induced terms in the NLSM action reduce its symmetry, which affects the physics of the problem in a dramatic way. First, this leads to the "information-charge separation": charge cumulants get decoupled from entanglement entropies. Second, the interaction stabilizes the volume-law phase for the entanglement. Third, for spatial dimensionality $d=1$, the interaction stabilizes the phase with logarithmic growth of charge cumulants (in the thermodynamic limit). Thus, in the presence of interaction, there are measurement transitions in any $d$, at variance with free fermions, for which a $d=1$ system is always in the area-law phase. Analytical results are supported by numerical simulations using time-dependent variational principles for matrix product states, which, in particular, confirm the separation of information and charge as a hallmark of the delocalized phase.</description>

      <title>Effects of dissipation in reservoir computing using a spin qubit array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is one of the hottest research topic as an application of many physical devices because the device characteristics can be used directly in computing sequences. Quantum RC is also a promising candidate for application in small-number qubit systems. Here, we propose a quantum RC based on the spin qubit system that reflects the status of the spin qubits in experiments comprising a one-dimensional qubit array. Spin qubits are coupled via the Heisenberg interaction, and data sequences are inputted to one of the spin qubits via pulsed rotations. By introducing dissipation, we obtained a relatively good performance in the quantum RC.</description>

      <title>Field theory for monitored Brownian SYK clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the time evolution of multiple clusters of Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK), i.e. systems of N Majorana fermions with a noisy interaction term. In addition to the unitary evolution, we introduce two-fermion monitorings. We construct a coherent states path integral of the dynamics by generalizing spin coherent states for higher symmetry groups. We then demonstrate that the evolution of the replicated density matrix can be described by an effective field theory for the "light" degrees of freedom, i.e. the quantum fluctuations generated by the unitary evolution. This method is applied to both quadratic, where the field theory reduces to the nonlinear sigma model (NLSM), and also to interacting SYK clusters. We show that in the stationary regime, two monitored clusters exhibit linear-in-N entanglement, with a proportionality factor dependent on the strength of the unitary coupling.</description>

      <title>On criticality of interface depinning and origin of "bump" in the avalanche distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The depinning transition critical point is manifested as power-law distributed avalanches exhibited by slowly driven elastic interfaces in quenched random media. Here we show that since avalanches with different starting heights relative to the mean interface height or different initial local interface curvatures experience different excess driving forces due to elasticity, avalanches close to the "global" critical point of non-mean field systems can be separated into populations of subcritical, critical and supercritical ones. The asymmetric interface height distribution results in an excess of supercritical avalanches, manifested as a "bump" in the avalanche size distribution cutoff.</description>

      <title>Critical Behavior and Collective Modes at the Superfluid Transition in Amorphous Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the critical behavior and the dynamics of the amplitude (Higgs) mode close to the superfluid-insulator quantum phase transition in an amorphous system (i.e., a system subject to topological randomness). In particular, we map the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian defined on a random Voronoi-Delaunay lattice onto a (2+1)-dimensional layered classical XY model with correlated topological disorder. We study the resulting model by laying recourse to classical Monte Carlo simulations. We specifically focus on the scalar susceptibility of the order parameter to study the dynamics of the amplitude mode. To do so, we harness the maximum entropy method to perform the analytic continuation of the scalar susceptibility to real frequencies. Our analysis shows that the amplitude mode remains delocalized in the presence of such topological disorder, quite at odds with its behavior in generic disordered systems, where the randomness localizes the Higgs mode. Furthermore, we show that the critical behavior of the topologically disordered system is identical to that of its translationally invariant counterpart, consistent with a modified Harris criterion. This suggests that the localization of the collective excitations in the presence of disorder is tied to the critical behavior of the quantum phase transition rather than a simple Anderson-localization-type interference mechanism.</description>

      <title>Learning in Associative Networks through Pavlovian Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hebbian learning theory is rooted in Pavlov's Classical Conditioning. While mathematical models of the former have been proposed and studied in the past decades, especially in spin glass theory, only recently it has been numerically shown that it is possible to write neural and synaptic dynamics that mirror Pavlov conditioning mechanisms and also give rise to synaptic weights that correspond to the Hebbian learning rule.
  In this paper, we show that the same dynamics can be derived with equilibrium statistical mechanics tools and basic and motivated modeling assumptions. Then, we show how to study the resulting system of coupled stochastic differential equations assuming the reasonable separation of neural and synaptic timescale. In particular, we analytically demonstrate that this synaptic evolution converges to the Hebbian learning rule in various settings and compute the variance of the stochastic process. Finally, drawing from evidence on pure memory reinforcement during sleep stages, we show how the proposed model can simulate neural networks that undergo sleep-associated memory consolidation processes, thereby proving the compatibility of Pavlovian learning with dreaming mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Stability-Aware Training of Machine Learning Force Fields with Differentiable Boltzmann Estimators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are an attractive alternative to ab-initio methods for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, they can produce unstable simulations, limiting their ability to model phenomena occurring over longer timescales and compromising the quality of estimated observables. To address these challenges, we present Stability-Aware Boltzmann Estimator (StABlE) Training, a multi-modal training procedure which leverages joint supervision from reference quantum-mechanical calculations and system observables. StABlE Training iteratively runs many MD simulations in parallel to seek out unstable regions, and corrects the instabilities via supervision with a reference observable. We achieve efficient end-to-end automatic differentiation through MD simulations using our Boltzmann Estimator, a generalization of implicit differentiation techniques to a broader class of stochastic algorithms. Unlike existing techniques based on active learning, our approach requires no additional ab-initio energy and forces calculations to correct instabilities. We demonstrate our methodology across organic molecules, tetrapeptides, and condensed phase systems, using three modern MLFF architectures. StABlE-trained models achieve significant improvements in simulation stability, data efficiency, and agreement with reference observables. By incorporating observables into the training process alongside first-principles calculations, StABlE Training can be viewed as a general semi-empirical framework applicable across MLFF architectures and systems. This makes it a powerful tool for training stable and accurate MLFFs, particularly in the absence of large reference datasets.</description>

Abstract: With the evolution of numerical methods, we are now aiming at not only qualitative understanding but also quantitative prediction and design of quantum many-body phenomena. As a novel numerical approach, machine learning techniques have been introduced in 2017 to analyze quantum many-body problems. Since then, proposed various novel approaches have opened a new era, in which challenging and fundamental problems in physics can be solved by machine learning methods. Especially, quantitative and accurate estimates of material-dependent physical properties of strongly correlated matter have now become realized by combining first-principles calculations with highly accurate quantum many-body solvers developed with the help of machine learning methods. Thus developed quantitative description of electron correlations will constitute a key element of materials science in the next generation.</description>
