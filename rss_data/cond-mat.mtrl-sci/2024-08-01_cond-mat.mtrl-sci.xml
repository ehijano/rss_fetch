      <title>Isogeometric-based Asymptotic Analysis on Multi-layered Thin Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shell structures are generally modeled based on kinematic hypotheses, where certain involved parameters have to be evaluated phenomenologically. In this article, we propose an isogeometric-based asymptotic analysis scheme aimed at achieving a rational modeling and interpretation about the deformation behaviors of multi-layered thin shells (MTSs). Asymptotic analysis of the three-dimensional governing elasticity equations allows us to gain a deeper insight over shell theories in three aspects. Firstly, the intrinsic hierarchy lying in the displacement field, stress components, constitutive law, and momentum conservation, resulting from the shell thinness, is naturally suggested through asymptotic analysis, and not only the overall stiffness but also the key stress components can be formulated in a fully rational manner. Secondly, through detailed discussion on the order of non-dimensional maximum principal curvature, it is shown that a shell must deform in one of the following two deformation modes. One regime exhibits a mode resembling that of thin plates, while the other corresponds to a piecewise linear distribution of local transverse shear stresses along the thickness. And the specific orders of the key quantities are determined for both cases. Thirdly, in contrast with the existing arguments where an applied shear load on the shell surface necessitates the inclusion of transverse shear stresses for analysis, it is demonstrated that a leading-order shell theory derived from asymptotic analysis should suffice to output satisfactory predictions over the shell stiffness, as well as its internal stress distribution. Numerical examples of the deformation and strength analysis for the MTS are also presented to show the reliability of the proposed method for shell modeling.</description>

      <title>Graded lithium-ion battery pouch cells to homogenise current distributions and mitigate lithium plating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial distributions in current, temperature, state-of-charge and degradation across the plane of large format lithium-ion battery pouch cells can significantly impact their performance, especially at high C-rates. In this paper, a method to smooth out these spatial distributions by grading the electrode microstructure in-the-plane is proposed. A mathematical model of a large format pouch cell is developed and validated against both temperature and voltage experimental data. An analytic solution for the optimal graded electrode that achieves a uniform current distribution across the pouch cell is then derived. The model predicts that the graded electrodes could significantly reduce the likelihood of lithium plating in large format pouch cells, with grading increasing the C-rate at which plating occurs from 2.75C to 5.5C. These results indicate the potential of designing spatially varying electrode architectures to homogenise the response of large format pouch cells and improve their high rate performance.</description>

      <title>X-Ray microtomography of mercury intruded compacted clay: An insight into the geometry of macropores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soil properties, such as wetting collapse behavior and permeability, are strongly correlated to the soil microstructure. To date, several techniques including mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), can be used to characterize the microstructure of soil, but all techniques have their own limitations. In this study, the features of mercury that penetrated and has been entrapped in the pore network of the specimens through MIP testing were investigated by X-Ray microtomography (X-$\mu$CT), in order to give an insight into the geometry of macropores and possible ink-bottle geometry. Two conditions of water content and density were selected for the compacted Maryland clay. The distribution and geometry features of mercury entrapped in the microstructure after MIP were characterized and pore size distributions were also reconstructed. The results suggest that, for the two conditions studied in this paper, macropores were evenly distributed within the specimens, and most of them with a non-spherical shape, and with aspect ratio (ratio between the maximum and minimum thickness along a given segment) smaller than three. Different dominant entrance pore size of macropore was obtained from MIP and X-$\mu$CT, due to the specific experimental protocol used in tests and the effect of ink-bottle geometry. Only the large pore bodies with high aspect ratio were imaged in X-$\mu$CT, due to the extrusion of mercury during the process of depressurization and subsequent sample preparation for X- $\mu$CT. But entire pore space was accessible in MIP. The difference in dominant entrance pore size was more significant for specimens with lower void ratio due to a more pronounced aspect ratio.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Diffusion in Magnesium Using Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and accurately predicting hydrogen diffusion in materials is challenging due to the complex interactions between hydrogen defects and the crystal lattice. These interactions span large length and time scales, making them difficult to address with standard ab initio techniques. This work addresses this challenge by employing accelerated machine learning (ML) molecular dynamics simulations through active learning. We conduct a comparative study of different ML-based interatomic potential schemes, including VASP, MACE, and CHGNet, utilizing various training strategies such as on-the-fly learning, pre-trained universal models, and fine-tuning. We obtain an optimal hydrogen diffusion coefficient value of \(2.1 \cdot 10^{-8}\) m\(^2\)/s at 673 K in MgH\(_{0.06}\), which aligns exceptionally well with experimental results, underlining the efficacy and accuracy of ML-assisted methodologies in the context of diffusive dynamics. Particularly, our procedure significantly reduces the computational effort associated with traditional transition state calculations or ad-hoc designed interatomic potentials. The results highlight the limitations of pre-trained universal solutions for defective materials and how they can be improved by fine-tuning. Specifically, fine-tuning the models on a database produced during on-the-fly training of VASP ML force field allows the retrieving of DFT-level accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Exciton Fission Enhanced Silicon Solar Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While silicon solar cells dominate global photovoltaic energy production, their continued improvement is hindered by the single junction limit. One potential solution is to use molecular singlet exciton fission to generate two electrons from each absorbed high-energy photon. We demonstrate that the long-standing challenge of coupling molecular excited states to silicon solar cells can be overcome using sequential charge transfer. Combining zinc phthalocyanine, aluminum oxide, and a shallow junction crystalline silicon microwire solar cell, the peak charge generation efficiency per photon absorbed in tetracene is (138 +- 6)%, comfortably surpassing the quantum efficiency limit for conventional silicon solar cells and establishing a new, scalable approach to low cost, high efficiency photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>Low dimensional fragment-based descriptors for property predictions in inorganic materials with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent times, the use of machine learning in materials design and discovery has aided to accelerate the discovery of innovative materials with extraordinary properties, which otherwise would have been driven by a laborious and time-consuming trial-and-error process. In this study, a simple yet powerful fragment-based descriptor, Low Dimensional Fragment Descriptors (LDFD), is proposed to work in conjunction with machine learning models to predict important properties of a wide range of inorganic materials such as perovskite oxides, metal halide perovskites, alloys, semiconductor, and other materials system and can also be extended to work with interfaces. To predict properties, the generation of descriptors requires only the structural formula of the materials and, in presence of identical structure in the dataset, additional system properties as input. And the generation of descriptors involves few steps, encoding the formula in binary space and reduction of dimensionality, allowing easy implementation and prediction. To evaluate descriptor performance, six known datasets with up to eight components were compared. The method was applied to properties such as band gaps of perovskites and semiconductors, lattice constant of magnetic alloys, bulk/shear modulus of superhard alloys, critical temperature of superconductors, formation enthalpy and energy above hull convex of perovskite oxides. An advanced python-based data mining tool matminer was utilized for the collection of data. The prediction accuracies are equivalent to the quality of the training data and show comparable effectiveness as previous studies. This method should be extendable to any inorganic material systems which can be subdivided into layers or crystal structures with more than one atom site, and with the progress of data mining the performance should get better with larger and unbiased datasets.</description>

      <title>Electric field control of magnetocaloric effect in cylindrical MnAs/PZT magnetoelectric composite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of electric field control of magnetocaloric effect through quasi-isostatic compression as a result of the converse piezoelectric effect was demonstrated on cylindrical type magnetoelectric composite MnAs/PZT. It was shown that an electric voltage of 100 V corresponding to an electric field of E ~0.3 kV/mm applied to the walls of the piezoelectric component PZT of the MnAs/PZT composite contributes to an increase in the maximum adiabatic temperature change by 0.2 K in the temperature range of the magnetostructural phase transition of MnAs ~317 K at magnetic field change of 1.8 T. Calculations using the finite element method have shown that an electric field voltage of 100 V is capable of creating a quasi-isostatic mechanical stress in the region inside a cylindrical PZT tube of ~3 MPa. Moreover, in the region of weak pressures up to 10 MPa, the contribution to the MCE from piezo compression linearly depends on the electrical voltage that can be used for control the MCE</description>

      <title>Clock Transitions Generated by Defects in Silica Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clock transitions (CTs) in spin systems, which occur at avoided level crossings, enhance quantum coherence lifetimes T$_2$ because the transition becomes immune to the decohering effects of magnetic field fluctuations to first order. We present the first electron-spin resonance (ESR) characterization of CTs in certain defect-rich silica glasses, noting coherence times up to 16 $\mu$s at the CTs. We find CT behavior at zero magnetic field in borosilicate and aluminosilicate glasses, but not in a variety of silica glasses lacking boron or aluminum. Annealing reduces or eliminates the zero-field signal. Since boron and aluminum have the same valence and are acceptors when substituted for silicon, we suggest the observed CT behavior could be generated by a spin-1 boron vacancy center within the borosilicate glass, and similarly, an aluminum-vacancy center in the aluminosilicate glass.</description>

      <title>Describe, Transform, Machine Learning: Feature Engineering for Grain Boundaries and Other Variable-Sized Atom Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining microscopic structure-property relationships for grain boundaries are challenging because of the complex atomic structures that underlie their behavior. This has led to recent efforts to obtain these relationships with machine learning, but representing a grain boundary structure in a manner suitable for machine learning is not a trivial task. There are three key steps common to property prediction in grain boundaries and other variable-sized atom clustered structures. These are: (1) describe the atomic structure as a feature matrix, (2) transform the variable-sized feature matrices of different structures to a fixed length common to all structures, and (3) apply machine learning to predict properties from the transformed feature matrices. We examine these feature engineering steps to understand how they impact the accuracy of grain boundary energy predictions. A database of over 7000 grain boundaries serves to evaluate the different feature engineering combinations. We also examine how these combination of engineered features provide interpretability, or the ability to extract insightful physics from the obtained structure-property relationships.</description>

      <title>Bimodal Scaling Law and Size Effect In Superelastic Nanopillars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape memory alloys that can deform and then spring back to their original shape, have found a wide range of applications in the medical field, from heart valves to stents. As we push the boundaries of technology creating smaller, more precise tools for delicate surgery treatments, the behavior of these alloys at tiny scales becomes increasingly crucial. In this study, we discover that the size effect of critical stress required for stress-induced phase transformation is not universal. We propose an orientation-dependent power decay law, indicating a specific increase in critical stress for pillars smaller than 1 micron meter for the nominally soft [001] and hard [111] orientations. Additionally, we observe high transformability with 11\% recoverable strain under high stress (2 GPa) through lattice frustration at 200nm scale. This research opens new avenues for exploring the superior elastic behavior of shape memory alloys for nanodevices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of two-dimensional ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials, the van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures constructed by ferroelectric and ferromagnetic monolayers have soon become the ideal platforms to achieve converse magnetoelectric functions at the nanoscale, namely to use electric field to control magnetization. In this Letter, by employing density functional theory calculations and dynamic simulations of atomic spin model, we study the key role of interfacial Dzyaloshinshii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in CrI$_3$-In$_2$Se$_3$ vdW heterostructures. Our work demonstrates feasible DMI torques pumped by ferroelectric switching, which can drive current-free and low-energy consumption domain wall motion. Moreover, such interfacial DMI can also significantly enlarge the Walker field in magnetic field-driven domain wall technique.</description>

      <title>Atomic Structure of Self-Buffered BaZr(S,Se)$_3$ Epitaxial Thin Film Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the growth of chalcogenide perovskite thin films through interface design is important for tailoring film properties. Here, the film and interface structure of BaZr(S,Se)$_3$ thin films grown on LaAlO$_3$ by molecular beam epitaxy and post-growth anion exchange is resolved using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. Epitaxial films are achieved from self-assembly of an interface ``buffer'' layer, which accommodates the large film/substrate lattice mismatch of nearly 40\% for the alloy film studied here. The self-assembled buffer layer, occurring for both the as-grown sulfide and post-selenization alloy films, is shown to have rock-salt-like atomic stacking akin to a Ruddlesden-Popper phase. Above this buffer, the film quickly transitions to the perovskite structure. Overall, these results provide insights into oxide-chalcogenide heteroepitaxial film growth, illustrating a process that yields relaxed, crystalline, epitaxial chalcogenide perovskite films that support ongoing studies of optoelectronic and device properties.</description>

      <title>Multiple sliding ferroelectricity of rhombohedral-stacked InSe for reconfigurable photovoltaics and imaging applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through stacking engineering of two-dimensional (2D) materials, a switchable interface polarization can be generated through interlayer sliding, so called sliding ferroelectricity, which is advantageous over the traditional ferroelectricity due to ultra-thin thickness, high switching speed and low fatigue. However, 2D materials with intrinsic sliding ferroelectricity are still rare, with the exception of rhombohedral-stacked MoS2, which limits sliding ferroelectricity for practical applications such as high-speed storage, photovoltaic, and neuromorphic computing. Here, we reported the observation of sliding ferroelectricity with multiple states in undoped rhombohedral-stacked InSe ({\gamma}-InSe) via dual-frequency resonance tracking piezoresponse force microscopy, scanning Kelvin probe microscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy. The tunable bulk photovoltaic effect via the electric field is achieved in the graphene/{\gamma}-InSe/graphene tunneling device with a photovoltaic current density of ~15 mA/cm2, which is attributed to the multiple sliding steps in {\gamma}-InSe according to our theoretical calculations. The vdw tunneling device also features a high photo responsivity of ~255 A/W and a fast response time for real-time imaging. Our work not only enriches rhombohedral-stacked 2D materials for sliding ferroelectricity, but also sheds light on their potential for tunable photovoltaics and imaging applications.</description>

      <title>A symmetry-oriented crystal structure prediction method for crystals with rigid bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed an efficient crystal structure prediction (CSP) method for desired chemical compositions, specifically suited for compounds featuring recurring molecules or rigid bodies. We applied this method to two metal chalcogenides: $\text{Li}_3\text{PS}_4$ and $\text{Na}_6\text{Ge}_2\text{Se}_6$, treating $\text{PS}_4$ as a tetrahedral rigid body and $\text{Ge}_2\text{Se}_6$ as an ethane-like dimer rigid body. Initial trials not only identified the experimentally observed structures of these compounds but also uncovered several novel phases, including a new stannite-type $\text{Li}_3\text{PS}_4$ structure and a potential metastable structure for $\text{Na}_6\text{Ge}_2\text{Se}_6$ that exhibits significantly lower energy than the observed phase, as evaluated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We compared our results with those obtained using USPEX, a popular CSP package leveraging genetic algorithms. Both methods predicted the same lowest energy structures in both compounds. However, our method demonstrated better performance in predicting metastable structures.

      <title>Comparative analysis of structural, elastic, electronic, phonon, thermal and optical properties of two $\text{Na}_6\text{Ge}_2\text{Se}_6$ phases from first principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for new alkali metal chalcogenide materials is continuously increasing due to their potential applications across various technological fields. Recently, a new compound, $\text{Na}_6\text{Ge}_2\text{Se}_6$, was computationally predicted, representing a new phase distinct from the experimentally observed $\text{Na}_6\text{Ge}_2\text{Se}_6$ reported in 1985. Notably, this newly predicted phase displays a lower total energy compared to the previously known experimental phase, as determined by first-principles calculations. In this study, we undertake a thorough comparative analysis of the structural, elastic, electronic, phonon, thermal, and optical properties of these two $\text{Na}_6\text{Ge}_2\text{Se}_6$ phases. Our results show that both phases meet mechanical and dynamical stability criteria. The electronic band structure analysis confirms the semiconducting nature of both materials, with a 2.97 eV indirect band gap for the predicted phase and a 2.93 eV direct band gap for the observed phase. Optically, both phases exhibit strong absorption in the ultraviolet region. Thermal properties analysis reveals that the predicted phase is more thermodynamically stable below 907 K, while the observed phase shows greater thermodynamic stability above this temperature.</description>

      <title>Anomalous strain rate sensitivity of a Cu/Al$_2$O$_3$ multi-layered thin film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study the size and strain rate dependency of copper polycrystalline microstructures, a multi-layered copper/Al$_2$O$_3$ thin film was deposited on a Si substrate using a hybrid deposition system (combining physical vapour and atomic layer deposition). High temperature treatment was applied on the "As Deposited" material with ultrafine-grained structure to increase the average grain size, resulting in a "Heat Treated" state with microcrystalline structure. Focused ion beam milling was employed to create square shaped micropillars with two different sizes, that were subjected to compressive loading at various (0.001/s - 1000/s) strain rates. The detected two distinct anomalies in the strain rate sensitivity behavior appearing at high strain rates could be related to the pillar diameter and the grain size of the deformed samples. The Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayer studied by transmission electron microscopy showed excellent thermal stability and grain boundary pinning by precipitation, also resulting in the homogeneous deformation of the pillars and preventing shear localization. Geometrically necessary dislocation densities estimated by high (angular) resolution electron backscatter diffraction presented inhomogeneous dislocation distribution within the deformed pillar volumes, that is attributed to the proximity of the sample edges. Finally, the Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayers successfully suppressed any possible recrystallization processes, contributing to the excellent film stability, that makes the proposed coating ideal to be operating under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Unsteady slip pulses under spatially-varying prestres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently established that self-healing slip pulses under uniform prestress $\tau_b$ are unstable frictional rupture modes, i.e., they either slowly expand/decay with time t. Furthermore, their dynamics were shown to follow a reduced-dimensionality description corresponding to a special $L(c)$ line in a plane defined by the pulse propagation velocity $c(t)$ and size $L(t)$. Yet, uniform prestress is rather the exception than the rule in natural faults. We study the effects of a spatially-varying prestress $\tau_b(x)$ on 2D slip pulses, initially generated under a uniform $\tau_b$ along a rate-and-state friction fault. We consider periodic and constant-gradient prestress $\tau_b(x)$ around the reference uniform $\tau_b$. For a periodic $\tau_b(x)$, pulses either sustain and form quasi-limit cycles in the $L-c$ plane or decay predominantly monotonically along the $L(c)$ line, depending on the instability index of the initial pulse and the properties of the periodic $\tau_b(x)$. For a constant-gradient $\tau_b(x)$, expanding/decaying pulses closely follow the $L(c)$ line, with systematic shifts determined by the sign and magnitude of the gradient. We also find that a spatially-varying $\tau_b(x)$ can revert the expanding/decaying nature of the initial reference pulse. Finally, we show that a constant-gradient $\tau_b(x)$, of sufficient magnitude and specific sign, can lead to the nucleation of a back-propagating rupture at the healing tail of the initial pulse, generating a bilateral crack-like rupture. This pulse-to-crack transition, along with the above-described effects, demonstrate that rich rupture dynamics merge from a simple, nonuniform prestress. Furthermore, we show that as long as pulses exist, their dynamics are related to the special $L(c)$ line, providing an effective, reduced-dimensionality description of unsteady slip pulses under spatially-varying prestress.</description>

      <title>Electrical control of magnons in multiferroic NiI$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered van der Waals two-dimensional (2D) magnets are a cornerstone of ultrathin spintronic and magnonic devices. The recent discovery of a 2D multiferroic with strong magnetoelectric coupling in NiI$_2$ offers a promising platform for the electrical control of spin-wave transport. In this work, using ab initio calculations, we investigate how the magnonic properties of monolayer NiI$_2$ can be controlled using an external electric field. We show that the emergence of a ferroelectric polarization leads to an energy splitting in the magnon spectrum, thus establishing a way to detect the electric polarization experimentally. We also show the modulation of the magnon splitting and the energy position of the singularities in magnon DOS by an electric field due to the strong magnetoelectric coupling. Our results highlight the interplay between ferroelectricity and magnons in van der Waals multiferroics and pave the way to design electrically tunable magnetic devices at the 2D limit.</description>

      <title>Stable Perovskite Solar Cells via exfoliated graphite as an ion diffusion-blocking layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion and metal diffusion in metal halide perovskites, charge-transporting layers, and electrodes are detrimental to the performance and stability of perovskite-based photovoltaic devices. As a result, there is an intense research interest in developing novel defect and ion diffusion mitigation strategies. We present a simple, low-cost, scalable, and highly effective method that uses spray-coated exfoliated graphite interlayers to block ion and metal diffusion and humidity ingress within the perovskite, the hole transport material, and metal electrodes. The influence of inserting the exfoliated graphite films on the structural, surface morphology, and optoelectronic properties were examined through various methods, including X-ray diffraction, Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry, Scanning electron microscope, atomic force microscopy, Current-voltage (J-V) characteristics, Transient photocurrent, and transient photovoltage. Our comprehensive investigation found that exfoliated graphite films reduced the I- and Li+ diffusion among the layers, leading to defect mitigation, reducing non-radiative recombination, and enhancing the device stability. Consequently, the best-performing device demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 25% and a fill factor exceeding 80%. Additionally, these devices were subjected to different lifetime tests, which significantly enhanced the operational stability.</description>

      <title>A concise 40 T pulse magnet for condensed matter experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in using pulsed high magnetic field as a controlling parameter of physical phenomena in various scientific disciplines, such as condensed matter physics, particle physics, plasma physics, chemistry and biological studies. We devised a concise and portable pulsed magnetic field generator that produces a 40 T field with a pulse duration of 2 ms. It is assembled using only off-the-shelf components and a homemade coil that leverages small computers, Raspberry Pi, and Python codes. It allows for straightforward modification for general purposes. As working examples, we show representative applications in condensed matter experiments of magnetoresistance, magnetization, and magnetostriction measurements for graphite, NdNi$_{2}$P$_{2}$, and NdCo$_{2}$P$_{2}$, respectively, with the maximum magnetic field of 41 T and the lowest temperature of 4.2 K.</description>

      <title>Ge-based Clinopyroxene series: first principles and experimental local probe study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural and electronic properties of the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$ clinopyroxene systems have been investigated by means of perturbed angular correlation (PAC) measurements, performed at ISOLDE, combined with $ab-initio$ electronic structure calculations within the density functional theory (DFT) framework. The partial density of states (PDOS) of the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$ stable compounds has been determined, and it has been observed that the requirement of including an on-site Hubbard-$U$ potential was necessary in order to describe the highly correlated Mn $3d$-states. By considering $U_{eff}$=4 eV, we obtained a band gap width of 1.82 eV and 1.70 eV, for the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$, respectively. Combining electric field gradient (EFG) first principles calculations, using a supercell scheme, with experimental PAC results, we were able to infer that the Cd probe can replace either the $A$ (Ca, Sr) or the Mn sites in the crystalline structures. We also showed that Cd substitution is expected to lead to a reduction in the width of the band gap in these systems, evidencing opportunities for potential band-gap engineering.</description>

      <title>Pressure induced nonmonotonic evolution of superconductivity in 6R-TaS2 with a natural bulk van der Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The natural bulk van der Waals heterostructures compound 6R-TaS2 consists of alternate stacking 1T- and 1H-TaS2 monolayers, creating a unique system that incorporates charge-density-wave (CDW) order and superconductivity (SC) in distinct monolayers. Here, after confirming that the 2D nature of the lattice is preserved up to 8 GPa in 6R-TaS2, we documented an unusual evolution of CDW and SC by conducting highpressure electronic transport measurements. Upon compression, we observe a gradual suppression of CDW within the 1T-layers, while the SC exhibits a dome-shaped behavior that terminates at a critical pressure Pc around 2.9 GPa. By taking account of the fact that the substantial suppression of SC is concomitant with the complete collapse of CDW order at Pc, we argue that the 6R-TaS2 behaves like a stack of Josephson junctions and thus the suppressed superconductivity can be attributed to the weakening of Josephson coupling associated with the presence of CDW fluctuations in the 1T-layers. Furthermore, the SC reversely enhances above Pc, implying the development of emergent superconductivity in the 1T-layers after the melting of T-layer CDW orders. These results show that the 6R-TaS2 not only provides a promising platform to explore emergent phenomena but also serves as a model system to study the complex interactions between competing electronic states.</description>

      <title>Advanced Techniques for High-Performance Fock Matrix Construction on GPU Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Article presents two optimized multi-GPU algorithms for Fock matrix construction, building on the work of Ufimtsev et al. and Barca et al. The novel algorithms, opt-UM and opt-Brc, introduce significant enhancements, including improved integral screening, exploitation of sparsity and symmetry, a linear scaling exchange matrix assembly algorithm, and extended capabilities for Hartree-Fock caculations up to $f$-type angular momentum functions. Opt-Brc excels for smaller systems and for highly contracted triple-$\zeta$ basis sets, while opt-UM is advantageous for large molecular systems. Performance benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs show that our algorithms in the EXtreme-scale Electronic Structure System (EXESS), when combined, outperform all current GPU and CPU Fock build implementations in TeraChem, QUICK, GPU4PySCF, LibIntX, ORCA, and Q-Chem. The implementations were benchmarked on linear and globular systems and average speed ups across three double-$\zeta$ basis sets of 1.5$\times$, 5.2$\times$, and 8.5$\times$ were observed compared to TeraChem, GPU4PySCF, and QUICK respectively. Strong scaling analysis reveals over 91% parallel efficiency on four GPUs for opt-Brc, making it typically faster for multi-GPU execution. Single-compute-node comparisons with CPU-based software like ORCA and Q-Chem show speedups of up to 42$\times$ and 31$\times$, respectively, enhancing power efficiency by up to 18$\times$.</description>

      <title>Molecular Simulations of Quantized Lamellar Thickening in Polyethylenes with Regularly Spaced Brominated Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polyethylene (PE) chains, with CH2 groups replaced by CBr2 at regular intervals ("precision PE"), have been observed to exhibit competing polymorphs driven by a preference for quantized fold lengths by Tasaki et al. Motivated by this recent discovery, the crystallisation behaviour of such precision PE chains, 400 carbons long with CBr2 groups placed regularly at every 21st carbon, is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. The united-monomer model of PE is extended to include dibromo groups, with steric clashes at the bromines reflected in a triple-well bending potential, demonstrating its function as a preferred fold site. Different crystallisation protocols, continuous-cooling and self-seeding, reveal remarkably different crystals. Using self-seeding, the crystalline lamellar thickness increases monotonically with temperature, in quantized multiples of the distance between dibromo units. Polymer chains are observed to fold preferentially at the dibromo groups and such groups appear to be tolerated within the crystal lamellae. On quenching the bromos assemble to form registered layers, not unlike Smectic phases observed in liquid crystals, which confirms the experimental observation of competing Form I and Form I' polymorphs.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface of magnetic kagome compound GdV6Sn6 investigated using de Haas van Alphen Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shape of the Fermi surface, and the cyclotron effective mass of the kagome magnet GdV6Sn6 charge carriers are investigated using de Haas van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations measurements and electronic band structure calculations. The temperature and angle-dependent torque magnetometry measurements revealed at least nine different frequencies ranging from ~10 T up to ~9000 T. These frequencies correspond to extremal areas of the Fermi surface ranging from ~0.2 % up to 50% of the first Brillouin zone, qualitatively consistent with the electronic band structure calculations. The angle dependent dHvA oscillation frequencies indicate that the smaller pockets of the Fermi surface have almost 3D character whereas the bigger pockets of the Fermi surface are mostly two-dimensional. We also find evidence of the presence of light (0.28(1) m0) as well as heavy (2.37(18) m0) charge carriers through the analysis of the temperature dependence of dominant frequencies. The comparison of the observed frequencies with the electronic band structure calculations indicates that the heavy masses correspond to saddle-point-like features of electronic band structure at the M point. The observation of the multiple low frequencies and the calculated contributions from various bands to such low frequencies prevent the estimation of topological nature of bands containing lighter fermions. In conclusion, our work reveals the features of a Fermi surface containing enhanced mass fermions originated from saddle points in the electronic band structure at the M point, which is inherent to kagome lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11702v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate band gap prediction in semiconductors is crucial for materials science and semiconductor technology advancements. This paper extends the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional for a wide range of semiconductors, tackling the exchange and correlation enhancement factor complexities within Density Functional Theory (DFT). Our customized functionals offer a clearer and more realistic alternative to DFT+U methods, which demand large negative U values for elements like Sulfur (S), Selenium (Se), and Phosphorus (P). Moreover, these functionals are more cost-effective than GW or Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional methods, therefore, significantly facilitating the way for unified workflows in analyzing electronic structure, dielectric constants, effective masses, and further transport and elastic properties, allowing for seamless calculations across various properties. We point out that such development could be helpful in the creation of comprehensive databases of band gap and dielectric properties of the materials without expensive calculations. Furthermore, for the semiconductors studied, we show that these customized functionals and the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed semilocal density functional (SCAN) perform similarly in terms of the band gap.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Stability, Magnetic Anisotropy, and Coercivity of $\tau$-L$1_0$ MnAl: Machine Learning, $\textit{Ab Initio}$, and Micromagnetic Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The binary manganese aluminium (MnAl) alloy with L$1_0$ crystal structure is a promising rare earth element-free permanent magnetic material because of its exceptional magnetic properties. However, experimentally synthesizing it in a stable bulk form is extremely challenging. Here, an alternative method of stabilizing the material is proposed and theoretically verified by partially substituting Mn and Al sites with Fe and Ni and identifying its enhanced phase stability, magnetic anisotropy, and coercivity from density functional theory (DFT), machine learning (ML) crystal graph convolution neural network (CGCNN), and micro-magnetic modeling. When considering a fixed ($50\%$)-Ni, the magnetic anisotropy increases with the increasing Fe content but decreases the formation energy. The calculated formation energies, elastic constants, and phonon frequencies demonstrate that all the binary and quaternary compositions are stable. Most importantly, the magnetic moment and magnetic anisotropy constants in $50\%$-Fe substituted composition (equiatomic phase) increase significantly compared to the MnAl. The predicted coercivity of the equiatomic phase is larger than the parent compound calculated by combining DFT computed parameters with micromagnetic simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prototypical antiferroelectric perovskite $\rm PbZrO_3$ (PZO) has garnered considerable attentions in recent years due to its significance in technological applications and fundamental research. Many unresolved issues in PZO are associated with large spatial and time scales, as well as finite temperatures, presenting significant challenges for first-principles density functional theory studies. Here, we introduce a deep learning interatomic potential of PZO, enabling investigation of finite-temperature properties through large-scale atomistic simulations. Trained using an elaborately designed dataset, the model successfully reproduces a large number of phases, in particular, the recently discovered 80-atom antiferroelectric $Pnam$ phase and ferrielectric $Ima2$ phase, providing precise predictions for their structural and dynamical properties. Using this model, we investigated phase transitions of multiple phases, including $Pbam$/$Pnam$, $Ima2$ and $R3c$, which show high similarity to the experimental observation. Our simulation results also highlight the crucial role of free-energy in determining the low-temperature phase of PZO, reconciling the apparent contradiction: $Pbam$ is the most commonly observed phase in experiments, while theoretical calculations predict other phases exhibiting even lower energy. Furthermore, in the temperature range where the $Pbam$ phase is thermodynamically stable, typical double polarization hysteresis loops for antiferroelectrics were obtained, along with a detailed elucidation of the structural evolution during the electric-field induced transitions between the non-polar $Pbam$ and polar $R3c$ phases.</description>

      <title>Atomistic modeling of bulk and grain boundary diffusion in solid electrolyte Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl using machine-learning interatomic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl is a promising candidate for the solid electrolyte in all-solid-state Li-ion batteries. In applications, this material is in a polycrystalline state with grain boundaries (GBs) that can affect ionic conductivity. While atomistic modeling provides valuable information on the impact of GBs on Li diffusion, such studies face either high computational cost (\textit{ab initio} methods) or accuracy limitations (classical potentials) as challenges. Here, we develop a quality-level-based active learning scheme for efficient and systematic development of \textit{ab initio}-based machine-learning interatomic potentials, specifically moment tensor potentials (MTPs), for large-scale, long-time, and high-accuracy simulations of complex atomic structures and diffusion mechanisms as encountered in solid electrolytes. Based on this scheme, we obtain MTPs for Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl and investigate two tilt GBs, $\Sigma3(1\bar{1}2)[110]$, $\Sigma3(\bar{1}11)[110]$, and one twist GB, $\Sigma5(001)[001]$. All three GBs exhibit low formation energies of less than \SI{20}{meV/\angstrom\textsuperscript{2}}, indicating their high stability in polycrystalline Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl. Using the MTPs, diffusion coefficients of the anion-ordered and anion-disordered bulk, as well as the three GBs, are obtained from molecular dynamics simulations of atomistic models. At \SI{300}{\kelvin}, the GB diffusion coefficients fall between the ones of the anion-ordered bulk structure (\SI{0.012e-7}{cm^2/s}, corresponding ionic conductivity about \SI{0.2}{mS/cm}) and the anion-disordered bulk structure (\SI{50}{\percent} Cl/S-anion disorder; \SI{2.203e-7}{cm^2/s}, about \SI{29.8}{mS/cm}) of Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl. Experimental data fall between the Arrhenius-extrapolated diffusion coefficients of the investigated atomic structures.</description>

      <title>Compliant Lattice Modulations Enable Anomalous Elasticity in Ni-Mn-Ga Martensite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High mobility of twin boundaries in modulated martensites of Ni-Mn-Ga-based ferromagnetic shape memory alloys holds a promise for unique magnetomechanical applications. This feature has not been fully understood so far, and in particular it has yet not been unveiled what makes the lattice mechanics of modulated Ni-Mn-Ga specifically different from other martensitic alloys. Here, results of dedicated laser-ultrasonic measurements on hierarchically twinned five-layer modulated (10 M) crystals fill this gap. Using a combination of transient grating spectroscopy and laser-baser resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, it is confirmed that there is a shear elastic instability in the lattice, being significantly stronger than in any other martensitic material and also than what the first-principles calculations for Ni-Mn-Ga predict. The experimental results reveal that the instability is directly related to the lattice modulations. A lattice-scale mechanism of dynamic faulting of the modulation sequence that explains this behavior is proposed; this mechanism can explain the extraordinary mobility of twin boundaries in 10 M.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric nematic -- isotropic critical end point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A critical end point above which an isotropic phase continuously evolves into a polar (ferroelectric) nematic phase with an increasing electric field is found in a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystalline material. The critical end point is approximately 30 K above the zero-field transition temperature from the isotropic to nematic phase and at an electric field of the order of 10 V/micron. Such systems are interesting from the application point of view because a strong birefringence can be induced in a broad temperature range in an optically isotropic phase.</description>

      <title>Active Sparse Bayesian Committee Machine Potential for Isothermal-Isobaric Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning potentials (MLPs) have significantly impacted the fields of chemistry, physics, and biology by enabling large-scale first-principles simulations. Among different machine learning approaches, kernel-based MLPs distinguish themselves through their ability to handle small datasets, quantify uncertainties, and minimize over-fitting. Nevertheless, their extensive computational requirements present considerable challenges. To alleviate these, sparsification methods have been developed, aiming to reduce computational scaling without compromising accuracy. In the context of isothermal and isobaric ML molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, achieving precise pressure estimation is crucial for reproducing reliable system behavior under constant pressure. Despite progress, sparse kernel MLPs struggle with precise pressure prediction. Here, we introduce a virial kernel function that significantly enhances pressure estimation accuracy of MLPs. Additionally, we propose the active sparse Bayesian committee machine (BCM) potential, an on-the-fly MLP architecture that aggregates local sparse Gaussian process regression (SGPR) MLPs. The sparse BCM potential overcomes the steep computational scaling with the kernel size, and a predefined restriction on the size of kernel allows for a fast and efficient on-the-fly training. Our advancements facilitate accurate and computationally efficient machine learning-enhanced MD (MLMD) simulations across diverse systems, including ice-liquid coexisting phases, \ce{Li10Ge(PS6)2} lithium solid electrolyte, and high-pressure liquid boron nitride.</description>

      <title>Twisted hyperbolic van der Waals crystals for full Stokes mid-infrared polarization detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating the polarization properties of light in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectrum is crucial for molecular sensing, biomedical diagnostics, and IR imaging system technologies. Traditional methods, limited by bulky size and intricate fabrication, utilize large rotating optics for full Stokes polarization detection, impeding miniaturization and accuracy. Van der Waals materials (vdW) based devices can address these challenges due to their lithography-free fabrication, ease of integration with chip-scale platforms and room-temperature operation. This study introduces a chip-integrated polarimeter device leveraging the in-plane biaxial hyperbolic vdW crystal properties for mid-infrared light manipulation. The spatial division measurement scheme incorporates six meticulously designed linear and circular polarization filters, achieving high extinction ratios exceeding 30 dB and transmittance surpassing 50%, with fabrication tolerance of film thickness up to 100 nm. The proposed device represents a significant advancement in polarimetric detection, providing a compact, cost-effective solution and opens new avenues for on-chip mid-IR polarimetric detection in next-generation ultra-compact optical systems.</description>

      <title>Unifying thermophotovoltaic performance metrics with technoeconomics: the relative importance of efficiency vs. power density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) are becoming a promising new heat engine with rapid recent gains in performance. Their performance is characterized by two metrics: efficiency and power density. As we bridge the gap between lab-scale and system-scale devices, we need to understand how each of these metrics impacts the technoeconomics of a TPV system. In this work, we develop a technoeconomic metric based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) to understand how the metrics should be weighted relative to each other in terms of importance. We find that systems with high infrastructure and fuel costs should prioritize TPV efficiency, while systems where the TPV cell cost dominates should prioritize power density. We then evaluate how concrete cell improvements could improve the technoeconomics of five example systems, identifying the most impactful specific properties. Namely, improving spectral control with sub-bandgap reflectance is the most effective at reducing LCOE in systems with high infrastructure cost, while increasing view factor and reducing series resistance are most critical in systems with high TPV cell cost. Improving just 1-2 of these properties can reduce the LCOE by 30-50%, reaching competitive values of 8 cents/kWh. This study therefore helps researchers understand which performance metric is more important for their application and how to achieve high values of this performance metric.</description>

      <title>Retinomorphic Machine Vision in a Network Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing prevalence of AI, demand increases for efficient machine learning hardware. Physical systems are sought which combine image feature detection with the essential nonlinearity for tasks such as image classification. Existing physical hardware typically detects features linearly, then employs digital processing for nonlinear activation. Biological vision systems excel at nonlinear image processing. The retina detects features in ganglion cells via lateral inhibition, where neighbouring cells nonlinearly compete for activation.
  We present a bio-inspired 'retinomorphic' machine vision platform using an on-chip semiconductor network laser. The system detects multiple features in parallel via spatially-overlapping lasing modes, with integrated nonlinearity provided by antagonistic gain competition between modes - a photonic analogue of retinal inhibition. Parallel feature-detection enhances efficiency relative to feature-detection schemes which operate sequentially or via multiple device copies, with Si-compatible processing and a compact micron-scale footprint relative to existing mm-scale systems. We report 98.05% accuracy on MNIST-digits and 87.85% on Fashion-MNIST, with strong performance on short training datasets.</description>
