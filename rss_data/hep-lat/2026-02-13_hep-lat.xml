      <description>arXiv:2602.11260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation and moment problems use the analytic structures provided by causality in order to provide rigorous bounds on smeared spectral functions. This proceedings discusses Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation and moment problems and reviews some useful results, including a simple proof that the space of causal data in Nevanlinna--Pick interpolation is convex.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Parton Distribution Functions from Boosted Correlations in the Coulomb gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a novel approach has been proposed to compute parton distributions through the use of boosted correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge from lattice QCD, within the framework of Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET). This approach circumvents the need for Wilson lines, potentially enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of lattice calculations. In this work, we present the first exploratory implementation of the Coulomb gauge method for calculating nucleon unpolarized, helicity, and transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs). The calculations are performed on a Highly-Improved-Staggered-Quark ensemble with lattice spacing $a = 0.06$ fm, volume $L_s^3 \times L_t=48^3\times 64$, and valence pion mass $m_\pi=300$ MeV, employing boosted nucleon states with momenta up to 3.04 GeV. Our lattice predictions for the valence-quark PDFs -- extracted from the real part of the correlators -- show good convergence with increasing nucleon momentum and are compatible with the most recent global analyses for all spin structures. On the other hand, the full-quark-channel PDFs obtained from the imaginary part of the correlators exhibit discrepancies between the two large nucleon momenta considered, although the results at the higher momentum are consistent with phenomenology. The discrepancies are likely driven by stronger excited-state contamination in the imaginary matrix elements, which is consistent with the observation in the literature. Overall, this work demonstrates the efficacy of the Coulomb gauge approach for nucleon PDFs and serves as a benchmark for its broader applications.</description>

      <title>Study of multi-particle states with tensor renormalization group method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the multi-particle states of the (1+1)-dimensional Ising model using a spectroscopy scheme based on the tensor renormalization group method. We start by computing the finite-volume energy spectrum of the model from the transfer matrix, which is numerically estimated using the coarse-grained tensor network. We then identify the quantum number and momentum of the eigenstates by using the symmetries of the system and the matrix elements of an appropriate interpolating operator. Next, we plot the energy for a particular quantum number and momentum as a function of system size to identify the number of particles in the corresponding energy eigenstates. With this method, we obtain one-, two-, and three-particle states. We also compute the two-particle scattering phase shift using L\"uscher's formula as well as the wave function approach, and compare the results with the exact prediction.</description>

      <title>Pion $\beta$ decay and $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ beyond leading logarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The consistent matching of short-distance contributions and hadronic matrix elements is crucial for precise predictions of weak processes involving hadrons. In this Letter, we address this point for charged-current processes involving two pions -- pion $\beta$ decay $\pi^\pm\to\pi^0 e^\pm\nu_e$ and hadronic $\tau$ decays $\tau^\pm\to\pi^\pm\pi^0\nu_\tau$ -- whose decay rates depend on the so-called $\gamma W$ box correction. Using recent results from lattice QCD, we show how to formulate the matching beyond leading-logarithmic accuracy, in particular, how to cancel the dependence on the scheme choice for evanescent operators. As main results, we obtain a prediction for the decay rate of pion $\beta$ decay with theory uncertainties improved by a factor of three, which renders theory uncertainties negligible for future determinations of $V_{ud}$ even beyond the reach of the PIONEER experiment, and an evaluation of isospin-breaking corrections to $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ with negligible uncertainty from the short-distance matching, as necessary for a future $\tau$-based determination of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Deconfined Criticality to 3D $N$-Flavor $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Quantum Chromodynamics on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The infra-red behaviour of gauge theories coupled to matter remains an open problem in quantum field theory. For a given gauge group, such theories are expected to flow to an interacting conformal fixed point over a range of fermion or scalar flavours, known as the `conformal window.' Their nature is important for understanding critical phases and phase transitions beyond the Landau paradigm like the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP), yet remains challenging for conventional non-perturbative approaches. In this work, we study a family of fuzzy-sphere models corresponding to non-linear sigma models with $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ global symmetry extended to the strongly-coupled region. These theories are expected have an infra-red fixed point described by $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in three space-time dimensions with $N$ flavours of fermions. They can be viewed as a generalisation of the $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ DQCP, corresponding to $N=2$. We investigate them using quantum Monte Carlo for $N$ up to $16$. We find evidence that for $N\geq4$ the phase diagram contains a critical phase that appears to be absent for $N=2$. Within this phase, we measure the two-point correlation function and the excitation spectrum, which exhibit emergent conformal symmetry. We also extract the scaling dimension $\Delta_\phi$ of a leading operator and find consistency with large-$N$ expectations.</description>

      <title>Thermal precondensation in gauge-fermion theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precondensation is a peculiar phenomenon in phase transitions, characterised by the occurrence of a condensate only over a finite range of length scales. It is closely connected to the emergence of domains, pseudo-gapped phases and spatial inhomogeneities in equilibrium. In this work, we show its occurrence in gauge-fermion theories in the chiral limit, close to the thermal chiral phase transition. We further show that the precondensation regime becomes increasingly pronounced and extends over a wider temperature range as the number of fermion flavours is increased. We analyse the underlying dynamics which is shared by a broad class of fermionic systems, ranging from condensed matter to high-energy physics. Specifically, we discuss the potential relevance of this phenomenon for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Soffer Bound: Positivity Constraints on Parton Distributions of Spin-3/2 Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the complete set of positivity bounds for the leading-twist parton distribution functions (PDFs) of a spin-3/2 hadron for the first time. This work generalizes the Soffer bound, a fundamental constraint for spin-1/2 nucleons, to quark and gluon distribution functions in higher-spin systems. Expressing the antiparton-hadron scattering amplitudes in terms of the PDFs and the spin density matrix, we establish the connections between the PDFs and the scattering amplitudes in the tensor product space of the parton and hadron spins. Moreover, we obtain the definitions of the PDFs in terms of the helicity amplitudes. Positive definiteness of the scattering amplitude matrix yields a set of inequalities that define the physically allowed parameter space for the helicity amplitudes and a set of constraints for the PDFs.</description>

      <title>Proposal for realizing unpaired Weyl points in a three-dimensional periodically driven optical Raman lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In static lattice systems, the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem enforces the pairing of Weyl points with opposite chiralities, which precludes the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in equilibrium. Periodic driving provides a viable route to circumvent this no-go constraint. Here, we propose a scheme to realize and control unpaired Weyl points using ultracold atoms in a three-dimensional (3D) optical Raman lattice under continuous periodic driving. By engineering distinct relative symmetries between the lattice and multiple Raman potentials, the configuration generates an effective 3D spin-orbit coupling and yields a tunable topological-insulator phase. Through adiabatic periodic modulation of this system, we show that eight Weyl points emerge in the quasienergy spectrum of the low-energy sector, whose net chirality can be precisely tuned. A nonzero total chirality directly corresponds to the formation of unpaired Weyl points. Furthermore, by implementing a synthetic magnetic field via laser-assisted tunneling in this setup, we demonstrate that the chirality imbalance drives a quantized charge current in the weak-field regime, providing a direct signature of the CME. We verify that the adiabatic condition of the driving protocol, as well as the proposed experimental preparation and detection techniques, are within reach of current ultracold-atom experiments. This work establishes a realistic and controllable platform for exploring chiral-anomaly physics and nonequilibrium topological phenomena linked to Weyl fermions.</description>

      <title>Phase structure of (3+1)-dimensional dense two-color QCD at $T=0$ in the strong coupling limit with the tensor renormalization group</title>

Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of the (3+1)-dimensional strong coupling two-color QCD at zero temperature ($T=0$) with finite chemical potential using the tensor renormalization group method. The chiral and diquark condensates and the quark number density are evaluated as a function of the chemical potential. We further determine the critical exponents associated with the diquark condensate, which suggest consistency with the predictions of mean-field theory.</description>

      <title>Tensor form factors of the $\Delta^+$ baryon induced by isovector and isoscalar currents in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12360v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tensor form factors of the $\Delta^+$ baryon are defined through the matrix element of the tensor current and describe its internal structure and spin distribution. We present the full Lorentz decomposition for the $\Delta^+ \rightarrow \Delta^+$ tensor current matrix element, including all independent structures consistent with Lorentz covariance, the Rarita-Schwinger constraints, and the discrete symmetries of Hermiticity, time-reversal, and parity invariance. By investigating the tensor form factors corresponding to both the isovector and isoscalar tensor currents, we observe differences that reflect the distinct contributions of up and down quark components in the $\Delta^+$ baryon.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic polarizabilities of the triplet hadrons in heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic polarizabilities of singly heavy mesons and doubly heavy baryons within the framework of heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory up to $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$. We estimate the low-energy constants using the non-relativistic constituent quark model. A striking prediction of our study is the giant electric polarizabilities of the $D^*$ mesons: $\alpha_E(\bar{D}^{*0}) \approx 291.4 \times 10^{-4} \text{fm}^3$ and $\alpha_E(D^{*-}) \approx -0.4-64.4 i \times 10^{-4} \text{fm}^3$. These anomalously large values arise from the near-degenerate mass between $D^*$ and $D \pi$, which are orders of magnitude larger than those of their bottom counterparts. This kinematic coincidence induces a pronounced cusp structure in the chiral loops, reflecting the long-range dynamics of a pion cloud. For doubly heavy baryons, polarizabilities depend strongly on heavy-flavor composition: the $bcq$ system differs markedly from $ccq$ and $bbq$ due to mixing with scalar heavy-diquark states. Using heavy diquark-antiquark symmetry (HDAS), we unify the chiral dynamics of singly heavy mesons and doubly heavy baryons in the heavy-quark limit. The pion-loop contributions dominate the electromagnetic structure of heavy hadrons and provide essential benchmarks for future lattice QCD simulations.</description>
