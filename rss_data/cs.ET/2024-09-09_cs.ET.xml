      <title>Delay Balancing with Clock-Follow-Data: Optimizing Area Delay Trade-offs for Robust Rapid Single Flux Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm for synthesis of clock-follow-data designs that provides robustness against timing violations for RSFQ circuits while maintaining high performance and minimizing area costs. Since superconducting logic gates must be clocked, managing data flow is a challenging problem that often requires the insertion of many path balancing D Flips (DFFs) to properly sequence data, leading to a substantial increase in area. To address this challenge, we present an algorithm to insert DFFs into clock-follow-data RSFQ circuits that partially balances the delays within the circuit to achieve a target throughput while minimizing area. Our algorithm can account for expected timing variations and, by adjusting the bias of the clock network and clock frequency, we can mitigate unexpected timing violations post-fabrication. Quantifying the benefits of our approach with a benchmark suite with nominal delays, our designs offer an average 1.48x improvement in area delay product (ADP) over high frequency full path balancing (FPB) designs and a 2.07x improvement in ADP over the state of the art robust circuits provided by state-of-the-art (SOTA) multi-phase clocking solutions.</description>

      <title>Parallax: A Compiler for Neutral Atom Quantum Computers under Hardware Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among different quantum computing technologies, neutral atom quantum computers have several advantageous features, such as multi-qubit gates, application-specific topologies, movable qubits, homogenous qubits, and long-range interactions. However, existing compilation techniques for neutral atoms fall short of leveraging these advantages in a practical and scalable manner. This paper introduces Parallax, a zero-SWAP, scalable, and parallelizable compilation and atom movement scheduling method tailored for neutral atom systems, which reduces high-error operations by 25% and increases the success rate by 28% on average compared to the state-of-the-art technique.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Role of Cultural Values in Adopting Large Language Models for Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a socio-technical activity, software development involves the close interconnection of people and technology. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into this process exemplifies the socio-technical nature of software development. Although LLMs influence the development process, software development remains fundamentally human-centric, necessitating an investigation of the human factors in this adoption. Thus, with this study we explore the factors influencing the adoption of LLMs in software development, focusing on the role of professionals' cultural values. Guided by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and Hofstede's cultural dimensions, we hypothesized that cultural values moderate the relationships within the UTAUT2 framework. Using Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling and data from 188 software engineers, we found that habit and performance expectancy are the primary drivers of LLM adoption, while cultural values do not significantly moderate this process. These findings suggest that, by highlighting how LLMs can boost performance and efficiency, organizations can encourage their use, no matter the cultural differences. Practical steps include offering training programs to demonstrate LLM benefits, creating a supportive environment for regular use, and continuously tracking and sharing performance improvements from using LLMs.</description>

      <title>From Concept to Reality: 5G Positioning with Open-Source Implementation of UL-TDoA in OpenAirInterface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents, for the first time, an open-source implementation of the 3GPP Uplink Time Difference of Arrival (UL-TDoA) positioning method using the OpenAirInterface (OAI) framework. UL-TDoA is a critical positioning technique in 5G networks, leveraging the time differences of signal arrival at multiple base stations to determine the precise location of User Equipment (UE). This implementation aims to democratize access to advanced positioning technology by integrating UL-TDoA capabilities into both the Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network (CN) components of OAI, providing a comprehensive and 3GPP-compliant solution.
  The development includes the incorporation of essential protocol procedures, message flows, and interfaces as defined by 3GPP standards. Validation is conducted using two distinct methods: an OAI-RF simulator-based setup for controlled testing and an O-RAN-based Localization Testbed at EURECOM in real-world conditions. The results demonstrate the viability of this open-source UL-TDoA implementation, enabling precise positioning in various environments. By making this implementation publicly available, the study paves the way for widespread research, development, and innovation in the field of 5G positioning technologies, fostering collaboration and accelerating the advancement of cellular network positioning.</description>

      <title>DFabric: Scaling Out Data Parallel Applications with CXL-Ethernet Hybrid Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging interconnects, such as CXL and NVLink, have been integrated into the intra-host topology to scale more accelerators and facilitate efficient communication between them, such as GPUs. To keep pace with the accelerator's growing computing throughput, the interconnect has seen substantial enhancement in link bandwidth, e.g., 256GBps for CXL 3.0 links, which surpasses Ethernet and InfiniBand network links by an order of magnitude or more. Consequently, when data-intensive jobs, such as LLM training, scale across multiple hosts beyond the reach limit of the interconnect, the performance is significantly hindered by the limiting bandwidth of the network infrastructure. We address the problem by proposing DFabric, a two-tier interconnect architecture. We address the problem by proposing DFabric, a two-tier interconnect architecture. First, DFabric disaggregates rack's computing units with an interconnect fabric, i.e., CXL fabric, which scales at rack-level, so that they can enjoy intra-rack efficient interconnecting. Second, DFabric disaggregates NICs from hosts, and consolidates them to form a NIC pool with CXL fabric. By providing sufficient aggregated capacity comparable to interconnect bandwidth, the NIC pool bridges efficient communication across racks or beyond the reach limit of interconnect fabric. However, the local memory accessing becomes the bottleneck when enabling each host to utilize the NIC pool efficiently. To the end, DFabric builds a memory pool with sufficient bandwidth by disaggregating host local memory and adding more memory devices. We have implemented a prototype of DFabric that can run applications transparently. We validated its performance gain by running various microbenchmarks and compute-intensive applications such as DNN and graph.</description>

      <title>Quantum Multiplexer Simplification for State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The initialization of quantum states or Quantum State Preparation (QSP) is a basic subroutine in quantum algorithms. In the worst case, general QSP algorithms are expensive due to the application of multi-controlled gates required to build them. Here, we propose an algorithm that detects whether a given quantum state can be factored into substates, increasing the efficiency of compiling the QSP circuit when we initialize states with some level of disentanglement. The simplification is done by eliminating controls of quantum multiplexers, significantly reducing circuit depth and the number of CNOT gates with a better execution and compilation time than the previous QSP algorithms. Considering efficiency in terms of depth and number of CNOT gates, our method is competitive with the methods in the literature. However, when it comes to run-time and compilation efficiency, our result is significantly better, and the experiments show that by increasing the number of qubits, the gap between the temporal efficiency of the methods increases.</description>

      <title>RegNLP in Action: Facilitating Compliance Through Automated Information Retrieval and Answer Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regulatory documents, issued by governmental regulatory bodies, establish rules, guidelines, and standards that organizations must adhere to for legal compliance. These documents, characterized by their length, complexity and frequent updates, are challenging to interpret, requiring significant allocation of time and expertise on the part of organizations to ensure ongoing compliance.Regulatory Natural Language Processing (RegNLP) is a multidisciplinary subfield aimed at simplifying access to and interpretation of regulatory rules and obligations. We define an Automated Question-Passage Generation task for RegNLP, create the ObliQA dataset containing 27,869 questions derived from the Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM) financial regulation document collection, design a baseline Regulatory Information Retrieval and Answer Generation system, and evaluate it with RePASs, a novel evaluation metric that tests whether generated answers accurately capture all relevant obligations and avoid contradictions.</description>

      <title>A Novel Finite Fractional Fourier Transform and its Quantum Circuit Implementation on Qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new number theoretic definition of discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFrFT) . In this approach the DFrFT is defined as the $N \times N$ dimensional unitary representation of the generator of the arithmetic rotational group $SO_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_N]$, which is the finite set of $\bmod N$ integer, $2\times 2$ matrices acting on the points of the discrete toroidal phase space lattice $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$, preserving the euclidean distance $\bmod N$.
  We construct explicitly, using techniques of the Finite Quantum Mechanics (FQM), the $p^n$ dimensional unitary matrix representation of the group $SO_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_{p^n}]$ and especially we work out in detail the one which corresponds to the generator. This is our definition of the arithmetic fractional Fourier transform (AFrFT).
  Following this definition, we proceed to the construction of efficient quantum circuits for the AFrFT, on sets of $n$ $p$-dimensional qudits with $p$ a prime integer, by introducing novel quantum subcircuits for diagonal operators with quadratic phases as well as new quantum subcircuits for multipliers by a constant. The quantum subcircuits that we introduce provide a set capable to construct quantum circuits for any element of a more general group, the group of Linear Canonical Transformations (LCT), $SL_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_N]$ of the toroidal phase space lattice. As a byproduct, extensions of the diagonal and multiplier quantum circuits for both the qudit and qubit case are given, which are useful alone in various applications. Also, we analyze the depth, width and gate complexity of the efficient AFrFT quantum circuit and we estimate its gate complexity which is of the order $O(n^2)$, its depth which is of the order $O(n)$ with depth $n$, while at the same time it has a structure permitting local interactions between the qudits.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have sparked considerable interest in the integration of these two cutting-edge fields. Among the various ML techniques, reinforcement learning (RL) stands out for its ability to address complex sequential decision-making problems. RL has already demonstrated substantial success in the classical ML community. Now, the emerging field of Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) seeks to enhance RL algorithms by incorporating principles from quantum computing. This paper offers an introduction to this exciting area for the broader AI and ML community.</description>

      <title>A Joint Optimization of Buffer and Splitter Insertion for Phase-Skipping Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron (AQFP) logic is a promising emerging device technology with six orders of magnitude lower power than CMOS. However, AQFP is challenged by the fact that every gate must be clocked, where proper data transfer requires connected gates to have shifted but overlapping clocks. As a result, buffers need to be used to balance re-convergent logic paths, a problem that is exacerbated by every multi-node fanout needing a tree of clocked splitters. Recent AQFP circuit design techniques have offered an opportunity to reduce buffer costs by supporting a notion of phase-skipping but the EDA support for these advanced circuits is limited. This paper proposes the first algorithm to optimize buffer and splitter insertion for phase-skipping AQFP circuits and achieves over 31\% savings over existing buffer reduction schemes and up to 74\% savings in buffers and splitter costs over the SOTA non-phase skipping circuits.</description>

      <title>One-Time Compilation of Device-Level Instructions for Quantum Subroutines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A large class of problems in the current era of quantum devices involve interfacing between the quantum and classical system. These include calibration procedures, characterization routines, and variational algorithms. The control in these routines iteratively switches between the classical and the quantum computer. This results in the repeated compilation of the program that runs on the quantum system, scaling directly with the number of circuits and iterations. The repeated compilation results in a significant overhead throughout the routine. In practice, the total runtime of the program (classical compilation plus quantum execution) has an additional cost proportional to the circuit count. At practical scales, this can dominate the round-trip CPU-QPU time, between 5% and 80%, depending on the proportion of quantum execution time.
  To avoid repeated device-level compilation, we identify that machine code can be parametrized corresponding to pulse/gate parameters which can be dynamically adjusted during execution. Therefore, we develop a device-level partial-compilation (DLPC) technique that reduces compilation overhead to nearly constant, by using cheap remote procedure calls (RPC) from the QPU control software to the CPU. We then demonstrate the performance speedup of this on optimal pulse calibration, system characterization using randomized benchmarking (RB), and variational algorithms. We execute this modified pipeline on real trapped-ion quantum computers and observe significant reductions in compilation time, as much as 2.7x speedup for small-scale VQE problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum multi-row iteration algorithm for linear systems with non-square coefficient matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of quantum linear system algorithms, quantum computing has realized exponential computational advantages over classical computing. However, the focus has been on square coefficient matrices, with few quantum algorithms addressing non-square matrices. Towards this kind of problems defined by $ Ax = b $ where $ A $$ \in\mathbb{R}^{m \times n} $, we propose a quantum algorithm inspired by the classical multi-row iteration method and provide an explicit quantum circuit based on the quantum comparator and Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM). The time complexity of our quantum multi-row iteration algorithm is $ O(K \log m) $, with $ K $ representing the number of iteration steps, which demonstrates an exponential speedup compared to the classical version. Based on the convergence of the classical multi-row iteration algorithm, we prove that our quantum algorithm converges faster than the quantum one-row iteration algorithm presented in [Phys. Rev. A, 101, 022322 (2020)]. Moreover, our algorithm places less demand on the coefficient matrix, making it suitable for solving inconsistent systems and quadratic optimization problems.</description>
