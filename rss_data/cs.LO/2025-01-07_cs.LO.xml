      <title>Revisiting DRUP-based Interpolants with CaDiCaL 2.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our implementation of DRUP-based interpolants in CaDiCaL 2.0, and evaluate performance in the bit-level model checker Avy using the Hardware Model Checking Competition benchmarks.
  CaDiCaL is a state-of-the-art, open-source SAT solver known for its efficiency and flexibility. In its latest release, version 2.0, CaDiCaL introduces a new proof tracer API. This paper presents a tool that leverages this API to implement the DRUP-based algorithm for generating interpolants.
  By integrating this algorithm into CaDiCaL, we enable its use in model-checking workflows that require interpolants. Our experimental evaluation shows that integrating CaDiCaL with DRUP-based interpolants in Avy results in better performance (both runtime and number of solved instances) when compared to Avy with Glucose as the main SAT solver.
  Our implementation is publicly available and can be used by the formal methods community to further develop interpolation-based algorithms using the state-of-the-art SAT solver CaDiCaL. Since our implementation uses the Tracer API, it should be maintainable and applicable to future releases of CaDiCaL.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented TLAPS Proof Generation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to automated proof generation for the TLA+ Proof System (TLAPS) using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our method combines two key components: a sub-proof obligation generation phase that breaks down complex proof obligations into simpler sub-obligations, and a proof generation phase that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation with verified proof examples. We evaluate our approach using proof obligations from varying complexity levels of proof obligations, spanning from fundamental arithmetic properties to the properties of algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that while the method successfully generates valid proofs for intermediate-complexity obligations, it faces limitations with more complex theorems. These results indicate that our approach can effectively assist in proof development for certain classes of properties, contributing to the broader goal of integrating LLMs into formal verification workflows.</description>

      <title>Disagree and Commit: Degrees of Argumentation-based Agreements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cooperative human decision-making, agreements are often not total; a partial degree of agreement is sufficient to commit to a decision and move on, as long as one is somewhat confident that the involved parties are likely to stand by their commitment in the future, given no drastic unexpected changes. In this paper, we introduce the notion of agreement scenarios that allow artificial autonomous agents to reach such agreements, using formal models of argumentation, in particular abstract argumentation and value-based argumentation. We introduce the notions of degrees of satisfaction and (minimum, mean, and median) agreement, as well as a measure of the impact a value in a value-based argumentation framework has on these notions. We then analyze how degrees of agreement are affected when agreement scenarios are expanded with new information, to shed light on the reliability of partial agreements in dynamic scenarios. An implementation of the introduced concepts is provided as part of an argumentation-based reasoning software library.</description>

      <title>Recursive Decomposition of Logical Thoughts: Framework for Superior Reasoning and Knowledge Propagation in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models remains a critical challenge in artificial intelligence. We introduce RDoLT, Recursive Decomposition of Logical Thought prompting, a novel framework that significantly boosts LLM reasoning performance. RDoLT is built on three key innovations: (1) recursively breaking down complex reasoning tasks into sub-tasks of progressive complexity; (2) employing an advanced selection and scoring mechanism to identify the most promising reasoning thoughts; and (3) integrating a knowledge propagation module that mimics human learning by keeping track of strong and weak thoughts for information propagation. Our approach was evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including GSM8K, SVAMP, MultiArith, LastLetterConcatenation, and Gaokao2023 Math. The results demonstrate that RDoLT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques, achieving a 90.98 percent accuracy on GSM8K with ChatGPT-4, surpassing state-of-the-art techniques by 6.28 percent. Similar improvements were observed on other benchmarks, with accuracy gains ranging from 5.5 percent to 6.75 percent. These findings highlight RDoLT's potential to advance prompt engineering, offering a more effective and generalizable approach to complex reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Second-order HyperLTL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15675v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the complexity of second-order HyperLTL satisfiability, finite-state satisfiability, and model-checking: All three are equivalent to truth in third-order arithmetic. We also consider two fragments of second-order HyperLTL that have been introduced with the aim to facilitate effective model-checking by restricting the sets one can quantify over. The first one restricts second-order quantification to smallest/largest sets that satisfy a guard while the second one restricts second-order quantification further to least fixed points of (first-order) HyperLTL definable functions. All three problems for the first fragment are still equivalent to truth in third-order arithmetic while satisfiability for the second fragment is $\Sigma_1^1$-complete, i.e., only as hard as for (first-order) HyperLTL and therefore much less complex. Finally, finite-state satisfiability and model-checking are in $\Sigma_2^2$ and are $\Sigma_1^1$-hard, and thus also less complex than for full second-order HyperLTL.</description>

      <title>The equational theory of the Weihrauch lattice with (iterated) composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the equational theory of the Weihrauch lattice with composition and iterations, meaning the collection of equations between terms built from variables, the lattice operations $\sqcup$, $\sqcap$, the composition operator $\star$ and its iteration $(-)^\diamond$ , which are true however we substitute (slightly extended) Weihrauch degrees for the variables. We characterize them using B\"uchi games on finite graphs and give a complete axiomatization that derives them. The term signature and the axiomatization are reminiscent of Kleene algebras, except that we additionally have meets and the lattice operations do not fully distributes over composition. The game characterization also implies that it is decidable whether an equation is universally valid. We give some complexity bounds; in particular, the problem is Pspace-hard in general and we conjecture that it is solvable in Pspace.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Strategy Logic with Degrees of Observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15135v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been considerable work on reasoning about the strategic ability of agents under imperfect information. However, existing logics such as Probabilistic Strategy Logic are unable to express properties relating to information transparency. Information transparency concerns the extent to which agents' actions and behaviours are observable by other agents. Reasoning about information transparency is useful in many domains including security, privacy, and decision-making. In this paper, we present a formal framework for reasoning about information transparency properties in stochastic multi-agent systems. We extend Probabilistic Strategy Logic with new observability operators that capture the degree of observability of temporal properties by agents. We show that the model checking problem for the resulting logic is decidable.</description>
