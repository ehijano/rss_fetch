      <title>Fine Tuning Swimming Locomotion Learned from Mosquito Larvae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In prior research, we analyzed the backwards swimming motion of mosquito larvae, parameterized it, and replicated it in a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. Since the parameterized swimming motion is copied from observed larvae, it is not necessarily the most efficient locomotion for the model of the swimmer. In this project, we further optimize this copied solution for the swimmer model. We utilize Reinforcement Learning to guide local parameter updates. Since the majority of the computation cost arises from the CFD model, we additionally train a deep learning model to replicate the forces acting on the swimmer model. We find that this method is effective at performing local search to improve the parameterized swimming locomotion.</description>

      <title>Were You Helpful -- Predicting Helpful Votes from Amazon Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project investigates factors that influence the perceived helpfulness of Amazon product reviews through machine learning techniques. After extensive feature analysis and correlation testing, we identified key metadata characteristics that serve as strong predictors of review helpfulness. While we initially explored natural language processing approaches using TextBlob for sentiment analysis, our final model focuses on metadata features that demonstrated more significant correlations, including the number of images per review, reviewer's historical helpful votes, and temporal aspects of the review.
  The data pipeline encompasses careful preprocessing and feature standardization steps to prepare the input for model training. Through systematic evaluation of different feature combinations, we discovered that metadata elements we choose using a threshold provide reliable signals when combined for predicting how helpful other Amazon users will find a review. This insight suggests that contextual and user-behavioral factors may be more indicative of review helpfulness than the linguistic content itself.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of dynamic systems using genetic algorithms with dynamic search limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool for describing, predicting, and understanding complex phenomena exhibited by real-world systems. However, identifying the equations that govern a system's dynamics from experimental data remains a significant challenge without a definitive solution. In this study, evolutionary computing techniques are presented to estimate the governing equations of a dynamical system using time-series data. The main approach is to propose polynomial equations with unknown coefficients, and subsequently perform a parametric estimation using genetic algorithms. Some of the main contributions of the present study are an adequate modification of the genetic algorithm to remove terms with minimal contributions, and a mechanism to escape local optima during the search. To evaluate the proposed method, we applied it to three dynamical systems: a linear model, a nonlinear model, and the Lorenz system. Our results demonstrate a reconstruction with an Integral Square Error below 0.22 and a coefficient of determination R-squared of 0.99 for all systems, indicating successful reconstruction of the governing dynamic equations.</description>

      <title>A Performance Investigation of Multimodal Multiobjective Optimization Algorithms in Solving Two Types of Real-World Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, multimodal multiobjective optimization algorithms (MMOAs) based on evolutionary computation have been widely studied. However, existing MMOAs are mainly tested on benchmark function sets such as the 2019 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation test suite (CEC 2019), and their performance on real-world problems is neglected. In this paper, two types of real-world multimodal multiobjective optimization problems in feature selection and location selection respectively are formulated. Moreover, four real-world datasets of Guangzhou, China are constructed for location selection. An investigation is conducted to evaluate the performance of seven existing MMOAs in solving these two types of real-world problems. An analysis of the experimental results explores the characteristics of the tested MMOAs, providing insights for selecting suitable MMOAs in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Integrating programmable plasticity in experiment descriptions for analog neuromorphic hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of plasticity in spiking neural networks is an active area of research. However, simulations that involve complex plasticity rules, dense connectivity/high synapse counts, complex neuron morphologies, or extended simulation times can be computationally demanding. The BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic architecture has been designed to address this challenge by supporting "hybrid" plasticity, which combines the concepts of programmability and inherently parallel emulation. In particular, observables that are expensive in numerical simulation, such as per-synapse correlation measurements, are implemented directly in the synapse circuits. The evaluation of the observables, the decision to perform an update, and the magnitude of an update, are all conducted in a conventional program that runs simultaneously with the analog neural network. Consequently, these systems can offer a scalable and flexible solution in such cases. While previous work on the platform has already reported on the use of different kinds of plasticity, the descriptions for the spiking neural network experiment topology and protocol, and the plasticity algorithm have not been connected. In this work, we introduce an integrated framework for describing spiking neural network experiments and plasticity rules in a unified high-level experiment description language for the BrainScaleS-2 platform and demonstrate its use.</description>

      <title>Short-reach Optical Communications: A Real-world Task for Neuromorphic Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) emulated on dedicated neuromorphic accelerators promise to offer energy-efficient signal processing. However, the neuromorphic advantage over traditional algorithms still remains to be demonstrated in real-world applications. Here, we describe an intensity-modulation, direct-detection (IM/DD) task that is relevant to high-speed optical communication systems used in data centers. Compared to other machine learning-inspired benchmarks, the task offers several advantages. First, the dataset is inherently time-dependent, i.e., there is a time dimension that can be natively mapped to the dynamic evolution of SNNs. Second, small-scale SNNs can achieve the target accuracy required by technical communication standards. Third, due to the small scale and the defined target accuracy, the task facilitates the optimization for real-world aspects, such as energy efficiency, resource requirements, and system complexity.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Mutation in Large Language Models for the Efficient Evolution of Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with evolutionary computation (EC) has introduced a promising paradigm for automating the design of metaheuristic algorithms. However, existing frameworks, such as the Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA), often lack precise control over mutation mechanisms, leading to inefficiencies in solution space exploration and potentially suboptimal convergence. This paper introduces a novel approach to mutation control within LLM-driven evolutionary frameworks, inspired by theory of genetic algorithms. Specifically, we propose dynamic mutation prompts that adaptively regulate mutation rates, leveraging a heavy-tailed power-law distribution to balance exploration and exploitation. Experiments using GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4o models demonstrate that GPT-3.5-turbo fails to adhere to the specific mutation instructions, while GPT-4o is able to adapt its mutation based on the prompt engineered dynamic prompts. Further experiments show that the introduction of these dynamic rates can improve the convergence speed and adaptability of LLaMEA, when using GPT-4o. This work sets the starting point for better controlled LLM-based mutations in code optimization tasks, paving the way for further advancements in automated metaheuristic design.</description>

      <title>Batch Normalization Decomposed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \emph{Batch normalization} is a successful building block of neural network architectures. Yet, it is not well understood. A neural network layer with batch normalization comprises three components that affect the representation induced by the network: \emph{recentering} the mean of the representation to zero, \emph{rescaling} the variance of the representation to one, and finally applying a \emph{non-linearity}. Our work follows the work of Hadi Daneshmand, Amir Joudaki, Francis Bach [NeurIPS~'21], which studied deep \emph{linear} neural networks with only the rescaling stage between layers at initialization. In our work, we present an analysis of the other two key components of networks with batch normalization, namely, the recentering and the non-linearity. When these two components are present, we observe a curious behavior at initialization. Through the layers, the representation of the batch converges to a single cluster except for an odd data point that breaks far away from the cluster in an orthogonal direction. We shed light on this behavior from two perspectives: (1) we analyze the geometrical evolution of a simplified indicative model; (2) we prove a stability result for the aforementioned~configuration.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Container Loading and Unloading through Dual-Cycling and Dockyard Rehandle Reduction Using a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the optimization of container unloading and loading operations at ports, integrating quay-crane dual-cycling with dockyard rehandle minimization. We present a unified model encompassing both operations: ship container unloading and loading by quay crane, and the other is reducing dockyard rehandles while loading the ship. We recognize that optimizing one aspect in isolation can lead to suboptimal outcomes due to interdependencies. Specifically, optimizing unloading sequences for minimal operation time may inadvertently increase dockyard rehandles during loading and vice versa. To address this NP-hard problem, we propose a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) QCDC-DR-GA comprising one-dimensional and two-dimensional GA components. Our model, QCDC-DR-GA, consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art methods in maximizing dual cycles and minimizing dockyard rehandles. Compared to those methods, it reduced 15-20% of total operation time for large vessels. Statistical validation through a two-tailed paired t-test confirms the superiority of QCDC-DR-GA at a 5% significance level. The approach effectively combines QCDC optimization with dockyard rehandle minimization, optimizing the total unloading-loading time. Results underscore the inefficiency of separately optimizing QCDC and dockyard rehandles. Fragmented approaches, such as QCDC Scheduling Optimized by bi-level GA and GA-ILSRS (Scenario 2), show limited improvement compared to QCDC-DR-GA. As in GA-ILSRS (Scenario 1), neglecting dual-cycle optimization leads to inferior performance than QCDC-DR-GA. This emphasizes the necessity of simultaneously considering both aspects for optimal resource utilization and overall operational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Canonic Signed Spike Coding for Efficient Spiking Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) seek to mimic the spiking behavior of biological neurons and are expected to play a key role in the advancement of neural computing and artificial intelligence. The conversion of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to SNNs is the most widely used training method, which ensures that the resulting SNNs perform comparably to ANNs on large-scale datasets. The efficiency of these conversion-based SNNs is often determined by the neural coding schemes. Current schemes typically use spike count or timing for encoding, which is linearly related to ANN activations and increases the required number of time steps. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Canonic Signed Spike (CSS) coding scheme. This method incorporates non-linearity into the encoding process by weighting spikes at each step of neural computation, thereby increasing the information encoded in spikes. We identify the temporal coupling phenomenon arising from weighted spikes and introduce negative spikes along with a Ternary Self-Amplifying (TSA) neuron model to mitigate the issue. A one-step silent period is implemented during neural computation, achieving high accuracy with low latency. We apply the proposed methods to directly convert full-precision ANNs and evaluate performance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that the CSS coding scheme effectively compresses time steps for coding and reduces inference latency with minimal conversion loss.</description>

      <title>Linear Simple Cycle Reservoirs at the edge of stability perform Fourier decomposition of the input driving signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the representational structure of linear Simple Cycle Reservoirs (SCR) operating at the edge of stability. We view SCR as providing in their state space feature representations of the input-driving time series. By endowing the state space with the canonical dot-product, we ``reverse engineer" the corresponding kernel (inner product) operating in the original time series space. The action of this time-series kernel is fully characterized by the eigenspace of the corresponding metric tensor. We demonstrate that when linear SCRs are constructed at the edge of stability, the eigenvectors of the time-series kernel align with the Fourier basis. This theoretical insight is supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>The Cooperative Network Architecture: Learning Structured Networks as Representation of Sensory Patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nets, cooperative networks of neurons, have been proposed as format for the representation of sensory signals, as physical implementation of the Gestalt phenomenon and as solution to the neural binding problem, while the direct interaction between nets by structure-sensitive matching has been proposed as basis for object-global operations such as object detection. The nets are flexibly composed of overlapping net fragments, which are learned from statistical regularities of sensory input. We here present the cooperative network architecture (CNA), a concrete model that learns such net structure to represent input patterns and deals robustly with noise, deformation, and out-of-distribution data, thus laying the groundwork for a novel neural architecture.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bounds and Model Complexity for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a network structure recently proposed by Liu et al. (2024) that offers improved interpretability and a more parsimonious design in many science-oriented tasks compared to multi-layer perceptrons. This work provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of KAN by establishing generalization bounds for KAN equipped with activation functions that are either represented by linear combinations of basis functions or lying in a low-rank Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). In the first case, the generalization bound accommodates various choices of basis functions in forming the activation functions in each layer of KAN and is adapted to different operator norms at each layer. For a particular choice of operator norms, the bound scales with the $l_1$ norm of the coefficient matrices and the Lipschitz constants for the activation functions, and it has no dependence on combinatorial parameters (e.g., number of nodes) outside of logarithmic factors. Moreover, our result does not require the boundedness assumption on the loss function and, hence, is applicable to a general class of regression-type loss functions. In the low-rank case, the generalization bound scales polynomially with the underlying ranks as well as the Lipschitz constants of the activation functions in each layer. These bounds are empirically investigated for KANs trained with stochastic gradient descent on simulated and real data sets. The numerical results demonstrate the practical relevance of these bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical physics provides tools for analyzing high-dimensional problems in machine learning and theoretical neuroscience. These calculations, particularly those using the replica method, often involve lengthy derivations that can obscure physical interpretation. We give concise, non-replica derivations of several key results and highlight their underlying similarities. Specifically, we introduce a cavity approach to analyzing high-dimensional learning problems and apply it to three cases: perceptron classification of points, perceptron classification of manifolds, and kernel ridge regression. These problems share a common structure -- a bipartite system of interacting feature and datum variables -- enabling a unified analysis. For perceptron-capacity problems, we identify a symmetry that allows derivation of correct capacities through a na\"ive method. These results match those obtained through the replica method.</description>
