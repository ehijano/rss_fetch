      <title>Understanding the Origin of a Second Mobility Reversal in Optoelectrically Powered Metallo-Dielectric Janus Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While previous studies indicated the mobility reversal of an electrically-powered metallo-dielectric Janus particle (JP) with increasing frequency, here we report an intriguing second mobility reversal observed in optoelectronically-driven JPs. In contrast to the commonly used setup with parallel ITO-coated glass substrates to induce a uniform electric field orthogonal to the velocity direction, this setup incorporates a thin photoconductive layer deposited on the bottom ITO-coated glass substrate. We have found that the reversal is associated with the asymmetry of the bottom substrate's photoconductivity, localized underneath the JP, resulting from the self-shading effect of the metallic hemisphere under top optical illumination. Numerous control tests, including optical illumination from the bottom, along with numerical simulations, support this hypothesized mechanism</description>

      <title>Electron Irradiation of Crystalline Nitrous Oxide Ice at Low Temperatures: Applications to Outer Solar System Planetary Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiation chemistry and physics of solid N2O have been increasingly studied due to its potential presence on the surfaces of cold, outer Solar System bodies. However, to date, no study has investigated systematically the influence of temperature on this chemistry and physics. In this present study, crystalline N2O ices were irradiated using 2 keV electrons at five different temperatures in the 20-60 K range and the radiolytic dissociation of the molecular solid (as well as the radiolytic formation of seven product molecules) was quantified through the G-value. Our results indicate that temperature does indeed play a role in the radiolytic destruction of crystalline N2O, with higher temperatures being associated with higher destruction G-values. The formation G-values of NO, NO2, N2O2, N2O3, N2O4, N2O5, and O3 were also noted to vary with temperature, with each product molecule exhibiting a distinct trend. The applications of our experimental results to further understanding solid-phase radiation chemistry in the outer Solar System are discussed.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of $A$-type Antiferromagnetism and Chiral Split Magnons in Altermagnetic $\alpha$-MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the $A$-type antiferromagnetic ordering, where ferromagnetic layers couple antiferromagnetically, in the semiconductor altermagnet $\alpha$-MnTe has been a subject of ongoing debate. Experimentally, $\alpha$-MnTe exhibits a nearest-neighbor in-plane ferromagnetic exchange interaction, whereas previous ab initio calculations predicted an antiferromagnetic interaction. In this Letter, we resolve this discrepancy by considering an expanded set of magnetic configurations, which reveals an FM in-plane exchange interaction in agreement with experimental findings. Additionally, we demonstrate that the 10th nearest-neighbor exchange interaction is directionally dependent, inducing a chiral splitting in the magnon bands, as recently observed experimentally. We further show that applying a compressive strain reverses the sign of the in-plane exchange interaction and significantly enhances the spin and chiral splittings of the electronic and magnonic bands, respectively. Our results highlight the critical importance of convergence in the number of magnetic configurations for complex spin interactions in antiferromagnetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a square tiling/tetragonal strip representation to the P, D, and G triply periodic minimal surfaces. This approach is useful in identifying mixtures and grain boundaries of these surfaces that might be useful for material sciences or advanced manufacturing purposes. Generalizations to more complicated strip topology (multi-strand) as well as other regular and semi-regular tilings are discussed. Examples of these include double diamond, double gyroid, and triangular P/D/G surfaces.</description>

      <title>Effect of Fe-doping on VS2 monolayer: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), like VS2, display unique electronic, magnetic, and optical properties, making them promising for spintronic and optoelectronic applications. Using first-principles calculations based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT), we study the effect of Fe-doping on the electronic and magnetic properties of a VS2 monolayer. The pristine VS2 monolayer has ferromagnetic order and a small energy bandgap. This work aims to comprehensively study the substitution of selected Vanadium atoms in the VS2 monolayer by Iron (Fe) atoms, where the substitution concerns Vanadium atoms at various sites within the 2x2 and 3x3 supercells. This leads to significant modifications of the electronic band structure, magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE), and optical response (e.g., dielectric constant and absorption coefficient). The results provide valuable insights into engineering the VS2 monolayer properties for future applications, ranging from spintronics to cancer therapy in medical science.</description>

      <title>SynCoTrain: A Dual Classifier PU-learning Framework for Synthesizability Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material discovery is a cornerstone of modern science, driving advancements in diverse disciplines from biomedical technology to climate solutions. Predicting synthesizability, a critical factor in realizing novel materials, remains a complex challenge due to the limitations of traditional heuristics and thermodynamic proxies. While stability metrics such as formation energy offer partial insights, they fail to account for kinetic factors and technological constraints that influence synthesis outcomes. These challenges are further compounded by the scarcity of negative data, as failed synthesis attempts are often unpublished or context-specific.
  We present SynCoTrain, a semi-supervised machine learning model designed to predict the synthesizability of materials. SynCoTrain employs a co-training framework leveraging two complementary graph convolutional neural networks: SchNet and ALIGNN. By iteratively exchanging predictions between classifiers, SynCoTrain mitigates model bias and enhances generalizability. Our approach uses Positive and Unlabeled (PU) Learning to address the absence of explicit negative data, iteratively refining predictions through collaborative learning.
  The model demonstrates robust performance, achieving high recall on internal and leave-out test sets. By focusing on oxide crystals, a well-characterized material family with extensive experimental data, we establish SynCoTrain as a reliable tool for predicting synthesizability while balancing dataset variability and computational efficiency. This work highlights the potential of co-training to advance high-throughput materials discovery and generative research, offering a scalable solution to the challenge of synthesizability prediction.</description>

      <title>Reward based optimization of resonance-enhanced piezoresponse spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic spectroscopies in Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) are critical for probing material properties, such as force interactions, mechanical properties, polarization switching, and electrochemical reactions and ionic dynamics. However, the practical implementation of these measurements is constrained by the need to balance imaging time and data quality. Signal to noise requirements favor long acquisition times and high frequencies to improve signal fidelity. However, these are limited on the low end by contact resonant frequency and photodiode sensitivity, and on the high end by the time needed to acquire high-resolution spectra, or the propensity for samples degradation under high field excitation over long times. The interdependence of key parameters such as instrument settings, acquisition times, and sampling rates makes manual tuning labor-intensive and highly dependent on user expertise, often yielding operator-dependent results. These limitations are prominent in techniques like Dual Amplitude Resonance Tracking (DART) in Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) that utilize multiple concurrent feedback loops for topography and resonance frequency tracking. Here, a reward-driven workflow is proposed that automates the tuning process, adapting experimental conditions in real time to optimize data quality. This approach significantly reduces the complexity and time required for manual adjustments and can be extended to other SPM spectroscopic methods, enhancing overall efficiency and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Cartesian Atomic Moment Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have substantially advanced atomistic simulations in materials science and chemistry by providing a compelling balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. While leading MLIPs rely on representations of atomic environments using spherical tensors, Cartesian representations offer potential advantages in simplicity and efficiency. In this work, we introduce Cartesian Atomic Moment Potentials (CAMP), an approach equivalent to models based on spherical tensors but operating entirely in the Cartesian space. CAMP constructs atomic moment tensors from neighboring atoms and combines these through tensor products to incorporate higher body-order interactions, which can provide a complete description of local atomic environments. By integrating these into a graph neural network (GNN) framework, CAMP enables physically-motivated and systematically improvable potentials. It requires minimal hyperparameter tuning that simplifies the training process. The model demonstrates excellent performance across diverse systems, including periodic structures, small organic molecules, and two-dimensional materials. It achieves accuracy, efficiency, and stability in molecular dynamics simulations surpassing or comparable to current leading models. By combining the strengths of Cartesian representations with the expressiveness of GNNs, CAMP provides a powerful tool for atomistic simulations to accelerate materials understanding and discovery.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional nature of anomalous Hall conductivity in YMn6Sn6-xGax, x ~ 0.55</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique connectivity of kagome lattices gives rise to topological properties, such as flat bands and Dirac cones. When combined with ferromagnetism and a chemical potential near the 2D Dirac points, this structure offers the potential to realize the highly sought-after topological Chern magnetotransport. Recently, there was considerable excitement surrounding this possibility in the ferrimagnetic kagome metal TbMn$_\mathbf{6}$Sn$_\mathbf{6}$. However, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the 2D Chern gap lies well above the Fermi energy, challenging its relevance in the observed anomalous Hall conductivity. Here, we investigate YMn$_\mathbf{6}$Sn$_\mathbf{5.45}$Ga$_\mathbf{0.55}$, a compound with similar crystallographic, magnetic, and electronic properties to TbMn$_\mathbf{6}$Sn$_\mathbf{6}$. Our findings show that the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity in this material, while comparable in magnitude to that in TbMn$_\mathbf{6}$Sn$_\mathbf{6}$, is fully three-dimensional, thus providing experimental evidence that Hall conductivity in this class of materials does not originate from 2D Chern gaps. Additionally, we confirm that the newly proposed empirical scaling relation for extrinsic Hall conductivity is universally governed by spin fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Layered semiconducting electrides in p-block metal oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional electrides, excess electrons are localized in crystal voids to serve as anions. Most of these electrides are metallic and the metal cations are primarily from the s-block, d-block, or rare-earth elements. Here, we report a class of p-block metal-based electrides found in bilayer SnO and PbO, which are semiconducting and feature electride states in both the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB), as referred to 2D "bipolar" electrides. These bilayers are hybrid electrides where excess electrons are localized in the interlayer region and hybridize with the orbitals of Sn atoms in the VB, exhibiting strong covalent-like interactions with neighboring metal atoms. Compared to previously studied hybrid electrides, the higher electronegativity of Sn and Pb enhances these covalent-like interactions, leading to largely enhanced semiconducting bandgap of up to 2.5 eV. Moreover, the CBM primarily arises from the overlap between metal states and interstitial charges, denoting a potential electride and forming a free-electron-like (FEL) state with small effective mass. This state offers high carrier mobilities for both electron and hole in bilayer SnO, suggesting its potential as a promising p-type semiconductor material.</description>

      <title>Hidden Markov model analysis to fluorescence blinking of fluorescently labeled DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine quantitatively the transition process from emitting to not-emitting states of fluorescent molecules with a machine learning technique. In a fluorescently labeled DNA, the fluorescence occurs continuously under irradiation, but it often transfers to the not-emitting state corresponding to a charge-separated state. The trajectory of the fluorescence consists of repetitions of light-emitting (ON) and not-emitting (OFF) states, called blinking, and it contains a very large amount of noise due to the several reasons, so in principle, it is difficult to distinguish the ON and OFF states quantitatively. The fluorescence trajectory is a typical stochastic process, and therefore requires advanced time-series data analysis. In the present study, we analyze the fluorescence trajectories using a hidden Markov model, and calculate the probability density of the ON and OFF duration. From the analysis, we found that the ON-duration probability density can be well described by an exponential function, and the OFF-duration probability density can be well described by a log-normal function, which are verified in terms of Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The time-bin dependence in the fluorescence trajectory on the probability density is carefully analyzed. We also discuss the ON and OFF processes from failure-rate analysis used in life testing of semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic phonon self-energy due to electrons with finite linewidths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of the non-adiabatic phonon self-energy arising from coupling to electrons with finite linewidths using the spectral representation of Green's functions. Our formalism naturally includes the contribution from the intra-band electronic transitions at all electron wavevectors to the phonon linewidths, which is forbidden for zone-center optical phonons if infinitesimal electron linewidths are used. As a proof of principle, we use the theory to calculate the linewidth of the double-degenerate, zone-center optical $E_{\rm 2g}$ phonons of graphene as a function of the chemical potential. The calculated phonon linewidths obtained with finite electron linewidths differ significantly from those obtained with infinitesimal electron linewidths even at low temperatures. Intra-band electronic transitions play an important role in making this difference. Moreover, only the results accounting for the finite electron linewidths are in quantitative agreement with available experimental data. The presented formalism is suitable for first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Noncollinear ferroelectric and screw-type antiferroelectric phases in a metal-free hybrid molecular crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncollinear dipole textures greatly extend the scientific merits and application perspective of ferroic materials. In fact, noncollinear spin textures have been well recognized as one of the core issues of condensed matter, e.g. cycloidal/conical magnets with multiferroicity and magnetic skyrmions with topological properties. However, the counterparts in electrical polarized materials are less studied and thus urgently needed, since electric dipoles are usually aligned collinearly in most ferroelectrics/antiferroelectrics. Molecular crystals with electric dipoles provide a rich ore to explore the noncollinear polarity. Here we report an organic salt (H2Dabco)BrClO4 (H2Dabco = N,N'-1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium) that shows a transition between the ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases. Based on experimental characterizations and ab initio calculations, it is found that its electric dipoles present nontrivial noncollinear textures with $60^\circ$-twisting angle between the neighbours. Then the ferroelectric-antiferroelectric transition can be understood as the coding of twisting angle sequence. Our study reveals the unique science of noncollinear electric polarity.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Material Property Predictions: elastic constant tensor prediction and materials design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate prediction of material properties is critical for advancing materials design and applications. The rapid-evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents a new opportunity for material property predictions, complementing experimental measurements and multi-scale computational methods. We focus on predicting the elastic constant tensor, as a case study, and develop domain-specific LLMs for predicting elastic constants and for materials discovery. The proposed ElaTBot LLM enables simultaneous prediction of elastic constant tensors, bulk modulus at finite temperatures, and the generation of new materials with targeted properties. Moreover, the capabilities of ElaTBot are further enhanced by integrating with general LLMs (GPT-4o) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for prediction. A specialized variant, ElaTBot-DFT, designed for 0 K elastic constant tensor prediction, reduces the prediction errors by 33.1% compared with domain-specific, material science LLMs (Darwin) trained on the same dataset. This natural language-based approach lowers the barriers to computational materials science and highlights the broader potential of LLMs for material property predictions and inverse design.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Insights into Metallic Doping Effects on Yttrium {10-10} Grain Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yttrium and its alloys are promising materials for high-tech applications, particularly in aerospace and nuclear reactors. The doping of metallic elements at grain boundaries can significantly influence the stability, strength, and mechanical properties of these materials; however, studies on solute segregation effects in Y-based alloys remain scarce. To address this gap, we employs first-principles calculations to systematically examine the effects of doping with 34 metallic elements on the properties of a highly symmetric twin grain boundary in yttrium. All solute elements exhibit a tendency to segregate to regions near the grain boundary, driven by segregation energy.energy barriers influence these elements to prefer segregation positions farther from the grain boundary line. the strengthening energy calculations reveal that all dopant elements enhance grain boundary strength when located near the boundary. For grain boundary energy and solubility trends, elements within the same transition metal group across different periods display consistent behaviors. And considering grain boundary energy effects, we identify 11 elements (Al, Zn, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, Sn, Ir, Pt, Au, Hg) that preferentially segregate near the grain boundary, where they contribute to grain boundary strengthening and enhanced stability. By decomposing the strengthening energy into mechanical, chemical, and vacancy formation components, chemical contribution is the primary factor in strengthening, while the mechanical contribution of transition metals correlates with changes in the Voronoi volume and relative atomic radius of the solute. The density of states analysis indicates that increased grain boundary stability arises mainly from hybridization between solute d orbitals and yttrium, leading to more stable electronic states. This study provides theoretical guidance for optimizing metallic dopants in Y-based alloys.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Quantum Effects on Proton Diffusivity in Perovskite Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, the nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) on proton diffusivity in oxides were evaluated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the quantum thermal bath (QTB) based on the Langevin dynamics. We employed the proton diffusion in barium zirconate (BaZrO3) with the cubic perovskite structure as the model system, in which protons migrate by rotation around single oxide ions and hopping between adjacent oxide ions. MD simulations with the standard classical thermal bath (CTB) and phonon calculations were also conducted to verify the conventionally used classical harmonic transition state theory (classical h-TST), in which the transition state theory (TST), the harmonic approximation, and the classical approximation are assumed. As a result, the h-TST are reasonable for the proton rotation, while significantly overestimate the activation energy and the pre-exponential factor of the jump frequency for the proton hopping. Furthermore, the classical approximation makes the proton jump frequencies close to linear in the Arrhenius plots, which should actually be nonlinear by the NQEs in the temperature range of 500-2000 K. This suggests the necessity of the treatment beyond the classical h-TST for accurate evaluation of the proton diffusivity in oxides even in the intermediate temperature range (573-873 K).</description>

      <title>Emergent surface multiferroicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the surface of a centrosymmetric, collinear, compensated antiferromagnet, which hosts bulk ferroically ordered magnetic octupoles, exhibits a linear magnetoelectric effect, a net magnetization, and a net electric dipole moment. Thus, the surface satisfies all the conditions of a multiferroic, in striking contrast to the bulk, which is neither polar nor exhibits any net magnetization or linear magnetoelectric response. Of particular interest is the case of non-relativistic $d$-wave spin split antiferromagnets, in which the bulk magnetic octupoles and consequently the surface multiferroicity exist even without spin-orbit interaction. We illustrate our findings using first-principles calculations, taking FeF$_2$ as an example material. Our work underscores the bulk-boundary correspondence in these unconventional antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>How to Recognize Clustering of Luminescent Defects in Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are a promising material platform for near-infrared in-vivo imaging, optical sensing, and single-photon emission at telecommunication wavelengths. The functionalization of SWCNTs with luminescent defects can lead to significantly enhanced photoluminescence (PL) properties due to efficient trapping of highly mobile excitons and red-shifted emission from these trap states. Among the most studied luminescent defect types are oxygen and aryl defects that have largely similar optical properties. So far, no direct comparison between SWCNTs functionalized with oxygen and aryl defects under identical conditions has been performed. Here, we employ a combination of spectroscopic techniques to quantify the number of defects, their distribution along the nanotubes and thus their exciton trapping efficiencies. The different slopes of Raman D/G+ ratios versus calculated defect densities from PL quantum yield measurements indicate substantial dissimilarities between oxygen and aryl defects. Supported by statistical analysis of single-nanotube PL spectra at cryogenic temperatures it reveals clustering of oxygen defects. The clustering of 2-3 oxygen defects, which act as a single exciton trap, occurs irrespective of the functionalization method and thus enables the use of simple equations to determine the density of oxygen defects and oxygen defect clusters in SWCNTs based on standard Raman spectroscopy. The presented analytical approach is a versatile and sensitive tool to study defect distribution and clustering in SWCNTs and can be applied to any new functionalization method.</description>

      <title>Vanishing conductivity-like Gilbert damping in mirror-symmetric van der Waals ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnetic materials has significantly expanded the realm of magnetic materials and enabled innovative control techniques such as gating and stacking. The dynamical behavior of magnetization is profoundly influenced by the Gilbert damping parameter, a crucial factor for enhancing the speed of magnetic switching and reducing the energy consumption of magnetic devices. Despite its importance, the understanding of Gilbert damping in van der Waals ferromagnets remains limited, impeding their technological applications. Here we present a theoretical calculation of Gilbert damping in two-dimensional van der Waals metals, focusing on Fe3GaTe2 and Fe3GeTe2 as model systems. We discover that mirror symmetry prohibits intraband contributions, resulting in disappearance of conductivity-like damping. Consequently, at low temperatures, the Gilbert damping in single-layer Fe3GaTe2 and Fe3GeTe2 is remarkably low when the magnetization is perpendicular to the atomic layer, but it increases substantially when the magnetization is reoriented into the atomic plane. Furthermore, topological nodal lines, also protected by mirror symmetry, contribute significantly to damping mediated by interband transitions and can be effectively modulated by adjusting the Fermi level. Our findings elucidate the distinctive characteristics of Gilbert damping in two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnets, providing valuable insights for the design and optimization of low-dimensional spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Accurate and efficient localized basis sets for two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles density functional theory (DFT) codes which employ a localized basis offer advantages over those which use plane-wave bases, such as better scaling with system size and better suitability to low-dimensional systems. The trade-off is that care must be taken in order to generate a good localized basis set which is efficient and accurate in a variety of environments. Here we develop and make freely available optimized local basis sets for two common two-dimensional (2D) materials, graphene and hexagonal boron nitride, for the \siesta DFT code. Each basis set is benchmarked against the \abinit plane-wave code, using the same pseudopotentials and exchange-correlation functionals. We find that a significant improvement is obtained by including the $l+2$ polarization orbitals ($4f$) to the basis set, which greatly improves angular flexibility. The optimized basis sets yield much better agreement with plane-wave calculations for key features of the physical system, including total energy, lattice constant and cohesive energy. The optimized basis sets also result in a speedup of the calculations with respect to the non-optimized, native choices.</description>

      <title>A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</description>

      <title>Reward driven workflows for unsupervised explainable analysis of phases and ferroic variants from atomically resolved imaging data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid progress in aberration corrected electron microscopy necessitates development of robust methods for the identification of phases, ferroic variants, and other pertinent aspects of materials structure from imaging data. While unsupervised methods for clustering and classification are widely used for these tasks, their performance can be sensitive to hyperparameter selection in the analysis workflow. In this study, we explore the effects of descriptors and hyperparameters on the capability of unsupervised ML methods to distill local structural information, exemplified by discovery of polarization and lattice distortion in Sm doped BiFeO3 (BFO) thin films. We demonstrate that a reward-driven approach can be used to optimize these key hyperparameters across the full workflow, where rewards were designed to reflect domain wall continuity and straightness, ensuring that the analysis aligns with the material's physical behavior. This approach allows us to discover local descriptors that are best aligned with the specific physical behavior, providing insight into the fundamental physics of materials. We further extend the reward driven workflows to disentangle structural factors of variation via optimized variational autoencoder (VAE). Finally, the importance of well-defined rewards was explored as a quantifiable measure of success of the workflow.</description>

      <title>Crystal Hypergraph Convolutional Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph representations of solid state materials that encode only interatomic distance lack geometrical resolution, resulting in degenerate representations that may map distinct structures to equivalent graphs. Here we propose a hypergraph representation scheme for materials that allows for the association of higher-order geometrical information with hyperedges. Hyperedges generalize edges to connected sets of more than two nodes, and may be used to represent triplets and local environments of atoms in materials. This generalization of edges requires a different approach in graph convolution, three of which are developed in this paper. Results presented here focus on the improved performance of models based on both pair-wise edges and local environment hyperedges. These results demonstrate that hypergraphs are an effective method for incorporating geometrical information in material representations.</description>

Abstract: Ultrathin magnetic films on heavy metal substrates with strong spin-orbit coupling provide versatile platforms for exploring novel spin textures. So far, structurally open fcc(110) substrates remain largely terra incognita. Here, we stabilize a metastable, unreconstructed Ir(110)-$(1 \times 1)$ surface supporting two layers of Fe. Combining spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy and ab initio calculations, we reveal a right-handed N\'eel-type spin spiral along the [$\overline{1}10$] crystallographic direction with a period of 1.27~nm as the magnetic ground state. Our analysis reveals this spiral is of the Yoshimori type, i.e., driven by frustrated Heisenberg interactions, with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction determining its cycloidal nature and handedness.</description>

      <title>Effects of Neutron Radiation on the Thermal Conductivity of Highly Oriented Pyrolitic Graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly Ordered Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG) has been extensively researched due to its chemical and physical properties that make it suitable for applications in several technologies. Its high thermal conductivity makes HOPG an excellent heat sink, a crucial characteristic for manufacturing targets used in nuclear reactions, such as those proposed by the NUMEN project. However, when subjected to different radiation sources, this material undergoes changes in its crystalline structure, which alters its intended functionality. This study examined HOPG sheets before and after exposure to a 14 MeV neutron beam. Morphological and crystallographic analyses reveal that even minor disruptions in the high atomic ordering result in modifications to its thermal properties. The results of this study are essential to establish the survival time of the HOPG used as thermal interface material to improve heat dissipation of a nuclear target to be bombarded by an intense high-energy heavy-ion beam.</description>

      <title>Anti-chiral surface states and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger physics in rutile altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study surface states and domain wall bound states in altermagnets using a rutile-lattice tight-binding model of electrons coupled to a N\'eel order. We discover that two symmetry-protected Weyl nodal lines in the bulk band structure can give rise to unconventional anti-chiral surface states -- surface states from opposite surfaces propagate in a \emph{parallel} manner, as opposed to the anti-parallel manner for the more conventional chiral surface states. We also find that the anti-chiral surface states can be turned into chiral surface states upon changing the surface termination. The origin of the surface states, the dependence on the surface termination, and key features of domain wall bound states are explained using a map from the altermagnet to a family of a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) chain and the associated bulk-boundary correspondence. Our work reveals rutile altermagnets as a promising candidate among very few quantum materials that can support anti-chiral surface states.</description>

      <title>Magnetic ground state and excitations in mixed 3$d$-4$d$ quasi-1D spin-chain oxide Sr$_3$NiRhO$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement of spin and orbital degrees of freedom, via relativistic spin-orbit coupling, in 4$d$ transition metal oxides can give rise to a variety of novel quantum phases. A previous study of mixed 3$d$-4$d$ quasi-1D spin-chain oxide Sr$_3$NiRhO$_6$ using the magnetization measurements by Mohapatra et al. [Phys. Rev. B 75, 214422 (2007)] revealed a partially disordered antiferromagnetic (PDA) structure below 50 K [Mohapatra et al, Phys. Rev. B 75, 214422 (2007)]. We here report the magnetic ground state and spin-wave excitations in Sr$_3$NiRhO$_6$, using muon spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR), and neutron (elastic and inelastic) scattering techniques. Our neutron diffraction study reveals that in the magnetic structure of Sr$_3$NiRhO$_6$, Rh$^{4+}$ and Ni$^{2+}$ spins are aligned ferromagnetically in a spin-chain, with moments along the crystallographic $c$-axis. However, spin-chains are coupled antiferromanetically in the $ab$-plane. $\mu$SR reveals the presence of oscillations in the asymmetry-time spectra below 50 K, supporting the long-range magnetically ordered ground state. Our inelastic neutron scattering study reveals gapped quasi-1D magnetic excitations with a large ratio of gap to exchange interaction. The observed spin-wave spectrum could be well fitted with a ferromagnetic isotropic exchange model (with $J = 3.7 $ meV) and single ion anisotropy ($D=10$ meV) on the Ni$^{2+}$ site. The magnetic excitations survive up to 85 K, well above the magnetic ordering temperature of $\sim 50$ K, also indicating a quasi-1D nature of the magnetic interactions in Sr$_3$NiRhO$_6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Properties of layered superconductors can vary drastically when thinned down from bulk to monolayer, owing to the reduced dimensionality and weakened interlayer coupling. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), the inherent symmetry breaking effect in atomically thin crystals prompts novel states of matter, such as Ising superconductivity with an extraordinary in-plane upper critical field. Here, we demonstrate that two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity resembling those in atomic layers but with more fascinating behaviours can be realized in the bulk crystals of two new TMD-based superconductors Ba0.75ClTaS2 and Ba0.75ClTaSe2. They comprise an alternating stack of H-type TMD layers and Ba-Cl layers. In both materials, intrinsic 2D superconductivity develops below a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The upper critical field along ab plane exceeds the Pauli limit (Hp); in particular, Ba0.75ClTaSe2 exhibits an extremely high in plane Hc2 (14Hp) and a colossal superconducting anisotropy of 150. Moreover, the temperature-field phase diagram of Ba0.75ClTaSe2 under an in-plane magnetic field contains a large phase regime of vortex dissipation, which can be ascribed to the Josephson vortex motion, signifying an unprecedentedly strong fluctuation effect in TMD-based superconductors. Our results provide a new path towards the establishment of 2D superconductivity and novel exotic quantum phases in bulk crystals of TMD-based superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit many unexpected properties including two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity as the interlayer coupling being weakened upon either layer-number reduction or chemical intercalation. Here we report the realization of 2D superconductivity in the newly-synthesized niobium dichalcogenides-based bulk superlattices Ba$_{0.75}$ClNbS$_{2}$ and Ba$_{0.75}$ClNbSe$_{2}$, which consists of the alternating stacking of monolayer $H$-NbS$_{2}$ (or $H$-NbSe$_{2}$) and monolayer inorganic insulator spacer Ba$_{0.75}$Cl. Magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements show that both superlattices belong to type-II superconductor with $T_{c}$ of 1 K and 1.25 K, respectively. Intrinsic 2D superconductivity is confirmed for both compounds below a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition and a large anisotropy of the upper critical field. Furthermore, the upper critical field along $ab$ plane ($H_{c2}^{\parallel ab}$) exceeds the Pauli limit ($\mu_{0}H_{p}$) in Ba$_{0.75}$ClNbSe$_{2}$, highlighting the influence of spin-orbit interactions. Our results establish a generic method for realizing the 2D superconducting properties in bulk superlattice materials.</description>

      <title>Double Splay Nematic Order in Confined Polar Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate that when a ferroelectric nematic is confined between two glass plates coated with ionic polymers, a modulated phase emerges in a narrow temperature range between the nematic and ferroelectric nematic phases. This modulated phase emerges from the nematic phase in a continuous manner and then transforms into the ferroelectric nematic phase via a first-order transition upon cooling. Using optical microscopy, we provide compelling evidence that this modulated phase corresponds to the theoretically predicted double splay nematic phase. In this phase, splay deformations alternate in two orthogonal directions oriented at 45{\deg} to the substrate surfaces, creating a modulation wavelength that is twice the thickness of the cell. Our experiments with different ionic coatings reveal that only polymeric cationic coatings effectively promote the formation of this phase, highlighting the critical role of electrical screening. These findings not only confirm the existence of the double splay nematic phase but also provide insights into the distinctive topological defects of this phase in confined geometries.</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation with dissimilar quantum dots over a hybrid quantum network</title>

Abstract: Photonic quantum information processing in metropolitan quantum networks lays the foundation for cloud quantum computing [1, 2], secure communication [3, 4], and the realization of a global quantum internet [5, 6]. This paradigm shift requires on-demand and high-rate generation of flying qubits and their quantum state teleportation over long distances [7]. Despite the last decade has witnessed an impressive progress in the performances of deterministic photon sources [8-11], the exploitation of distinct quantum emitters to implement all-photonic quantum teleportation among distant parties has remained elusive. Here, we overcome this challenge by using dissimilar quantum dots whose electronic and optical properties are engineered by light-matter interaction [12], multi-axial strain [13] and magnetic fields [14] so as to make them suitable for the teleportation of polarization qubits. This is demonstrated in a hybrid quantum network harnessing both fiber connections and 270 m free-space optical link connecting two buildings of the University campus in the center of Rome. The protocol exploits GPS-assisted synchronization, ultra-fast single photon detectors as well as stabilization systems that compensate for atmospheric turbulence. The achieved teleportation state fidelity reaches up to 82+-1%, above the classical limit by more than 10 standard deviations. Our field demonstration of all-photonic quantum teleportation opens a new route to implement solid-state based quantum relays and builds the foundation for practical quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Disordered Hyperuniformity in Confined Fluids and Soft Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confinement can significantly alter fluid properties, offering potential for specific technological applications. However, achieving precise control over the structural complexity of confined fluids and soft matter remains challenging, as it often requires careful tuning of system parameters. In this study, we perform large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of a fluid confined in a slit pore, employing an interaction potential applicable to a broad range of soft matter. Confinement induces the fluid to form two-dimensional (2D) layers, each of which self-assembles into structures of varying complexity. Notably, we observe a suppression of large-scale density fluctuations-akin to crystals-within complex nontrivial fluid-like geometries, leading to the emergence of disordered hyperuniformity. We demonstrate that fluid properties can be precisely adjusted by modifying control parameters. This work provides a foundation for designing experimental protocols to regulate the structure of self-assembling materials, stabilize disordered hyperuniform structures, and facilitate the fabrication of 2D arrays with tailored complexity. Additionally, it offers a new perspective for analyzing biological monolayers, such as epithelial tissues.</description>

      <title>Step meandering: The balance between the potential well and the Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive and innovative exploration of how the surface potential energy landscape influences meander formation. Using the Vicinal Cellular Automaton model, which distinguishes surface diffusion from adatom incorporation into the crystal, the research delves into various factors affecting surface pattern dynamics. By isolating the diffusion process within a defined energy potential, the study provides a detailed analysis of how changes in the potential energy well and the barrier at the top of the step contribute to meander formation. Remarkably, the results reveal that the mere presence of a potential well at the step's bottom is sufficient to induce meandering. The role of the Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier on already-formed meanders is further investigated, and a mechanism for meander formation is proposed to clarify this process. The derived relation accurately captures the meander length patterns observed in the simulations. Ultimately, the findings demonstrate that the shape of the surface energy potential plays a pivotal role in determining surface pattern formation.</description>

      <title>Phase transition from Weyl to knotted semimetal using bi-circular laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fermi surface topology of a triple non-hermitian (NH) Weyl semimetal (WSM) driven by bi-circularly polarized light is presented in this study. A NH WSM in particular has remarkable outlines. Bi-circular light, however, modifies the symmetry features of non-hermitian triple Weyl and causes an unusual new kind of band swapping. We observe swapping between the imaginary bands (with or without exceptional degenaracies), which causes unique Fermi surfaces in the form of double rings and knots. This is something never discussed before phase transition between Weyl and knotted phases. We also discuss the corresponding changes in the Berry curvature as well.</description>

      <title>Low loss lumped-element inductors made from granular aluminum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lumped-element inductors are an integral component in the circuit QED toolbox. However, it is challenging to build inductors that are simultaneously compact, linear and low-loss with standard approaches that either rely on the geometric inductance of superconducting thin films or on the kinetic inductance of Josephson junctions arrays. In this work, we overcome this challenge by utilizing the high kinetic inductance offered by superconducting granular aluminum (grAl). We demonstrate lumped-element inductors with a few nH of inductance that are up to $100$ times more compact than inductors built from pure aluminum (Al). To characterize the properties of these linear inductors, we first report on the performance of lumped-element resonators built entirely out of grAl with sheet inductances varying from $30-320\,$pH/sq and self-Kerr non-linearities of $0.2-20\,\mathrm{Hz/photon}$. Further, we demonstrate ex-situ integration of these grAl inductors into hybrid resonators with Al or tantalum (Ta) capacitor electrodes without increasing total internal losses. Interestingly, the measured internal quality factors systematically decrease with increasing room-temperature resistivity of the grAl film for all devices, indicating a trade-off between compactness and internal loss. For our lowest resistivity grAl films, we measure quality factors reaching $3.5 \times 10^6$ for the all-grAl devices and $4.5 \times 10^6$ for the hybrid grAl/Ta devices, similar to state-of-the-art quantum circuits. Our loss analysis suggests that the surface loss factor of grAl is similar to that of pure Al for our lowest resistivity films, while the increasing losses with resistivity could be explained by increasing conductor loss in the grAl film.</description>

      <title>Columnar grain boundaries are the weakest link in hard coatings: Insights from micro-cantilever testing with bridge notches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of columnar grain boundaries on the fracture toughness was investigated using micro-cantilever fracture testing with a bridge notch, and a unique hard coating consisting of two distinct microstructures: one with columnar grains and another with an epitaxial layer. The bridge-failure sequence qualitatively demonstrated the lower fracture toughness at the columnar-grained structure. Quantitatively, the load drops measured at bridge-failure also revealed a significant decrease in fracture toughness due to grain boundaries. Specifically, the fracture toughness decreased by around 30%, from 4.1 +/- 0.4 MPa m1/2 for epitaxial microstructure to 3.0 +/- 0.3 MPa m1/2 for columnar-grained structure. The fracture toughness of columnar-grained structure is 3.0 +/- 0.2 MPa m1/2 perpendicular to the growth direction higher than 2.7 +/- 0.1 MPa m1/2 along it. These findings suggest that future optimization of hard coatings should focus on grain boundary toughening, and the present toolbox proposes suitable techniques for such microstructure optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An intense femtosecond-laser excitation of a solid induces highly nonthermal conditions. In materials like silicon, laser-induced bond-softening leads to a highly incoherent ionic motion and eventually nonthermal melting. But is this outcome an inevitable consequence, or can it be controlled? Here, we performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of crystalline silicon after timed multiple femtosecond-laser pulse excitations with fluence above the nonthermal melting threshold. Our results demonstrate an excitation mechanism that pauses nonthermal melting and creates a metastable state instead, with an electronic structure similar to the ground state. This mechanism can be generalized to other materials, potentially enabling structural and/or electronic transitions to metastable phases in the high-excitation regime. In addition, our approach could be used to switch off nonthermal contributions in experiments, allowing reliable electron-phonon coupling constants to be obtained more easily.</description>

      <title>Construction of Multi-Dimensional Functions for Optimization of Additive-Manufacturing Process Parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The authors present a generic framework for the parameter optimization of additive manufacturing (AM) processes, one tailored to a high-throughput experimental methodology (HTEM). Given the large number of parameters, which impact the quality of AM-metallic components, the authors advocate for partitioning the AM parameter set into stages (tiers), based on their relative importance, modeling one tier at a time until successful, and then systematically expanding the framework. The authors demonstrate how the construction of multi-dimensional functions, based on neural networks (NN), can be applied to successfully model relative densities and Rockwell hardness obtained from HTEM testing of the Inconel 718 superalloy fabricated, using a powder-bed approach. The authors analyze the input data set, assess its suitability for predictions, and show how to optimize the framework for the multi-dimensional functional construction, such as to obtain the highest degree of fit with the input data set. The authors also compare and contrast the NN-based multi-dimensional functional construction to multi-variate linear regression, to polynomial regression, and to Gaussian process regression (GPR), highlight similarity between the NN-based multi-dimensional functional construction and the GPR, and offer insights into the suitability of each of these methods for the data set and the application at hand. In terms of the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, a relatively simple, single-layer NN with 5 or 10 nodes outperforms multi-variate linear regression, 2nd-order polynomial regression, and GPR for the primary Inconel 718 HTEM data set studied. The novelty of the research work entails the versatile and scalable NN framework presented, suitable for use in conjunction with HTEM, for the AM parameter optimization of superalloys, and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fundamental properties of spontaneous and piezo polarization are reformulated and critically reviewed. It was demonstrated that Landau definition of polarization as a dipole density could be used to the infinite systems. The difference between the bulk polarization and surface polarity are distinguished thus creating clear identification of both components. The local model of spontaneous polarization was created and used to calculate spontaneous polarization as the electric dipole density. It was shown that the proposed local model correctly predicts c-axis spontaneous polarization values of the nitride wurtzite semiconductors. It was also shown that the proposed model predicts zero polarization in the plane perpendicular to the c-axis, in accordance with symmetry requirements. In addition, the model results are in accordance with polarization equal to zero for zinc blende lattice. These data confirm the basic correctness of the proposed model. The spontaneous polarization values obtained for all wurtzite III nitrides (BN, AlN, GaN and InN) are in basic agreement with the earlier calculations using Berry phase and slab models of Bernardini et al. {Bernardini et al. Phys Rev B 56 (2001) R10024 &amp; 63 (2001) 193201} but not with Dreyer et al. {Dreyer et al. Phys. Rev X 6 (2016) 021038}. Wurtzite nitride superlattices ab initio calculations were performed to derive polarization-induced fields in the coherently strained lattices showing good agreement with the polarization values. The strained superlattice data were used to determine the piezoelectric parameters of wurtzite nitrides obtaining the values that were in basic agreement with the earlier data. Zinc blende superlattices were also modeled using ab initio calculations showing results that are in agreement with the absence of polarization of all nitrides in zinc blende symmetry.</description>

      <title>The initial stages of silver fluorination: a scanning tunneling microscopy investigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-STM) to characterize the early stages of silver fluorination. On Ag(100), we observe only one adsorbate species, which shows a bias-dependent STM topography. Notably, at negative bias voltages, $V_{\rm B}&lt;0$, the apparent shape can be described as a round protrusion surrounded by a moat-like depression (sombrero). As the voltage increases, the apparent shape changes, eventually evolving into a round depression. From the STM images, we determine the adsorption site to be the hollow position. On Ag(110) we find adsorbates with three distinct STM topographies. One type exhibits the same shape change with $V_{\rm B}$ as observed on Ag(100), that is, from a sombrero shape to a round depression as the voltage changes from negative to positive values; the other two types are observed as round depressions regardless of $V_{\rm B}$. From the STM images, we find the three adsorbates to be sitting on the short-bridge, hollow and top position on the Ag(110) surface, with a relative abundance of 60\%, 35\% and 5\%.</description>

Abstract: It is quite intriguing to investigate the transition from a topological insulator (TI) phase to topological crystalline insulator (TCI) phase in a material as the latter has an advantage over the former in controlled device applications. This work investigates the existence of this dual topological behavior in Sn-based ternary chalcogenides family PbSnX2 (X=S, Se, Te) under the hydrostatic pressure using first-principles approach. These materials are dynamically sTABLE at ambient and elevated pressure conditions up to which the topological phase transitions (TPTs) are studied. This family have a topologically trivial ground state with direct band gap values 0.338 eV, 0.183 eV and 0.217 eV for PbSnS2, PbSnSe2 and PbSnTe2, respectively. The first TPT i.e., TI phase for these materials is observed, under the effect of external pressure of 5 GPa, 2.5 GPa and 3.5 GPa, with a single band inversion at F-point in the bulk band structure and an odd number of Dirac cones along the (111) surface. A further increase in pressure to 5.5 GPa, 3 GPa and 4 GPa results in another band inversion at {\Gamma}-point and an even number of Dirac cones along the (111) plane. These even number of band inversions suggest that (\(\bar{1}2\bar{1}\)) surface has mirror symmetry around (\(\bar{1}0\bar{1}\)) plane and hence, the TCI phase is obtained. This TCI phase is further corroborated with even value of mirror Chern number calculated using winding of Wannier charge centers.</description>

      <title>Semi-Dirac fermions in hexagonal close-packed cadmium</title>

Abstract: Semi-Dirac fermions are massless in one direction and massive in the perpendicular directions. Such quasiparticles have been proposed in various contexts in condensed matter. Using first principles calculations, we identify a pair of semi-Dirac bands in the electronic structure of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) cadmium, which keep their linear out-of-plane and quadratic inplane dispersions up to the Fermi level. We demonstrate that the dichotomy between the linear and quadratic dispersions is driven by an orientation-sensitive hybridization between the $s$ and $p_z$ orbitals. The upper semi-Dirac band produces a lens-shaped nonellipsoidal Fermi sheet whose cross-section area has a $k$-dependence that is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured period of Sondheimer oscillations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider stationary states of the SSH model for infinite polyacetylene chains that are homoclinic or heteroclinic connections between two-periodic dimerized states. We prove that such connections converge exponentially fast to the corresponding asymptotic periodic states.</description>

      <title>NEP-MB-pol: A unified machine-learned framework for fast and accurate prediction of water's thermodynamic and transport properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Water's unique hydrogen-bonding network and anomalous properties pose significant challenges for accurately modeling its structural, thermodynamic, and transport behavior across varied conditions. Although machine-learned potentials have advanced the prediction of individual properties, a unified computational framework capable of simultaneously capturing water's complex and subtle properties with high accuracy has remained elusive. Here, we address this challenge by introducing NEP-MB-pol, a highly accurate and efficient neuroevolution potential (NEP) trained on extensive many-body polarization (MB-pol) reference data approaching coupled-cluster-level accuracy, combined with path-integral molecular dynamics and quantum-correction techniques to incorporate nuclear quantum effects. This NEP-MB-pol framework reproduces experimentally measured structural, thermodynamic, and transport properties of water across a broad temperature range, achieving simultaneous, fast, and accurate prediction of self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. Our approach provides a unified and robust tool for exploring thermodynamic and transport properties of water under diverse conditions, with significant potential for broader applications across research fields.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Sondheimer oscillations of conductivity in thin cadmium crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decades ago, Sondheimer discovered that the electric conductivity of metallic crystals hosting ballistic electrons oscillates with magnetic field. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field and the period proportional to the sample thickness, have been understood in a semi-classical framework. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thickness varying between 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m. When the magnetic field is sufficiently large or the sample sufficiently thick, the amplitude of oscillation falls off as $B^{-4}$ as previously reported. In contrast, the ten first oscillations follow a $B^{-2.5}e^{-B/B_0}$ field dependence and their amplitude is set by the quantum of conductance, the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. We demonstrate that they are beyond the semi-classical picture, as the exponential prefactor indicates quantum tunneling between distinct quantum states. We draw a picture of these quantum oscillations, in which the linear dispersion of the semi-Dirac band in the cadmium plays a crucial role. The oscillations arise by the intersection between the lowest Landau tube and flat toroids on the Fermi surface induced by confinement. Positive and negative corrections to semi-classical magneto-conductance can occur by alternation between destructive and constructive interference in phase-coherent helical states. The quantum limit of Sondheimer oscillations emerges as another manifestation of Aharanov-Bohm flux quantization.</description>
