      <title>Mixed (Regular and Chaotic) Dynamics under the Channeling of the High Energy Positrons in [100] Direction of the Silicon Crystal and Podolskiy-Narimanov Distribution</title>

Abstract: The character of motion (regular or chaotic) on the quantum level manifests itself in the statistics of the set of the system's energy levels. The completely regular case generates the sequence of the levels with exponential (Poisson) level spacing distribution; the completely chaotic one -- with Wigner distribution. The most interesting case is the co-existence of the regular and chaotic motion domains in the phase space of the system under consideration. The assumption of independent generation of two level sequencies by one chaotic domain and by all regular domains leads to Berry--Robnik distribution. However, the presence of the chaotic motion domain in the phase space affects the levels produced by the regular domains via the so-called chaos-assisted tunneling (CAT) that leads to Podolskiy--Narimanov distribution of the level spacings. This distribution needs the mean amplitude of the tunnel transition and the relative contribution of the regular domains to the mean level density as the parameters. Using their estimations for the transverse motion of the high energy positrons channeling near [100] direction in the silicon crystal we found that Podolskiy--Narimanov distribution demonstrates the best agreement with the level spacing distribution.</description>

      <title>Luminosity and Beam-Induced Background Studies for the Cool Copper Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A high-energy electron-positron collider has been widely recognized by the particle physics community to be the next crucial step for detailed studies of the Higgs boson and other fundamental particles and processes. Several proposals for such colliders, either linear or circular, are currently under evaluation. Any such collider will be required to reach high lumimosities, in order to collect enough data at a reasonable time scale, while at the same time coping with high rates of background particles produced from beam-beam interactions during the collisions. In this paper, we analyze the luminosity and beam-beam interaction characteristics of the Cool Copper Collider (C$^3$) and perform a comparison with other linear collider proposals. We conclude that C$^3$ can reach the same or higher collision rates as the other proposals, without having to cope with higher beam-induced background fluxes. Thus, C$^3$ emerges as an attractive option for a future electron-positron collider, benefiting from the collective advancements in beam delivery and final focus system technologies developed by other linear collider initiatives.</description>
