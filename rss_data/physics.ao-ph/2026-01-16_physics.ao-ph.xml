      <title>On the geometry of aggregate snowflakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Snowflakes play a crucial role in weather and climate. A significant portion of precipitation that reaches the surface originates as ice, even when it ultimately falls as rain. Contrary to the popular image of symmetric, dendritic crystals, most large snowflakes are irregular aggregates formed through the collision of primary ice crystals, such as hexagonal plates, columns, and dendrites. These aggregates exhibit complex, fractal-like structures, particularly at large sizes. Despite this structural complexity, each aggregate snowflake is unique, with properties that vary significantly around the mean - variability that is typically neglected in weather and climate models. Using a physically based aggregation model, we generate millions of synthetic snowflakes to investigate their geometric properties. The resulting dataset reveals that, for a given monomer number (cluster size) and mass, the maximum dimension follows approximately a lognormal distribution. We present a parameterization of aggregate geometry that captures key statistical properties, including maximum dimension, aspect ratio, cross-sectional area, and their joint correlations. This formulation enables a stochastic representation of aggregate snowflakes in Lagrangian particle models. Incorporating this variability improves the realism of simulated fall velocities, enhances growth rates by aggregation, and broadens Doppler radar spectra in closer agreement with observations.</description>

      <title>Submesoscale and boundary layer turbulence under mesoscale forcing in the upper ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction among quasi-geostrophic mesoscale eddies, submesoscale fronts, and boundary layer turbulence (BLT) is a central problem in upper ocean dynamics. We investigate these multiscale dynamics using a novel large-eddy simulation on a 100km-scale domain with meter-scale resolution. The simulation resolves BLT energized by uniform surface wind and convective forcing. A front interacts with BLT within a prescribed, spatially inhomogeneous mesoscale eddy field, representing a canonical eddy quadrupole. Using a triple flow decomposition, we analyze the dynamic coupling and kinetic energy budgets among the large-scale field, submesoscale field, and the resolved BLT. Our analysis reveals significant heterogeneity in the structure and intensity of submesoscales and BLT under varying mesoscale forcing. Turbulent kinetic energy and production rates can vary by an order of magnitude along the front, creating distinct turbulent hotspots whose locations are tied to the underlying large-scale flow. The region under stronger mesoscale convergence holds stronger horizontal and vertical geostrophic shear productions for BLT, and stronger self-production and BLT-destruction for submesoscales. In contrast, the region under dominant mesoscale divergence holds dramatic distortion of the front isotherm, along with dominant submesoscale vertical buoyancy production and self-destruction. These results provide a direct characterization of BLT and submesoscales in the ocean mixed layer modulated by a mesoscale eddy field, which can better inform future parameterization developments.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry of the rotating shallow water model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rotating shallow water equations (RSWE) are a mainstay of atmospheric and oceanic modeling, and their wave dynamics has close analogues in settings ranging from two-dimensional electron gases to active-matter fluids. While recent work has emphasized the topological character of RSWE wave bands, here we develop a complementary quantum-geometric description by computing the full quantum geometric tensor (QGT) for the linearized RSWE on an $f$-plane. The QGT unifies two pieces of band geometry: its real part defines a metric that quantifies how rapidly wave polarization changes with parameters, while its imaginary part is the Berry curvature that controls geometric phases and topological invariants. We obtain compact, symmetry-guided expressions for all three bands, highlighting the transverse structure of the metric and the monopole-like Berry curvature that yields Chern numbers for the Poincar\'e bands. Finally, we describe a feasible route to probing this geometry in rotating-tank experiments via weak, time-periodic parametric driving.</description>
