      <title>Compressive Feature Selection for Remote Visual Multi-Task Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep models produce a number of features in each internal layer. A key problem in applications such as feature compression for remote inference is determining how important each feature is for the task(s) performed by the model. The problem is especially challenging in the case of multi-task inference, where the same feature may carry different importance for different tasks. In this paper, we examine how effective is mutual information (MI) between a feature and a model's task output as a measure of the feature's importance for that task. Experiments involving hard selection and soft selection (unequal compression) based on MI are carried out to compare the MI-based method with alternative approaches. Multi-objective analysis is provided to offer further insight.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Image Privacy in Semantic Communication over Wiretap Channels leveraging Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) enhances transmission efficiency by sending only task-relevant information compared to traditional methods. However, transmitting semantic-rich data over insecure or public channels poses security and privacy risks. This paper addresses the privacy problem of transmitting images over wiretap channels and proposes a novel SemCom approach ensuring privacy through a differential privacy (DP)-based image protection and deprotection mechanism. The method utilizes the GAN inversion technique to extract disentangled semantic features and applies a DP mechanism to protect sensitive features within the extracted semantic information. To address the non-invertibility of DP, we introduce two neural networks to approximate the DP application and removal processes, offering a privacy protection level close to that by the original DP process. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our method in preventing eavesdroppers from obtaining sensitive information while maintaining high-fidelity image reconstruction at the legitimate receiver.</description>

      <title>Deep Blur Multi-Model (DeepBlurMM) -- a strategy to mitigate the impact of image blur on deep learning model performance in histopathology image analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-based analysis of histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) is central in computational pathology. However, image quality can impact model performance. Here, we investigate to what extent unsharp areas of WSIs impact deep convolutional neural network classification performance. We propose a multi-model approach, i.e. DeepBlurMM, to alleviate the impact of unsharp image areas and improve the model performance. DeepBlurMM uses the sigma cut-offs to determine the most suitable model for predicting tiles with various levels of blurring within a single WSI, where sigma is the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution. Specifically, the cut-offs categorise the tiles into sharp or slight blur, moderate blur, and high blur. Each blur level has a corresponding model to be selected for tile-level predictions. Throughout the simulation study, we demonstrated the application of DeepBlurMM in a binary classification task for breast cancer Nottingham Histological Grade 1 vs 3. Performance, evaluated over 5-fold cross-validation, showed that DeepBlurMM outperformed the base model under moderate blur and mixed blur conditions. Unsharp image tiles (local blurriness) at prediction time reduced model performance. The proposed multi-model approach improved performance under some conditions, with the potential to improve quality in both research and clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Large coordinate kernel attention network for lightweight image super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-scale receptive field and large kernel attention (LKA) module have been shown to significantly improve performance in the lightweight image super-resolution task. However, existing lightweight super-resolution (SR) methods seldom pay attention to designing efficient building block with multi-scale receptive field for local modeling, and their LKA modules face a quadratic increase in computational and memory footprints as the convolutional kernel size increases. To address the first issue, we propose the multi-scale blueprint separable convolutions (MBSConv) as highly efficient building block with multi-scale receptive field, it can focus on the learning for the multi-scale information which is a vital component of discriminative representation. As for the second issue, we revisit the key properties of LKA in which we find that the adjacent direct interaction of local information and long-distance dependencies is crucial to provide remarkable performance. Thus, taking this into account and in order to mitigate the complexity of LKA, we propose a large coordinate kernel attention (LCKA) module which decomposes the 2D convolutional kernels of the depth-wise convolutional layers in LKA into horizontal and vertical 1-D kernels. LCKA enables the adjacent direct interaction of local information and long-distance dependencies not only in the horizontal direction but also in the vertical. Besides, LCKA allows for the direct use of extremely large kernels in the depth-wise convolutional layers to capture more contextual information, which helps to significantly improve the reconstruction performance, and it incurs lower computational complexity and memory footprints. Integrating MBSConv and LCKA, we propose a large coordinate kernel attention network (LCAN).</description>

      <title>M$^4$oE: A Foundation Model for Medical Multimodal Image Segmentation with Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical imaging data is inherently heterogeneous across different modalities and clinical centers, posing unique challenges for developing generalizable foundation models. Conventional entails training distinct models per dataset or using a shared encoder with modality-specific decoders. However, these approaches incur heavy computational overheads and suffer from poor scalability. To address these limitations, we propose the Medical Multimodal Mixture of Experts (M$^4$oE) framework, leveraging the SwinUNet architecture. Specifically, M$^4$oE comprises modality-specific experts; each separately initialized to learn features encoding domain knowledge. Subsequently, a gating network is integrated during fine-tuning to modulate each expert's contribution to the collective predictions dynamically. This enhances model interpretability and generalization ability while retaining expertise specialization. Simultaneously, the M$^4$oE architecture amplifies the model's parallel processing capabilities, and it also ensures the model's adaptation to new modalities with ease. Experiments across three modalities reveal that M$^4$oE can achieve 3.45% over STU-Net-L, 5.11% over MED3D, and 11.93% over SAM-Med2D across the MICCAI FLARE22, AMOS2022, and ATLAS2023 datasets. Moreover, M$^4$oE showcases a significant reduction in training duration with 7 hours less while maintaining a parameter count that is only 30% of its compared methods.

      <title>Perception- and Fidelity-aware Reduced-Reference Super-Resolution Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of image super-resolution (SR) algorithms, how to evaluate the quality of generated SR images has become an urgent task. Although full-reference methods perform well in SR image quality assessment (SR-IQA), their reliance on high-resolution (HR) images limits their practical applicability. Leveraging available reconstruction information as much as possible for SR-IQA, such as low-resolution (LR) images and the scale factors, is a promising way to enhance assessment performance for SR-IQA without HR for reference. In this letter, we attempt to evaluate the perceptual quality and reconstruction fidelity of SR images considering LR images and scale factors. Specifically, we propose a novel dual-branch reduced-reference SR-IQA network, \ie, Perception- and Fidelity-aware SR-IQA (PFIQA). The perception-aware branch evaluates the perceptual quality of SR images by leveraging the merits of global modeling of Vision Transformer (ViT) and local relation of ResNet, and incorporating the scale factor to enable comprehensive visual perception. Meanwhile, the fidelity-aware branch assesses the reconstruction fidelity between LR and SR images through their visual perception. The combination of the two branches substantially aligns with the human visual system, enabling a comprehensive SR image evaluation. Experimental results indicate that our PFIQA outperforms current state-of-the-art models across three widely-used SR-IQA benchmarks. Notably, PFIQA excels in assessing the quality of real-world SR images.</description>

      <title>MMFusion: Multi-modality Diffusion Model for Lymph Node Metastasis Diagnosis in Esophageal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Esophageal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide and ranks sixth in cancer-related mortality. Accurate computer-assisted diagnosis of cancer progression can help physicians effectively customize personalized treatment plans. Currently, CT-based cancer diagnosis methods have received much attention for their comprehensive ability to examine patients' conditions. However, multi-modal based methods may likely introduce information redundancy, leading to underperformance. In addition, efficient and effective interactions between multi-modal representations need to be further explored, lacking insightful exploration of prognostic correlation in multi-modality features. In this work, we introduce a multi-modal heterogeneous graph-based conditional feature-guided diffusion model for lymph node metastasis diagnosis based on CT images as well as clinical measurements and radiomics data. To explore the intricate relationships between multi-modal features, we construct a heterogeneous graph. Following this, a conditional feature-guided diffusion approach is applied to eliminate information redundancy. Moreover, we propose a masked relational representation learning strategy, aiming to uncover the latent prognostic correlations and priorities of primary tumor and lymph node image representations. Various experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/wuchengyu123/MMFusion.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Decouple Learning for Image Compression Artifacts Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the benefit of deep learning techniques, recent researches have made significant progress in image compression artifacts reduction. Despite their improved performances, prevailing methods only focus on learning a mapping from the compressed image to the original one but ignore the intrinsic attributes of the given compressed images, which greatly harms the performance of downstream parsing tasks. Different from these methods, we propose to decouple the intrinsic attributes into two complementary features for artifacts reduction,ie, the compression-insensitive features to regularize the high-level semantic representations during training and the compression-sensitive features to be aware of the compression degree. To achieve this, we first employ adversarial training to regularize the compressed and original encoded features for retaining high-level semantics, and we then develop the compression quality-aware feature encoder for compression-sensitive features. Based on these dual complementary features, we propose a Dual Awareness Guidance Network (DAGN) to utilize these awareness features as transformation guidance during the decoding phase. In our proposed DAGN, we develop a cross-feature fusion module to maintain the consistency of compression-insensitive features by fusing compression-insensitive features into the artifacts reduction baseline. Our method achieves an average 2.06 dB PSNR gains on BSD500, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, and only requires 29.7 ms to process one image on BSD500. Besides, the experimental results on LIVE1 and LIU4K also demonstrate the efficiency, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed method in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and downstream machine vision tasks.</description>

      <title>Learned Scanpaths Aid Blind Panoramic Video Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Panoramic videos have the advantage of providing an immersive and interactive viewing experience. Nevertheless, their spherical nature gives rise to various and uncertain user viewing behaviors, which poses significant challenges for panoramic video quality assessment (PVQA). In this work, we propose an end-to-end optimized, blind PVQA method with explicit modeling of user viewing patterns through visual scanpaths. Our method consists of two modules: a scanpath generator and a quality assessor. The scanpath generator is initially trained to predict future scanpaths by minimizing their expected code length and then jointly optimized with the quality assessor for quality prediction. Our blind PVQA method enables direct quality assessment of panoramic images by treating them as videos composed of identical frames. Experiments on three public panoramic image and video quality datasets, encompassing both synthetic and authentic distortions, validate the superiority of our blind PVQA model over existing methods.</description>

      <title>SSUMamba: Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model for Hyperspectral Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01726v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denoising hyperspectral images (HSIs) is a crucial preprocessing procedure due to the noise originating from intra-imaging mechanisms and environmental factors. Utilizing domain-specific knowledge of HSIs, such as spectral correlation, spatial self-similarity, and spatial-spectral correlation, is essential for deep learning-based denoising. Existing methods are often constrained by running time, space complexity, and computational complexity, employing strategies that explore these priors separately. While these strategies can avoid some redundant information, they inevitably overlook broader and more underlying long-range spatial-spectral information that positively impacts image restoration. This paper proposes a Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model-based U-shaped network, termed Spatial-Spectral U-Mamba (SSUMamba), for hyperspectral image denoising. We can obtain complete global spatial-spectral correlation within a module thanks to the linear space complexity in State Space Model (SSM) computations. We introduce a Spatial-Spectral Alternating Scan (SSAS) strategy for HSIs, which helps model the information flow in multiple directions in 3-D HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms compared methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/lronkitty/SSUMamba.</description>

      <title>Similarity Metrics for MR Image-To-Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image-to-image translation can create large impact in medical imaging, i.e. if images of a patient can be translated to another modality, type or sequence for better diagnosis. However, these methods must be validated by human reader studies, which are costly and restricted to small samples. Automatic evaluation of large samples to pre-evaluate and continuously improve methods before human validation is needed. In this study, we give an overview of reference and non-reference metrics for image synthesis assessment and investigate the ability of nine metrics, that need a reference (SSIM, MS-SSIM, PSNR, MSE, NMSE, MAE, LPIPS, NMI and PCC) and three non-reference metrics (BLUR, MSN, MNG) to detect 11 kinds of distortions in MR images from the BraSyn dataset. In addition we test a downstream segmentation metric and the effect of three normalization methods (Minmax, cMinMax and Zscore). Although PSNR and SSIM are frequently used to evaluate generative models for image-to-image-translation tasks in the medical domain, they show very specific shortcomings. SSIM ignores blurring but is very sensitive to intensity shifts in unnormalized MR images. PSNR is even more sensitive to different normalization methods and hardly measures the degree of distortions. Further metrics, such as LPIPS, NMI and DICE can be very useful to evaluate other similarity aspects. If the images to be compared are misaligned, most metrics are flawed. By carefully selecting and reasonably combining image similarity metrics, the training and selection of generative models for MR image synthesis can be improved. Many aspects of their output can be validated before final and costly evaluation by trained radiologists is conducted.</description>

      <title>RMT-BVQA: Recurrent Memory Transformer-based Blind Video Quality Assessment for Enhanced Video Content</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With recent advances in deep learning, numerous algorithms have been developed to enhance video quality, reduce visual artefacts and improve perceptual quality. However, little research has been reported on the quality assessment of enhanced content - the evaluation of enhancement methods is often based on quality metrics that were designed for compression applications. In this paper, we propose a novel blind deep video quality assessment (VQA) method specifically for enhanced video content. It employs a new Recurrent Memory Transformer (RMT) based network architecture to obtain video quality representations, which is optimised through a novel content-quality-aware contrastive learning strategy based on a new database containing 13K training patches with enhanced content. The extracted quality representations are then combined through linear regression to generate video-level quality indices. The proposed method, RMT-BVQA, has been evaluated on the VDPVE (VQA Dataset for Perceptual Video Enhancement) database through a five-fold cross validation. The results show its superior correlation performance when compared to ten existing no-reference quality metrics.</description>

      <title>nnSAM: Plug-and-play Segment Anything Model Improves nnUNet Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic segmentation of medical images is crucial in modern clinical workflows. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has emerged as a versatile tool for image segmentation without specific domain training, but it requires human prompts and may have limitations in specific domains. Traditional models like nnUNet perform automatic segmentation during inference and are effective in specific domains but need extensive domain-specific training. To combine the strengths of foundational and domain-specific models, we propose nnSAM, integrating SAM's robust feature extraction with nnUNet's automatic configuration to enhance segmentation accuracy on small datasets. Our nnSAM model optimizes two main approaches: leveraging SAM's feature extraction and nnUNet's domain-specific adaptation, and incorporating a boundary shape supervision loss function based on level set functions and curvature calculations to learn anatomical shape priors from limited data. We evaluated nnSAM on four segmentation tasks: brain white matter, liver, lung, and heart segmentation. Our method outperformed others, achieving the highest DICE score of 82.77% and the lowest ASD of 1.14 mm in brain white matter segmentation with 20 training samples, compared to nnUNet's DICE score of 79.25% and ASD of 1.36 mm. A sample size study highlighted nnSAM's advantage with fewer training samples. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance with nnSAM, showcasing its potential for small-sample learning in medical image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Polarimetric Light Transport Analysis for Specular Inter-reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarization is well known for its ability to decompose diffuse and specular reflections. However, the existing decomposition methods only focus on direct reflection and overlook multiple reflections, especially specular inter-reflection. In this paper, we propose a novel decomposition method for handling specular inter-reflection of metal objects by using a unique polarimetric feature: the rotation direction of linear polarization. This rotation direction serves as a discriminative factor between direct and inter-reflection on specular surfaces. To decompose the reflectance components, we actively rotate the linear polarization of incident light and analyze the rotation direction of the reflected light. We evaluate our method using both synthetic and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness in decomposing specular inter-reflections of metal objects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can be combined with other decomposition methods for a detailed analysis of light transport. As a practical application, we show its effectiveness in improving the accuracy of 3D measurement against strong specular inter-reflection.</description>
