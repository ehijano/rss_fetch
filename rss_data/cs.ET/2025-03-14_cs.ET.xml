      <title>MoCoMR: A Collaborative MR Simulator with Individual Behavior Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying collaborative behavior in Mixed Reality (MR) often requires extensive, challenging data collection. This paper introduces MoCoMR, a novel simulator designed to address this by generating synthetic yet realistic collaborative MR data. MoCoMR captures individual behavioral modalities such as speaking, gaze, and locomotion during a collaborative image-sorting task with 48 participants to identify distinct behavioral patterns. MoCoMR simulates individual actions and interactions within a virtual space, enabling researchers to investigate the impact of individual behaviors on group dynamics and task performance. This simulator facilitates the development of more effective and human-centered MR applications by providing insights into user behavior and interaction patterns. The simulator's API allows for flexible configuration and data analysis, enabling researchers to explore various scenarios and generate valuable insights for optimizing collaborative MR experiences.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok-3, have gained significant attention for their exceptional capabilities in natural language processing and multimodal data understanding. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has driven the growing need for intelligence, efficient, and adaptable wireless networks. Wireless networks require the empowerment of RL-based LLMs while these models also benefit from wireless networks to broaden their application scenarios. Specifically, RL-based LLMs can enhance wireless communication systems through intelligent resource allocation, adaptive network optimization, and real-time decision-making. Conversely, wireless networks provide a vital infrastructure for the efficient training, deployment, and distributed inference of RL-based LLMs, especially in decentralized and edge computing environments. This mutual empowerment highlights the need for a deeper exploration of the interplay between these two domains. We first review recent advancements in wireless communications, highlighting the associated challenges and potential solutions. We then discuss the progress of RL-based LLMs, focusing on key technologies for LLM training, challenges, and potential solutions. Subsequently, we explore the mutual empowerment between these two fields, highlighting key motivations, open challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we provide insights into future directions, applications, and their societal impact to further explore this intersection, paving the way for next-generation intelligent communication systems. Overall, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between RL-based LLMs and wireless networks, offering a vision where these domains empower each other to drive innovations.</description>

      <title>Resource efficient data transmission on animals based on machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bio-loggers, electronic devices used to track animal behaviour through various sensors, have become essential in wildlife research.
  Despite continuous improvements in their capabilities, bio-loggers still face significant limitations in storage, processing, and data transmission due to the constraints of size and weight, which are necessary to avoid disturbing the animals.
  This study aims to explore how selective data transmission, guided by machine learning, can reduce the energy consumption of bio-loggers, thereby extending their operational lifespan without requiring hardware modifications.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Boundary of Quantum Advantage in Hard Combinatorial Optimization with Probabilistic Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent demonstrations on specialized benchmarks have reignited excitement for quantum computers, yet whether they can deliver an advantage for practical real-world problems remains an open question. Here, we show that probabilistic computers (p-computers) when co-designed with hardware to implement powerful Monte Carlo algorithms surpass state-of-the-art quantum annealers [\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05867-2}{King et al., Nature (2023)}] in solving hard optimization problems. We focus on two key algorithms: discrete-time simulated quantum annealing (DT-SQA) and adaptive parallel tempering (APT), both applied to 3D spin glasses. For DT-SQA, we find that increasing the number of replicas improves residual energy scaling, while parallelizing fewer replicas across independent runs also achieves comparable scaling. Both strategies align with the theoretical expectations from extreme value theory. In addition, APT outperforms DT-SQA when supported by non-local isoenergetic cluster moves. Finite-size scaling analysis suggests a universal behavior that explains the superior performance of APT over both DT-SQA and quantum annealing. We show that these algorithms are readily implementable in modern hardware thanks to the mature semiconductor technology. Unlike software simulations, replicas can be monolithically housed on a single chip and a large number of spins can be updated in parallel and asynchronously, similar to a quantum annealer. We project that custom Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) or specialized chips leveraging massive parallelism can further accelerate these algorithms by orders of magnitude, while drastically improving energy efficiency. Our results challenge the notion of a practical quantum advantage in optimization and present p-computers as scalable, energy-efficient hardware for real-world optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of a Multi-Molecule Molecular Communication Testbed Based on Spectral Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a novel flow-based molecular communication (MC) testbed using spectral sensing and ink intensity estimation to enable real-time multi-molecule (MUMO) transmission. MUMO communication opens up crucial opportunities for increased throughput as well as implementing more complex coding, modulation, and resource allocation strategies for MC testbeds. An estimator using non-invasive spectral sensing at the receiver is proposed based on a simple absorption model. We conduct in-depth channel impulse response (CIR) measurements and a preliminary communication performance evaluation. Additionally, a simple analytical model is used to check the consistency of the CIRs. The results indicate that by utilizing MUMO transmission, on-off-keying, and a simple difference detector, the testbed can achieve up to 3 bits per second for near-error-free communication, which is on par with comparable testbeds that utilize more sophisticated coding or detection methods. Our platform lays the ground for implementing MUMO communication and evaluating various physical layer and networking techniques based on multiple molecule types in future MC testbeds in real time.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report investigates the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms for dynamic resource allocation in wireless communication systems. An environment that includes a base station, multiple antennas, and user equipment is created. Using the RLlib library, various DRL algorithms such as Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are then applied. These algorithms are compared based on their ability to optimize resource allocation, focusing on the impact of different learning rates and scheduling policies. The findings demonstrate that the choice of algorithm and learning rate significantly influences system performance, with DRL providing more efficient resource allocation compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA): An Integrated Framework for AI-Enabled Government</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence transforms public sector operations, governments struggle to integrate technological innovations into coherent systems for effective service delivery. This paper introduces the Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA), a novel four-layer framework conceptualising how Digital Public Infrastructure, Data-for-Policy, Algorithmic Government/Governance, and GovTech interact as an integrated system in AI-enabled states. Unlike approaches that treat these as parallel developments, ASA positions them as interdependent layers with specific enabling relationships and feedback mechanisms. Through comparative analysis of implementations in Estonia, Singapore, India, and the UK, we demonstrate how foundational digital infrastructure enables systematic data collection, which powers algorithmic decision-making processes, ultimately manifesting in user-facing services. Our analysis reveals that successful implementations require balanced development across all layers, with particular attention to integration mechanisms between them. The framework contributes to both theory and practice by bridging previously disconnected domains of digital government research, identifying critical dependencies that influence implementation success, and providing a structured approach for analysing the maturity and development pathways of AI-enabled government systems.</description>
