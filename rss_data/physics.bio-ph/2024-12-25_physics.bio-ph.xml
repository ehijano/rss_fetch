      <title>Statistical physics of large-scale neural activity with loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As experiments advance to record from tens of thousands of neurons, statistical physics provides a framework for understanding how collective activity emerges from networks of fine-scale correlations. While modeling these populations is tractable in loop-free networks, neural circuitry inherently contains feedback loops of connectivity. Here, for a class of networks with loops, we present an exact solution to the maximum entropy problem that scales to very large systems. This solution provides direct access to information-theoretic measures like the entropy of the model and the information contained in correlations, which are usually inaccessible at large scales. In turn, this allows us to search for the optimal network of correlations that contains the maximum information about population activity. Applying these methods to 45 recordings of approximately 10,000 neurons in the mouse visual system, we demonstrate that our framework captures more information -- providing a better description of the population -- than existing methods without loops. For a given population, our models perform even better during visual stimulation than spontaneous activity; however, the inferred interactions overlap significantly, suggesting an underlying neural circuitry that remains consistent across stimuli. Generally, we construct an optimized framework for studying the statistical physics of large neural populations, with future applications extending to other biological networks.</description>

      <title>How accurate is mechanobiology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanobiology is gaining more and more traction as the fundamental role of physical forces in biological function becomes clearer. Forces at the microscale are often measured indirectly using inverse problems such as Traction Force Microscopy because biological experiments are hard to access with physical probes. In contrast with the experimental nature of biology and physics, these measurements do not come with error bars, confidence regions, or p-values. The aim of this manuscript is to publicize this issue and to propose a first step towards a remedy in the form of a general reconstruction framework that enables hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>An AI-directed analytical study on the optical transmission microscopic images of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in planktonic and biofilm states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biofilms are resistant microbial cell aggregates that pose risks to health and food industries and produce environmental contamination. Accurate and efficient detection and prevention of biofilms are challenging and demand interdisciplinary approaches. This multidisciplinary research reports the application of a deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) model for detecting biofilms produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa with high accuracy. Aptamer DNA templated silver nanocluster (Ag-NC) was used to prevent biofilm formation, which produced images of the planktonic states of the bacteria. Large-volume bright field images of bacterial biofilms were used to design the AI model. In particular, we used U-Net with ResNet encoder enhancement to segment biofilm images for AI analysis. Different degrees of biofilm structures can be efficiently detected using ResNet18 and ResNet34 backbones. The potential applications of this technique are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Inferring intermediate states by leveraging the many-body Arrhenius law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastable states appear as long-lived intermediate states in various natural transport phenomena which are governed by energy landscapes. Moreover, they dominate a system's evolution in deciding the selective outcome or shedding light on the preferred mechanism on how a system explores the energy landscape. It is thus crucial to develop techniques to quantify these metastabilities hence uncovering key details of the energy landscape. Here, we propose a powerful method by leveraging a many-body Arrhenius law that detects the metastabilites in an escape problem, involving interacting particles with excluded volume confined to a complex energy landscape. Observing transport in colloidal systems or translocation of macromolecules through biological pores can be an ideal test bed to verify our results.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Dynamic Models Hybridisation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-based dynamic models (PBDMs) are simplified representations of complex dynamical systems. PBDMs take specific processes within a complex system and assign a fragment of variables and an accompanying set of parameters to depict the processes. As this often leads to suboptimal parameterisation of the system, a key challenge requires refining the empirical parameters and variables to reduce uncertainties while maintaining the model s explainability and enhancing its predictive accuracy. We demonstrate that a hybrid mosquito population dynamics model, which integrates a PBDM with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), retains the explainability of the PBDM by incorporating the PINN-learned model parameters in place of its empirical counterparts. Specifically, we address the limitations of traditional PBDMs by modelling the parameters of larva and pupa development rates using a PINN that encodes complex, learned interactions of air temperature, precipitation and humidity. Our results demonstrate improved mosquito population simulations including the difficult-to-predict mosquito population peaks. This opens the possibility of hybridisation concept application on other complex systems based on PBDMs such as cancer growth to address the challenges posed by scarce and noisy data, and to numerical weather prediction and climate modelling to overcome the gap between physics-based and data-driven weather prediction models.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Optimal Reaction Coordinates of Biomolecular System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present flow matching for reaction coordinates (FMRC), a novel deep learning algorithm designed to identify optimal reaction coordinates (RC) in biomolecular reversible dynamics. FMRC is based on the mathematical principles of lumpability and decomposability, which we reformulate into a conditional probability framework for efficient data-driven optimization using deep generative models. While FMRC does not explicitly learn the well-established transfer operator or its eigenfunctions, it can effectively encode the dynamics of leading eigenfunctions of the system transfer operator into its low-dimensional RC space. We further quantitatively compare its performance with several state-of-the-art algorithms by evaluating the quality of Markov state models (MSM) constructed in their respective RC spaces, demonstrating the superiority of FMRC in three increasingly complex biomolecular systems. In addition, we successfully demonstrated the efficacy of FMRC for bias deposition in the enhanced sampling of a simple model system. Finally, we discuss its potential applications in downstream applications such as enhanced sampling methods and MSM construction.</description>
