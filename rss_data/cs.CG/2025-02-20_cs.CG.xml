      <title>Fast Kd-trees for the Kullback--Leibler Divergence and other Decomposable Bregman Divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contributions of the paper span theoretical and implementational results. First, we prove that Kd-trees can be extended to spaces in which the distance is measured with an arbitrary Bregman divergence. Perhaps surprisingly, this shows that the triangle inequality is not necessary for correct pruning in Kd-trees. Second, we offer an efficient algorithm and C++ implementation for nearest neighbour search for decomposable Bregman divergences.
  The implementation supports the Kullback--Leibler divergence (relative entropy) which is a popular distance between probability vectors and is commonly used in statistics and machine learning. This is a step toward broadening the usage of computational geometry algorithms.
  Our benchmarks show that our implementation efficiently handles both exact and approximate nearest neighbour queries. Compared to a naive approach, we achieve two orders of magnitude speedup for practical scenarios in dimension up to 100. Our solution is simpler and more efficient than competing methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal covering of rectangular grid graphs with tours of constrained length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a rectangular grid graph with a special vertex at a corner called base station, we study the problem of covering the vertices of the entire graph with tours that start and end at the base station and whose lengths do not exceed a given threshold, while minimizing a quality measure. We consider two objective functions: minimizing the number of tours and minimizing the sum of their lengths. We present an algorithm that computes the optimal solution for both objectives in linear time with respect to the grid size.</description>

      <title>Slant/Gokigen Naname is NP-complete, and Some Variations are in P</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that a generalized version of the Nikoli puzzle Slant is NP-complete. We also give polynomial time algorithms for versions of the puzzle where some constraints are omitted. These problems correspond to simultaneously satisfying connectivity and vertex degree constraints in a grid graph and its dual.</description>

      <title>A Query-Driven Approach to Space-Efficient Range Searching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a study of a query-driven approach to designing partition trees for range-searching problems. Our model assumes that a data structure is to be built for an unknown query distribution that we can access through a sampling oracle, and must be selected such that it optimizes a meaningful performance parameter on expectation. Our first contribution is to show that a near-linear sample of queries allows the construction of a partition tree with a near-optimal expected number of nodes visited during querying. We enhance this approach by treating node processing as a classification problem, leveraging fast classifiers like shallow neural networks to obtain experimentally efficient query times. Our second contribution is to develop partition trees using sparse geometric separators. Our preprocessing algorithm, based on a sample of queries, builds a balanced tree with nodes associated with separators that minimize query stabs on expectation; this yields both fast processing of each node and a small number of visited nodes, significantly reducing query time.</description>

      <title>Multi-Covering a Point Set by $m$ Disks with Minimum Total Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common robotics sensing problem is to place sensors to robustly monitor a set of assets, where robustness is assured by requiring asset $p$ to be monitored by at least $\kappa(p)$ sensors. Given $n$ assets that must be observed by $m$ sensors, each with a disk-shaped sensing region, where should the sensors be placed to minimize the total area observed? We provide and analyze a fast heuristic for this problem. We then use the heuristic to initialize an exact Integer Programming solution. Subsequently, we enforce separation constraints between the sensors by modifying the integer program formulation and by changing the disk candidate set.</description>

      <title>On Diverse Solutions to Packing and Covering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general framework, called \emph{approximately-diverse dynamic programming (ADDP)} that provides PTASs for generating a collection of $k&gt;1$ maximally diverse solutions to various packing and covering problems. Given an approximation factor $0\le c\le 1$, this framework also allows for maximizing diversity in the larger space of $c$-optimal solutions. We showcase the power and limitations of our technique via three applications.
  1. Given an input to the knapsack problem, an integer $k$ and a $c\le 1$, we give an algorithm that runs in time $n^{O(1/\epsilon)}\text{poly}(k)f(\epsilon,\delta,\gamma)$ and returns $k$ solutions, each with value within $c(1-\delta)$ of optimal, weight at most $(1+\gamma)$ of the knapsack, and with diversity at least $(1-\epsilon)$ of any optimally diverse collection of $c$-optimal solutions.
  2. Given a planar graph $G$, an integer $k$ and a value $c\le 1$, we give algorithms running in time $2^{O(kf(\delta,\epsilon))}n^{O(1/\epsilon)}$ that return $(1-\epsilon)$-apx. diverse $(1-\delta)c$-optimal independent sets or vertex covers. When $k=O(\log n)$, this gives a PTAS. This is the \emph{first PTAS for diverse variants for any NP-complete problem}.
  3. We show how to generate diverse solutions for a geometric variant of the knapsack problem - the rectangle packing problem by [Coffman, Garey, Johnson, and Tarjan 1980]. In this problem, we are given a set of axis-aligned rectangles and a square knapsack, and the goal is to pack as many rectangles as possible into the knapsack. We present a poly-time algorithm that returns $k$ distinct solutions, where each solution achieves a profit of at least $(1-\epsilon)$ times the optimal value and fits into a $(1+\epsilon)$-enlarged knapsack. In this case, the diversity is at least $(1-\epsilon)$ of that of any collection of $k$ container based solutions.</description>

      <title>Rapid mixing of the flip chain over non-crossing spanning trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the flip chain for non-crossing spanning trees of $n+1$ points in convex position mixes in time $O(n^8\log n)$. We use connections between Fuss-Catalan structures to construct a comparison argument with a chain similar to Wilson's lattice path chain (Wilson 2004).</description>
