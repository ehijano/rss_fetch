      <title>Multicomponent DKP hierarchy and its dispersionless limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the free fermions technique and bosonization rules we introduce the multicomponent DKP hierarchy as a generating bilinear integral equation for the tau-function. A number of bilinear equations of the Hirota-Miwa type are obtained as its corollaries. We also consider the dispersionless version of the hierarchy as a set of nonlinear differential equations for the dispersionless limit of logarithm of the tau-function (the $F$-function). We show that there is an elliptic curve built in the structure of the hierarchy, with the elliptic modulus being a dynamical variable. This curve can be uniformized by elliptic functions, and in the elliptic parametrization many dispersionless equations of the Hirota-Miwa type become equivalent to a single equation having a nice form.</description>

      <title>Algebraic entropy for hex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hex systems were recently introduced [A. P. Kels. Integrable systems on hexagonal lattices and consistency on polytopes with quadrilateral and hexagonal faces. 2022. arXiv:2205.02720 [math-ph]] as systems of equations defined on two-dimensional honeycomb lattices. We give a definition of algebraic entropy for such systems and use it to check the integrability of specific examples.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative nonisospectral Toda and Lotka-Volterra lattices, and matrix discrete Painlev\'{e} equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The noncommutative analogues of the nonisospectral Toda and Lotka-Volterra lattices are proposed and studied by performing nonisopectral deformations on the matrix orthogonal polynomials and matrix symmetric orthogonal polynomials without specific weight functions, respectively. Under stationary reductions, matrix discrete Painlev\'{e} I and matrix asymmetric discrete Painlev\'{e} I equations are derived separately not only from the noncommutative nonisospectral lattices themselves, but also from their Lax pairs. The rationality of the stationary reduction has been justified in the sense that quasideterminant solutions are provided for the corresponding matrix discrete Painlev\'{e} equations.</description>

      <title>Integrability of open boundary driven quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of Yang-Baxter integrability of doubled quantum circuit of qubits (spins 1/2) with open boundary conditions where the two circuit replicas are only coupled at the left or right boundary. We investigate the cases where the bulk is given by elementary six vertex unitary gates of either the free fermionic XX type or interacting XXZ type. By using the Sklyanin's construction of reflection algebra, we obtain the most general solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation for such a setup. We use this solution to build, from the transfer matrix formalism, integrable circuits with two step discrete time Floquet (aka brickwork) dynamics. We prove that, only if the bulk is a free-model, the boundary matrices are in general non-factorizable, and for particular choice of free parameters yield non-trivial unitary dynamics with boundary interaction between the two chains. Then, we consider the limit of continuous time evolution and we give the interpretation of a restricted set of the boundary terms in the Lindbladian setting. Specifically, for a particular choice of free parameters, the solutions correspond to an open quantum system dynamics with the source terms representing injecting or removing particles from the boundary of the spin chain.</description>

      <title>Computation of $\wp$-functions on plane algebraic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical tools for computation of $\wp$-functions, also known as Kleinian, or multiply periodic, are proposed. In this connection, computation of periods of the both first and second kinds is reconsidered. An analytical approach to constructing the Reimann surface of a plane algebraic curves of low gonalities is used. The approach is based on explicit radical solutions to quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations, which serve for hyperelliptic, trigonal, and tetragonal curves, respectively. The proposed analytical construction of the Riemann surface gives a full control over computation of the Abel image of any point on a curve. Therefore, computation of $\wp$-functions on given divisors can be done directly. An alternative computation with the help of the Jacobi inversion problem is used for verification. Hyperelliptic and trigonal curves are considered in detail, and illustrated by examples.</description>
