      <title>AMix-1: A Pathway to Test-Time Scalable Protein Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce AMix-1, a powerful protein foundation model built on Bayesian Flow Networks and empowered by a systematic training methodology, encompassing pretraining scaling laws, emergent capability analysis, in-context learning mechanism, and test-time scaling algorithm. To guarantee robust scalability, we establish a predictive scaling law and reveal the progressive emergence of structural understanding via loss perspective, culminating in a strong 1.7-billion model. Building on this foundation, we devise a multiple sequence alignment (MSA)-based in-context learning strategy to unify protein design into a general framework, where AMix-1 recognizes deep evolutionary signals among MSAs and consistently generates structurally and functionally coherent proteins. This framework enables the successful design of a dramatically improved AmeR variant with an up to $50\times$ activity increase over its wild type. Pushing the boundaries of protein engineering, we further empower AMix-1 with an evolutionary test-time scaling algorithm for in silico directed evolution that delivers substantial, scalable performance gains as verification budgets are intensified, laying the groundwork for next-generation lab-in-the-loop protein design.</description>

      <title>Conformation-Aware Structure Prediction of Antigen-Recognizing Immune Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Ibex, a pan-immunoglobulin structure prediction model that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in modeling the variable domains of antibodies, nanobodies, and T-cell receptors. Unlike previous approaches, Ibex explicitly distinguishes between bound and unbound protein conformations by training on labeled apo and holo structural pairs, enabling accurate prediction of both states at inference time. Using a comprehensive private dataset of high-resolution antibody structures, we demonstrate superior out-of-distribution performance compared to existing specialized and general protein structure prediction tools. Ibex combines the accuracy of cutting-edge models with significantly reduced computational requirements, providing a robust foundation for accelerating large molecule design and therapeutic development.</description>

      <title>Advancing Structure Prediction of Biomolecular Interaction via Contact-Guided Sampling with HelixFold-S1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomolecular structure prediction is essential to molecular biology, yet accurately predicting the structures of complexes remains challenging, especially when co-evolutionary signals are absent. While recent methods have improved prediction accuracy through extensive sampling, aimless sampling often provides diminishing returns due to limited conformational diversity. Here, we introduce HelixFold-S1, a contact-guided sampling strategy that improves structural accuracy. Rather than relying on indiscriminate sampling, HelixFold-S1 predicts contact probabilities between molecular entities and uses these predictions to prioritize sampling of likely binding sites and modes. This targeted approach generates a diverse set of structural candidates, enhancing the likelihood of identifying accurate conformations. We demonstrate that HelixFold-S1 consistently outperforms baseline sampling strategies across a range of biomolecular interactions, including protein-antibody, protein-protein, protein-ligand, protein-RNA, and protein-DNA interfaces. Furthermore, the predicted contact probabilities serve as a reliable indicator of structural difficulty, guiding the allocation of sampling resources. These results highlight the potential of targeted sampling strategies to advance the structural modeling of complex biomolecular interactions during inference.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Conformational Diversity for Enhanced Structure-Based Virtual Screening: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations of HIV-1 Protease-Ligand Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure-based virtual screening aims to identify high-affinity ligands by estimating binding free energies between proteins and small molecules. However, the conformational flexibility of both proteins and ligands challenges conventional rigid docking methods that assume a fixed receptor structure. In this study, we examined the impact of conformational diversity on binding energy calculations using 79 HIV-1 protease-ligand complexes. Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to generate structural ensembles for both proteins and ligands in aqueous environments. RMSD-based clustering was applied to reduce redundancy while preserving structural diversity. Binding energies were computed using van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. The results demonstrated that native protein-ligand pairs consistently yielded favorable binding energies, whereas non-native pairings often failed to reproduce binding. Furthermore, clustering thresholds influenced the balance between computational cost and interaction accuracy. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating multiple protein and ligand conformations in SBVS protocols to improve prediction reliability and support more effective drug discovery strategies.</description>

      <title>ToxBench: A Binding Affinity Prediction Benchmark with AB-FEP-Calculated Labels for Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein-ligand binding affinity prediction is essential for drug discovery and toxicity assessment. While machine learning (ML) promises fast and accurate predictions, its progress is constrained by the availability of reliable data. In contrast, physics-based methods such as absolute binding free energy perturbation (AB-FEP) deliver high accuracy but are computationally prohibitive for high-throughput applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToxBench, the first large-scale AB-FEP dataset designed for ML development and focused on a single pharmaceutically critical target, Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ER$\alpha$). ToxBench contains 8,770 ER$\alpha$-ligand complex structures with binding free energies computed via AB-FEP with a subset validated against experimental affinities at 1.75 kcal/mol RMSE, along with non-overlapping ligand splits to assess model generalizability. Using ToxBench, we further benchmark state-of-the-art ML methods, and notably, our proposed DualBind model, which employs a dual-loss framework to effectively learn the binding energy function. The benchmark results demonstrate the superior performance of DualBind and the potential of ML to approximate AB-FEP at a fraction of the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Conditional Chemical Language Models are Versatile Tools in Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative chemical language models (CLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in molecular design, yet their impact in drug discovery remains limited by the absence of reliable reward signals and the lack of interpretability in their outputs. We present SAFE-T, a generalist chemical modeling framework that conditions on biological context -- such as protein targets or mechanisms of action -- to prioritize and design molecules without relying on structural information or engineered scoring functions. SAFE-T models the conditional likelihood of fragment-based molecular sequences given a biological prompt, enabling principled scoring of molecules across tasks such as virtual screening, drug-target interaction prediction, and activity cliff detection. Moreover, it supports goal-directed generation by sampling from this learned distribution, aligning molecular design with biological objectives. In comprehensive zero-shot evaluations across predictive (LIT-PCBA, DAVIS, KIBA, ACNet) and generative (DRUG, PMO) benchmarks, SAFE-T consistently achieves performance comparable to or better than existing approaches while being significantly faster. Fragment-level attribution further reveals that SAFE-T captures known structure-activity relationships, supporting interpretable and biologically grounded design. Together with its computational efficiency, these results demonstrate that conditional generative CLMs can unify scoring and generation to accelerate early-stage drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Complex Multiplexed DIA Spectra in De Novo Peptide Sequencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15684v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) was introduced to improve sensitivity to cover all peptides in a range rather than only sampling high-intensity peaks as in Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry. However, it is not very clear how useful DIA data is for de novo peptide sequencing as the DIA data are marred with coeluted peptides, high noises, and varying data quality. We present a new deep learning method DIANovo, and address each of these difficulties, and improves the previous established system DeepNovo-DIA by from 34% to 108%, averaging 50%, for amino acid recall, and by from 32% to 83%, averaging 57%, for peptide recall, by equipping the model with a deeper understanding of coeluted DIA spectra. This paper also provides criteria about when DIA data could be used for de novo peptide sequencing and when not to by providing a comparison between DDA and DIA, in both de novo and database search mode. We find that while DIA excels with narrow isolation windows on older-generation instruments, it loses its advantage with wider windows. However, with Orbitrap Astral, DIA consistently outperforms DDA due to narrow window mode enabled. We also provide a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon, emphasizing the critical role of the signal-to-noise profile in the successful application of de novo sequencing.</description>

      <title>Challenges and Guidelines in Deep Generative Protein Design: Four Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep generative models show promise for $\textit{de novo}$ protein design, yet reliably producing designs that are geometrically plausible, evolutionarily consistent, functionally relevant, and dynamically stable remains challenging. We present a deep generative modeling pipeline for early $\textit{de novo}$ design of monomeric proteins, based on Score Matching and Flow Matching. We apply this pipeline to four diverse protein families with an adaptable evaluation protocol. Generated structures display realistic, clash-free conformations enriched with family-specific features, while the designed sequences preserve essential functional residues while retaining variability. Molecular dynamics and binding simulations show dynamic stability, with wild-type-like binding pockets that interact favorably with family-specific ligands. These results provide practical guidelines for integrating generative models into protein design workflows.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and the limit of predictability in protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein evolution involves mutations occurring across a wide range of time scales. In analogy with disordered systems in statistical physics, this dynamical heterogeneity suggests strong correlations between mutations happening at distinct sites and times. To quantify these correlations, we examine the role of various fluctuation sources in protein evolution, simulated using a data-driven energy landscape as a proxy for protein fitness. By applying spatio-temporal correlation functions developed in the context of disordered physical systems, we disentangle fluctuations originating from the initial condition, i.e. the ancestral sequence from which the evolutionary process originated, from those driven by stochastic mutations along independent evolutionary paths. Our analysis shows that, in diverse protein families, fluctuations from the ancestral sequence predominate at shorter time scales. This allows us to identify a time scale over which ancestral sequence information persists, enabling its reconstruction. We link this persistence to the strength of epistatic interactions: ancestral sequences with stronger epistatic signatures impact evolutionary trajectories over extended periods. At longer time scales, however, ancestral influence fades as epistatically constrained sites evolve collectively. To confirm this idea, we apply a standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithm and verify that the time-dependent recovery error is influenced by the properties of the ancestor itself. Overall, our results reveal that the properties of ancestral sequences - particularly their epistatic constraints - influence the initial evolutionary dynamics and the performance of standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithms.</description>
