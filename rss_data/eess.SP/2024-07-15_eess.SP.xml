      <title>CommRad: Context-Aware Sensing-Driven Millimeter-Wave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology is pivotal for next-generation wireless networks, enabling high-data-rate and low-latency applications such as autonomous vehicles and XR streaming. However, maintaining directional mmWave links in dynamic mobile environments is challenging due to mobility-induced disruptions and blockage. While effective, the current 5G NR beam training methods incur significant overhead and scalability issues in multi-user scenarios. To address this, we introduce CommRad, a sensing-driven solution incorporating a radar sensor at the base station to track mobile users and maintain directional beams even under blockages. While radar provides high-resolution object tracking, it suffers from a fundamental challenge of lack of context, i.e., it cannot discern which objects in the environment represent active users, reflectors, or blockers. To obtain this contextual awareness, CommRad unites wireless sensing capabilities of bi-static radio communication with the mono-static radar sensor, allowing radios to provide initial context to radar sensors. Subsequently, the radar aids in user tracking and sustains mobile links even in obstructed scenarios, resulting in robust and high-throughput directional connections for all mobile users at all times. We evaluate this collaborative radar-radio framework using a 28 GHz mmWave testbed integrated with a radar sensor in various indoor and outdoor scenarios, demonstrating a 2.5x improvement in median throughput compared to a non-collaborative baseline.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Enabled Over the Air Index Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Users' desire for enhanced performance drive the inevitable technological progress on vertical applications in wireless communication systems. To meet these demands, researchers vigorously investigate potential 6G and beyond technologies and solutions. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have risen in popularity and attracted the attention of academia as well as industry and seem to be a promising candidate for 6G technology. RISs are reflective metamaterials with many configurable elements consisting of pin diodes that have the ability to manipulate the impinging signals' properties, hence, enabling some sort of virtual control over the wireless channel. In this paper, we propose a novel over-the-air index modulation (IM) scheme through the use of a hybrid RIS with active and passive partitions to convey additional IM bits over-the-air. In addition we propose another modified scheme that allows the transmission for even more IM bits but at the expense of certain trade-offs. First, we present the system model for both of the proposed schemes. Furthermore, comprehensive computer simulation results are provided and discussed presenting the superior bit error rate (BER) performance and additional benefits of the proposed systems compared to similar benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Perturbation-based Sequence Selection for Probabilistic Amplitude Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a practical sign-dependent sequence selection metric for probabilistic amplitude shaping and propose a simple method to predict the gains in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for sequence selection. The proposed metric provides a $0.5$ dB SNR gain for single-polarized 256-QAM transmission over a long-haul fiber link.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Sensitivity of Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasound Transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer (CMUT) has a wild range of applications in medical detecting and imaging fields. However, operating under self-generating-self-receiving (SGSR) method usually results in poor sensitivity. But the sensitivity cannot be improved simply by increasing the resonant frequency since the frequency of a specific kind of CMUT is designed for specific usage. In this paper, based on one specific type of CMUT, mechanical model is built and simulation analysis is demonstrated. A brand-new method one-generating-multiple-receiving (OGMR) is introduced and a special circuit model has been designed to improve the signal to thermal noise ratio. By increasing the number of receiving capacitors from 1 to 8, we increased the signal-noise ratio to 2.83 times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate C+L+S long-haul systems using a closed-form GN/EGN non-linearity model. We perform accurate launch power and Raman pump optimization. We show a potential 4x throughput increase over legacy C-band systems in 1000 km links, using moderate S-only Raman amplification. We simultaneously achieve extra-flat GSNR, within +/-0.5 dB across the whole C+L+S spectrum.</description>

      <title>68-Channel Highly-Integrated Neural Signal Processing PSoC with On-Chip Feature Extraction, Compression, and Hardware Accelerators for Neuroprosthetics in 22nm FDSOI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-channel electrophysiology systems for recording of neuronal activity face significant data throughput limitations, hampering real-time, data-informed experiments. These limitations impact both experimental neurobiology research and next-generation neuroprosthetics. We present a novel solution that leverages the high integration density of 22nm FDSOI CMOS technology to address these challenges. The proposed highly integrated programmable System-on-Chip comprises 68-channel 0.41 \textmu W/Ch recording frontends, spike detectors, 16-channel 0.87-4.39 \textmu W/Ch action potential and 8-channel 0.32 \textmu W/Ch local field potential codecs, as well as a MAC-assisted power-efficient processor operating at 25 MHz (5.19 \textmu W/MHz). The system supports on-chip training processes for compression, training and inference for neural spike sorting. The spike sorting achieves an average accuracy of 91.48% or 94.12% depending on the utilized features. The proposed PSoC is optimized for reduced area (9 mm2) and power. On-chip processing and compression capabilities free up the data bottlenecks in data transmission (up to 91% space saving ratio), and moreover enable a fully autonomous yet flexible processor-driven operation. Combined, these design considerations overcome data-bottlenecks by allowing on-chip feature extraction and subsequent compression.</description>

      <title>Belief Propagation-based Rotation and Translation Estimation for Rigid Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel solution to the rigid body localization (RBL) problem, in which the three-dimensional (3D) rotation and translation is estimated by only utilizing the range measurements between the wireless sensors on the rigid body and the anchor sensors. The proposed framework first constructs a linear Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) algorithm to estimate the absolute sensor positions utilizing the range-based received signal model, which is used for the reconstruction of the RBL transformation model, linearized with a small-angle approximation. In light of the reformulated system, a second bivariate GaBP is designed to directly estimate the 3D rotation angles and translation distances, with an interference cancellation (IC) refinement to improve the angle estimation performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via numerical simulations, highlighting the superior performance of the proposed method against the state-of-the-art (SotA) techniques for the position, rotation, and translation estimation performance.</description>

      <title>Power Optimization and Deep Learning for Channel Estimation of Active IRS-Aided IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09254v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, channel estimation of an active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided uplink Internet of Things (IoT) network is investigated. Firstly, the least square (LS) estimators for the direct channel and the cascaded channel are presented, respectively. The corresponding mean square errors (MSE) of channel estimators are derived. Subsequently, in order to evaluate the influence of adjusting the transmit power at the IoT devices or the reflected power at the active IRS on Sum-MSE performance, two situations are considered. In the first case, under the total power sum constraint of the IoT devices and active IRS, the closed-form expression of the optimal power allocation factor is derived. In the second case, when the transmit power at the IoT devices is fixed, there exists an optimal reflective power at active IRS. To further improve the estimation performance, the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based direct channel estimation (CDCE) algorithm and the CNN-based cascaded channel estimation (CCCE) algorithm are designed. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the existence of an optimal power allocation strategy that minimizes the Sum-MSE, and further validate the superiority of the proposed CDCE / CCCE algorithms over their respective traditional LS and minimum mean square error (MMSE) baselines.</description>

      <title>Informed FastICA: Semi-Blind Minimum Variance Distortionless Beamformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussianity-based Independent Vector Extraction leads to the famous one-unit FastICA/FastIVA algorithm when the likelihood function is optimized using an approximate Newton-Raphson algorithm under the orthogonality constraint. In this paper, we replace the constraint with the analytic form of the minimum variance distortionless beamformer (MVDR), by which a semi-blind variant of FastICA/FastIVA is obtained. The side information here is provided by a weighted covariance matrix replacing the noise covariance matrix, the estimation of which is a frequent goal of neural beamformers. The algorithm thus provides an intuitive connection between model-based blind extraction and learning-based extraction. The algorithm is tested in simulations and speaker ID-guided speaker extraction, showing fast convergence and promising performance.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Encoding Schemes on Ubiquitous Sensor Signal for Spiking Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), a brain-inspired computing paradigm, are emerging for their inference performance, particularly in terms of energy efficiency and latency attributed to the plasticity in signal processing. To deploy SNNs in ubiquitous computing systems, signal encoding of sensors is crucial for achieving high accuracy and robustness. Using inertial sensor readings for gym activity recognition as a case study, this work comprehensively evaluates four main encoding schemes and deploys the corresponding SNN on the neuromorphic processor Loihi2 for post-deployment encoding assessment. Rate encoding, time-to-first-spike encoding, binary encoding, and delta modulation are evaluated using metrics like average fire rate, signal-to-noise ratio, classification accuracy, robustness, and inference latency and energy. In this case study, the time-to-first-spike encoding required the lowest firing rate (2%) and achieved a comparative accuracy (89%), although it was the least robust scheme against error spikes (over 20% accuracy drop with 0.1 noisy spike rate). Rate encoding with optimal value-to-probability mapping achieved the highest accuracy (91.7%). Binary encoding provided a balance between information reconstruction and noise resistance. Multi-threshold delta modulation showed the best robustness, with only a 0.7% accuracy drop at a 0.1 noisy spike rate. This work serves researchers in selecting the best encoding scheme for SNN-based ubiquitous sensor signal processing, tailored to specific performance requirements.</description>

      <title>TelecomGPT: A Framework to Build Telecom-Specfic Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize the Sixth Generation (6G) communication networks. However, current mainstream LLMs generally lack the specialized knowledge in telecom domain. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a pipeline to adapt any general purpose LLMs to a telecom-specific LLMs. We collect and build telecom-specific pre-train dataset, instruction dataset, preference dataset to perform continual pre-training, instruct tuning and alignment tuning respectively. Besides, due to the lack of widely accepted evaluation benchmarks in telecom domain, we extend existing evaluation benchmarks and proposed three new benchmarks, namely, Telecom Math Modeling, Telecom Open QnA and Telecom Code Tasks. These new benchmarks provide a holistic evaluation of the capabilities of LLMs including math modeling, Open-Ended question answering, code generation, infilling, summarization and analysis in telecom domain. Our fine-tuned LLM TelecomGPT outperforms state of the art (SOTA) LLMs including GPT-4, Llama-3 and Mistral in Telecom Math Modeling benchmark significantly and achieve comparable performance in various evaluation benchmarks such as TeleQnA, 3GPP technical documents classification, telecom code summary and generation and infilling.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Aerial Collaborative Secure Communication Optimization via Generative Diffusion Model-enabled Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to flexibility and low-cost, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly crucial for enhancing coverage and functionality of wireless networks. However, incorporating UAVs into next-generation wireless communication systems poses significant challenges, particularly in sustaining high-rate and long-range secure communications against eavesdropping attacks. In this work, we consider a UAV swarm-enabled secure surveillance network system, where a UAV swarm forms a virtual antenna array to transmit sensitive surveillance data to a remote base station (RBS) via collaborative beamforming (CB) so as to resist mobile eavesdroppers. Specifically, we formulate an aerial secure communication and energy efficiency multi-objective optimization problem (ASCEE-MOP) to maximize the secrecy rate of the system and to minimize the flight energy consumption of the UAV swarm. To address the non-convex, NP-hard and dynamic ASCEE-MOP, we propose a generative diffusion model-enabled twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (GDMTD3) method. Specifically, GDMTD3 leverages an innovative application of diffusion models to determine optimal excitation current weights and position decisions of UAVs. The diffusion models can better capture the complex dynamics and the trade-off of the ASCEE-MOP, thereby yielding promising solutions. Simulation results highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with traditional deployment strategies and some other deep reinforcement learning (DRL) benchmarks. Moreover, performance analysis under various parameter settings of GDMTD3 and different numbers of UAVs verifies the robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Redefinition of Digital Twin and its Situation Awareness Framework Designing Towards Fourth Paradigm for Energy Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional knowledge-based situation awareness (SA) modes struggle to adapt to the escalating complexity of today's Energy Internet of Things (EIoT), necessitating a pivotal paradigm shift. In response, this work introduces a pioneering data-driven SA framework, termed digital twin-based situation awareness (DT-SA), aiming to bridge existing gaps between data and demands, and further to enhance SA capabilities within the complex EIoT landscape. First, we redefine the concept of digital twin (DT) within the EIoT context, aligning it with data-intensive scientific discovery paradigm (the Fourth Paradigm) so as to waken EIoT's sleeping data; this contextual redefinition lays the cornerstone of our DT-SA framework for EIoT. Then, the framework is comprehensively explored through its four fundamental steps: digitalization, simulation, informatization, and intellectualization. These steps initiate a virtual ecosystem conducive to a continuously self-adaptive, self-learning, and self-evolving big model (BM), further contributing to the evolution and effectiveness of DT-SA in engineering. Our framework is characterized by the incorporation of system theory and Fourth Paradigm as guiding ideologies, DT as data engine, and BM as intelligence engine. This unique combination forms the backbone of our approach. This work extends beyond engineering, stepping into the domain of data science -- DT-SA not only enhances management practices for EIoT users/operators, but also propels advancements in pattern analysis and machine intelligence (PAMI) within the intricate fabric of a complex system. Numerous real-world cases validate our DT-SA framework.</description>

      <title>Physical encryption and decryption for secure data transmission in optical networks leveraging the temporal Talbot effect and microwave photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel microwave photonic scheme for secure data transmission in optical networks is proposed. The security of the scheme is guaranteed by physical encryption and decryption via the temporal Talbot effect in dispersive mediums. First, the original data is randomized in the digital domain by performing an exclusive OR operation using a random matrix. Subsequently, a time-varying multi-tone electrical signal, which represents the randomized data matrix, is modulated onto an optical carrier. The optical signal after modulation is then phase-modulated by a temporal Talbot array illuminator (TAI) signal, and the optical signal after discrete quadratic phase modulation will lose its original appearance in the frequency domain and be further dispersed in the first dispersive medium. Due to the dispersion that does not match the TAI signal exactly, the waveform after the first dispersive medium is a noise-like signal. Hence, the physical encryption of the original data is successfully achieved. As the optical signal passes a second dispersive medium that makes the total dispersion match the TAI signal, the temporal waveform of the noise-like signal after photodetection is transformed into pulses. "1" and "0" in the randomized data matrix are represented through the presence and absence of pulses, and the physical decryption is achieved. By further processing the recovered data matrix using the random matrix, the original data can be recovered. The physical layer security of the proposed scheme and its fiber transmission capability are demonstrated. 8-Gbit/s data is transmitted, encrypted, and decrypted using two dispersive mediums and an optical fiber of 10 to 200 km, and error-free transmission is achieved. Many factors that affect the encryption, decryption, and transmission performance of the system have been analyzed.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Online Adaptation via Modular Drift Detection for Deep Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning is envisioned to facilitate the operation of wireless receivers, with emerging architectures integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) with traditional modular receiver processing. While deep receivers were shown to operate reliably in complex settings for which they were trained, the dynamic nature of wireless communications gives rise to the need to repeatedly adapt deep receivers to channel variations. However, frequent re-training is costly and ineffective, while in practice, not every channel variation necessitates adaptation of the entire DNN. In this paper, we study concept drift detection for identifying when does a deep receiver no longer match the channel, enabling asynchronous adaptation, i.e., re-training only when necessary. We identify existing drift detection schemes from the machine learning literature that can be adapted for deep receivers in dynamic channels, and propose a novel soft-output detection mechanism tailored to the communication domain. Moreover, for deep receivers that preserve conventional modular receiver processing, we design modular drift detection mechanisms, that simultaneously identify when and which sub-module to re-train. The provided numerical studies show that even in a rapidly time-varying scenarios, asynchronous adaptation via modular drift detection dramatically reduces the number of trained parameters and re-training times, with little compromise on performance.</description>

      <title>Deep Adversarial Defense Against Multilevel-Lp Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have shown considerable vulnerability to adversarial attacks, particularly as attacker strategies become more sophisticated. While traditional adversarial training (AT) techniques offer some resilience, they often focus on defending against a single type of attack, e.g., the $\ell_\infty$-norm attack, which can fail for other types. This paper introduces a computationally efficient multilevel $\ell_p$ defense, called the Efficient Robust Mode Connectivity (EMRC) method, which aims to enhance a deep learning model's resilience against multiple $\ell_p$-norm attacks. Similar to analytical continuation approaches used in continuous optimization, the method blends two $p$-specific adversarially optimal models, the $\ell_1$- and $\ell_\infty$-norm AT solutions, to provide good adversarial robustness for a range of $p$. We present experiments demonstrating that our approach performs better on various attacks as compared to AT-$\ell_\infty$, E-AT, and MSD, for datasets/architectures including: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 / PreResNet110, WideResNet, ViT-Base.</description>

      <title>Cost-optimized probabilistic maintenance for condition monitoring of wind turbines with rare failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method, a model, and a form of presenting model results for condition monitoring of a small set of wind turbines with rare failures. The main new ingredient of the method is to sample failure thresholds according to the profit they give to an operating company. The model is a multiple linear regression with seasonal components and external regressors, representing all sensor components except for the considered one. To overcome the scarcity of the training data, we use the median sensor values from all available turbines in their healthy state. The cumulated deviation from the normal behavior model obtained for this median turbine is calibrated for each turbine at the beginning of the test period and after known failures. The proposed form of presenting results is to set a scale for possible costs, control for random maintenance, and show a whole distribution of costs depending on the free model parameters. We make a case study on an open dataset with SCADA data from multiple sensors and show that considering the influence of turbine components is more critical than seasonality. The distribution, the average, and the standard deviation of maintenance costs can be very different for similar minimal costs. Random maintenance can be more profitable than reactive maintenance and other approaches. Our predictive maintenance model outperforms random maintenance and competitors for the whole set of considered turbines, giving substantial savings.</description>

      <title>Compressed Sensing: A Discrete Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Compressed Sensing (CS) problem, which is the problem of finding the most sparse vector that satisfies a set of linear measurements up to some numerical tolerance. We introduce an $\ell_2$ regularized formulation of CS which we reformulate as a mixed integer second order cone program. We derive a second order cone relaxation of this problem and show that under mild conditions on the regularization parameter, the resulting relaxation is equivalent to the well studied basis pursuit denoising problem. We present a semidefinite relaxation that strengthens the second order cone relaxation and develop a custom branch-and-bound algorithm that leverages our second order cone relaxation to solve small-scale instances of CS to certifiable optimality. When compared against solutions produced by three state of the art benchmark methods on synthetic data, our numerical results show that our approach produces solutions that are on average $6.22\%$ more sparse. When compared only against the experiment-wise best performing benchmark method on synthetic data, our approach produces solutions that are on average $3.10\%$ more sparse. On real world ECG data, for a given $\ell_2$ reconstruction error our approach produces solutions that are on average $9.95\%$ more sparse than benchmark methods ($3.88\%$ more sparse if only compared against the best performing benchmark), while for a given sparsity level our approach produces solutions that have on average $10.77\%$ lower reconstruction error than benchmark methods ($1.42\%$ lower error if only compared against the best performing benchmark). When used as a component of a multi-label classification algorithm, our approach achieves greater classification accuracy than benchmark compressed sensing methods. This improved accuracy comes at the cost of an increase in computation time by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Contrastive Learning for 6G UM-MIMO THz Communications: Improving Robustness Under Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of contrastive learning in 6G ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) communication systems, specifically focusing on hybrid beamforming under imperfect channel state information (CSI) conditions at THz. UM-MIMO systems are promising for future 6G wireless communication networks due to their high spectral efficiency and capacity. The accuracy of CSI significantly influences the performance of UM-MIMO systems. However, acquiring perfect CSI is challenging due to various practical constraints such as channel estimation errors, feedback delays, and hardware imperfections. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised contrastive learning-based approach for hybrid beamforming, which is robust against imperfect CSI. We demonstrate the power of contrastive learning to tackle the challenges posed by imperfect CSI and show that our proposed method results in improved system performance in terms of achievable rate compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication Under DISCO Physical-Layer Jamming Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems traditionally presuppose that sensing and communication (S&amp;C) channels remain approximately constant during their coherence time. However, a "DISCO" reconfigurable intelligent surface (DRIS), i.e., an illegitimate RIS with random, time-varying reflection properties that acts like a "disco ball," introduces a paradigm shift that enables active channel aging more rapidly during the channel coherence time. In this letter, we investigate the impact of DISCO jamming attacks launched by a DRISbased fully-passive jammer (FPJ) on an ISAC system. Specifically, an ISAC problem formulation and a corresponding waveform optimization are presented in which the ISAC waveform design considers the trade-off between the S&amp;C performance and is formulated as a Pareto optimization problem. Moreover, a theoretical analysis is conducted to quantify the impact of DISCO jamming attacks. Numerical results are presented to evaluate the S&amp;C performance under DISCO jamming attacks and to validate the derived theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Budget Recycling Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11445v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms usually {force} reduction in data utility by producing "out-of-bound" noisy results for a tight privacy budget. We introduce the Budget Recycling Differential Privacy (BR-DP) framework, designed to provide soft-bounded noisy outputs for a broad range of existing DP mechanisms. By "soft-bounded," we refer to the mechanism's ability to release most outputs within a predefined error boundary, thereby improving utility and maintaining privacy simultaneously. The core of BR-DP consists of two components: a DP kernel responsible for generating a noisy answer per iteration, and a recycler that probabilistically recycles/regenerates or releases the noisy answer. We delve into the privacy accounting of BR-DP, culminating in the development of a budgeting principle that optimally sub-allocates the available budget between the DP kernel and the recycler. Furthermore, we introduce algorithms for tight BR-DP accounting in composition scenarios, and our findings indicate that BR-DP achieves reduced privacy leakage post-composition compared to DP. Additionally, we explore the concept of privacy amplification via subsampling within the BR-DP framework and propose optimal sampling rates for BR-DP across various queries. We experiment with real data, and the results demonstrate BR-DP's effectiveness in lifting the utility-privacy tradeoff provided by DP mechanisms.</description>

      <title>State space representations of the Roesser type for convolutional layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the perspective of control theory, convolutional layers (of neural networks) are 2-D (or N-D) linear time-invariant dynamical systems. The usual representation of convolutional layers by the convolution kernel corresponds to the representation of a dynamical system by its impulse response. However, many analysis tools from control theory, e.g., involving linear matrix inequalities, require a state space representation. For this reason, we explicitly provide a state space representation of the Roesser type for 2-D convolutional layers with $c_\mathrm{in}r_1 + c_\mathrm{out}r_2$ states, where $c_\mathrm{in}$/$c_\mathrm{out}$ is the number of input/output channels of the layer and $r_1$/$r_2$ characterizes the width/length of the convolution kernel. This representation is shown to be minimal for $c_\mathrm{in} = c_\mathrm{out}$. We further construct state space representations for dilated, strided, and N-D convolutions.</description>
