      <title>Quantile-Scaled Bayesian Optimization Using Rank-Only Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is widely used for optimizing expensive black-box functions, particularly in hyperparameter tuning. However, standard BO assumes access to precise objective values, which may be unavailable, noisy, or unreliable in real-world settings where only relative or rank-based feedback can be obtained. In this study, we propose Quantile-Scaled Bayesian Optimization (QS-BO), a principled rank-based optimization framework. QS-BO converts ranks into heteroscedastic Gaussian targets through a quantile-scaling pipeline, enabling the use of Gaussian process surrogates and standard acquisition functions without requiring explicit metric scores. We evaluate QS-BO on synthetic benchmark functions, including one- and two-dimensional nonlinear functions and the Branin function, and compare its performance against Random Search. Results demonstrate that QS-BO consistently achieves lower objective values and exhibits greater stability across runs. Statistical tests further confirm that QS-BO significantly outperforms Random Search at the 1\% significance level. These findings establish QS-BO as a practical and effective extension of Bayesian Optimization for rank-only feedback, with promising applications in preference learning, recommendation, and human-in-the-loop optimization where absolute metric values are unavailable or unreliable.</description>

      <title>Mathematically rigorous proofs for Shapley explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning is becoming increasingly more important in today's world. It is therefore very important to provide understanding of the decision-making process of machine-learning models. A popular way to do this is by looking at the Shapley-Values of these models as introduced by Lundberg and Lee.
  In this thesis, we discuss the two main results by Lundberg and Lee from a mathematically rigorous standpoint and provide full proofs, which are not available from the original material.
  The first result of this thesis is an axiomatic characterization of the Shapley values in machine learning based on axioms by Young. We show that the Shapley values are the unique explanation to satisfy local accuracy, missingness, symmetry and consistency. Lundberg and Lee claim that the symmetry axiom is redundant for explanations. However, we provide a counterexample that shows the symmetry axiom is in fact essential.
  The second result shows that we can write the Shapley values as the unique solution to a weighted linear regression problem. This result is proven with the use of dimensionality reduction.</description>

      <title>Transformed $\ell_1$ Regularizations for Robust Principal Component Analysis: Toward a Fine-Grained Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) aims to recover a low-rank structure from noisy, partially observed data that is also corrupted by sparse, potentially large-magnitude outliers. Traditional RPCA models rely on convex relaxations, such as nuclear norm and $\ell_1$ norm, to approximate the rank of a matrix and the $\ell_0$ functional (the number of non-zero elements) of another. In this work, we advocate a nonconvex regularization method, referred to as transformed $\ell_1$ (TL1), to improve both approximations. The rationale is that by varying the internal parameter of TL1, its behavior asymptotically approaches either $\ell_0$ or $\ell_1$. Since the rank is equal to the number of non-zero singular values and the nuclear norm is defined as their sum, applying TL1 to the singular values can approximate either the rank or the nuclear norm, depending on its internal parameter. We conduct a fine-grained theoretical analysis of statistical convergence rates, measured in the Frobenius norm, for both the low-rank and sparse components under general sampling schemes. These rates are comparable to those of the classical RPCA model based on the nuclear norm and $\ell_1$ norm. Moreover, we establish constant-order upper bounds on the estimated rank of the low-rank component and the cardinality of the sparse component in the regime where TL1 behaves like $\ell_0$, assuming that the respective matrices are exactly low-rank and exactly sparse. Extensive numerical experiments on synthetic data and real-world applications demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher accuracy than the classic convex model, especially under non-uniform sampling schemes.</description>

      <title>The analogy theorem in Hoare logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of machine learning methods has led to significant advances in automation, optimization, and discoveries in various fields of science and technology. However, their widespread application faces a fundamental limitation: the transfer of models between data domains generally lacks a rigorous mathematical justification. The key problem is the lack of formal criteria to guarantee that a model trained on one type of data will retain its properties on another.This paper proposes a solution to this problem by formalizing the concept of analogy between data sets and models using first-order logic and Hoare logic.We formulate and rigorously prove a theorem that sets out the necessary and sufficient conditions for analogy in the task of knowledge transfer between machine learning models. Practical verification of the analogy theorem on model data obtained using the Monte Carlo method, as well as on MNIST and USPS data, allows us to achieving F1 scores of 0.84 and 0.88 for convolutional neural networks and random forests, respectively.The proposed approach not only allows us to justify the correctness of transfer between domains but also provides tools for comparing the applicability of models to different types of data.The main contribution of the work is a rigorous formalization of analogy at the level of program logic, providing verifiable guarantees of the correctness of knowledge transfer, which opens new opportunities for both theoretical research and the practical use of machine learning models in previously inaccessible areas.</description>

      <title>Spectral Thresholds for Identifiability and Stability:Finite-Sample Phase Transitions in High-Dimensional Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-dimensional learning, models remain stable until they collapse abruptly once the sample size falls below a critical level. This instability is not algorithm-specific but a geometric mechanism: when the weakest Fisher eigendirection falls beneath sample-level fluctuations, identifiability fails. Our Fisher Threshold Theorem formalizes this by proving that stability requires the minimal Fisher eigenvalue to exceed an explicit $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ bound. Unlike prior asymptotic or model-specific criteria, this threshold is finite-sample and necessary, marking a sharp phase transition between reliable concentration and inevitable failure. To make the principle constructive, we introduce the Fisher floor, a verifiable spectral regularization robust to smoothing and preconditioning. Synthetic experiments on Gaussian mixtures and logistic models confirm the predicted transition, consistent with $d/n$ scaling. Statistically, the threshold sharpens classical eigenvalue conditions into a non-asymptotic law; learning-theoretically, it defines a spectral sample-complexity frontier, bridging theory with diagnostics for robust high-dimensional inference.</description>

      <title>Self-Speculative Masked Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present self-speculative masked diffusions, a new class of masked diffusion generative models for discrete data that require significantly fewer function evaluations to generate samples. Standard masked diffusion models predict factorized logits over currently masked positions. A number of masked positions are then sampled, however, the factorization approximation means that sampling too many positions in one go leads to poor sample quality. As a result, many simulation steps and therefore neural network function evaluations are required to generate high-quality data. We reduce the computational burden by generating non-factorized predictions over masked positions. This is achieved by modifying the final transformer attention mask from non-causal to causal, enabling draft token generation and parallel validation via a novel, model-integrated speculative sampling mechanism. This results in a non-factorized predictive distribution over masked positions in a single forward pass. We apply our method to GPT2 scale text modelling and protein sequences generation, finding that we can achieve a ~2x reduction in the required number of network forward passes relative to standard masked diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference via telescoping ratio estimation for trawl processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing availability of large and complex datasets has increased interest in temporal stochastic processes that can capture stylized facts such as marginal skewness, non-Gaussian tails, long memory, and even non-Markovian dynamics. While such models are often easy to simulate from, parameter estimation remains challenging. Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a promising way forward, but existing methods typically require large training datasets or complex architectures and frequently yield confidence (credible) regions that fail to attain their nominal values, raising doubts on the reliability of estimates for the very features that motivate the use of these models. To address these challenges, we propose a fast and accurate, sample-efficient SBI framework for amortized posterior inference applicable to intractable stochastic processes. The proposed approach relies on two main steps: first, we learn the posterior density by decomposing it sequentially across parameter dimensions. Then, we use Chebyshev polynomial approximations to efficiently generate independent posterior samples, enabling accurate inference even when Markov chain Monte Carlo methods mix poorly. We further develop novel diagnostic tools for SBI in this context, as well as post-hoc calibration techniques; the latter not only lead to performance improvements of the learned inferential tool, but also to the ability to reuse it directly with new time series of varying lengths, thus amortizing the training cost. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness on trawl processes, a class of flexible infinitely divisible models that generalize univariate Gaussian processes, applied to energy demand data.</description>

      <title>Scalable Causal Discovery from Recursive Nonlinear Data via Truncated Basis Function Scores and Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning graphical conditional independence structures from nonlinear, continuous or mixed data is a central challenge in machine learning and the sciences, and many existing methods struggle to scale to thousands of samples or hundreds of variables. We introduce two basis-expansion tools for scalable causal discovery. First, the Basis Function BIC (BF-BIC) score uses truncated additive expansions to approximate nonlinear dependencies. BF-BIC is theoretically consistent under additive models and extends to post-nonlinear (PNL) models via an invertible reparameterization. It remains robust under moderate interactions and supports mixed data through a degenerate-Gaussian embedding for discrete variables. In simulations with fully nonlinear neural causal models (NCMs), BF-BIC outperforms kernel- and constraint-based methods (e.g., KCI, RFCI) in both accuracy and runtime. Second, the Basis Function Likelihood Ratio Test (BF-LRT) provides an approximate conditional independence test that is substantially faster than kernel tests while retaining competitive accuracy. Extensive simulations and a real-data application to Canadian wildfire risk show that, when integrated into hybrid searches, BF-based methods enable interpretable and scalable causal discovery. Implementations are available in Python, R, and Java.</description>

      <title>Relative Information Gain and Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sample complexity of estimating or maximising an unknown function in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space is known to be linked to both the effective dimension and the information gain associated with the kernel. While the information gain has an attractive information-theoretic interpretation, the effective dimension typically results in better rates. We introduce a new quantity called the relative information gain, which measures the sensitivity of the information gain with respect to the observation noise. We show that the relative information gain smoothly interpolates between the effective dimension and the information gain, and that the relative information gain has the same growth rate as the effective dimension. In the second half of the paper, we prove a new PAC-Bayesian excess risk bound for Gaussian process regression. The relative information gain arises naturally from the complexity term in this PAC-Bayesian bound. We prove bounds on the relative information gain that depend on the spectral properties of the kernel. When these upper bounds are combined with our excess risk bound, we obtain minimax-optimal rates of convergence.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Coverage Policies in Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional conformal prediction methods construct prediction sets such that the true label falls within the set with a user-specified coverage level. However, poorly chosen coverage levels can result in uninformative predictions, either producing overly conservative sets when the coverage level is too high, or empty sets when it is too low. Moreover, the fixed coverage level cannot adapt to the specific characteristics of each individual example, limiting the flexibility and efficiency of these methods. In this work, we leverage recent advances in e-values and post-hoc conformal inference, which allow the use of data-dependent coverage levels while maintaining valid statistical guarantees. We propose to optimize an adaptive coverage policy by training a neural network using a leave-one-out procedure on the calibration set, allowing the coverage level and the resulting prediction set size to vary with the difficulty of each individual example. We support our approach with theoretical coverage guarantees and demonstrate its practical benefits through a series of experiments.</description>

      <title>Modular and Adaptive Conformal Prediction for Sequential Models via Residual Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction offers finite-sample coverage guarantees under minimal assumptions. However, existing methods treat the entire modeling process as a black box, overlooking opportunities to exploit modular structure. We introduce a conformal prediction framework for two-stage sequential models, where an upstream predictor generates intermediate representations for a downstream model. By decomposing the overall prediction residual into stage-specific components, our method enables practitioners to attribute uncertainty to specific pipeline stages. We develop a risk-controlled parameter selection procedure using family-wise error rate (FWER) control to calibrate stage-wise scaling parameters, and propose an adaptive extension for non-stationary settings that preserves long-run coverage guarantees. Experiments on synthetic distribution shifts, as well as real-world supply chain and stock market data, demonstrate that our approach maintains coverage under conditions that degrade standard conformal methods, while providing interpretable stage-wise uncertainty attribution. This framework offers diagnostic advantages and robust coverage that standard conformal methods lack.</description>

      <title>Learning Survival Models with Right-Censored Reporting Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Survival analysis is a statistical technique used to estimate the time until an event occurs. Although it is applied across a wide range of fields, adjusting for reporting delays under practical constraints remains a significant challenge in the insurance industry. Such delays render event occurrences unobservable when their reports are subject to right censoring. This issue becomes particularly critical when estimating hazard rates for newly enrolled cohorts with limited follow-up due to administrative censoring. Our study addresses this challenge by jointly modeling the parametric hazard functions of event occurrences and report timings. The joint probability distribution is marginalized over the latent event occurrence status. We construct an estimator for the proposed survival model and establish its asymptotic consistency. Furthermore, we develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to compute its estimates. Using these findings, we propose a two-stage estimation procedure based on a parametric proportional hazards model to evaluate observations subject to administrative censoring. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the timeliness of risk evaluation for newly enrolled cohorts.</description>

      <title>Divergence Phase Index: A Riesz-Transform Framework for Multidimensional Phase Difference Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Divergence Phase Index (DPI), a novel framework for quantifying phase differences in one and multidimensional signals, grounded in harmonic analysis via the Riesz transform. Based on classical Hilbert Transform phase measures, the DPI extends these principles to higher dimensions, offering a geometry-aware metric that is invariant to intensity scaling and sensitive to structural changes. We applied this method on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings during epileptic seizures, high-resolution microscopy images, and paintings. In the 1D case, the DPI robustly detects hypersynchronization associated with generalized epilepsy, while in 2D, it reveals subtle, imperceptible changes in images and artworks. Additionally, it can detect rotational variations in highly isotropic microscopy images. The DPI's robustness to amplitude variations and its adaptability across domains enable its use in diverse applications from nonlinear dynamics, complex systems analysis, to multidimensional signal processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a dynamic landscape where portfolios and environments evolve, maintaining the accuracy of pricing models is critical. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically examine concept drift in non-life insurance pricing. We (i) provide an overview of the relevant literature and commonly used methodologies, clarify the distinction between virtual drift and concept drift, and explain their implications for long-run model performance; (ii) review and formalize common performance measures, including the Gini index and deviance loss, and articulate their interpretation; (iii) derive the asymptotic distribution of the Gini index, enabling valid inference and hypothesis testing; and (iv) present a standardized monitoring procedure that indicates when refitting is warranted. We illustrate the framework using a modified real-world portfolio with induced concept drift and discuss practical considerations and pitfalls.</description>

Abstract: Wasserstein barycenters provide a powerful tool for aggregating probability measures, while leveraging the geometry of their ambient space. Existing discrete methods suffer from poor scalability, as they require access to the complete set of samples from input measures. We address this issue by recasting the original barycenter problem as a gradient flow in the Wasserstein space. Our approach offers two advantages. First, we achieve scalability by sampling mini-batches from the input measures. Second, we incorporate functionals over probability measures, which regularize the barycenter problem through internal, potential, and interaction energies. We present two algorithms for empirical and Gaussian mixture measures, providing convergence guarantees under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality. Experimental validation on toy datasets and domain adaptation benchmarks show that our methods outperform previous discrete and neural net-based methods for computing Wasserstein barycenters.</description>

      <title>Fisher-Bingham-like normalizing flows on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generic D-dimensional Gaussian can be conditioned or projected onto the D-1 unit sphere, thereby leading to the well-known Fisher-Bingham (FB) or Angular Gaussian (AG) distribution families, respectively. These are some of the most fundamental distributions on the sphere, yet cannot straightforwardly be written as a normalizing flow except in two special cases: the von-Mises Fisher in D=3 and the central angular Gaussian in any D. In this paper, we describe how to generalize these special cases to a family of normalizing flows that behave similarly to the full FB or AG family in any D. We call them "zoom-linear-project" (ZLP)-Fisher flows. Unlike a normal Fisher-Bingham distribution, their composition allows to gradually add complexity as needed. Furthermore, they can naturally handle conditional density estimation with target distributions that vary by orders of magnitude in scale - a setting that is important in astronomical applications but that existing flows often struggle with. A particularly useful member of the new family is the Kent analogue that can cheaply upgrade any flow in this situation to yield better performance.</description>

      <title>Kernel ridge regression under power-law data: spectrum and generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate high-dimensional kernel ridge regression (KRR) on i.i.d. Gaussian data with anisotropic power-law covariance. This setting differs fundamentally from the classical source &amp; capacity conditions for KRR, where power-law assumptions are typically imposed on the kernel eigen-spectrum itself. Our contributions are twofold. First, we derive an explicit characterization of the kernel spectrum for polynomial inner-product kernels, giving a precise description of how the kernel eigen-spectrum inherits the data decay. Second, we provide an asymptotic analysis of the excess risk in the high-dimensional regime for a particular kernel with this spectral behavior, showing that the sample complexity is governed by the effective dimension of the data rather than the ambient dimension. These results establish a fundamental advantage of learning with power-law anisotropic data over isotropic data. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous treatment of non-linear KRR under power-law data.</description>

      <title>A Noise Resilient Approach for Robust Hurst Exponent Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding signal behavior across scales is vital in areas such as natural phenomena analysis and financial modeling. A key property is self-similarity, quantified by the Hurst exponent (H), which reveals long-term dependencies. Wavelet-based methods are effective for estimating H due to their multi-scale analysis capability, but additive noise in real-world measurements often degrades accuracy. We propose Noise-Controlled ALPHEE (NC-ALPHEE), an enhancement of the Average Level-Pairwise Hurst Exponent Estimator (ALPHEE), incorporating noise mitigation and generating multiple level-pairwise estimates from signal energy pairs. A neural network (NN) combines these estimates, replacing traditional averaging. This adaptive learning maintains ALPHEE's behavior in noise-free cases while improving performance in noisy conditions. Extensive simulations show that in noise-free data, NC-ALPHEE matches ALPHEE's accuracy using both averaging and NN-based methods. Under noise, however, traditional averaging deteriorates and requires impractical level restrictions, while NC-ALPHEE consistently outperforms existing techniques without such constraints. NC-ALPHEE offers a robust, adaptive approach for H estimation, significantly enhancing the reliability of wavelet-based methods in noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Set to Be Fair: Demographic Parity Constraints for Set-Valued Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Set-valued classification is used in multiclass settings where confusion between classes can occur and lead to misleading predictions. However, its application may amplify discriminatory bias motivating the development of set-valued approaches under fairness constraints. In this paper, we address the problem of set-valued classification under demographic parity and expected size constraints. We propose two complementary strategies: an oracle-based method that minimizes classification risk while satisfying both constraints, and a computationally efficient proxy that prioritizes constraint satisfaction. For both strategies, we derive closed-form expressions for the (optimal) fair set-valued classifiers and use these to build plug-in, data-driven procedures for empirical predictions. We establish distribution-free convergence rates for violations of the size and fairness constraints for both methods, and under mild assumptions we also provide excess-risk bounds for the oracle-based approach. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of both strategies and highlight the efficiency of our proxy method.</description>

      <title>Embracing Discrete Search: A Reasonable Approach to Causal Structure Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FLOP (Fast Learning of Order and Parents), a score-based causal discovery algorithm for linear models. It pairs fast parent selection with iterative Cholesky-based score updates, cutting run-times over prior algorithms. This makes it feasible to fully embrace discrete search, enabling iterated local search with principled order initialization to find graphs with scores at or close to the global optimum. The resulting structures are highly accurate across benchmarks, with near-perfect recovery in standard settings. This performance calls for revisiting discrete search over graphs as a reasonable approach to causal discovery.</description>

      <title>Curiosity-Driven Co-Development of Action and Language in Robots Through Self-Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human infants acquire language and action co-developmentally, achieving remarkable generalization capabilities from only a minimal number of learning examples. In contrast, recent large language models require exposure to billions of training tokens to achieve such generalization. What mechanisms underlie such efficient developmental learning in humans? This study addresses this question through simulation experiments in which robots learn to perform various actions corresponding to imperative sentences (e.g., \textit{push red cube}) via trials of self-guided exploration. Our approach integrates the active inference framework with reinforcement learning, enabling curiosity-driven developmental learning. The simulations yielded several nontrivial findings: i) Curiosity-driven exploration combined with motor noise substantially outperforms learning without curiosity. ii) Simpler, prerequisite-like actions emerge earlier in development, while more complex actions involving these prerequisites develop later. iii) Rote pairing of sentences and actions occurs before the emergence of compositional generalization. iv) Generalization is drastically improved as the number of compositional elements increases. These results shed light into possible mechanisms underlying efficient co-developmental learning in infants and provide computational parallels to findings in developmental psychology.</description>

      <title>Causal Abstractions, Categorically Unified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a categorical framework for relating causal models that represent the same system at different levels of abstraction. We define a causal abstraction as natural transformations between appropriate Markov functors, which concisely consolidate desirable properties a causal abstraction should exhibit. Our approach unifies and generalizes previously considered causal abstractions, and we obtain categorical proofs and generalizations of existing results on causal abstractions. Using string diagrammatical tools, we can explicitly describe the graphs that serve as consistent abstractions of a low-level graph under interventions. We discuss how methods from mechanistic interpretability, such as circuit analysis and sparse autoencoders, fit within our categorical framework. We also show how applying do-calculus on a high-level graphical abstraction of an acyclic-directed mixed graph (ADMG), when unobserved confounders are present, gives valid results on the low-level graph, thus generalizing an earlier statement by Anand et al. (2023). We argue that our framework is more suitable for modeling causal abstractions compared to existing categorical frameworks. Finally, we discuss how notions such as $\tau$-consistency and constructive $\tau$-abstractions can be recovered with our framework.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Workflows in Climate Modeling: Design Patterns and Insights from Case Studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has been increasingly applied in climate modeling on system emulation acceleration, data-driven parameter inference, forecasting, and knowledge discovery, addressing challenges such as physical consistency, multi-scale coupling, data sparsity, robust generalization, and integration with scientific workflows. This paper analyzes a series of case studies from applied machine learning research in climate modeling, with a focus on design choices and workflow structure. Rather than reviewing technical details, we aim to synthesize workflow design patterns across diverse projects in ML-enabled climate modeling: from surrogate modeling, ML parameterization, probabilistic programming, to simulation-based inference, and physics-informed transfer learning. We unpack how these workflows are grounded in physical knowledge, informed by simulation data, and designed to integrate observations. We aim to offer a framework for ensuring rigor in scientific machine learning through more transparent model development, critical evaluation, informed adaptation, and reproducibility, and to contribute to lowering the barrier for interdisciplinary collaboration at the interface of data science and climate modeling.</description>

      <title>Estimating link level traffic emissions: enhancing MOVES with open-source data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-source data offers a scalable and transparent foundation for estimating vehicle activity and emissions in urban regions. In this study, we propose a data-driven framework that integrates MOVES and open-source GPS trajectory data, OpenStreetMap (OSM) road networks, regional traffic datasets and satellite imagery-derived feature vectors to estimate the link level operating mode distribution and traffic emissions. A neural network model is trained to predict the distribution of MOVES-defined operating modes using only features derived from readily available data. The proposed methodology was applied using open-source data related to 45 municipalities in the Boston Metropolitan area. The "ground truth" operating mode distribution was established using OSM open-source GPS trajectories. Compared to the MOVES baseline, the proposed model reduces RMSE by over 50% for regional scale traffic emissions of key pollutants including CO, NOx, CO2, and PM2.5. This study demonstrates the feasibility of low-cost, replicable, and data-driven emissions estimation using fully open data sources.</description>

Abstract: The Weak form Estimation of Nonlinear Dynamics (WENDy) method is a recently proposed class of parameter estimation algorithms that exhibits notable noise robustness and computational efficiency. This work examines the coverage and bias properties of the original WENDy-IRLS algorithm's parameter and state estimators in the context of the following differential equations: Logistic, Lotka-Volterra, FitzHugh-Nagumo, Hindmarsh-Rose, and a Protein Transduction Benchmark. The estimators' performance was studied in simulated data examples, under four different noise distributions (normal, log-normal, additive censored normal, and additive truncated normal), and a wide range of noise, reaching levels much higher than previously tested for this algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty-aware wind power prediction is essential for grid integration and reliable wind farm operation. We apply neural diffusion processes (NDPs)-a recent class of models that learn distributions over functions-and extend them to a multi-task NDP (MT-NDP) framework for wind power prediction. We provide the first empirical evaluation of NDPs in real supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data. We introduce a task encoder within MT-NDPs to capture cross-turbine correlations and enable few-shot adaptation to unseen turbines. The proposed MT-NDP framework outperforms single-task NDPs and GPs in terms of point accuracy and calibration, particularly for wind turbines whose behaviour deviates from the fleet average. In general, NDP-based models deliver calibrated and scalable predictions suitable for operational deployment, offering sharper, yet trustworthy, predictive intervals that can support dispatch and maintenance decisions in modern wind farms.</description>

      <title>Consistent Kernel Change-Point Detection under m-Dependence for Text Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel change-point detection (KCPD) has become a widely used tool for identifying structural changes in complex data. While existing theory establishes consistency under independence assumptions, real-world sequential data such as text exhibits strong dependencies. We establish new guarantees for KCPD under $m$-dependent data: specifically, we prove consistency in the number of detected change points and weak consistency in their locations under mild additional assumptions. We perform an LLM-based simulation that generates synthetic $m$-dependent text to validate the asymptotics. To complement these results, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of KCPD for text segmentation with modern embeddings. Across diverse text datasets, KCPD with text embeddings outperforms baselines in standard text segmentation metrics. We demonstrate through a case study on Taylor Swift's tweets that KCPD not only provides strong theoretical and simulated reliability but also practical effectiveness for text segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Regularization Under Uncertainty: Distributional Robustness and Convexity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regularization is a central tool for addressing ill-posedness in inverse problems and statistical estimation, with the choice of a suitable penalty often determining the reliability and interpretability of downstream solutions. While recent work has characterized optimal regularizers for well-specified data distributions, practical deployments are often complicated by distributional uncertainty and the need to enforce structural constraints such as convexity. In this paper, we introduce a framework for distributionally robust optimal regularization, which identifies regularizers that remain effective under perturbations of the data distribution. Our approach leverages convex duality to reformulate the underlying distributionally robust optimization problem, eliminating the inner maximization and yielding formulations that are amenable to numerical computation. We show how the resulting robust regularizers interpolate between memorization of the training distribution and uniform priors, providing insights into their behavior as robustness parameters vary. For example, we show how certain ambiguity sets, such as those based on the Wasserstein-1 distance, naturally induce regularity in the optimal regularizer by promoting regularizers with smaller Lipschitz constants. We further investigate the setting where regularizers are required to be convex, formulating a convex program for their computation and illustrating their stability with respect to distributional shifts. Taken together, our results provide both theoretical and computational foundations for designing regularizers that are reliable under model uncertainty and structurally constrained for robust deployment.</description>

      <title>On residual network depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep residual architectures, such as ResNet and the Transformer, have enabled models of unprecedented depth, yet a formal understanding of why depth is so effective remains an open question. A popular intuition, following Veit et al. (2016), is that these residual networks behave like ensembles of many shallower models. Our key finding is an explicit analytical formula that verifies this ensemble perspective, proving that increasing network depth is mathematically equivalent to expanding the size of this implicit ensemble. Furthermore, our expansion reveals a hierarchical ensemble structure in which the combinatorial growth of computation paths leads to an explosion in the output signal, explaining the historical necessity of normalization layers in training deep models. This insight offers a first principles explanation for the historical dependence on normalization layers and sheds new light on a family of successful normalization-free techniques like SkipInit and Fixup. However, while these previous approaches infer scaling factors through optimizer analysis or a heuristic analogy to Batch Normalization, our work offers the first explanation derived directly from the network's inherent functional structure. Specifically, our Residual Expansion Theorem reveals that scaling each residual module provides a principled solution to taming the combinatorial explosion inherent to these architectures. We further show that this scaling acts as a capacity controls that also implicitly regularizes the model's complexity.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Data Suffices for Statistically Efficient Policy Evaluation in Finite-Horizon Offline RL with Linear $q^\pi$-Realizability and Concentrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite-horizon offline reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation for both policy evaluation and policy optimization. Prior work established that statistically efficient learning is impossible for either of these problems when the only assumptions are that the data has good coverage (concentrability) and the state-action value function of every policy is linearly realizable ($q^\pi$-realizability) (Foster et al., 2021). Recently, Tkachuk et al. (2024) gave a statistically efficient learner for policy optimization, if in addition the data is assumed to be given as trajectories. In this work we present a statistically efficient learner for policy evaluation under the same assumptions. Further, we show that the sample complexity of the learner used by Tkachuk et al. (2024) for policy optimization can be improved by a tighter analysis.</description>

      <title>Composite Optimization with Error Feedback: the Dual Averaging Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Communication efficiency is a central challenge in distributed machine learning training, and message compression is a widely used solution. However, standard Error Feedback (EF) methods (Seide et al., 2014), though effective for smooth unconstrained optimization with compression (Karimireddy et al., 2019), fail in the broader and practically important setting of composite optimization, which captures, e.g., objectives consisting of a smooth loss combined with a non-smooth regularizer or constraints. The theoretical foundation and behavior of EF in the context of the general composite setting remain largely unexplored. In this work, we consider composite optimization with EF. We point out that the basic EF mechanism and its analysis no longer stand when a composite part is involved. We argue that this is because of a fundamental limitation in the method and its analysis technique. We propose a novel method that combines Dual Averaging with EControl (Gao et al., 2024), a state-of-the-art variant of the EF mechanism, and achieves for the first time a strong convergence analysis for composite optimization with error feedback. Along with our new algorithm, we also provide a new and novel analysis template for inexact dual averaging method, which might be of independent interest. We also provide experimental results to complement our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Mapping of the Douro River Plume with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of long-term (multiple days) mapping of a river plume using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), focusing on the Douro river representative use-case. We propose an energy - and communication - efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning approach in which a central coordinator intermittently communicates with the AUVs, collecting measurements and issuing commands. Our approach integrates spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (GPR) with a multi-head Q-network controller that regulates direction and speed for each AUV. Simulations using the Delft3D ocean model demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single- and multi-agent benchmarks, with scaling the number of agents both improving mean squared error (MSE) and operational endurance. In some instances, our algorithm demonstrates that doubling the number of AUVs can more than double endurance while maintaining or improving accuracy, underscoring the benefits of multi-agent coordination. Our learned policies generalize across unseen seasonal regimes over different months and years, demonstrating promise for future developments of data-driven long-term monitoring of dynamic plume environments.</description>

      <title>Sequential decoder training for improved latent space dynamics identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate numerical solutions of partial differential equations are essential in many scientific fields but often require computationally expensive solvers, motivating reduced-order models (ROMs). Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) is a data-driven ROM framework that combines autoencoders with equation discovery to learn interpretable latent dynamics. However, enforcing latent dynamics during training can compromise reconstruction accuracy of the model for simulation data. We introduce multi-stage LaSDI (mLaSDI), a framework that improves reconstruction and prediction accuracy by sequentially learning additional decoders to correct residual errors from previous stages. Applied to the 1D-1V Vlasov equation, mLaSDI consistently outperforms standard LaSDI, achieving lower prediction errors and reduced training time across a wide range of architectures.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Flow Matching for Trajectory Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models for sequential data often struggle with sparsely sampled and high-dimensional trajectories, typically reducing the learning of dynamics to pairwise transitions. We propose \textit{Interpolative Multi-Marginal Flow Matching} (IMMFM), a framework that learns continuous stochastic dynamics jointly consistent with multiple observed time points. IMMFM employs a piecewise-quadratic interpolation path as a smooth target for flow matching and jointly optimizes drift and a data-driven diffusion coefficient, supported by a theoretical condition for stable learning. This design captures intrinsic stochasticity, handles irregular sparse sampling, and yields subject-specific trajectories. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world longitudinal neuroimaging datasets show that IMMFM outperforms existing methods in both forecasting accuracy and further downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>BEKAN: Boundary condition-guaranteed evolutionary Kolmogorov-Arnold networks with radial basis functions for solving PDE problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has gained attention for solving PDEs, but the black-box nature of neural networks hinders precise enforcement of boundary conditions. To address this, we propose a boundary condition-guaranteed evolutionary Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with radial basis functions (BEKAN). In BEKAN, we propose three distinct and combinable approaches for incorporating Dirichlet, periodic, and Neumann boundary conditions into the network. For Dirichlet problem, we use smooth and global Gaussian RBFs to construct univariate basis functions for approximating the solution and to encode boundary information at the activation level of the network. To handle periodic problems, we employ a periodic layer constructed from a set of sinusoidal functions to enforce the boundary conditions exactly. For a Neumann problem, we devise a least-squares formulation to guide the parameter evolution toward satisfying the Neumann condition. By virtue of the boundary-embedded RBFs, the periodic layer, and the evolutionary framework, we can perform accurate PDE simulations while rigorously enforcing boundary conditions. For demonstration, we conducted extensive numerical experiments on Dirichlet, Neumann, periodic, and mixed boundary value problems. The results indicate that BEKAN outperforms both multilayer perceptron (MLP) and B-splines KAN in terms of accuracy. In conclusion, the proposed approach enhances the capability of KANs in solving PDE problems while satisfying boundary conditions, thereby facilitating advancements in scientific computing and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Latent Mixture of Symmetries for Sample-Efficient Dynamic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning dynamics is essential for model-based control and Reinforcement Learning in engineering systems, such as robotics and power systems. However, limited system measurements, such as those from low-resolution sensors, demand sample-efficient learning. Symmetry provides a powerful inductive bias by characterizing equivariant relations in system states to improve sample efficiency. While recent methods attempt to discover symmetries from data, they typically assume a single global symmetry group and treat symmetry discovery and dynamic learning as separate tasks, leading to limited expressiveness and error accumulation. In this paper, we propose the Latent Mixture of Symmetries (Latent MoS), an expressive model that captures a mixture of symmetry-governed latent factors from complex dynamical measurements. Latent MoS focuses on dynamic learning while locally and provably preserving the underlying symmetric transformations. To further capture long-term equivariance, we introduce a hierarchical architecture that stacks MoS blocks. Numerical experiments in diverse physical systems demonstrate that Latent MoS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in interpolation and extrapolation tasks while offering interpretable latent representations suitable for future geometric and safety-critical analyses.</description>

      <title>Exact and Approximate MCMC for Doubly-intractable Probabilistic Graphical Models Leveraging the Underlying Independence Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference for doubly-intractable probabilistic graphical models typically involves variations of the exchange algorithm or approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers. However, existing methods for both classes of algorithms require either perfect samplers or sequential samplers for complex models, which are often either not available, or suffer from poor mixing, especially in high dimensions. We develop a method that does not require perfect or sequential sampling, and can be applied to both classes of methods: exact and approximate MCMC. The key to our approach is to utilize the tractable independence model underlying an intractable probabilistic graphical model for the purpose of constructing a finite sample unbiased Monte Carlo (and not MCMC) estimate of the Metropolis--Hastings ratio. This innovation turns out to be crucial for scalability in high dimensions. The method is demonstrated on the Ising model. Gradient-based alternatives to construct a proposal, such as Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo approaches, also arise as a natural corollary to our general procedure, and are demonstrated as well.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Role of Training Data in Test-Time Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by allocating extra compute to generate longer Chains-of-Thoughts (CoTs). This enables models to tackle more complex problem by breaking them down into additional steps, backtracking, and correcting mistakes. Despite its strong performance--demonstrated by OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek R1, the conditions in the training data under which long CoTs emerge, and when such long CoTs improve the performance, remain unclear. In this paper, we study the performance of test-time scaling for transformers trained on an in-context weight prediction task for linear regression. Our analysis provides a theoretical explanation for several intriguing observations: First, at any fixed test error, increasing test-time compute allows us to reduce the number of in-context examples (context length) in training prompts. Second, if the skills required to solve a downstream task are not sufficiently present in the training data, increasing test-time compute can harm performance. Finally, we characterize task hardness via the smallest eigenvalue of its feature covariance matrix and show that training on a diverse, relevant, and hard set of tasks results in best performance for test-time scaling. We confirm our findings with experiments on large, nonlinear transformer architectures.</description>

      <title>Explore the Loss space with Hill-ADAM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Hill-ADAM. Hill-ADAM is an optimizer with its focus towards escaping local minima in prescribed loss landscapes to find the global minimum. Hill-ADAM escapes minima by deterministically exploring the state space. This eliminates uncertainty from random gradient updates in stochastic algorithms while seldom converging at the first minimum that visits. In the paper we first derive an analytical approximation of the ADAM Optimizer step size at a particular model state. From there define the primary condition determining ADAM limitations in escaping local minima. The proposed optimizer algorithm Hill-ADAM alternates between error minimization and maximization. It maximizes to escape the local minimum and minimizes again afterward. This alternation provides an overall exploration throughout the loss space. This allows the deduction of the global minimum's state. Hill-ADAM was tested with 5 loss functions and 12 amber-saturated to cooler-shade image color correction instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Neural Bayesian Filtering (NBF), an algorithm for maintaining distributions over hidden states, called beliefs, in partially observable systems. NBF is trained to find a good latent representation of the beliefs induced by a task. It maps beliefs to fixed-length embedding vectors, which condition generative models for sampling. During filtering, particle-style updates compute posteriors in this embedding space using incoming observations and the environment's dynamics. NBF combines the computational efficiency of classical filters with the expressiveness of deep generative models - tracking rapidly shifting, multimodal beliefs while mitigating the risk of particle impoverishment. We validate NBF in state estimation tasks in three partially observable environments.</description>

      <title>Handling Missing Data in Probabilistic Regression Trees: Methods and Implementation in R</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic Regression Trees (PRTrees) generalize traditional decision trees by incorporating probability functions that associate each data point with different regions of the tree, providing smooth decisions and continuous responses. This paper introduces an adaptation of PRTrees capable of handling missing values in covariates through three distinct approaches: (i) a uniform probability method, (ii) a partial observation approach, and (iii) a dimension-reduced smoothing technique. The proposed methods preserve the interpretability properties of PRTrees while extending their applicability to incomplete datasets. Simulation studies under MCAR conditions demonstrate the relative performance of each approach, including comparisons with traditional regression trees on smooth function estimation tasks. The proposed methods, together with the original version, have been developed in R with highly optimized routines and are distributed in the PRTree package, publicly available on CRAN. In this paper we also present and discuss the main functionalities of the PRTree package, providing researchers and practitioners with new tools for incomplete data analysis.</description>

      <title>Implicit Models: Expressive Power Scales with Test-Time Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit models, an emerging model class, compute outputs by iterating a single parameter block to a fixed point. This architecture realizes an infinite-depth, weight-tied network that trains with constant memory, significantly reducing memory needs for the same level of performance compared to explicit models. While it is empirically known that these compact models can often match or even exceed larger explicit networks by allocating more test-time compute, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood.
  We study this gap through a nonparametric analysis of expressive power. We provide a strict mathematical characterization, showing that a simple and regular implicit operator can, through iteration, progressively express more complex mappings. We prove that for a broad class of implicit models, this process lets the model's expressive power scale with test-time compute, ultimately matching a much richer function class. The theory is validated across three domains: image reconstruction, scientific computing, and operations research, demonstrating that as test-time iterations increase, the complexity of the learned mapping rises, while the solution quality simultaneously improves and stabilizes.</description>

      <title>Does higher interpretability imply better utility? A Pairwise Analysis on Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are widely used to steer large language models (LLMs), based on the assumption that their interpretable features naturally enable effective model behavior steering. Yet, a fundamental question remains unanswered: does higher interpretability indeed imply better steering utility? To answer this question, we train 90 SAEs across three LLMs (Gemma-2-2B, Qwen-2.5-3B, Gemma-2-9B), spanning five architectures and six sparsity levels, and evaluate their interpretability and steering utility based on SAEBench (arXiv:2501.12345) and AxBench (arXiv:2502.23456) respectively, and perform a rank-agreement analysis via Kendall's rank coefficients (tau b). Our analysis reveals only a relatively weak positive association (tau b approx 0.298), indicating that interpretability is an insufficient proxy for steering performance. We conjecture the interpretability utility gap may stem from the selection of SAE features, as not all of them are equally effective for steering. To further find features that truly steer the behavior of LLMs, we propose a novel selection criterion called Delta Token Confidence, which measures how much amplifying a feature changes the next token distribution. We show that our method improves the steering performance of three LLMs by 52.52 percent compared to the current best output score based criterion (arXiv:2503.34567). Strikingly, after selecting features with high Delta Token Confidence, the correlation between interpretability and utility vanishes (tau b approx 0), and can even become negative. This further highlights the divergence between interpretability and utility for the most effective steering features.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the computational challenges of large-scale attention-based models in artificial intelligence by utilizing importance sampling methods in the streaming setting. Inspired by the classical definition of the $\ell_2$ sampler and the recent progress of the attention scheme in Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose the definition of the attention sampler. Our approach significantly reduces the computational burden of traditional attention mechanisms. We analyze the effectiveness of the attention sampler from a theoretical perspective, including space and update time. Additionally, our framework exhibits scalability and broad applicability across various model architectures and domains.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Group Policy Gradient (GPG), a family of critic-free policy-gradient estimators for general MDPs. Inspired by the success of GRPO's approach in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), GPG replaces a learned value function with a group-based Monte Carlo advantage estimator, removing the memory, compute, and hyperparameter costs of training a critic while preserving PPO's clipped-objective structure. We prove the consistency of the GPG estimator, analyze the bias-variance tradeoffs, and demonstrate empirically that GPG matches or outperforms PPO on standard benchmarks. GPG makes better use of parallel simulations, which, together with its critic-free design, results in more efficient use of computational resources than PPO.</description>

      <title>From Moments to Models: Graphon Mixture-Aware Mixup and Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world graph datasets often consist of mixtures of populations, where graphs are generated from multiple distinct underlying distributions. However, modern representation learning approaches, such as graph contrastive learning (GCL) and augmentation methods like Mixup, typically overlook this mixture structure. In this work, we propose a unified framework that explicitly models data as a mixture of underlying probabilistic graph generative models represented by graphons. To characterize these graphons, we leverage graph moments (motif densities) to cluster graphs arising from the same model. This enables us to disentangle the mixture components and identify their distinct generative mechanisms. This model-aware partitioning benefits two key graph learning tasks: 1) It enables a graphon-mixture-aware mixup (GMAM), a data augmentation technique that interpolates in a semantically valid space guided by the estimated graphons, instead of assuming a single graphon per class. 2) For GCL, it enables model-adaptive and principled augmentations. Additionally, by introducing a new model-aware objective, our proposed approach (termed MGCL) improves negative sampling by restricting negatives to graphs from other models. We establish a key theoretical guarantee: a novel, tighter bound showing that graphs sampled from graphons with small cut distance will have similar motif densities with high probability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate strong empirical performance. In unsupervised learning, MGCL achieves state-of-the-art results, obtaining the top average rank across eight datasets. In supervised learning, GMAM consistently outperforms existing strategies, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy in 6 out of 7 datasets.</description>

      <title>Balancing Interpretability and Performance in Reinforcement Learning: An Adaptive Spectral Based Linear Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied to sequential decision making, where interpretability and performance are both critical for practical adoption. Current approaches typically focus on performance and rely on post hoc explanations to account for interpretability. Different from these approaches, we focus on designing an interpretability-oriented yet performance-enhanced RL approach. Specifically, we propose a spectral based linear RL method that extends the ridge regression-based approach through a spectral filter function. The proposed method clarifies the role of regularization in controlling estimation error and further enables the design of an adaptive regularization parameter selection strategy guided by the bias-variance trade-off principle. Theoretical analysis establishes near-optimal bounds for both parameter estimation and generalization error. Extensive experiments on simulated environments and real-world datasets from Kuaishou and Taobao demonstrate that our method either outperforms or matches existing baselines in decision quality. We also conduct interpretability analyses to illustrate how the learned policies make decisions, thereby enhancing user trust. These results highlight the potential of our approach to bridge the gap between RL theory and practical decision making, providing interpretability, accuracy, and adaptability in management contexts.</description>

      <title>Cost Efficient Fairness Audit Under Partial Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of auditing the fairness of a given classifier under partial feedback, where true labels are available only for positively classified individuals, (e.g., loan repayment outcomes are observed only for approved applicants). We introduce a novel cost model for acquiring additional labeled data, designed to more accurately reflect real-world costs such as credit assessment, loan processing, and potential defaults. Our goal is to find optimal fairness audit algorithms that are more cost-effective than random exploration and natural baselines.
  In our work, we consider two audit settings: a black-box model with no assumptions on the data distribution, and a mixture model, where features and true labels follow a mixture of exponential family distributions. In the black-box setting, we propose a near-optimal auditing algorithm under mild assumptions and show that a natural baseline can be strictly suboptimal. In the mixture model setting, we design a novel algorithm that achieves significantly lower audit cost than the black-box case. Our approach leverages prior work on learning from truncated samples and maximum-a-posteriori oracles, and extends known results on spherical Gaussian mixtures to handle exponential family mixtures, which may be of independent interest. Moreover, our algorithms apply to popular fairness metrics including demographic parity, equal opportunity, and equalized odds. Empirically, we demonstrate strong performance of our algorithms on real-world fair classification datasets like Adult Income and Law School, consistently outperforming natural baselines by around 50% in terms of audit cost.</description>

      <title>Allocation of Parameters in Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable successes across a wide range of applications, yet the theoretical foundation of their model efficiency remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate how the model parameters -- mainly attention heads and head dimensions -- should be allocated across layers to balance expressivity and efficiency. We first provide mathematical analysis on the role of early layers in information extraction from an approximation perspective, with a theoretical characterization on the trade-off between the number of heads and head dimension under a fixed parameter budget. In addition, we uncover and prove the \emph{saturation} behavior of softmax activations: Continuously increasing head dimensions can lead to diminishing returns in learning errors, particularly for long sequences. Supported by both theory and experiments, this saturation pattern suggests that later layers can operate more efficiently with reduced parameters. Combining these insights, we propose principled strategies for allocating attention heads and dimensions across Transformers' layers, shedding light on theoretically-grounded model efficiency of Transformer-based architectures.</description>

      <title>Robust Batched Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The batched multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, in which rewards are collected in batches, is crucial for applications such as clinical trials. Existing research predominantly assumes light-tailed reward distributions, yet many real-world scenarios, including clinical outcomes, exhibit heavy-tailed characteristics. This paper bridges this gap by proposing robust batched bandit algorithms designed for heavy-tailed rewards, within both finite-arm and Lipschitz-continuous settings. We reveal a surprising phenomenon: in the instance-independent regime, as well as in the Lipschitz setting, heavier-tailed rewards necessitate a smaller number of batches to achieve near-optimal regret. In stark contrast, for the instance-dependent setting, the required number of batches to attain near-optimal regret remains invariant with respect to tail heaviness.</description>

      <title>TROLL: Trust Regions improve Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) with PPO-like clip objectives has become the standard choice for reward-based fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). Although recent work has explored improved estimators of advantages and normalization, the clipping mechanism itself has remained untouched. Originally introduced as a proxy for principled KL-based trust regions, clipping is a crude approximation that often causes unstable updates and suboptimal performance. We replace the clip objective with a novel discrete differentiable trust region projection, which provides principled token-level KL constraints. The projection operates on a sparse subset of the model's most important token logits to balance computational cost and projection effectiveness. Our approach, Trust Region Optimization for Large Language Models (TROLL), serves as a direct replacement for PPO-like clipping during training and does not alter the model's inference behavior. Across datasets, model families, and advantage-estimation methods, TROLL consistently outperforms PPO-like clipping in terms of training speed, stability, and final success rates.</description>

      <title>Proximal Diffusion Neural Sampler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of learning a diffusion-based neural sampler for drawing samples from an unnormalized target distribution can be viewed as a stochastic optimal control problem on path measures. However, the training of neural samplers can be challenging when the target distribution is multimodal with significant barriers separating the modes, potentially leading to mode collapse. We propose a framework named \textbf{Proximal Diffusion Neural Sampler (PDNS)} that addresses these challenges by tackling the stochastic optimal control problem via proximal point method on the space of path measures. PDNS decomposes the learning process into a series of simpler subproblems that create a path gradually approaching the desired distribution. This staged procedure traces a progressively refined path to the desired distribution and promotes thorough exploration across modes. For a practical and efficient realization, we instantiate each proximal step with a proximal weighted denoising cross-entropy (WDCE) objective. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of PDNS through extensive experiments on both continuous and discrete sampling tasks, including challenging scenarios in molecular dynamics and statistical physics.</description>

      <title>HOFLON: Hybrid Offline Learning and Online Optimization for Process Start-Up and Grade-Transition Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Start-ups and product grade-changes are critical steps in continuous-process plant operation, because any misstep immediately affects product quality and drives operational losses. These transitions have long relied on manual operation by a handful of expert operators, but the progressive retirement of that workforce is leaving plant owners without the tacit know-how needed to execute them consistently. In the absence of a process model, offline reinforcement learning (RL) promises to capture and even surpass human expertise by mining historical start-up and grade-change logs, yet standard offline RL struggles with distribution shift and value-overestimation whenever a learned policy ventures outside the data envelope. We introduce HOFLON (Hybrid Offline Learning + Online Optimization) to overcome those limitations. Offline, HOFLON learns (i) a latent data manifold that represents the feasible region spanned by past transitions and (ii) a long-horizon Q-critic that predicts the cumulative reward from state-action pairs. Online, it solves a one-step optimization problem that maximizes the Q-critic while penalizing deviations from the learned manifold and excessive rates of change in the manipulated variables. We test HOFLON on two industrial case studies: a polymerization reactor start-up and a paper-machine grade-change problem, and benchmark it against Implicit Q-Learning (IQL), a leading offline-RL algorithm. In both plants HOFLON not only surpasses IQL but also delivers, on average, better cumulative rewards than the best start-up or grade-change observed in the historical data, demonstrating its potential to automate transition operations beyond current expert capability.</description>

      <title>Technical note on Fisher Information for Robust Federated Cross-Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When training data are fragmented across batches or federated-learned across different geographic locations, trained models manifest performance degradation. That degradation partly owes to covariate shift induced by data having been fragmented across time and space and producing dissimilar empirical training distributions. Each fragment's distribution is slightly different to a hypothetical unfragmented training distribution of covariates, and to the single validation distribution. To address this problem, we propose Fisher Information for Robust fEderated validation (\textbf{FIRE}). This method accumulates fragmentation-induced covariate shift divergences from the global training distribution via an approximate Fisher information. That term, which we prove to be a more computationally-tractable estimate, is then used as a per-fragment loss penalty, enabling scalable distribution alignment. FIRE outperforms importance weighting benchmarks by $5.1\%$ at maximum and federated learning (FL) benchmarks by up to $5.3\%$ on shifted validation sets.</description>

      <title>Technical note on Sequential Test-Time Adaptation via Martingale-Driven Fisher Prompting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for M-FISHER, a method for sequential distribution shift detection and stable adaptation in streaming data. For detection, we construct an exponential martingale from non-conformity scores and apply Ville's inequality to obtain time-uniform guarantees on false alarm control, ensuring statistical validity at any stopping time. Under sustained shifts, we further bound the expected detection delay as $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\delta)/\Gamma)$, where $\Gamma$ reflects the post-shift information gain, thereby linking detection efficiency to distributional divergence. For adaptation, we show that Fisher-preconditioned updates of prompt parameters implement natural gradient descent on the distributional manifold, yielding locally optimal updates that minimize KL divergence while preserving stability and parameterization invariance. Together, these results establish M-FISHER as a principled approach for robust, anytime-valid detection and geometrically stable adaptation in sequential decision-making under covariate shift.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates a class of games with large strategy spaces, motivated by challenges in AI alignment and language games. We introduce the hidden game problem, where for each player, an unknown subset of strategies consistently yields higher rewards compared to the rest. The central question is whether efficient regret minimization algorithms can be designed to discover and exploit such hidden structures, leading to equilibrium in these subgames while maintaining rationality in general. We answer this question affirmatively by developing a composition of regret minimization techniques that achieve optimal external and swap regret bounds. Our approach ensures rapid convergence to correlated equilibria in hidden subgames, leveraging the hidden game structure for improved computational efficiency.</description>

Abstract: The recently introduced optimizer, Muon, has gained increasing attention due to its superior performance across a wide range of applications. However, its effectiveness in federated learning remains unexplored. To address this gap, this paper investigates the performance of Muon in the federated learning setting. Specifically, we propose a new algorithm, FedMuon, and establish its convergence rate for nonconvex problems. Our theoretical analysis reveals multiple favorable properties of FedMuon. In particular, due to its orthonormalized update direction, the learning rate of FedMuon is independent of problem-specific parameters, and, importantly, it can naturally accommodate heavy-tailed noise. The extensive experiments on a variety of neural network architectures validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scaling Needs Optimal Norm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in optimal hyperparameter transfer under model and dataset scaling, no unifying explanatory principle has been established. Using the Scion optimizer, we discover that joint optimal scaling across model and dataset sizes is governed by a single invariant: the operator norm of the output layer. Across models with up to 1.3B parameters trained on up to 138B tokens, the optimal learning rate/batch size pair $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$ consistently has the same operator norm value - a phenomenon we term norm transfer. This constant norm condition is necessary but not sufficient: while for each dataset size, multiple $(\eta, B)$ reach the optimal norm, only a unique $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$ achieves the best loss. As a sufficient condition, we provide the first measurement of $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$ scaling with dataset size for Scion, and find that the scaling rules are consistent with those of the Adam optimizer. Tuning per-layer-group learning rates also improves model performance, with the output layer being the most sensitive and hidden layers benefiting from lower learning rates. We provide practical insights on norm-guided optimal scaling and release our Distributed Scion (Disco) implementation with logs from over two thousand runs to support research on LLM training dynamics at scale.</description>

      <title>Analysis of kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo under the stochastic exponential Euler discretization from underdamped all the way to overdamped</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03949v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the kinetic Langevin dynamics is a popular approach for sampling from distributions, where only their unnormalized densities are available. Various discretizations of the kinetic Langevin dynamics have been considered, where the resulting algorithm is collectively referred to as the kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo (KLMC) or underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo. Specifically, the stochastic exponential Euler discretization, or exponential integrator for short, has previously been studied under strongly log-concave and log-Lipschitz smooth potentials via the synchronous Wasserstein coupling strategy. Existing analyses, however, impose restrictions on the parameters that do not explain the behavior of KLMC under various choices of parameters. In particular, all known results fail to hold in the overdamped regime, suggesting that the exponential integrator degenerates in the overdamped limit. In this work, we revisit the synchronous Wasserstein coupling analysis of KLMC with the exponential integrator. Our refined analysis results in Wasserstein contractions and bounds on the asymptotic bias that hold under weaker restrictions on the parameters, which assert that the exponential integrator is capable of stably simulating the kinetic Langevin dynamics in the overdamped regime, as long as proper time acceleration is applied.</description>

Yet on-policy algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer in early training: noisy gradients from low-quality rollouts lead to unstable updates and inefficient exploration. We introduce Slow-Fast Policy Optimization (SFPO), a simple yet efficient framework to address these limitations via decomposing each step into three stages: a short fast trajectory of inner steps on the same batch, a reposition mechanism to control off-policy drift, and a final slow correction. This reposition-before-update design preserves the objective and rollout process unchanged, making SFPO plug-compatible with existing policy-gradient pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFPO consistently improves stability, reduces rollouts, and accelerates convergence of reasoning RL training. Specifically, it outperforms GRPO by up to 2.80 points in average on math reasoning benchmarks. It also achieves up to 4.93\texttimes{} fewer rollouts and a 4.19\texttimes{} reduction in wall-clock time to match GRPO's best accuracy.</description>

      <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning in Large State Spaces: Algorithms and Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces the theory of offline reinforcement learning in large state spaces, where good policies are learned from historical data without online interactions with the environment. Key concepts introduced include expressivity assumptions on function approximation (e.g., Bellman completeness vs. realizability) and data coverage (e.g., all-policy vs. single-policy coverage). A rich landscape of algorithms and results is described, depending on the assumptions one is willing to make and the sample and computational complexity guarantees one wishes to achieve. We also discuss open questions and connections to adjacent areas.</description>

      <title>Don't Pass$\mathtt{@}k$: A Bayesian Framework for Large Language Model Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pass$@k$ is widely used to report performance for LLM reasoning, but it often yields unstable, misleading rankings, especially when the number of trials (samples) is limited and compute is constrained. We present a principled Bayesian evaluation framework that replaces Pass$@k$ and average accuracy over $N$ trials (avg$@N$) with posterior estimates of a model's underlying success probability and credible intervals, yielding stable rankings and a transparent decision rule for differences. Evaluation outcomes are modeled as categorical (not just 0/1) with a Dirichlet prior, giving closed-form expressions for the posterior mean and uncertainty of any weighted rubric and enabling the use of prior evidence when appropriate. Theoretically, under a uniform prior, the Bayesian posterior mean is order-equivalent to average accuracy (Pass$@1$), explaining its empirical robustness while adding principled uncertainty. Empirically, in simulations with known ground-truth success rates and on AIME'24/'25, HMMT'25, and BrUMO'25, the Bayesian/avg procedure achieves faster convergence and greater rank stability than Pass$@k$ and recent variants, enabling reliable comparisons at far smaller sample counts. The framework clarifies when observed gaps are statistically meaningful (non-overlapping credible intervals) versus noise, and it naturally extends to graded, rubric-based evaluations. Together, these results recommend replacing Pass$@k$ for LLM evaluation and ranking with a posterior-based, compute-efficient protocol that unifies binary and non-binary evaluation while making uncertainty explicit.

      <title>Probing Geometry of Next Token Prediction Using Cumulant Expansion of the Softmax Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a cumulant-expansion framework for quantifying how large language models (LLMs) internalize higher-order statistical structure during next-token prediction. By treating the softmax entropy of each layer's logit distribution as a perturbation around its "center" distribution, we derive closed-form cumulant observables that isolate successively higher-order correlations. Empirically, we track these cumulants in GPT-2 and Pythia models on Pile-10K prompts. (i) Structured prompts exhibit a characteristic rise-and-plateau profile across layers, whereas token-shuffled prompts remain flat, revealing the dependence of the cumulant profile on meaningful context. (ii) During training, all cumulants increase monotonically before saturating, directly visualizing the model's progression from capturing variance to learning skew, kurtosis, and higher-order statistical structures. (iii) Mathematical prompts show distinct cumulant signatures compared to general text, quantifying how models employ fundamentally different processing mechanisms for mathematical versus linguistic content. Together, these results establish cumulant analysis as a lightweight, mathematically grounded probe of feature-learning dynamics in high-dimensional neural networks.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic-Mean $\mu$P for Modern Architectures: A Unified Learning-Rate Scale for CNNs and ResNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Choosing an appropriate learning rate remains a key challenge in scaling depth of modern deep networks. The classical maximal update parameterization ($\mu$P) enforces a fixed per-layer update magnitude, which is well suited to homogeneous multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) but becomes ill-posed in heterogeneous architectures where residual accumulation and convolutions introduce imbalance across layers. We introduce Arithmetic-Mean $\mu$P (AM-$\mu$P), which constrains not each individual layer but the network-wide average one-step pre-activation second moment to a constant scale. Combined with a residual-aware He fan-in initialization - scaling residual-branch weights by the number of blocks ($\mathrm{Var}[W]=c/(K\cdot \mathrm{fan\text{-}in})$) - AM-$\mu$P yields width-robust depth laws that transfer consistently across depths. We prove that, for one- and two-dimensional convolutional networks, the maximal-update learning rate satisfies $\eta^\star(L)\propto L^{-3/2}$; with zero padding, boundary effects are constant-level as $N\gg k$. For standard residual networks with general conv+MLP blocks, we establish $\eta^\star(L)=\Theta(L^{-3/2})$, with $L$ the minimal depth. Empirical results across a range of depths confirm the $-3/2$ scaling law and enable zero-shot learning-rate transfer, providing a unified and practical LR principle for convolutional and deep residual networks without additional tuning overhead.</description>

      <title>Score-based generative emulation of impact-relevant Earth system model outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy targets evolve faster than the Couple Model Intercomparison Project cycles, complicating adaptation and mitigation planning that must often contend with outdated projections. Climate model output emulators address this gap by offering inexpensive surrogates that can rapidly explore alternative futures while staying close to Earth System Model (ESM) behavior. We focus on emulators designed to provide inputs to impact models. Using monthly ESM fields of near-surface temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and wind speed, we show that deep generative models have the potential to model jointly the distribution of variables relevant for impacts. The specific model we propose uses score-based diffusion on a spherical mesh and runs on a single mid-range graphical processing unit. We introduce a thorough suite of diagnostics to compare emulator outputs with their parent ESMs, including their probability densities, cross-variable correlations, time of emergence, or tail behavior. We evaluate performance across three distinct ESMs in both pre-industrial and forced regimes. The results show that the emulator produces distributions that closely match the ESM outputs and captures key forced responses. They also reveal important failure cases, notably for variables with a strong regime shift in the seasonal cycle. Although not a perfect match to the ESM, the inaccuracies of the emulator are small relative to the scale of internal variability in ESM projections. We therefore argue that it shows potential to be useful in supporting impact assessment. We discuss priorities for future development toward daily resolution, finer spatial scales, and bias-aware training. Code is made available at https://github.com/shahineb/climemu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present spd-metrics-id, a Python package for computing distances and divergences between symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices. Unlike traditional toolkits that focus on specific applications, spd-metrics-id provides a unified, extensible, and reproducible framework for SPD distance computation. The package supports a wide variety of geometry-aware metrics, including Alpha-z Bures-Wasserstein, Alpha-Procrustes, affine-invariant Riemannian, log-Euclidean, and others, and is accessible both via a command-line interface and a Python API. Reproducibility is ensured through Docker images and Zenodo archiving. We illustrate usage through a connectome fingerprinting example, but the package is broadly applicable to covariance analysis, diffusion tensor imaging, and other domains requiring SPD matrix comparison. The package is openly available at https://pypi.org/project/spd-metrics-id/.</description>

      <title>Domain Generalization: A Tale of Two ERMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) is the problem of generalizing from several distributions (or domains), for which labeled training data are available, to a new test domain for which no labeled data is available. A common finding in the DG literature is that it is difficult to outperform empirical risk minimization (ERM) on the pooled training data.
  In this work, we argue that this finding has primarily been reported for datasets satisfying a \emph{covariate shift} assumption. When the dataset satisfies a \emph{posterior drift} assumption instead, we show that ``domain-informed ERM,'' wherein feature vectors are augmented with domain-specific information, outperforms pooling ERM. These claims are supported by a theoretical framework and experiments on language and vision tasks.</description>

      <title>Inverse Mixed-Integer Programming: Learning Constraints then Objective Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In mixed-integer linear programming, data-driven inverse optimization that learns the objective function and the constraints from observed data plays an important role in constructing appropriate mathematical models for various fields, including power systems and scheduling. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no known method for learning both the objective functions and the constraints. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method for a class of problems where the objective function is expressed as a linear combination of functions and the constraints are represented by functions and thresholds. Specifically, our method first learns the constraints and then learns the objective function. On the theoretical side, we show the proposed method can solve inverse optimization problems in finite dataset, develop statistical learning theory in pseudometric spaces and sub-Gaussian distributions, and construct a statistical learning for inverse optimization. On the experimental side, we demonstrate that our method is practically applicable for scheduling problems formulated as integer linear programmings with up to 100 decision variables, which are typical in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Two new approaches to multiple canonical correlation analysis for repeated measures data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical canonical correlation analysis (CCA), the goal is to determine the linear transformations of two random vectors into two new random variables that are most strongly correlated. Canonical variables are pairs of these new random variables, while canonical correlations are correlations between these pairs. In this paper, we propose and study two generalizations of this classical method:
  (1) Instead of two random vectors we study more complex data structures that appear in important applications. In these structures, there are $L$ features, each described by $p_l$ scalars, $1 \le l \le L$. We observe $n$ such objects over $T$ time points. We derive a suitable analog of the CCA for such data. Our approach relies on embeddings into Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, and covers several related data structures as well.
  (2) We develop an analogous approach for multidimensional random processes. In this case, the experimental units are multivariate continuous, square-integrable functions over a given interval. These functions are modeled as elements of a Hilbert space, so in this case, we define the multiple functional canonical correlation analysis, MFCCA.
  We justify our approaches by their application to two data sets and suitable large sample theory. We derive consistency rates for the related transformation and correlation estimators, and show that it is possible to relax two common assumptions on the compactness of the underlying cross-covariance operators and the independence of the data.</description>

      <title>Demystifying MaskGIT Sampler and Beyond: Adaptive Order Selection in Masked Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masked diffusion models have shown promising performance in generating high-quality samples in a wide range of domains, but accelerating their sampling process remains relatively underexplored. To investigate efficient samplers for masked diffusion, this paper theoretically analyzes the MaskGIT sampler for image modeling, revealing its implicit temperature sampling mechanism. Through this analysis, we introduce the "moment sampler," an asymptotically equivalent but more tractable and interpretable alternative to MaskGIT, which employs a "choose-then-sample" approach by selecting unmasking positions before sampling tokens. In addition, we improve the efficiency of choose-then-sample algorithms through two key innovations: a partial caching technique for transformers that approximates longer sampling trajectories without proportional computational cost, and a hybrid approach formalizing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in adaptive unmasking. Experiments in image and text domains demonstrate our theory as well as the efficiency of our proposed methods, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of masked diffusion samplers.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Tabular Deep Learning Should Learn Feature Interactions, Not Just Make Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent progress, deep learning methods for tabular data still struggle to compete with traditional tree-based models. A key challenge lies in modeling complex, dataset-specific feature interactions that are central to tabular data. Graph-based tabular deep learning (GTDL) methods aim to address this by representing features and their interactions as graphs. However, existing methods predominantly optimize predictive accuracy, neglecting accurate modeling of the graph structure. This position paper argues that GTDL should move beyond prediction-centric objectives and prioritize the explicit learning and evaluation of feature interactions. Using synthetic datasets with known ground-truth graph structures, we show that existing GTDL methods fail to recover meaningful feature interactions. Moreover, enforcing the true interaction structure improves predictive performance. This highlights the need for GTDL methods to prioritize quantitative evaluation and accurate structural learning. We call for a shift toward structure-aware modeling as a foundation for building GTDL systems that are not only accurate but also interpretable, trustworthy, and grounded in domain understanding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a key building block of modern large language models, yet its theoretical mechanisms remain poorly understood. It is particularly mysterious how ICL operates in real-world applications where tasks have a common structure. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing a linear attention model trained on low-rank regression tasks. Within this setting, we precisely characterize the distribution of predictions and the generalization error in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we find that statistical fluctuations in finite pre-training data induce an implicit regularization. Finally, we identify a sharp phase transition of the generalization error governed by task structure. These results provide a framework for understanding how transformers learn to learn the task structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have made significant advances in generating complex content, yet conditional generation remains a fundamental challenge. Existing conditional generative adversarial networks often struggle to balance the dual objectives of assessing authenticity and conditional alignment of input samples within their conditional discriminators. To address this, we propose a novel discriminator design that integrates three key capabilities: unconditional discrimination, matching-aware supervision to enhance alignment sensitivity, and adaptive weighting to dynamically balance all objectives. Specifically, we introduce Sum of Naturalness and Alignment (SONA), which employs separate projections for naturalness (authenticity) and alignment in the final layer with an inductive bias, supported by dedicated objective functions and an adaptive weighting mechanism. Extensive experiments on class-conditional generation tasks show that \ours achieves superior sample quality and conditional alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effectiveness in text-to-image generation, confirming the versatility and robustness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Busemann Functions in the Wasserstein Space: Existence, Closed-Forms, and Applications to Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Busemann function has recently found much interest in a variety of geometric machine learning problems, as it naturally defines projections onto geodesic rays of Riemannian manifolds and generalizes the notion of hyperplanes. As several sources of data can be conveniently modeled as probability distributions, it is natural to study this function in the Wasserstein space, which carries a rich formal Riemannian structure induced by Optimal Transport metrics. In this work, we investigate the existence and computation of Busemann functions in Wasserstein space, which admits geodesic rays. We establish closed-form expressions in two important cases: one-dimensional distributions and Gaussian measures. These results enable explicit projection schemes for probability distributions on $\mathbb{R}$, which in turn allow us to define novel Sliced-Wasserstein distances over Gaussian mixtures and labeled datasets.

      <title>Closed-Form Last Layer Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are typically optimized with variants of stochastic gradient descent. Under a squared loss, however, the optimal solution to the linear last layer weights is known in closed-form. We propose to leverage this during optimization, treating the last layer as a function of the backbone parameters, and optimizing solely for these parameters. We show this is equivalent to alternating between gradient descent steps on the backbone and closed-form updates on the last layer. We adapt the method for the setting of stochastic gradient descent, by trading off the loss on the current batch against the accumulated information from previous batches. Further, we prove that, in the Neural Tangent Kernel regime, convergence of this method to an optimal solution is guaranteed. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared with standard SGD on a squared loss in several supervised tasks -- both regression and classification -- including Fourier Neural Operators and Instrumental Variable Regression.</description>

      <title>On decomposability and subdifferential of the tensor nuclear norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the decomposability and the subdifferential of the tensor nuclear norm. Both concepts are well understood and widely applied in matrices but remain unclear for higher-order tensors. We show that the tensor nuclear norm admits a full decomposability over specific subspaces and determine the largest possible subspaces that allow the full decomposability. We derive novel inclusions of the subdifferential of the tensor nuclear norm and study its subgradients in a variety of subspaces of interest. All the results hold for tensors of an arbitrary order. As an immediate application, we establish the statistical performance of the tensor robust principal component analysis, the first such result for tensors of an arbitrary order.</description>

      <title>When Do Credal Sets Stabilize? Fixed-Point Theorems for Credal Set Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many machine learning algorithms rely on iterative updates of uncertainty representations, ranging from variational inference and expectation-maximization, to reinforcement learning, continual learning, and multi-agent learning. In the presence of imprecision and ambiguity, credal sets -- closed, convex sets of probability distributions -- have emerged as a popular framework for representing imprecise probabilistic beliefs. Under such imprecision, many learning problems in imprecise probabilistic machine learning (IPML) may be viewed as processes involving successive applications of update rules on credal sets. This naturally raises the question of whether this iterative process converges to stable fixed points -- or, more generally, under what conditions on the updating mechanism such fixed points exist, and whether they can be attained. We provide the first analysis of this problem and illustrate our findings using Credal Bayesian Deep Learning as a concrete example. Our work demonstrates that incorporating imprecision into the learning process not only enriches the representation of uncertainty, but also reveals structural conditions under which stability emerges, thereby offering new insights into the dynamics of iterative learning under imprecision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between discrete analogues of Ricci and scalar curvature that are defined for point clouds and graphs. In the discrete setting, Ricci curvature is replaced by Ollivier-Ricci curvature. Scalar curvature can be computed as the trace of Ricci curvature for a Riemannian manifold; this motivates a new definition of a scalar version of Ollivier-Ricci curvature. We show that our definition converges to scalar curvature for nearest neighbor graphs obtained by sampling from a manifold. We also prove some new results about the convergence of Ollivier-Ricci curvature to Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>On Structured State-Space Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured State-Space Duality (SSD) [Dao &amp; Gu, ICML 2024] is an equivalence between a simple Structured State-Space Model (SSM) and a masked attention mechanism. In particular, a state-space model with a scalar-times-identity state matrix is equivalent to a masked self-attention with a $1$-semiseparable causal mask. Consequently, the same sequence transformation (model) has two algorithmic realizations: as a linear-time $O(T)$ recurrence or as a quadratic-time $O(T^2)$ attention. In this note, we formalize and generalize this duality: (i) we extend SSD from the scalar-identity case to general diagonal SSMs (diagonal state matrices); (ii) we show that these diagonal SSMs match the scalar case's training complexity lower bounds while supporting richer dynamics; (iii) we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which an SSM is equivalent to $1$-semiseparable masked attention; and (iv) we show that such duality fails to extend to standard softmax attention due to rank explosion. Together, these results tighten bridge between recurrent SSMs and Transformers, and widen the design space for expressive yet efficient sequence models.</description>

      <title>Reinforce-Ada: An Adaptive Sampling Framework for Reinforce-Style LLM Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks is often bottlenecked by unstable gradient estimates due to fixed and uniform sampling of responses across prompts. Prior work such as GVM-RAFT addresses this by dynamically allocating inference budget per prompt to minimize stochastic gradient variance under a budget constraint. Inspired by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Ada, an adaptive sampling framework for online RL post-training of LLMs that continuously reallocates sampling effort to the prompts with the greatest uncertainty or learning potential. Unlike conventional two-stage allocation methods, Reinforce-Ada interleaves estimation and sampling in an online successive elimination process, and automatically stops sampling for a prompt once sufficient signal is collected. To stabilize updates, we form fixed-size groups with enforced reward diversity and compute advantage baselines using global statistics aggregated over the adaptive sampling phase. Empirical results across multiple model architectures and reasoning benchmarks show that Reinforce-Ada accelerates convergence and improves final performance compared to GRPO, especially when using the balanced sampling variant. Our work highlights the central role of variance-aware, adaptive data curation in enabling efficient and reliable reinforcement learning for reasoning-capable LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/RLHFlow/Reinforce-Ada.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Langevin Thompson Sampling from A Stochastic Approximation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing approximate Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithms for multi-armed bandits use Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) or its variants in each round to sample from the posterior, relaxing the need for conjugacy assumptions between priors and reward distributions in vanilla TS. However, they often require approximating a different posterior distribution in different round of the bandit problem. This requires tricky, round-specific tuning of hyperparameters such as dynamic learning rates, causing challenges in both theoretical analysis and practical implementation. To alleviate this non-stationarity, we introduce TS-SA, which incorporates stochastic approximation (SA) within the TS framework. In each round, TS-SA constructs a posterior approximation only using the most recent reward(s), performs a Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) update, and applies an SA step to average noisy proposals over time. This can be interpreted as approximating a stationary posterior target throughout the entire algorithm, which further yields a fixed step-size, a unified convergence analysis framework, and improved posterior estimates through temporal averaging. We establish near-optimal regret bounds for TS-SA, with a simplified and more intuitive theoretical analysis enabled by interpreting the entire algorithm as a simulation of a stationary SGLD process. Our empirical results demonstrate that even a single-step Langevin update with certain warm-up outperforms existing methods substantially on bandit tasks.</description>

      <title>ResCP: Reservoir Conformal Prediction for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction offers a powerful framework for building distribution-free prediction intervals for exchangeable data. Existing methods that extend conformal prediction to sequential data rely on fitting a relatively complex model to capture temporal dependencies. However, these methods can fail if the sample size is small and often require expensive retraining when the underlying data distribution changes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Reservoir Conformal Prediction (ResCP), a novel training-free conformal prediction method for time series. Our approach leverages the efficiency and representation learning capabilities of reservoir computing to dynamically reweight conformity scores. In particular, we compute similarity scores among reservoir states and use them to adaptively reweight the observed residuals at each step. With this approach, ResCP enables us to account for local temporal dynamics when modeling the error distribution without compromising computational scalability. We prove that, under reasonable assumptions, ResCP achieves asymptotic conditional coverage, and we empirically demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse forecasting tasks.</description>

      <title>TopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning via Persistent Rationale Filtration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success across various scientific fields, yet their adoption in critical decision-making is often hindered by a lack of interpretability. Recently, intrinsically interpretable GNNs have been studied to provide insights into model predictions by identifying rationale substructures in graphs. However, existing methods face challenges when the underlying rationale subgraphs are complex and varied. In this work, we propose TopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning, a novel topological framework that leverages persistent homology to identify persistent rationale subgraphs. TopInG employs a rationale filtration learning approach to model an autoregressive generation process of rationale subgraphs, and introduces a self-adjusted topological constraint, termed topological discrepancy, to enforce a persistent topological distinction between rationale subgraphs and irrelevant counterparts. We provide theoretical guarantees that our loss function is uniquely optimized by the ground truth under specific conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate TopInG's effectiveness in tackling key challenges, such as handling variform rationale subgraphs, balancing predictive performance with interpretability, and mitigating spurious correlations. Results show that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art methods on both predictive accuracy and interpretation quality.</description>

      <title>Mixtures of Gaussian Process Experts with SMC$^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian processes are a key component of many flexible statistical and machine learning models. However, they exhibit cubic computational complexity and high memory constraints due to the need of inverting and storing a full covariance matrix. To circumvent this, mixtures of Gaussian process experts have been considered where data points are assigned to independent experts, reducing the complexity by allowing inference based on smaller, local covariance matrices. Moreover, mixtures of Gaussian process experts substantially enrich the model's flexibility, allowing for behaviors such as non-stationarity, heteroscedasticity, and discontinuities. In this work, we construct a novel inference approach based on nested sequential Monte Carlo samplers to simultaneously infer both the gating network and Gaussian process expert parameters. This greatly improves inference compared to importance sampling, particularly in settings when a stationary Gaussian process is inappropriate, while still being thoroughly parallelizable.</description>

Abstract: We develop a fitted value iteration (FVI) method to compute bicausal optimal transport (OT) where couplings have an adapted structure. Based on the dynamic programming formulation, FVI adopts a function class to approximate the value functions in bicausal OT. Under the concentrability condition and approximate completeness assumption, we prove the sample complexity using (local) Rademacher complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that multilayer neural networks with appropriate structures satisfy the crucial assumptions required in sample complexity proofs. Numerical experiments reveal that FVI outperforms linear programming and adapted Sinkhorn methods in scalability as the time horizon increases, while still maintaining acceptable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Sharp Generalization for Nonparametric Regression in Interpolation Space by Over-Parameterized Neural Networks Trained with Preconditioned Gradient Descent and Early Stopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11353v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonparametric regression using an over-parameterized two-layer neural networks trained with algorithmic guarantees in this paper. We consider the setting where the training features are drawn uniformly from the unit sphere in $\RR^d$, and the target function lies in an interpolation space commonly studied in statistical learning theory. We demonstrate that training the neural network with a novel Preconditioned Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm, equipped with early stopping, achieves a sharp regression rate of $\cO(n^{-\frac{2\alpha s'}{2\alpha s'+1}})$ when the target function is in the interpolation space $\bth{\cH_K}^{s'}$ with $s' \ge 3$. This rate is even sharper than the currently known nearly-optimal rate of $\cO(n^{-\frac{2\alpha s'}{2\alpha s'+1}})\log^2(1/\delta)$~\citep{Li2024-edr-general-domain}, where $n$ is the size of the training data and $\delta \in (0,1)$ is a small probability. This rate is also sharper than the standard kernel regression rate of $\cO(n^{-\frac{2\alpha}{2\alpha+1}})$ obtained under the regular Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime when training the neural network with the vanilla gradient descent (GD), where $2\alpha = d/(d-1)$. Our analysis is based on two key technical contributions. First, we present a principled decomposition of the network output at each PGD step into a function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of a newly induced integral kernel, and a residual function with small $L^{\infty}$-norm. Second, leveraging this decomposition, we apply local Rademacher complexity theory to tightly control the complexity of the function class comprising all the neural network functions obtained in the PGD iterates. Our results further suggest that PGD enables the neural network to escape the linear NTK regime and achieve improved generalization.</description>

      <title>Universality of Kernel Random Matrices and Kernel Regression in the Quadratic Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a popular class of machine learning models that has become an important tool for understanding deep learning. Much of the focus thus far has been on studying the proportional asymptotic regime, $n \asymp d$, where $n$ is the number of training samples and $d$ is the dimension of the dataset. In the proportional regime, under certain conditions on the data distribution, the kernel random matrix involved in KRR exhibits behavior akin to that of a linear kernel. In this work, we extend the study of kernel regression to the quadratic asymptotic regime, where $n \asymp d^2$. In this regime, we demonstrate that a broad class of inner-product kernels exhibits behavior similar to a quadratic kernel. Specifically, we establish an operator norm approximation bound for the difference between the original kernel random matrix and a quadratic kernel random matrix with additional correction terms compared to the Taylor expansion of the kernel functions. The approximation works for general data distributions under a Gaussian-moment-matching assumption with a covariance structure. This new approximation is utilized to obtain a limiting spectral distribution of the original kernel matrix and characterize the precise asymptotic training and test errors for KRR in the quadratic regime when $n/d^2$ converges to a non-zero constant. The generalization errors are obtained for (i) a random teacher model, (ii) a deterministic teacher model where the weights are perfectly aligned with the covariance of the data. Under the random teacher model setting, we also verify that the generalized cross-validation (GCV) estimator can consistently estimate the generalization error in the quadratic regime for anisotropic data. Our proof techniques combine moment methods, Wick's formula, orthogonal polynomials, and resolvent analysis of random matrices with correlated entries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the approximation capacity of deep ReLU recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and explore the convergence properties of nonparametric least squares regression using RNNs. We derive upper bounds on the approximation error of RNNs for H\"older smooth functions, in the sense that the output at each time step of an RNN can approximate a H\"older function that depends only on past and current information, termed a past-dependent function. This allows a carefully constructed RNN to simultaneously approximate a sequence of past-dependent H\"older functions. We apply these approximation results to derive non-asymptotic upper bounds for the prediction error of the empirical risk minimizer in regression problem. Our error bounds achieve minimax optimal rate under both exponentially $\beta$-mixing and i.i.d. data assumptions, improving upon existing ones. Our results provide statistical guarantees on the performance of RNNs.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual explainability and analysis of variance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing tools for explaining complex models and systems are associational rather than causal and do not provide mechanistic understanding. We propose a new notion called counterfactual explainability for causal attribution that is motivated by the concept of genetic heritability in twin studies. Counterfactual explainability extends methods for global sensitivity analysis (including the functional analysis of variance and Sobol's indices), which assumes independent explanatory variables, to dependent explanations by using a directed acyclic graphs to describe their causal relationship. Therefore, this explanability measure directly incorporates causal mechanisms by construction. Under a comonotonicity assumption, we discuss methods for estimating counterfactual explainability and apply them to a real dataset dataset to explain income inequality by gender, race, and educational attainment.</description>

      <title>Another look at inference after prediction</title>

Abstract: From structural biology to epidemiology, predictions from machine learning (ML) models increasingly complement costly gold-standard data to enable faster, more affordable, and scalable scientific inquiry. In response, prediction-based (PB) inference has emerged to accommodate statistical analysis using a large volume of predictions together with a small amount of gold-standard data. The goals of PB inference are two-fold: (i) to mitigate bias from errors in predictions and (ii) to improve efficiency relative to classical inference using only the gold-standard data. While early PB inference methods focused on bias, their ability to enhance efficiency remains a focus of ongoing research. We revisit a foundational PB inference method and show that a simple modification can be applied to guarantee provable improvements in efficiency. In doing so, we establish new connections between augmented inverse probability weighted estimators (AIPW) and several recently proposed PB inference methods with a similar focus. The utility of our proposal, which leverages prediction-based outcomes to enhance efficiency, is demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and an application to real data from the UK Biobank. Further, we contextualize PB inference by drawing connections to historical literature from economics and statistics, highlighting how classic methods directly inform this contemporary problem.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Hypothesis Testing Framework for Data Misappropriation Detection in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly gaining enormous popularity in recent years. However, the training of LLMs has raised significant privacy and legal concerns, particularly regarding the distillation and inclusion of copyrighted materials in their training data without proper attribution or licensing, an issue that falls under the broader concern of data misappropriation. In this article, we focus on a specific problem of data misappropriation detection, namely, to determine whether a given LLM has incorporated the data generated by another LLM. We propose embedding watermarks into the copyrighted training data and formulating the detection of data misappropriation as a hypothesis testing problem. We develop a general statistical testing framework, construct test statistics, determine optimal rejection thresholds, and explicitly control type I and type II errors. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic optimality properties of the proposed tests, and demonstrate the empirical effectiveness through intensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparsification of Simplicial Complexes via Local Densities of States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simplicial complexes (SCs) have become a popular abstraction for analyzing complex data using tools from topological data analysis or topological signal processing. However, the analysis of many real-world datasets often leads to dense SCs, with many higher-order simplicies, which results in prohibitive computational requirements in terms of time and memory consumption. The sparsification of such complexes is thus of broad interest, i.e., the approximation of an original SC with a sparser surrogate SC (with typically only a log-linear number of simplices) that maintains the spectrum of the original SC as closely as possible. In this work, we develop a novel method for a probabilistic sparsification of SCs that uses so-called local densities of states. Using this local densities of states, we can efficiently approximate so-called generalized effective resistance of each simplex, which is proportional to the required sampling probability for the sparsification of the SC. To avoid degenerate structures in the spectrum of the corresponding Hodge Laplacian operators, we suggest a ``kernel-ignoring'' decomposition to approximate the sampling probability. Additionally, we utilize certain error estimates to characterize the asymptotic algorithmic complexity of the developed method. We demonstrate the performance of our framework on a family of Vietoris--Rips filtered simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Vector Copula Variational Inference and Dependent Block Posterior Approximations</title>

Abstract: The key to VI is the selection of a tractable density to approximate the Bayesian posterior. For large and complex models a common choice is to assume independence between multivariate blocks in a partition of the parameter space. While this simplifies the problem it can reduce accuracy. This paper proposes using vector copulas to capture dependence between the blocks parsimoniously. Tailored multivariate marginals are constructed using learnable transport maps. We call the resulting joint distribution a ``dependent block posterior'' approximation. Vector copula models are suggested that make tractable and flexible variational approximations. They allow for differing marginals, numbers of blocks, block sizes and forms of between block dependence. They also allow for solution of the variational optimization using efficient stochastic gradient methods. The approach is demonstrated using four different statistical models and 16 datasets which have posteriors that are challenging to approximate. This includes models that use global-local shrinkage priors for regularization, and hierarchical models for smoothing and heteroscedastic time series. In all cases, our method produces more accurate posterior approximations than benchmark VI methods that either assume block independence or factor-based dependence, at limited additional computational cost. A python package implementing the method is available on GitHub at https://github.com/YuFuOliver/VCVI_Rep_PyPackage.</description>

      <title>Graph Alignment via Birkhoff Relaxation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the graph alignment problem, wherein the objective is to find a vertex correspondence between two graphs that maximizes the edge overlap. The graph alignment problem is an instance of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), known to be NP-hard in the worst case even to approximately solve. In this paper, we analyze Birkhoff relaxation, a tight convex relaxation of QAP, and present theoretical guarantees on its performance when the inputs follow the Gaussian Wigner Model. More specifically, the weighted adjacency matrices are correlated Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble with correlation $1/\sqrt{1+\sigma^2}$. Denote the optimal solutions of the QAP and Birkhoff relaxation by $\Pi^\star$ and $X^\star$ respectively. We show that $\|X^\star-\Pi^\star\|_F^2 = o(n)$ when $\sigma = o(n^{-1.25})$ and $\|X^\star-\Pi^\star\|_F^2 = \Omega(n)$ when $\sigma = \Omega(n^{-0.5})$. Thus, the optimal solution $X^\star$ transitions from a small perturbation of $\Pi^\star$ for small $\sigma$ to being well separated from $\Pi^\star$ as $\sigma$ becomes larger than $n^{-0.5}$. This result allows us to guarantee that simple rounding procedures on $X^\star$ align $1-o(1)$ fraction of vertices correctly whenever $\sigma = o(n^{-1.25})$. This condition on $\sigma$ to ensure the success of the Birkhoff relaxation is state-of-the-art.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates the expected number of critical points of random neural networks with different activation functions as the depth increases in the infinite-width limit. Under suitable regularity conditions, we derive precise asymptotic formulas for the expected number of critical points of fixed index and those exceeding a given threshold. Our analysis reveals three distinct regimes depending on the value of the first derivative of the covariance evaluated at 1: the expected number of critical points may converge, grow polynomially, or grow exponentially with depth. The theoretical predictions are supported by numerical experiments. Moreover, we provide numerical evidence suggesting that, when the regularity condition is not satisfied (e.g. for neural networks with ReLU as activation function), the number of critical points increases as the map resolution increases, indicating a potential divergence in the number of critical points.</description>

      <title>Uniform convergence of the smooth calibration error and its relationship with functional gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19396v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calibration is a critical requirement for reliable probabilistic prediction, especially in high-risk applications. However, the theoretical understanding of which learning algorithms can simultaneously achieve high accuracy and good calibration remains limited, and many existing studies provide empirical validation or a theoretical guarantee in restrictive settings. To address this issue, in this work, we focus on the smooth calibration error (CE) and provide a uniform convergence bound, showing that the smooth CE is bounded by the sum of the smooth CE over the training dataset and a generalization gap. We further prove that the functional gradient of the loss function can effectively control the training smooth CE. Based on this framework, we analyze three representative algorithms: gradient boosting trees, kernel boosting, and two-layer neural networks. For each, we derive conditions under which both classification and calibration performances are simultaneously guaranteed. Our results offer new theoretical insights and practical guidance for designing reliable probabilistic models with provable calibration guarantees.</description>

      <title>A Copula Based Supervised Filter for Feature Selection in Diabetes Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective feature selection is vital for robust and interpretable medical prediction, especially for identifying risk factors concentrated in extreme patient strata. Standard methods emphasize average associations and may miss predictors whose importance lies in the tails of the distribution. We propose a computationally efficient supervised filter that ranks features using the Gumbel copula upper tail dependence coefficient ($\lambda_U$), prioritizing variables that are simultaneously extreme with the positive class. We benchmarked against Mutual Information, mRMR, ReliefF, and $L_1$ Elastic Net across four classifiers on two diabetes datasets: a large public health survey (CDC, N=253,680) and a clinical benchmark (PIMA, N=768). Evaluation included paired statistical tests, permutation importance, and robustness checks with label flips, feature noise, and missingness. On CDC, our method was the fastest selector and reduced the feature space by about 52% while retaining strong discrimination. Although using all 21 features yielded the highest AUC, our filter significantly outperformed Mutual Information and mRMR and was statistically indistinguishable from ReliefF. On PIMA, with only eight predictors, our ranking produced the numerically highest ROC AUC, and no significant differences were found versus strong baselines. Across both datasets, the upper tail criterion consistently identified clinically coherent, impactful predictors. We conclude that copula based feature selection via upper tail dependence is a powerful, efficient, and interpretable approach for building risk models in public health and clinical medicine.</description>

      <title>Probably Approximately Correct Labels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labeled datasets is often costly, requiring either human annotation or expensive experiments. In theory, powerful pre-trained AI models provide an opportunity to automatically label datasets and save costs. Unfortunately, these models come with no guarantees on their accuracy, making wholesale replacement of manual labeling impractical. In this work, we propose a method for leveraging pre-trained AI models to curate cost-effective and high-quality datasets. In particular, our approach results in probably approximately correct labels: with high probability, the overall labeling error is small. Our method is nonasymptotically valid under minimal assumptions on the dataset or the AI model being studied, and thus enables rigorous yet efficient dataset curation using modern AI models. We demonstrate the benefits of the methodology through text annotation with large language models, image labeling with pre-trained vision models, and protein folding analysis with AlphaFold.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction for Long-Tailed Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world classification problems, such as plant identification, have extremely long-tailed class distributions. In order for prediction sets to be useful in such settings, they should (i) provide good class-conditional coverage, ensuring that rare classes are not systematically omitted from the prediction sets, and (ii) be a reasonable size, allowing users to easily verify candidate labels. Unfortunately, existing conformal prediction methods, when applied to the long-tailed setting, force practitioners to make a binary choice between small sets with poor class-conditional coverage or sets with very good class-conditional coverage but that are extremely large. We propose methods with guaranteed marginal coverage that smoothly trade off between set size and class-conditional coverage. First, we introduce a new conformal score function called prevalence-adjusted softmax that targets macro-coverage, a relaxed notion of class-conditional coverage. Second, we propose a new procedure that interpolates between marginal and class-conditional conformal prediction by linearly interpolating their conformal score thresholds. We demonstrate our methods on Pl@ntNet-300K and iNaturalist-2018, two long-tailed image datasets with 1,081 and 8,142 classes, respectively.</description>

      <title>MIBoost: A Gradient Boosting Algorithm for Variable Selection After Multiple Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21807v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical learning methods for automated variable selection, such as LASSO, elastic nets, or gradient boosting, have become increasingly popular tools for building powerful prediction models. Yet, in practice, analyses are often complicated by missing data. The most widely used approach to address missingness is multiple imputation, which involves creating several completed datasets. However, there is an ongoing debate on how to perform model selection in the presence of multiple imputed datasets. Simple strategies, such as pooling models across datasets, have been shown to have suboptimal properties. Although more sophisticated methods exist, they are often difficult to implement and therefore not widely applied. In contrast, two recent approaches modify the regularization methods LASSO and elastic nets by defining a single loss function, resulting in a unified set of coefficients across imputations. Our key contribution is to extend this principle to the framework of component-wise gradient boosting by proposing MIBoost, a novel algorithm that employs a uniform variable-selection mechanism across imputed datasets. Simulation studies suggest that our approach yields prediction performance comparable to that of these recently proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Improving Shampoo and SOAP via Kullback-Leibler Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shampoo and its efficient variant, SOAP, employ structured second-moment estimations and have shown strong performance for training neural networks (NNs). In practice, however, Shampoo typically requires step-size grafting with Adam to be competitive, and SOAP mitigates this by applying Adam in Shampoo's eigenbasis -- at the cost of additional memory overhead from Adam in both methods. Prior analyses have largely relied on the Frobenius norm to motivate these estimation schemes. We instead recast their estimation procedures as covariance estimation under Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization, revealing a previously overlooked theoretical limitation and motivating principled redesigns. Building on this perspective, we develop $\textbf{KL-Shampoo}$ and $\textbf{KL-SOAP}$, practical schemes that match or exceed the performance of Shampoo and SOAP in NN pre-training while achieving SOAP-level per-iteration runtime. Notably, KL-Shampoo does not rely on Adam to attain competitive performance, eliminating the memory overhead introduced by Adam. Across our experiments, KL-Shampoo consistently outperforms SOAP, Shampoo, and even KL-SOAP, establishing the KL-based approach as a compelling foundation for designing structured methods in NN optimization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on computing the convex conjugate (also known as the Legendre-Fenchel conjugate or c-transform) that appears in Euclidean Wasserstein-2 optimal transport. This conjugation is considered difficult to compute and in practice, methods are limited by not being able to exactly conjugate the dual potentials in continuous space. To overcome this, the computation of the conjugate can be approximated with amortized optimization, which learns a model to predict the conjugate. I show that combining amortized approximations to the conjugate with a solver for fine-tuning significantly improves the quality of transport maps learned for the Wasserstein-2 benchmark by Korotin et al. (2021a) and is able to model many 2-dimensional couplings and flows considered in the literature.

      <title>Quick Adaptive Ternary Segmentation: An Efficient Decoding Procedure For Hidden Markov Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are characterized by an unobservable Markov chain and an observable process -- a noisy version of the hidden chain. Decoding the original signal from the noisy observations is one of the main goals in nearly all HMM based data analyses. Existing decoding algorithms such as Viterbi and the pointwise maximum a posteriori (PMAP) algorithm have computational complexity at best linear in the length of the observed sequence, and sub-quadratic in the size of the state space of the hidden chain.
  We present Quick Adaptive Ternary Segmentation (QATS), a divide-and-conquer procedure with computational complexity polylogarithmic in the length of the sequence, and cubic in the size of the state space, hence particularly suited for large scale HMMs with relatively few states. It also suggests an effective way of data storage as specific cumulative sums. In essence, the estimated sequence of states sequentially maximizes local likelihood scores among all local paths with at most three segments, and is meanwhile admissible. The maximization is performed only approximately using an adaptive search procedure. Our simulations demonstrate the speedups offered by QATS in comparison to Viterbi and PMAP, along with a precision analysis. An implementation of QATS is in the R-package QATS on GitHub.</description>

      <title>What is Intelligence? A Cycle Closure Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What is intelligence? We argue for a structural-dynamical account rooted in a topological closure law: \emph{the boundary of a boundary vanishes} ($\partial^2=0$). This principle forces transient fragments to cancel while closed cycles persist as invariants, yielding the cascade $\partial^2\!=\!0 \Rightarrow \text{cycles (invariants)} \Rightarrow \text{memory} \Rightarrow \text{prediction (intelligence)}$. Prediction requires invariance: only order-invariant cycles can stabilize the predictive substrate. This motivates the \textbf{Structure-before-Specificity (SbS)} principle, where persistent structures ($\Phi$) must stabilize before contextual specificities ($\Psi$) can be meaningfully interpreted, and is formalized by the \textbf{Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP)}, which casts cognition as dynamic alignment that minimizes the joint uncertainty $H(\Phi,\Psi)$. We show that \textbf{Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI)} is the computational mechanism that implements SbS\,$\rightarrow$\,CCUP through dual bootstrapping: \emph{temporal} bootstrapping consolidates episodic specifics into reusable latent trajectories, while \emph{spatial} bootstrapping reuses these invariants across latent manifolds. This framework explains why \emph{semantics precedes syntax}: stable cycles anchor meaning, and symbolic syntax emerges only after semantic invariants are in place. In an evolutionary perspective, the same closure law unifies the trajectory of natural intelligence: from primitive memory traces in microbes, to cyclic sensorimotor patterns in bilaterians, to semantic generalization in mammals, culminating in human symbolic abstraction by natural language. In sum, intelligence arises from the progressive collapse of specificity into structure, grounded in the closure-induced emergence of invariants.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic Information Bottleneck Method for Clustering Mixed-Type Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03389v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an information-theoretic method for clustering mixed-type data, that is, data consisting of both continuous and categorical variables. The proposed approach extends the Information Bottleneck principle to heterogeneous data through generalised product kernels, integrating continuous, nominal, and ordinal variables within a unified optimization framework. We address the following challenges: developing a systematic bandwidth selection strategy that equalises contributions across variable types, and proposing an adaptive hyperparameter updating scheme that ensures a valid solution into a predetermined number of potentially imbalanced clusters. Through simulations on 28,800 synthetic data sets and ten publicly available benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed method, named DIBmix, achieves superior performance compared to four established methods (KAMILA, K-Prototypes, FAMD with K-Means, and PAM with Gower's dissimilarity). Results show DIBmix particularly excels when clusters exhibit size imbalances, data contain low or moderate cluster overlap, and categorical and continuous variables are equally represented. The method presents a significant advantage over traditional centroid-based algorithms, establishing DIBmix as a competitive and theoretically grounded alternative for mixed-type data clustering.</description>

      <title>Learning Orthogonal Multi-Index Models: A Fine-Grained Information Exponent Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The information exponent ([BAGJ21]) and its extensions -- which are equivalent to the lowest
  degree in the Hermite expansion of the link function (after a potential label transform) for Gaussian single-index
  models -- have played an important role in predicting the sample complexity of online stochastic gradient descent
  (SGD) in various learning tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that, for multi-index models, focusing solely on the
  lowest degree can miss key structural details of the model and result in suboptimal rates.
  Specifically, we consider the task of learning target functions of form $f_*(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{k=1}^{P} \phi(\mathbf{v}_k^* \cdot \mathbf{x})$,
  where $P \ll d$, the ground-truth directions $\{ \mathbf{v}_k^* \}_{k=1}^P$ are orthonormal, and the information exponent of
  $\phi$ is $L$. Based on the theory of information exponent, when $L = 2$, only the relevant subspace (not the exact
  directions) can be recovered due to the rotational invariance of the second-order terms, and when $L &gt; 2$,
  recovering the directions using online SGD require $\tilde{O}(P d^{L-1})$ samples. In this work, we show that by
  considering both second- and higher-order terms, we can first learn the relevant space using the second-order
  terms, and then the exact directions using the higher-order terms, and the overall sample and complexity of online
  SGD is $\tilde{O}( d P^{L-1} )$.</description>

      <title>Learning to Bid in Non-Stationary Repeated First-Price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-price auctions have recently gained significant traction in digital advertising markets, exemplified by Google's transition from second-price to first-price auctions. Unlike in second-price auctions, where bidding one's private valuation is a dominant strategy, determining an optimal bidding strategy in first-price auctions is more complex. From a learning perspective, the learner (a specific bidder) can interact with the environment (other bidders, i.e., opponents) sequentially to infer their behaviors. Existing research often assumes specific environmental conditions and benchmarks performance against the best fixed policy (static benchmark). While this approach ensures strong learning guarantees, the static benchmark can deviate significantly from the optimal strategy in environments with even mild non-stationarity. To address such scenarios, a dynamic benchmark--representing the sum of the highest achievable rewards at each time step--offers a more suitable objective. However, achieving no-regret learning with respect to the dynamic benchmark requires additional constraints. By inspecting reward functions in online first-price auctions, we introduce two metrics to quantify the regularity of the sequence of opponents' highest bids, which serve as measures of non-stationarity. We provide a minimax-optimal characterization of the dynamic regret for the class of sequences of opponents' highest bids that satisfy either of these regularity constraints. Our main technical tool is the Optimistic Mirror Descent (OMD) framework with a novel optimism configuration, which is well-suited for achieving minimax-optimal dynamic regret rates in this context. We then use synthetic datasets to validate our theoretical guarantees and demonstrate that our methods outperform existing ones.</description>

      <title>Summaries as Centroids for Interpretable and Scalable Text Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce k-NLPmeans and k-LLMmeans, text-clustering variants of k-means that periodically replace numeric centroids with textual summaries. The key idea, summary-as-centroid, retains k-means assignments in embedding space while producing human-readable, auditable cluster prototypes. The method is LLM-optional: k-NLPmeans uses lightweight, deterministic summarizers, enabling offline, low-cost, and stable operation; k-LLMmeans is a drop-in upgrade that uses an LLM for summaries under a fixed per-iteration budget whose cost does not grow with dataset size. We also present a mini-batch extension for real-time clustering of streaming text. Across diverse datasets, embedding models, and summarization strategies, our approach consistently outperforms classical baselines and approaches the accuracy of recent LLM-based clustering-without extensive LLM calls. Finally, we provide a case study on sequential text streams and release a StackExchange-derived benchmark for evaluating streaming text clustering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05861v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do classification models "see" our data? Based on their success in delineating behaviors, there must be some lens through which it is easy to see the boundary between classes; however, our current set of visualization techniques makes this prospect difficult. In this work, we propose a hybrid supervised-unsupervised technique distinctly suited to visualizing the decision boundaries determined by classification problems. This method provides a human-interpretable map that can be analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, which we demonstrate through visualizing and interpreting a decision boundary for chemical neurotoxicity. While we discuss this method in the context of chemistry-driven problems, its application can be generalized across subfields for "unboxing" the operations of machine-learning classification models.</description>

      <title>Dependency-aware Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active learning aims to efficiently build a labeled training set by strategically selecting samples to query labels from annotators. In this sequential process, each sample acquisition influences subsequent selections, causing dependencies among samples in the labeled set. However, these dependencies are overlooked during the model parameter estimation stage when updating the model using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), a conventional method that assumes independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data. We propose Dependency-aware MLE (DMLE), which corrects MLE within the active learning framework by addressing sample dependencies typically neglected due to the i.i.d. assumption, ensuring consistency with active learning principles in the model parameter estimation process. This improved method achieves superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets, reaching higher performance in earlier cycles compared to conventional MLE. Specifically, we observe average accuracy improvements of 6%, 8.6%, and 10.5% for k=1, k=5, and k=10 respectively, after collecting the first 100 samples, where entropy is the acquisition function and k is the query batch size acquired at every active learning cycle.

      <title>Density Ratio-based Causal Discovery from Bivariate Continuous-Discrete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a causal discovery method for mixed bivariate data consisting of one continuous and one discrete variable. Existing approaches either impose strong distributional assumptions or face challenges in fairly comparing causal directions between variables of different types, due to differences in their information content. We introduce a novel approach that determines causal direction by analyzing the monotonicity of the conditional density ratio of the continuous variable, conditioned on different values of the discrete variable. Our theoretical analysis shows that the conditional density ratio exhibits monotonicity when the continuous variable causes the discrete variable, but not in the reverse direction. This property provides a principled basis for comparing causal directions between variables of different types, free from strong distributional assumptions and bias arising from differences in their information content. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing superior accuracy compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Directional Convergence, Benign Overfitting of Gradient Descent in leaky ReLU two-layer Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study benign overfitting of fixed width leaky ReLU two-layer neural network classifiers trained on mixture data via gradient descent. We provide both, upper and lower classification error bounds, and discover a phase transition in the bound as a function of signal strength. The lower bound leads to a characterization of cases when benign overfitting provably fails even if directional convergence occurs. Our analysis allows us to considerably relax the distributional assumptions that are made in existing work on benign overfitting of leaky ReLU two-layer neural network classifiers. We can allow for non-sub-Gaussian data and do not require near orthogonality. Our results are derived by establishing directional convergence of the network parameters and studying classification error bounds for the convergent direction. Previously, directional convergence in (leaky) ReLU neural networks was established only for gradient flow. By first establishing directional convergence, we are able to study benign overfitting of fixed width leaky ReLU two-layer neural network classifiers in a much wider range of scenarios than was done before.</description>

      <title>Improved Sample Complexity For Diffusion Model Training Without Empirical Risk Minimizer Access</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18344v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models, essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial structures, they remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint. In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume access to an empirical risk minimizer. In this work, we present a principled theoretical framework analyzing diffusion models, providing a state-of-the-art sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$. Our structured decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical and optimization components offers critical insights into how diffusion models can be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance of diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Gradient-flow SDEs have unique transient population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying the drift and diffusion of an SDE from its population dynamics is a notoriously challenging task. Researchers in machine learning and single cell biology have only been able to prove a partial identifiability result: for potential-driven SDEs, the gradient-flow drift can be identified from temporal marginals if the Brownian diffusivity is already known. Existing methods therefore assume that the diffusivity is known a priori, despite it being unknown in practice. We dispel the need for this assumption by providing a complete characterization of identifiability: the gradient-flow drift and Brownian diffusivity are jointly identifiable from temporal marginals if and only if the process is observed outside of equilibrium. Given this fundamental result, we propose nn-APPEX, the first Schr\"odinger Bridge-based inference method that can simultaneously learn the drift and diffusion of gradient-flow SDEs solely from observed marginals. Extensive numerical experiments show that nn-APPEX's ability to adjust its diffusion estimate enables accurate inference, while previous Schr\"odinger Bridge methods obtain biased drift estimates due to their assumed, and likely incorrect, diffusion.</description>

      <title>Inference-time Scaling of Diffusion Models through Classical Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical search algorithms have long underpinned modern artificial intelligence. In this work, we tackle the challenge of inference-time control in diffusion models -- adapting generated outputs to meet diverse test-time objectives -- using principles from classical search. We propose a general framework that orchestrates local and global search to efficiently navigate the generative space. It employs a theoretically grounded local search via annealed Langevin MCMC and performs compute-efficient global exploration using breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range of challenging domains, including planning, offline reinforcement learning, and image generation. Across all tasks, we observe significant gains in both performance and efficiency. These results show that classical search provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time scaling in diffusion models.

Abstract: Single-cell technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity for dissecting the interplay between the cancer cells and the associated tumor microenvironment, and the produced high-dimensional omics data should also augment existing survival modeling approaches for identifying tumor cell type-specific genes predictive of cancer patient survival. However, there is no statistical model to integrate multiscale data including individual-level survival data, multicellular-level cell composition data and cellular-level single-cell omics covariates. We propose a class of Bayesian generalized promotion time cure models (GPTCMs) for the multiscale data integration to identify cell-type-specific genes and improve cancer prognosis. We demonstrate with simulations in both low- and high-dimensional settings that the proposed Bayesian GPTCMs are able to identify cell-type-associated covariates and improve survival prediction.</description>

      <title>Variational Gaussian Approximation in Replica Analysis of Parametric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the replica method for analyzing inference and learning in parametric models, considering situations where the data-generating distribution is unknown or analytically intractable. Instead of assuming idealized distributions to carry out quenched averages analytically, we use a variational Gaussian approximation for the replicated system in grand canonical formalism in which the data average can be deferred and replaced by empirical averages, leading to stationarity conditions that adaptively determine the parameters of the trial Hamiltonian for each dataset. This approach clarifies how fluctuations affect information extraction and connects directly with the results of mathematical statistics or learning theory such as information criteria. As a concrete application, we analyze linear regression and derive learning curves. This includes cases with real-world datasets, where exact replica calculations are not feasible.</description>

      <title>Learning to Reason as Action Abstractions with Scalable Mid-Training RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data. Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and Codeforces.</description>

      <title>A first-order method for constrained nonconvex--nonconcave minimax problems under a local Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of constrained nonconvex--nonconcave minimax problems in which the inner maximization involves potentially complex constraints. Under the assumption that the inner problem of a novel lifted minimax problem satisfies a local Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) condition, we show that the maximal function of the original problem enjoys a local H\"older smoothness property. We also propose a sequential convex programming (SCP) method for solving constrained optimization problems and establish its convergence rate under a local KL condition. Leveraging these results, we develop an inexact proximal gradient method for the original minimax problem, where the inexact gradient of the maximal function is computed via the SCP method applied to a locally KL-structured subproblem. Finally, we establish complexity guarantees for the proposed method in computing an approximate stationary point of the original minimax problem.</description>
