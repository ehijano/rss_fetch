      <title>Generating Infinitely Many Hyperbolic Knots with Plats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the relationships between links in plat position, the dynamics of the braid group, and Heegaard splittings of double branched covers of $S^3$ over a link. These relationships offer new ways to view links in plat position and a new tool kit for analyzing links. In particular, we show that the Hempel distance of the Heegaard splitting of the double branched cover obtained from a plat is a lower bound for the Hempel distance of that plat. Using the Hempel distance of a knot in bridge position and pseudo-Anosov braids we obtain our main result: a construction of infinitely many sequences of prime hyperbolic $n$-bridge knots for $n \geq 3$, infinitely many of which are distinct. We consider known results to show that the knot genus and hyperbolic volume of these knots are bounded below by a linear function. As a further result we show that the plat closure of a 6-braid is generically hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>On the embeddability of skeleta of manifold triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a criterion for a skeleton of a manifold triangulation being embeddable into Euclidean space in terms of the complement of a submanifold. As an application, we obtain embeddability of a $(q-1)$-skeleton of a triangulation of an $S^p$-bundle over $S^q$ into $\mathbb{R}^{p+q}$.</description>

      <title>Determinant of the OU matrix of a braid diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define the OU matrix of a braid diagram and discuss how the OU matrix reflects the warping degree or the layeredness of the braid diagram, and show that the determinant of the OU matrix of a layered braid diagram is the product of the determinants of the layers. We also introduce invariants of positive braids which are derived from the OU matrix.</description>

      <title>Farrell cohomology of the pure mapping class group of non-orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an odd prime $p$, we determine the $p$-primary component of the Farrell cohomology of the pure mapping class groups of a non orientable surface of genus $p$ with $k\geqslant 1$ marked points. To do this, we classify conjugacy classes of subgroups of order $p$ of the pure mapping class group of a non orientable surface of any genus with marked points. This is obtained by extending the notion of topological equivalence for surface kernel epimorphisms of non Euclidean crystallographic groups, adapting it to the setting of surfaces with marked points.</description>

      <title>Measure and dimension theory of permeable sets and its applications to fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study {\it permeable} sets. These are sets \(\Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) which have the property that each two points \(x,y\in \mathbb{R}^d\) can be connected by a short path \(\gamma\) which has small (or even empty, apart from the end points of \(\gamma\)) intersection with \(\Theta\). We investigate relations between permeability and Lebesgue measure and establish theorems on the relation of permeability with several notions of dimension. It turns out that for most notions of dimension each subset of \(\mathbb{R}^d\) of dimension less than \(d-1\) is permeable. We use our permeability result on the Nagata dimension to characterize permeability properties of self-similar sets with certain finiteness properties.</description>

      <title>Free Products and the Isomorphism between Standard and Dual Artin Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a Coxeter system with a fixed Coxeter element, there is a surjective group morphism $\Psi$ from the standard to the dual Artin groups. We give conditions that are sufficient, necessary or equivalent to $\Psi$ being an isomorphism. In particular, we prove that if the Hurwitz action on the reduced words of any element in the noncrossing partition poset is transitive, and if the Hurwitz action on the reduced words of the Coxeter element has the same stabilizer as essentially the same action viewed in the standard Artin group, then $\Psi$ is an isomorphism. Both of those conditions are already known in some cases, notably in spherical and affine types. We then prove that taking the free (or direct) product of groups that satisfy those two conditions yields another group that, with a suitable Coxeter element, also satisfies them.</description>

      <title>A geometrical description of untwisted Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT with defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a simple, geometric and explicit construction of 3d untwisted Dijkgraaf-Witten theory with defects of all codimensions. It is given as a symmetric monoidal functor from a defect cobordism category into the category of finite-dimensional complex vector spaces. The objects of this category are oriented stratified surfaces and its morphisms are equivalence classes of stratified cobordisms, both labelled with higher categorical data. This TQFT is constructed in terms of geometric quantities such as fundamental groupoids and bundles and requires neither state sums on triangulations nor diagrammatic calculi for higher categories. It is obtained from a functor that assigns to each defect surface a representation of a gauge groupoid and to each defect cobordism a fibrant span of groupoids and an intertwiner between the groupoid representations at its boundary. It is constructed by homotopy theoretic methods and allows for an explicit computation of examples. In particular, we show how the 2d part of this defect TQFT gives a simple description of defects of all codimensions in Kitaev's quantum double model.</description>

      <title>Kirby diagrams of 4-dimensional open books</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an algorithm for constructing a Kirby diagram of a 4-dimensional open book given a Heegaard diagram of the page. As an application, we show that an open book constructed with arbitrary page and trivial monodromy is diffeomorphic to an open book constructed with a punctured handlebody as page and a composition of torus twists and sphere twists as monodromy.</description>

      <title>Non-Clifford and parallelizable fault-tolerant logical gates on constant and almost-constant rate homological quantum LDPC codes via higher symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study parallel fault-tolerant quantum computing for families of homological quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes defined on 3-manifolds with constant or almost-constant encoding rate. We derive generic formula for a transversal $T$ gate of color codes on general 3-manifolds, which acts as collective non-Clifford logical CCZ gates on any triplet of logical qubits with their logical-$X$ membranes having a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ triple intersection at a single point. The triple intersection number is a topological invariant, which also arises in the path integral of the emergent higher symmetry operator in a topological quantum field theory: the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory. Moreover, the transversal $S$ gate of the color code corresponds to a higher-form symmetry supported on a codimension-1 submanifold, giving rise to exponentially many addressable and parallelizable logical CZ gates. We have developed a generic formalism to compute the triple intersection invariants for 3-manifolds and also study the scaling of the Betti number and systoles with volume for various 3-manifolds, which translates to the encoding rate and distance. We further develop three types of LDPC codes supporting such logical gates: (1) A quasi-hyperbolic code from the product of 2D hyperbolic surface and a circle, with almost-constant rate $k/n=O(1/\log(n))$ and $O(\log(n))$ distance; (2) A homological fibre bundle code with $O(1/\log^{\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ rate and $O(\log^{\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ distance; (3) A specific family of 3D hyperbolic codes: the Torelli mapping torus code, constructed from mapping tori of a pseudo-Anosov element in the Torelli subgroup, which has constant rate while the distance scaling is currently unknown. We then show a generic constant-overhead scheme for applying a parallelizable universal gate set with the aid of logical-$X$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Latent symmetry of graphs and stretch factors in Out(Fr)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every irreducible outer automorphism of the free group of rank r is topologically represented by an irreducible train track map $f$ on some graph $\Gamma$ of rank r. Moreover, $f$ can always be written as a composition of folds and a graph isomorphism. We give a lower bound on the stretch factor of an irreducible outer automorphism in terms of the number of folds of $f$ and the number of edges in $\Gamma$. In the case that $f$ is periodic on the vertex set of $\Gamma$, we show a precise notion of the latent symmetry of $\Gamma$ gives a lower bound on the number of folds required. We use this notion of latent symmetry to classify all possible irreducible single fold train track maps.</description>
