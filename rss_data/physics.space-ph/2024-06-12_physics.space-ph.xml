      <title>The evolution of coronal shock wave properties and their relation with solar energetic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shock waves driven by fast and wide coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are highly efficient particle accelerators involved in the production of solar energetic particle (SEP) events. The gradual SEP event measured by STEREO-A and B on October 11, 2013 had notable properties: (1) it occurred in isolation with very low background particle intensities, (2) it had a clear onset of SEPs measured in situ allowing detailed timing analyses, and (3) it was associated with a fast CME event magnetically connected with STA and B. These allowed us to investigate the temporal connection between the rapidly evolving shock properties, such as compression ratio, Mach number and geometry, and the intensity and composition of SEPs measured in situ. We use shock reconstruction techniques and multi-viewpoint imaging data from STA and B, SOHO, and SDO spacecraft to determine the kinematic evolution of the expanding shock wave. Using 3D magneto-hydrodynamic modelling we obtained shock wave properties along an ensemble of magnetic field lines connected to STA and B, estimating their uncertainties. Using a velocity dispersion analysis of the SEP data, we time shift the SEP time series and analyze the relations between their properties and the modeled shock ones, as well as the energy dependence of these relations. We find a very good temporal agreement between the formation of the modelled shock wave and the estimated release times for both electrons and protons. This simultaneous release suggests a common acceleration process. This early phase is marked at both STEREOs by elevated electron-to-proton ratios that coincide with the highly quasi-perpendicular phase of the shock, suggesting that the rapid evolution of the shock as it transits from the low to the high corona modifies the conditions under which particles are accelerated. We discuss these findings in terms of basic geometry and acceleration processes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Interactions of Planetary-Scale Waves in Mesospheric Winds Observed at 52{\deg}N Latitude and Two Longitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nine years of mesospheric wind data from two meteor radars at 52{\deg}N latitude were analyzed to investigate planetary waves (PWs) and tides by estimating their zonal wavenumber through longitudinal phase differences. Our results reveal that PW normal modes (NMs) primarily drive multi-day oscillations, showing seasonal variability and statistical associations with Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW) events. Specifically, a significant 6-day NM emerges in April, followed by predominant 4- and 2-day NMs until June, with peaks of 2-, 4-, and 6-day NMs spanning July to October. Furthermore, our study provides the first observational verification of frequency and zonal wavenumber of over ten secondary waves from nonlinear interactions among planetary-scale waves. One notable finding is the prevalence of non-migrating components in winter 24-hour and summer 8-hour tides, attributed to these nonlinear interactions. Our findings underscore the diverse nonlinear dynamics of planetary-scale waves, triggering a variety of periodic oscillations.</description>
