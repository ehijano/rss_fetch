      <title>Combining Hybrid and Opaque Scintillator Techniques in the Search for Double Beta Plus Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05999v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double beta plus decay is a rare nuclear disintegration process. Difficulties in its measurement arise from suppressed decay probabilities, experimentally challenging decay signatures and low natural abundances of suitable candidate nuclei. In this article, we propose a new detector concept to overcome these challenges. It is based on the first-time combination of hybrid and opaque scintillation detector technology paired with novel light read-out techniques. This approach is particularly suitable detecting positrons (beta plus) signatures. We expect to discover two-neutrino double beta plus decay modes within 1 tonne-week exposure and are able to probe neutrinoless double beta plus decays at several orders of magnitude improved significance compared to current experimental limits.</description>

      <title>A Nuclear Interferometer for Ultra-Light Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the nuclear interferometer - a single-photon interferometry experiment based upon the thorium-229 nuclear clock transition - as a novel detector for ultra-light dark matter (ULDM). Thanks to the enhanced sensitivity of this transition to the variation of fundamental constants, we find that possible realisations of such an experiment deploying either single ions or clouds of atoms have the potential to be complementary to advanced very-long-baseline terrestrial clock atom interferometers in the search for ultra-light dark matter with scalar couplings to photons. Nuclear interferometry may also offer an unparalleled window to new physics coupling to the QCD sector via quarks or gluons, with a discovery reach that could enhance existing and proposed experiments over a range of frequencies in the direction of well-motivated parameter space.</description>

      <title>Spin entanglement in two-proton emission from $^6$Be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation of coupled-spin entanglement in the two-proton ($2p$) radioactive emission. The three-body model of $^{6}$Be with the proton-proton interaction, which is adjusted to reproduce the experimental energy release, is utilized. Time-dependent calculation is performed to compute the coupled-spin state of the emitted two protons. The spin-correlation function $S$ as Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) indicator is obtained as $\abs{S} \cong 2.72$. Namely, the $2p$-spin entanglement beyond the limit of local-hidden-variable (LHV) theory is concluded. This entanglement is sensitive to the proton-proton interaction. The short-lived (broad-width) $2p$~state has the weaker spin entanglement. In parallel, the core-proton interactions do not harm this entanglement during the time-dependent decaying process. The CHSH measurement can be a probe into the effective nuclear interaction inside finite systems.</description>

      <title>A practical approach to calculating magnetic Johnson noise for precision measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Johnson noise is an important consideration for many applications involving precision magnetometry, and its significance will only increase in the future with improvements in measurement sensitivity. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be utilized to derive analytic expressions for magnetic Johnson noise in certain situations. But when used in conjunction with commercially available finite element analysis tools, the combined approach is particularly powerful as it provides a practical means to calculate the magnetic Johnson noise arising from conductors of arbitrary geometry and permeability. In this paper, we demonstrate this method to be one of the most comprehensive approaches presently available to calculate thermal magnetic noise. In particular, its applicability is shown to not be limited to cases where the noise is evaluated at a point in space but also can be expanded to include cases where the magnetic field detector has a more general shape, such as a finite size loop, a gradiometer, or a detector that consists of a polarized atomic species trapped in a volume. Furthermore, some physics insights gained through studies made using this method are discussed.</description>

      <title>New physical processes for extracting GPDs with a better sensitivity to partonic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of exclusive processes for a better study of generalized parton distributions (GPDs), which we refer to as single-diffractive hard exclusive processes (SDHEPs). We advocate a two-stage framework for picturing SDHEPs based on the separation of scales, which gives a clear description both kinematically and dynamically. We examine the sensitivity of the SDHEP to the parton momentum fraction $x$-dependence of GPDs, and demonstrate it quantitatively with two specific processes that can be readily measured at J-PARC or AMBER using a pion beam and at JLab using a photon beam, respectively. Both processes are capable of providing enhanced sensitivity to the $x$-dependence, overcoming the problem of shadow GPDs, and disentangling different types of GPDs with various spin asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Reexamining charm versus bottom quark energy loss inside a color-deconfined medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The general intuition that heavier partons suffer weaker energy loss inside a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium is critically re-examined. Within a linear Boltzmann transport model that includes both Yukawa and string types of interactions between heavy quarks and the QGP, we find that while the radiative energy loss is suppressed by the parton mass, heavier partons can experience stronger string potential scatterings with the medium. Their competition may result in less energy loss of bottom quarks than charm quarks at low transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) but an inverse order at high $p_\mathrm{T}$. Our model calculation shows a weaker nuclear modification on bottom particles than charm particles at low $p_\mathrm{T}$, as observed by both RHIC and LHC experiments, but predicts an opposite hierarchy at high $p_\mathrm{T}$. A larger momentum space transport coefficient ($\hat{q}$) and a smaller spatial diffusion coefficient ($D_\mathrm{s}$) are found for bottom quarks than for charm quarks.</description>

      <title>Empirical fits to inclusive electron-carbon scattering data obtained by deep-learning methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing the neural network framework, we obtain empirical fits to the electron-scattering cross sections for carbon over a broad kinematic region, extending from the quasielastic peak through resonance excitation to the onset of deep-inelastic scattering. We consider two different methods of obtaining such model-independent parametrizations and the corresponding uncertainties: based on the bootstrap approach and the Monte Carlo dropout approach. In our analysis, the $\chi^2$ defines the loss function, including point-to-point and normalization uncertainties for each independent set of measurements. Our statistical approaches lead to fits of comparable quality and similar uncertainties of the order of $7$%. To test these models, we compare their predictions to test datasets excluded from the training process and theoretical predictions obtained within the spectral function approach. The predictions of both models agree with experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. We also perform a comparison to a dataset lying beyond the covered kinematic region, and find that the bootstrap approach shows better interpolation and extrapolation abilities than the one based on the dropout algorithm.</description>

      <title>Contact interaction study of proton parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a symmetry-preserving formulation of a vector$\,\times\,$vector contact interaction (SCI) and treating the proton as a quark + interacting-diquark bound state, whose structure is obtained by solving a Poincar\'e-covariant Faddeev equation, we provide a comprehensive, coherent set of predictions for unpolarised and polarised proton parton distribution functions (DFs): valence, glue, and four-flavour separated sea. The results enable many themes to be addressed, including: the asymmetry of antimatter in the proton; the neutron:proton structure function ratio; helicity retention in hard scattering processes; the charm quark momentum fraction; the sign and size of the polarised gluon DF; and the origin of the proton spin. In all cases where sound analyses of data are available, SCI predictions are semiquantitatively in agreement with the results. Those mismatches which exist are typically attributable to the momentum-independence of the underlying interaction. Judiciously interpreted, the SCI delivers a sound and insightful explanation of proton structure as expressed in DFs.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the mechanism of chiral three-nucleon force in driving spin-orbit splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three-nucleon force (3NF) is crucial in shaping the shell structure of atomic nuclei, particularly impacting the enhancement of spin-orbit (SO) splitting, especially in nuclei with significant deviations from stability. Despite its importance, the specific mechanisms driving this enhancement remain unclear. In this study, we introduce a decomposition scheme based on the rank of irreducible tensors forming the 3NF, derived from chiral effective field theory at next-to-next-to-leading order, to elucidate their influence on SO splitting. Within the shell-model framework, our analysis reveals that the rank-1 component of the 3NF is the primary factor enlarging the energy gap between the $0p_{3/2}$ and $0p_{1/2}$ single-particle levels in $p$-shell nuclei, while the rank-2 component makes a subdominant contribution. Since the rank-1 component originates exclusively from the $2\pi$-exchange 3NF, our finding will not depend on the choice of the low-energy constants of contact terms. We also remark on the antisymmetry of the rank-1 3NF, which can affect the quantum entanglement of spin states. This study lays the groundwork for further exploration into this field toward a microscopic understanding of the 3NF impact on the nuclear shell structure.</description>

      <title>Compact Ion Beam System for Fusion Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a compact ion beam device capable of accelerating H$^+$ and D$^+$ ions up to 75keV energy, on to a solid target, with sufficient beam current to study fusion reactions. The ion beam system uses a microwave driven plasma source to generate ions that are accelerated to high energy with a DC acceleration structure. The plasma source is driven by pulsed microwaves from a solid-state RF amplifier, which is impedance matched to the plasma source chamber at the ISM band frequency (2.4-2.5GHz). The plasma chamber is held at high positive DC potential and is isolated from the impedance matching structure (at ground potential) by a dielectric-filled gap. To facilitate the use of high-energy-particle detectors near the target, the plasma chamber is biased to a high positive voltage, while the target remains grounded. A target loaded with deuterium is used to study D-D fusion and a B$_4$C or LaB$_6$ target is used to study p-$^{11}$B fusion. Detectors include solid-state charged particle detector and a scintillation fast neutron detector. The complete ion beam system can fit on a laboratory table and is a useful tool for teaching undergraduate and graduate students about the physics of fusion.</description>
