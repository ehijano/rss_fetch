      <title>Enhancing Management of Large-Scale Optical Networks through RFID Technology Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Managing large-scale optical distribution networks is a daunting task. This paper introduces a novel solution using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to transform the procedure we monitor and manage the complex optical network dumb resources (ONDR). By implementing and deploying removable RFID tag pairing based on the serial peripheral interface (SPI) communication protocol, the system identifies 30 pairs of tags within one second, even at densities of up to 5.1 tagged components per square inch of patch panel surface area. The integration of light-emitting diode (LED) navigation aids in indicating correctly matched interfaces, effectively addressing the complexities associated with large-scale fiber matching.</description>

      <title>A New Security and Identification Concept for SWIPT Systems in IoT Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses an innovative concept to enhance the security for IoT applications in the case of Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer. This is achieved by integrating a complementary security and identification mechanism through Wireless Power Transfer link within the network of autonomous wireless nodes. This mechanism is implemented at the level of the RF rectifier used to receive energy from a dedicated RF source. A prototype of such RF rectifier has been developed, it generates in real time a backscattered waveform (uplink from the wireless node to the RF source) as function of the parameters of the incoming energy waveform (downlink from RF source) and a digital private key code, generated/available at the level of the wireless node. This uplink waveform can be monitored at the level of the RF source for security/identification purposes implementing an autonomous hardware/physical security layer that operates independently from the communication protocols.</description>

      <title>COMSPLIT: A Communication-Aware Split Learning Design for Heterogeneous IoT Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significance of distributed learning and inference algorithms in Internet of Things (IoT) network is growing since they flexibly distribute computation load between IoT devices and the infrastructure, enhance data privacy, and minimize latency. However, a notable challenge stems from the influence of communication channel conditions on their performance. In this work, we introduce COMSPLIT: a novel communication-aware design for split learning (SL) and inference paradigm tailored to processing time series data in IoT networks. COMSPLIT provides a versatile framework for deploying adaptable SL in IoT networks affected by diverse channel conditions. In conjunction with the integration of an early-exit strategy, and addressing IoT scenarios containing devices with heterogeneous computational capabilities, COMSPLIT represents a comprehensive design solution for communication-aware SL in IoT networks. Numerical results show superior performance of COMSPLIT compared to vanilla SL approaches (that assume ideal communication channel), demonstrating its ability to offer both design simplicity and adaptability to different channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficiency Architectural Enhancements for Sensing-Enabled Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing will be a key technology in 6G networks, enabling a plethora of new sensing-enabled use cases. Some of the use cases relate to deployments over a wide physical area that needs to be sensed by multiple sensing sources at different locations. The efficient management of the sensing resources is pivotal for sustainable sensing-enabled mobile network designs. In this paper, we provide an example of such use case, and show the energy consumption due to sensing has potential to scale to prohibitive levels. We then propose architectural enhancements to solve this problem, and discuss energy saving and energy efficient strategies in sensing, that can only be properly quantified and applied with the proposed architectural enhancements.</description>

      <title>Integrating LoRaWAN with Mobile Ad-hoc Networks for Enhanced Campus Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) with Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) presents a promising solution for enhancing communication networks within campus environments. This paper explores the unique advantages of combining these two technologies, including scalability, energy efficiency, flexibility, and support for diverse applications. LoRaWAN low power consumption and extended range capabilities address the challenges of traditional communication methods, enabling reliable data transmission across various campus scenarios, such as emergency alerts, event coordination, and real-time monitoring. We also identify key challenges faced in this integrated architecture, including signal interference, data packet collisions, and energy management. By providing a comprehensive survey of existing techniques and solutions categorized by the network protocol stack layers, this study aims to inform future research and development efforts in creating robust, energy efficient communication systems tailored for modern educational institutions. Ultimately, the findings highlight the potential of LoRaWAN MANET architectures to transform campus communication into a more reliable, adaptable, and cost effective framework.</description>

      <title>MANSY: Generalizing Neural Adaptive Immersive Video Streaming With Ensemble and Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The popularity of immersive videos has prompted extensive research into neural adaptive tile-based streaming to optimize video transmission over networks with limited bandwidth. However, the diversity of users' viewing patterns and Quality of Experience (QoE) preferences has not been fully addressed yet by existing neural adaptive approaches for viewport prediction and bitrate selection. Their performance can significantly deteriorate when users' actual viewing patterns and QoE preferences differ considerably from those observed during the training phase, resulting in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose MANSY, a novel streaming system that embraces user diversity to improve generalization. Specifically, to accommodate users' diverse viewing patterns, we design a Transformer-based viewport prediction model with an efficient multi-viewport trajectory input output architecture based on implicit ensemble learning. Besides, we for the first time combine the advanced representation learning and deep reinforcement learning to train the bitrate selection model to maximize diverse QoE objectives, enabling the model to generalize across users with diverse preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MANSY outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in viewport prediction accuracy and QoE improvement on both trained and unseen viewing patterns and QoE preferences, achieving better generalization.</description>

      <title>Planning and Operation of Millimeter-wave Downlink Systems with Hybrid Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates downlink radio resource management (RRM) in millimeter-wave systems with codebook-based hybrid beamforming in a single cell. We consider a practical but often overlooked multi-channel scenario where the base station is equipped with fewer radio frequency chains than there are user equipment (UEs) in the cell. In this case, analog beam selection is important because not all beams preferred by UEs can be selected simultaneously, and since the beam selection cannot vary across subchannels in a time slot, this creates a coupling between subchannels within a time slot. None of the solutions proposed in the literature deal with this important constraint. The paper begins with an offline study that analyzes the impact of different RRM procedures and system parameters on performance. An offline joint RRM optimization problem is formulated and solved that includes beam set selection, UE set selection, power distribution, modulation and coding scheme selection, and digital beamforming as a part of hybrid beamforming. The evaluation results of the offline study provide valuable insights that shows the importance of not neglecting the constraint and guide the design of low-complexity and high-performance online downlink RRM schemes in the second part of the paper. The proposed online RRM algorithms perform close to the performance targets obtained from the offline study while offering acceptable runtime.</description>

      <title>Decision-Making Frameworks for Network Resilience -- Managing and Mitigating Systemic (Cyber) Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a decision-making framework tailored for the management of systemic risk in networks. This framework is constructed upon three fundamental components: (1) a set of acceptable network configurations, (2) a set of interventions aimed at risk mitigation, and (3) a cost function quantifying the expenses associated with these interventions. While our discussion primarily revolves around the management of systemic cyber risks in digital networks, we concurrently draw parallels to risk management of other complex systems where analogous approaches may be adequate.</description>
