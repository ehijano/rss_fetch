      <title>A Motivational Driver Steering Model: Task Difficulty Homeostasis From Control Theory Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general and psychologically plausible collision avoidance driver model can improve transportation safety significantly. Most computational driver models found in the literature have used control theory methods only, and they are not established based on psychological theories. In this paper, a unified approach is presented based on concepts taken from psychology and control theory. The "task difficulty homeostasis theory", a prominent motivational theory, is combined with the "Lyapunov stability method" in control theory to present a general and psychologically plausible model. This approach is used to model driver steering behavior for collision avoidance. The performance of this model is measured by simulation of two collision avoidance scenarios at a wide range of speeds from 20 km/h to 170 km/h. The model is validated by experiments on a driving simulator. The results demonstrate that the model follows human behavior accurately with a mean error of 7 percent.</description>

      <title>Spatial-to-Spectral Harmonic-Modulated Arrays for 6G Multi-Beam MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents an overview and analysis of spatial-to-spectral harmonic-modulated arrays (SHAs). Compared to traditional analog or digital beamforming arrays, SHAs enable concurrent multi-beamforming without requiring substantial hardware replication. SHAs replace the need for hardware replication with frequency-domain multiplexing. Furthermore, SHAs have the potential to become key contributors to future 6G networks by enabling scalable multi-user communications, joint communication and sensing, and spatial interference mitigation. In addition, an analysis of the SHA's harmonic-modulation waveform and its effects on gain, noise and bandwidth is presented. A comb-like modulation waveform for SHAs that minimizes spectral inefficiency is proposed. Further, an analysis of the SHA's capability to independently steer multiple beams is presented. This capability is quantified in terms of the SHA's spatial-to-spectral degrees of freedom. Lastly, this work introduces a novel SHA architecture that provides three spatial-to-spectral degrees of freedom with minimal hardware replication.</description>

      <title>Towards Smart Manufacturing Metaverse via Digital Twinning in Extended Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of modern manufacturing systems is driven by the integration of emerging metaverse technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), digital twin (DT) with different forms of extended reality (XR) like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). These advances confront manufacturing workers with complex and evolving environments that demand digital literacy for problem solving in the future workplace. However, manufacturing industry faces a critical shortage of skilled workforce with digital literacy in the world. Further, global pandemic has significantly changed how people work and collaborate digitally and remotely. There is an urgent need to rethink digital platformization and leverage emerging technologies to propel industrial evolution toward human-centered manufacturing metaverse (MfgVerse). This paper presents a forward-looking perspective on the development of smart MfgVerse, highlighting current efforts in learning factory, cognitive digital twinning, and the new sharing economy of manufacturing-as-a-service (MaaS). MfgVerse is converging into multiplex networks, including a social network of human stakeholders, an interconnected network of manufacturing things or agents (e.g., machines, robots, facilities, material handling systems), a network of digital twins of physical things, as well as auxiliary networks of sales, supply chain, logistics, and remanufacturing systems. We also showcase the design and development of a learning factory for workforce training in extended reality. Finally, future directions, challenges, and opportunities are discussed for human-centered manufacturing metaverse. We hope this work helps stimulate more comprehensive studies and in-depth research efforts to advance MfgVerse technologies.</description>

      <title>AC Dynamics-aware Trajectory Optimization with Binary Enforcement for Adaptive UFLS Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high penetration of distributed energy resources, resulting in backfeed of power at the transmission and distribution interface, is causing conventional underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) schemes to become nonconforming. Adaptive schemes that update UFLS relay settings recursively in time offer a solution, but existing adaptive techniques that obtain UFLS relay settings with linearized or reduced-order model formulations fail to capture AC nonlinear network behavior. In practice, this will result in relays unable to restore system frequency during adverse disturbances. We formulate an adaptive UFLS problem as a trajectory optimization and include the full AC nonlinear network dynamics to ensure AC feasibility and time-coordinated control actions. We include binary decisions to model relay switching action and time-delayed multi-stage load-shedding. However, this formulation results in an intractable MINLP problem. To enforce model tractability, we relax these binary variables into continuous surrogates and reformulate the MINLP as a sequence of NLPs. We solve the NLPs with a homotopy-driven method that enforces near-integer-feasible solutions. We evaluate the framework on multiple synthetic transmission systems and demonstrate that it scales efficiently to networks exceeding 1500+ nodes with over 170k+ continuous and 73k+ binary decision variables, while successfully recovering binary-feasible solutions that arrest the frequency decline during worst-case disturbance.</description>

      <title>Supervisory Control of Hybrid Power Plants Using Online Feedback Optimization: Designs and Validations with a Hybrid Co-Simulation Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates designing a supervisory feedback controller for a hybrid power plant that coordinates the wind, solar, and battery energy storage plants to meet the desired power demands. We have explored an online feedback control design that does not require detailed knowledge about the models, known as feedback optimization. The control inputs are updated using the gradient information of the cost and the outputs with respect to the input control commands. This enables us to adjust the active power references of wind, solar, and storage plants to meet the power generation requirements set by grid operators. The methodology also ensures robust control performance in the presence of uncertainties in the weather. In this paper, we focus on describing the supervisory feedback optimization formulation and control-oriented modeling for individual renewable and storage components of the hybrid power plant. The proposed supervisory control has been integrated with the hybrid plant co-simulation engine, Hercules, demonstrating its effectiveness in more realistic simulation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Real-time Measurement-based Optimization for Distribution System Operation Considering Battery Voltage and Thermal Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The secure operation of power distribution systems is challenged by the growing integration of distributed energy resources. Leveraging the flexibility of battery storage offers a cost-effective alternative to measures like generation curtailment, which results in energy losses. However, developing an effective operational model for battery storage is hindered by inaccurate grid models, unavailability of load data, nonlinear relationship between power injections and network states, intertemporal constraints, and complex electrochemical and thermal dynamics. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a data-driven operational control scheme for battery storage in distribution systems. Linear and convex quadratic operational constraints are constructed based on real-time distribution system and battery storage measurements. Lyapunov optimization decouples multi-period battery operation, enabling a real-time, forecast-free control strategy with low computational complexity. Numerical studies using nonlinear distribution system and battery storage simulators validate the effectiveness of the approach in ensuring secure distribution system operation and satisfaction of voltage and thermal constraints of battery storage.</description>

      <title>AoI-Aware Task Offloading and Transmission Optimization for Industrial IoT Networks: A Branching Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), the frequent transmission of large amounts of data over wireless networks should meet the stringent timeliness requirements. Particularly, the freshness of packet status updates has a significant impact on the system performance. In this paper, we propose an age-of-information (AoI)-aware multi-base station (BS) real-time monitoring framework to support extensive IIoT deployments. To meet the freshness requirements of IIoT, we formulate a joint task offloading and resource allocation optimization problem with the goal of minimizing long-term average AoI. Tackling the core challenges of combinatorial explosion in multi-BS decision spaces and the stochastic dynamics of IIoT systems is crucial, as these factors render traditional optimization methods intractable. Firstly, an innovative branching-based Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (Branching-D3QN) algorithm is proposed to effectively implement task offloading, which optimizes the convergence performance by reducing the action space complexity from exponential to linear levels. Then, an efficient optimization solution to resource allocation is proposed by proving the semi-definite property of the Hessian matrix of bandwidth and computation resources. Finally, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm for efficient joint task offloading and resource allocation to achieve optimal average AoI performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed Branching-D3QN algorithm outperforms both state-of-the-art DRL methods and classical heuristics, achieving up to a 75% enhanced convergence speed and at least a 22% reduction in the long-term average AoI.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Nonlinear Systems with State-Dependent Representation: From Model-Based to Direct Data-Driven Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for stabilizing nonlinear systems represented in state-dependent form. We first reformulate the nonlinear dynamics as a state-dependent parameter-varying model and synthesize a stabilizing controller offline via tractable linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The resulting controller guarantees local exponential stability, maintains robustness against disturbances, and provides an estimate of the region of attraction under input saturation. We then extend the formulation to the direct data-driven setting, where a known library of basis functions represents the dynamics with unknown coefficients consistent with noisy experimental data. By leveraging Petersen's lemma, we derive data-dependent LMIs that ensure stability and robustness for all systems compatible with the data. Numerical and physical experimental results validate that our approach achieves rigorous end-to-end guarantees on stability, robustness, and safety directly from finite data without explicit model identification.</description>

      <title>Small-Signal Stability Analysis of Power Systems by Implicit Multilinear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to perform small-signal stability analysis based on linearization of implicit multilinear models. Multilinear models describe the system dynamics by multilinear functions of state, input, and algebraic variables. Using suitable transformations of variables, they can also represent trigonometric functions, which often occur in power systems modeling. This allows tensor representations of grid-following and grid-forming power converters. This paper introduces small-signal stability analysis of equilibrium points based on implicit multilinear models using generalized eigenvalues. The generalized eigenvalues are computed from linear descriptor models of the linearized implicit multilinear model. The proposed approach is tested using a 3-bus network example, first by comparing time-domain simulations of the implicit multilinear model with those of the nonlinear model, and second by comparing the generalized eigenvalues with those of the linearized nonlinear model. The results show that the decomposed tensor representation of the implicit multilinear model allows for a faster linearization compared to conventional methods in MATLAB Simulink.</description>

      <title>SMP-RCR: A Sparse Multipoint Moment Matching Method for RC Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In post--layout circuit simulation, efficient model order reduction (MOR) for many--port resistor--capacitor (RC) circuits remains a crucial issue. The current mainstream MOR methods for such circuits include high--order moment matching methods and elimination methods. High-order moment matching methods--characterized by high accuracy, such as PRIMA and TurboMOR--tend to generate large dense reduced-order systems when the number of ports is large, which impairs the efficiency of MOR. Another common type of MOR method for many--port circuits is based on Gaussian elimination, with the SIP method as a representative. The main limitation of this method lies in the inadequate matching of high--order moments. In this paper, we propose a sparse multipoint moment matching method and present comprehensive theoretical analysis results regarding the multi--frequency high--order moment matching property. Meanwhile, to enhance the algorithm's efficiency, sparse control and deflation techniques are introduced to further optimize the algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrated that, compared to SIP, the accuracy is improved by more than two orders of magnitude at high frequency points without adding many extra linear components. Compared to TurboMOR methods, our method achieves a speed improvement of more than twice while maintaining the same level of precision.</description>

      <title>Linear State Estimation in Presence of Bounded Uncertainties: A Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of algorithms have been proposed to address the power system state estimation problem in the presence of uncertainties in the data. However, less emphasis has been given to handling perturbations in the model. In the context of linear state estimation (LSE), which is the focus of this paper, perturbations in the model come from variations in the line parameters. Since the actual values of the line parameters can be different from the values stored in a power utility's database, we investigate three approaches in this paper to estimate the states in the presence of bounded uncertainties in the data and the model. The first approach is based on interval arithmetic, the second is based on convex optimization, and the third is based on generalized linear fractional programming. The three algorithms are applied to multiple IEEE test systems and compared in terms of their speed and accuracy. The results indicate that the first two algorithms are extremely fast and give expected results, while the third suffers from scalability issues and is unsuitable for LSE.</description>

      <title>A Control-Theoretic Approach to Dynamic Payment Routing for Success Rate Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a control-theoretic framework for dynamic payment routing, implemented within JUSPAY's Payment Orchestrator to maximize transaction success rate. The routing system is modeled as a closed-loop feedback controller continuously sensing gateway performance, computing corrective actions, and dynamically routes transactions across gateway to ensure operational resilience. The system leverages concepts from control theory, reinforcement learning, and multi-armed bandit optimization to achieve both short-term responsiveness and long-term stability. Rather than relying on explicit PID regulation, the framework applies generalized feedback-based adaptation, ensuring that corrective actions remain proportional to observed performance deviations and the computed gateway score gradually converges toward the success rate. This hybrid approach unifies control theory and adaptive decision systems, enabling self-regulating transaction routing that dampens instability, and improves reliability. Live production results show an improvement of up to 1.15% in success rate over traditional rule-based routing, demonstrating the effectiveness of feedback-based control in payment systems.</description>

      <title>Safe Payload Transfer with Ship-Mounted Cranes: A Robust Model Predictive Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safe real-time control of ship-mounted cranes in unstructured transportation environments requires handling multiple safety constraints while maintaining effective payload transfer performance. Unlike traditional crane systems, ship-mounted cranes are consistently subjected to significant external disturbances affecting underactuated crane dynamics due to the ship's dynamic motion response to harsh sea conditions, which can lead to robustness issues. To tackle these challenges, we propose a robust and safe model predictive control (MPC) framework and demonstrate it on a 5-DOF crane system, where a Stewart platform simulates the external disturbances that ocean surface motions would have on the supporting ship. The crane payload transfer operation must avoid obstacles and accurately place the payload within a designated target area. We use a robust zero-order control barrier function (R-ZOCBF)-based safety constraint in the nonlinear MPC to ensure safe payload positioning, while time-varying bounding boxes are utilized for collision avoidance. We introduce a new optimization-based online robustness parameter adaptation scheme to reduce the conservativeness of R-ZOCBFs. Experimental trials on a crane prototype demonstrate the overall performance of our safe control approach under significant perturbing motions of the crane base. While our focus is on crane-facilitated transfer, the methods more generally apply to safe robotically-assisted parts mating and parts insertion.</description>

      <title>Differentiating Through Power Flow Solutions for Admittance and Topology Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power flow equations relate bus voltage phasors to power injections via the network admittance matrix. These equations are central to the key operational and protection functions of power systems (e.g., optimal power flow scheduling and control, state estimation, protection, and fault location, among others). As control, optimization, and estimation of network admittance parameters are central to multiple avenues of research in electric power systems, we propose a linearization of power flow solutions obtained by implicitly differentiating them with respect to the network admittance parameters. This is achieved by utilizing the implicit function theorem, in which we show that such a differentiation is guaranteed to exist under mild conditions and is applicable to generic power systems (radial or meshed). The proposed theory is applied to derive sensitivities of complex voltages, line currents, and power flows. The developed theory of linearizing the power flow equations around changes in the complex network admittance parameters has numerous applications. We demonstrate several of these applications, such as predicting the nodal voltages when the network topology changes without solving the power flow equations. We showcase the application for continuous admittance control, which is used to increase the hosting capacity of a given distribution network.</description>

      <title>Semantic Intelligence: A Bio-Inspired Cognitive Framework for Embodied Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced natural language understanding and content generation. However, these models primarily operate in disembodied digital environments and lack interaction with the physical world. To address this limitation, Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI) has emerged, focusing on agents that can perceive and interact with their surroundings. Despite progress, current embodied agents face challenges in unstructured real-world environments due to insufficient semantic intelligence, which is critical for understanding and reasoning about complex tasks. This paper introduces the Semantic Intelligence-Driven Embodied (SIDE) agent framework, which integrates a hierarchical semantic cognition architecture with a semantic-driven decision-making process. This enables agents to reason about and interact with the physical world in a contextually adaptive manner. The framework is inspired by biological cognitive mechanisms and utilizes bio-inspired principles to design a semantic cognitive architecture that mimics how humans and animals integrate and process sensory information. We present this framework as a step toward developing more intelligent and versatile embodied agents.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Framework for Online Mitigation of False Data Injection Signals in Networked Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel two-stage framework for online mitigation of False Data Injection (FDI) signals to improve the resiliency of Networked Control Systems (NCSs) and ensure their safe operation in the presence of malicious activities. The first stage involves meta learning to select a base time series forecasting model within a stacked ensemble learning architecture. This is achieved by converting time series data into scalograms using continuous wavelet transform, which are then split into image frames to generate a scalo-temporal representation of the data and to distinguish between different complexity levels of time series data based on an entropy metric using a convolutional neural network. In the second stage, the selected model mitigates false data injection signals in real-time. The proposed framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through rigorous simulations involving the formation control of differential drive mobile robots. By addressing the security challenges in NCSs, this framework offers a promising approach to maintaining system integrity and ensuring operational safety.</description>

      <title>Generalized Group Selection Strategies for Self-sustainable RIS-aided Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a cutting-edge communication technology that has been proposed as aviable option for beyond fifth-generation wireless communication networks. This paper investigates various group selection strategies in the context of grouping-based self-sustainable RIS-aided device-to-device (D2D) communication with spatially correlated wireless channels. Specifically, we consider both power splitting (PS) and time switching (TS) configurations, of the self-sustainable RIS to analyze the system performance and propose appropriate bounds on the choice of system parameters. The analysis takes into account a simplified linear energy harvesting (EH) model as well as a practical non-linear EH model. Based on the application requirements, we propose various group selection strategies at the RIS. Notably, each strategy schedules the k-th best available group at the RIS based on the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and also the energy harvested at a particular group of the RIS. Accordingly, by using tools from high order statistics, we derive analytical expressions for the outage probability of each selection strategy. Moreover, by applying the tools from extreme value theory, we also investigate an asymptotic scenario, where the number of groups available for selection at an RIS approaches infinity. The nontrivial insights obtained from this approach is especially beneficial in applications like large intelligent surface-aided wireless communication. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate the importance and benefits of the proposed approaches in terms of metrics such as the data throughput and the outage (both data and energy) performance.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Ground-Satellite Direct Access via Onboard Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-satellite links for 6G networks face critical challenges, including severe path loss, tight size-weight-power limits, and congested spectrum, all of which significantly hinder the performance of traditional radio frequency (RF) front ends. This article introduces the Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receiver (RAQR) for onboard satellite systems, a millimeter-scale front end that converts radio fields to optical signals through atomic electromagnetically induced transparency. RAQR's high sensitivity and high frequency selectivity address link budget, payload, and interference challenges while fitting within space constraints. A hybrid atomic-electronic design and supporting signal model demonstrate enhanced data rate, coverage, and sensing accuracy relative to conventional RF receivers. The article concludes with integration strategies, distributed-satellite concepts, and open research problems for bringing RAQR-enabled satellite payloads into service.</description>

      <title>Comparison and performance analysis of dynamic encrypted control approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encrypted controllers using homomorphic encryption have proven to guarantee the privacy of measurement and control signals, as well as system and controller parameters, while regulating the system as intended. However, encrypting dynamic controllers has remained a challenge due to growing noise and overflow issues in the encoding. In this paper, we review recent approaches to dynamic encrypted control, such as bootstrapping, periodic resets of the controller state, integer reformulations, and FIR controllers, and equip them with a stability and performance analysis to evaluate their suitability. We complement the analysis with a numerical performance comparison on a benchmark system.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Adaptive Systems via Normalized Parameter Estimation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new class of parameter estimation laws for adaptive systems, called \emph{normalized parameter estimation laws}. A key feature of these estimation laws is that they accelerate the convergence of the system state, $\mathit{x(t)}$, to the origin. We quantify this improvement by showing that our estimation laws guarantee finite integrability of the $\mathit{r}$-th root of the squared norm of the system state, i.e., \( \mathit{\|x(t)\|}_2^{2/\mathit{r}} \in \mathcal{L}_1, \) where $\mathit{r} \geq 1$ is a pre-specified parameter that, for a broad class of systems, can be chosen arbitrarily large. In contrast, standard Lyapunov-based estimation laws only guarantee integrability of $\mathit{\|x(t)\|}_2^2$ (i.e., $\mathit{r} = 1$). We motivate our method by showing that, for large values of $r$, this guarantee serves as a sparsity-promoting mechanism in the time domain, meaning that it penalizes prolonged signal duration and slow decay, thereby promoting faster convergence of $\mathit{x(t)}$. The proposed estimation laws do not rely on time-varying or high adaptation gains and do not require persistent excitation. Moreover, they can be applied to systems with matched and unmatched uncertainties, regardless of their dynamic structure, as long as a control Lyapunov function (CLF) exists. Finally, they are compatible with any CLF-based certainty equivalence controllers. We further develop higher-order extensions of our estimation laws by incorporating momentum into the estimation dynamics. We illustrate the performance improvements achieved with the proposed scheme through various numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Artificial magnetic conductor backed dual-mode sectoral cylindrical DRA for off-body biomedical telemetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the potential of a sectoral Cylindrical Dielectric Resonator Antenna (CDRA) for biomedical telemetry. CDRAs are known for their low loss, ruggedness, and stability, but their limited bandwidth and size make them unsuitable for wearable devices. The research addresses these limitations by proposing a dual mode antenna that operates in EH110 and TE210 modes. The sectoral CDRA is a quarter segment with Perfect Electric Conductor boundaries, reducing its size by a factor of four. Mathematical derivations of the field components for both modes are derived to support the design. To minimize specific absorption rate (SAR), an Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) surface is applied to the antennas backside, enhancing compatibility with the transverse electric modes. The antenna achieves a bandwidth of 0.7 GHz (5.2-5.9 GHz), suitable for biomedical applications, with a measured peak gain of 7.9 dBi and a SAR of 1.24 W/kg when applied to a human arm.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Optimization for Minimum Threat Exposure using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to solve the two-point boundary value problem (BVP) arising from the necessary conditions postulated by Pontryagin's Minimum Principle for optimal control. Such BVPs are known to be numerically difficult to solve by traditional shooting methods due to extremely high sensitivity to initial guesses. In the light of recent successes in applying PINNs for solving high-dimensional differential equations, we develop a PINN to solve the problem of finding trajectories with minimum exposure to a spatiotemporal threat for a vehicle kinematic model. First, we implement PINNs that are trained to solve the BVP for a given pair of initial and final states for a given threat field. Next, we implement a PINN conditioned on the initial state for a given threat field, which eliminates the need for retraining for each initial state. We demonstrate that the PINN outputs satisfy the necessary conditions with low numerical error.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Communication and Control Design for Distributed Frequency Regulation with Black-box Inverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources into the power grid, with often only black-box models available, challenges long-standing frequency control methods. Most recent works take a decentralized approach without online device coordination via communication. This paper considers both dynamic behavior and communication within secondary frequency control on an intermediate timescale. We develop a distributed data-driven approach that utilizes peer-to-peer communication between inverters to avoid the need for a central control center. To enable a trade off between communication network requirements and control performance, we present a framework to guide communication topology design for secondary frequency regulation. Following design of the inter-agent information exchange scheme, we design a controller that is structured according to the communication topology with a closed-loop stability guarantee. Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system validate the framework and illustrate the trade-off between communication requirements and control performance that is enabled by our approach.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents probabilistic bounds for the spectrum of the admittance matrix and classical linear power flow models under uncertain network parameters; for example, probabilistic line contingencies. Our proposed approach imports tools from probability theory, such as concentration inequalities for random matrices with independent entries.

      <description>arXiv:2510.15904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of deep neural network (DNN) workloads has significantly increased the demand for large-capacity on-chip SRAM in machine learning (ML) applications, with SRAM arrays now occupying a substantial fraction of the total die area. To address the dual challenges of storage density and computation efficiency, this paper proposes an NVM-in-Cache architecture that integrates resistive RAM (RRAM) devices into a conventional 6T-SRAM cell, forming a compact 6T-2R bit-cell. This hybrid cell enables Processing-in-Memory (PIM) mode, which performs massively parallel multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations directly on cache power lines while preserving stored cache data. By exploiting the intrinsic properties of the 6T-2R structure, the architecture achieves additional storage capability, high computational throughput without any bit-cell area overhead. Circuit- and array-level simulations in GlobalFoundries 22nm FDSOI technology demonstrate that the proposed design achieves a throughput of 0.4 TOPS and 491.78 TOPS/W. For 128 row-parallel operations, the CIFAR-10 classification is demonstrated by mapping a Resnet-18 neural network, achieving an accuracy of 91.27%. These results highlight the potential of the NVM-in-Cache approach to serve as a scalable, energy-efficient computing method by re-purposing existing 6T SRAM cache architecture for next-generation AI accelerators and general purpose processors.</description>

      <title>Nondeterminism-Aware Optimistic Verification for Floating-Point Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16028v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks increasingly run on hardware outside the user's control (cloud GPUs, inference marketplaces). Yet ML-as-a-Service reveals little about what actually ran or whether returned outputs faithfully reflect the intended inputs. Users lack recourse against service downgrades (model swaps, quantization, graph rewrites, or discrepancies like altered ad embeddings). Verifying outputs is hard because floating-point(FP) execution on heterogeneous accelerators is inherently nondeterministic. Existing approaches are either impractical for real FP neural networks or reintroduce vendor trust. We present NAO: a Nondeterministic tolerance Aware Optimistic verification protocol that accepts outputs within principled operator-level acceptance regions rather than requiring bitwise equality. NAO combines two error models: (i) sound per-operator IEEE-754 worst-case bounds and (ii) tight empirical percentile profiles calibrated across hardware. Discrepancies trigger a Merkle-anchored, threshold-guided dispute game that recursively partitions the computation graph until one operator remains, where adjudication reduces to a lightweight theoretical-bound check or a small honest-majority vote against empirical thresholds. Unchallenged results finalize after a challenge window, without requiring trusted hardware or deterministic kernels. We implement NAO as a PyTorch-compatible runtime and a contract layer currently deployed on Ethereum Holesky testnet. The runtime instruments graphs, computes per-operator bounds, and runs unmodified vendor kernels in FP32 with negligible overhead (0.3% on Qwen3-8B). Across CNNs, Transformers and diffusion models on A100, H100, RTX6000, RTX4090, empirical thresholds are $10^2-10^3$ times tighter than theoretical bounds, and bound-aware adversarial attacks achieve 0% success. NAO reconciles scalability with verifiability for real-world heterogeneous ML compute.</description>

      <title>Learning a Generalized Model for Substation Level Voltage Estimation in Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate voltage estimation in distribution networks is critical for real-time monitoring and increasing the reliability of the grid. As DER penetration and distribution level voltage variability increase, robust distribution system state estimation (DSSE) has become more essential to maintain safe and efficient operations. Traditional DSSE techniques, however, struggle with sparse measurements and the scale of modern feeders, limiting their scalability to large networks. This paper presents a hierarchical graph neural network for substation-level voltage estimation that exploits both electrical topology and physical features, while remaining robust to the low observability levels common to real-world distribution networks. Leveraging the public SMART-DS datasets, the model is trained and evaluated on thousands of buses across multiple substations and DER penetration scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 2 times lower RMSE than alternative data-driven models, and maintains high accuracy with as little as 1\% measurement coverage. The results highlight the potential of GNNs to enable scalable, reproducible, and data-driven voltage monitoring for distribution systems.</description>

      <title>Residual Correction Models for AC Optimal Power Flow Using DC Optimal Power Flow Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving the nonlinear AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem remains a major computational bottleneck for real-time grid operations. In this paper, we propose a residual learning paradigm that uses fast DC optimal power flow (DC OPF) solutions as a baseline, and learns only the nonlinear corrections required to provide the full AC-OPF solution. The method utilizes a topology-aware Graph Neural Network with local attention and two-level DC feature integration, trained using a physics-informed loss that enforces AC power-flow feasibility and operational limits. Evaluations on OPFData for 57-, 118-, and 2000-bus systems show around 25% lower MSE, up to 3X reduction in feasibility error, and up to 13X runtime speedup compared to conventional AC OPF solvers. The model maintains accuracy under N-1 contingencies and scales efficiently to large networks. These results demonstrate that residual learning is a practical and scalable bridge between linear approximations and AC-feasible OPF, enabling near real-time operational decision making.</description>

      <title>Explore-then-Commit for Nonstationary Linear Bandits with Latent Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a nonstationary bandit problem where rewards depend on both actions and latent states, the latter governed by unknown linear dynamics. Crucially, the state dynamics also depend on the actions, resulting in tension between short-term and long-term rewards. We propose an explore-then-commit algorithm for a finite horizon $T$. During the exploration phase, random Rademacher actions enable estimation of the Markov parameters of the linear dynamics, which characterize the action-reward relationship. In the commit phase, the algorithm uses the estimated parameters to design an optimized action sequence for long-term reward. Our proposed algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ regret. Our analysis handles two key challenges: learning from temporally correlated rewards, and designing action sequences with optimal long-term reward. We address the first challenge by providing near-optimal sample complexity and error bounds for system identification using bilinear rewards. We address the second challenge by proving an equivalence with indefinite quadratic optimization over a hypercube, a known NP-hard problem. We provide a sub-optimality guarantee for this problem, enabling our regret upper bound. Lastly, we propose a semidefinite relaxation with Goemans-Williamson rounding as a practical approach.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Task-Assignment with Uncertain Execution Times and Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While sequential task assignment for a single agent has been widely studied, such problems in a multi-agent setting, where the agents have heterogeneous task preferences or capabilities, remain less well-characterized. We study a multi-agent task assignment problem where a central planner assigns recurring tasks to multiple members of a team over a finite time horizon. For any given task, the members have heterogeneous capabilities in terms of task completion times, task resource consumption (which can model variables such as energy or attention), and preferences in terms of the rewards they collect upon task completion. We assume that the reward, execution time, and resource consumption for each member to complete any task are stochastic with unknown distributions. The goal of the planner is to maximize the total expected reward that the team receives over the problem horizon while ensuring that the resource consumption required for any assigned task is within the capability of the agent. We propose and analyze a bandit algorithm for this problem. Since the bandit algorithm relies on solving an optimal task assignment problem repeatedly, we analyze the achievable regret in two cases: when we can solve the optimal task assignment exactly and when we can solve it only approximately.</description>

      <title>DeGrip: A Compact Cable-driven Robotic Gripper for Desktop Disassembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent robotic disassembly of end-of-life (EOL) products has been a long-standing challenge in robotics. While machine learning techniques have shown promise, the lack of specialized hardware limits their application in real-world scenarios. We introduce DeGrip, a customized gripper designed for the disassembly of EOL computer desktops. DeGrip provides three degrees of freedom (DOF), enabling arbitrary configurations within the disassembly environment when mounted on a robotic manipulator. It employs a cable-driven transmission mechanism that reduces its overall size and enables operation in confined spaces. The wrist is designed to decouple the actuation of wrist and jaw joints. We also developed an EOL desktop disassembly environment in Isaac Sim to evaluate the effectiveness of DeGrip. The tasks were designed to demonstrate its ability to operate in confined spaces and disassemble components in arbitrary configurations. The evaluation results confirm the capability of DeGrip for EOL desktop disassembly.</description>

      <title>Personalized Collaborative Learning with Affinity-Based Variance Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent learning faces a fundamental tension: leveraging distributed collaboration without sacrificing the personalization needed for diverse agents. This tension intensifies when aiming for full personalization while adapting to unknown heterogeneity levels -- gaining collaborative speedup when agents are similar, without performance degradation when they are different. Embracing the challenge, we propose personalized collaborative learning (PCL), a novel framework for heterogeneous agents to collaboratively learn personalized solutions with seamless adaptivity. Through carefully designed bias correction and importance correction mechanisms, our method AffPCL robustly handles both environment and objective heterogeneity. We prove that AffPCL reduces sample complexity over independent learning by a factor of $\max\{n^{-1}, \delta\}$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $\delta\in[0,1]$ measures their heterogeneity. This affinity-based acceleration automatically interpolates between the linear speedup of federated learning in homogeneous settings and the baseline of independent learning, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. Our analysis further reveals that an agent may obtain linear speedup even by collaborating with arbitrarily dissimilar agents, unveiling new insights into personalization and collaboration in the high heterogeneity regime.</description>

      <title>Predictability of Complex Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of complex systems has attracted widespread attention from researchers in the fields of natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering. Prediction is one of the central issues in this field. Although most related studies have focused on prediction methods, research on the predictability of complex systems has received increasing attention across disciplines--aiming to provide theories and tools to address a key question: What are the limits of prediction accuracy? Predictability itself can serve as an important feature for characterizing complex systems, and accurate estimation of predictability can provide a benchmark for the study of prediction algorithms. This allows researchers to clearly identify the gap between current prediction accuracy and theoretical limits, thereby helping them determine whether there is still significant room to improve existing algorithms. More importantly, investigating predictability often requires the development of new theories and methods, which can further inspire the design of more effective algorithms. Over the past few decades, this field has undergone significant evolution. In particular, the rapid development of data science has introduced a wealth of data-driven approaches for understanding and quantifying predictability. This review summarizes representative achievements, integrating both data-driven and mechanistic perspectives. After a brief introduction to the significance of the topic in focus, we will explore three core aspects: the predictability of time series, the predictability of network structures, and the predictability of dynamical processes. Finally, we will provide extensive application examples across various fields and outline open challenges for future research.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction in The Loop: A Feedback-Based Uncertainty Model for Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a powerful statistical machine learning tool to construct uncertainty sets with coverage guarantees, which has fueled its extensive adoption in generating prediction regions for decision-making tasks, e.g., Trajectory Optimization (TO) in uncertain environments. However, existing methods predominantly employ a sequential scheme, where decisions rely unidirectionally on the prediction regions, and consequently the information from decision-making fails to be fed back to instruct CP. In this paper, we propose a novel Feedback-Based CP (Fb-CP) framework for shrinking-horizon TO with a joint risk constraint over the entire mission time. Specifically, a CP-based posterior risk calculation method is developed by fully leveraging the realized trajectories to adjust the posterior allowable risk, which is then allocated to future times to update prediction regions. In this way, the information in the realized trajectories is continuously fed back to the CP, enabling attractive feedback-based adjustments of the prediction regions and a provable online improvement in trajectory performance. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that such adjustments consistently maintain the coverage guarantees of the prediction regions, thereby ensuring provable safety. Additionally, we develop a decision-focused iterative risk allocation algorithm with theoretical convergence analysis for allocating the posterior allowable risk which closely aligns with Fb-CP. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to handle distribution shift. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are demonstrated through benchmark experiments.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Sensing Performance Design for Enhancing Secure Communication in Networked ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The channel state information (CSI) of an eavesdropper is crucial for physical layer security (PLS) design, but it is difficult to obtain due to the passive and non-cooperative nature of the eavesdropper. To this end, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) offers a novel solution by estimating the CSI of the eavesdropper based on sensing information. However, existing studies normally impose explicit and fixed sensing performance requirement without considering the varying communication conditions, which hinders the system from fully exploiting the synergy between sensing and communication. To address this issue, this paper proposes sensing-enhanced secure communication with adaptive sensing performance. Specifically, we formulate the sensing performance implicitly in the information leakage rate and adaptively optimize it for the minimization of the power consumption, offering enhanced flexibility and adaptability in sensing performance. We consider both centralized and decentralized designs to thoroughly investigate the impact of network structure on system performance and complexity. Specifically, we devise a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based method for centralized design. For decentralized design, we develop an optimization framework based on consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to reduce complexity and information exchange overhead. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed implicit sensing performance requirement design due to its capability to adaptively adjust the sensing performance to enhance the system performance for varying system configurations.</description>

      <title>Iterative solvers for partial differential equations with dissipative structure: Operator preconditioning and optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work considers the iterative solution of large-scale problems subject to non-symmetric matrices or operators arising in discretizations of (port-)Hamiltonian partial differential equations. We consider problems governed by an operator $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{H}+\mathcal{S}$ with symmetric part $\mathcal{H}$ that is positive (semi-)definite and skew-symmetric part $\mathcal{S}$. Prior work has shown that the structure and sparsity of the associated linear system enables Krylov subspace solvers such as the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) or short recurrence variants such as Widlund's or Rapoport's method using the symmetric part $\mathcal{H}$, or an approximation of it, as preconditioner. In this work, we analyze the resulting condition numbers, which are crucial for fast convergence of these methods, for various partial differential equations (PDEs) arising in diffusion phenomena, fluid dynamics, and elasticity. We show that preconditioning with the symmetric part leads to a condition number uniform in the mesh size in case of elliptic and parabolic PDEs where $\mathcal{H}^{-1}\mathcal{S}$ is a bounded operator. Further, we employ the tailored Krylov subspace methods in optimal control by means of a condensing approach and a constraint preconditioner for the optimality system. We illustrate the results by various large-scale numerical examples and discuss efficient evaluations of the preconditioner, such as incomplete Cholesky factorization or the algebraic multigrid method.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware Hybrid Wi-Fi/BLE Fingerprinting via Evidence-Theoretic Fusion and Persistent Homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor localization remains challenging in GNSS-denied environments due to multipath, device heterogeneity, and volatile radio conditions. We propose a topology-aware, hybrid Wi-Fi/BLE fingerprinting framework that (i) applies physically consistent RSS normalization (dBm z-scoring or dBm -&gt; linear mW -&gt; z-score), (ii) denoises streams with classical Bayesian filters (KF/UKF/PF), (iii) combines complementary regressors (Random Forest and weighted kNN with a diagonal Mahalanobis metric), (iv) performs evidence-theoretic fusion via Dempster-Shafer theory (DST), and (v) augments each sample with persistent-homology (PH) descriptors. The system outputs both (x, y) estimates and interpretable belief maps, and is engineered for microcontroller-class deployment with per-update cost O(T log M + log M + Mp + S).
  We evaluate on two heterogeneous datasets, including a new 1,200-sample ESP32 survey, and report ablations, robustness to test-only noise, and significance across 10 stratified splits. Under 10% synthetic RSS noise, the full pipeline attains 3.40 m (Dataset 1) and 2.45 m (Dataset 2) RMSE, improving a strong PF + RF baseline by about 37%. Averaged across splits, it yields 4.993 +/- 0.15 m versus 6.292 +/- 0.13 m (20.6% relative reduction; p &lt; 0.001). In noise-free tests, accuracy tightens to 0.44 m and 0.32 m (up to 56% better). Compared with recent learning-heavy approaches that assume large site-specific datasets and GPU inference, our method delivers competitive accuracy with formal uncertainty quantification and low computational cost suitable for real-time deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a promising technology for enhancing wireless communications through dense antenna arrays. Accurate channel estimation is critical to unlocking their full performance potential. To enhance RIS channel estimators, this paper proposes a novel observation matrix design scheme. Bayesian optimization framework is adopted to generate observation matrices that maximize the mutual information between received pilot signals and RIS channels. To solve the formulated problem efficiently, we develop an alternating Riemannian manifold optimization (ARMO) algorithm to alternately update the receiver combiners and RIS phase-shift matrices. An adaptive kernel training strategy is further introduced to iteratively refine the channel covariance matrix without requiring additional pilot resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ARMO-enhanced estimator achieves substantial gains in estimation accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Intelligent Traffic Signaling in Dhaka City Based on Vehicle Detection and Congestion Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vehicular density in urbanizing cities of developing countries such as Dhaka, Bangladesh result in a lot of traffic congestion, causing poor on-road experiences. Traffic signaling is a key component in effective traffic management for such situations, but the advancements in intelligent traffic signaling have been exclusive to developed countries with structured traffic. The non-lane-based, heterogeneous traffic of Dhaka City requires a contextual approach. This study focuses on the development of an intelligent traffic signaling system feasible in the context of developing countries such as Bangladesh. We propose a pipeline leveraging Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) feeds, a low resources system Raspberry Pi 4B processing, and a state of the art YOLO-based object detection model trained on the Non-lane-based and Heterogeneous Traffic (NHT-1071) dataset to detect and classify heterogeneous traffic. A multi-objective optimization algorithm, NSGA-II, then generates optimized signal timings, minimizing waiting time while maximizing vehicle throughput. We test our implementation in a five-road intersection at Palashi, Dhaka, demonstrating the potential to significantly improve traffic management in similar situations. The developed testbed paves the way for more contextual and effective Intelligent Traffic Signaling (ITS) solutions for developing areas with complicated traffic dynamics such as Dhaka City.</description>

      <title>QRTlib: A Library for Fast Quantum Real Transforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-valued transforms such as the discrete cosine, sine, and Hartley transforms play a central role in classical computing, complementing the Fourier transform in applications from signal and image processing to data compression. However, their quantum counterparts have not evolved in parallel, and no unified framework exists for implementing them efficiently on quantum hardware. This article addresses this gap by introducing QRTlib, a library for fast and practical implementations of quantum real transforms, including the quantum Hartley, cosine, and sine transforms of various types. We develop new algorithms and circuit optimizations that make these transforms efficient and suitable for near-term devices. In particular, we present a quantum Hartley transform based on the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) technique, achieving a fourfold reduction in circuit size compared to prior methods, and an improved quantum sine transform of Type I that removes large multi-controlled operations. We also introduce circuit-level optimizations, including two's-complement and or-tree constructions. QRTlib provides the first complete implementations of these quantum real transforms in Qiskit.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Robust Control of Fixed-Wing Aircraft under Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based path-following controller for a fixed-wing small uncrewed aircraft system (sUAS) that is robust to uncertainties in the aerodynamic model of the sUAS. The controller is trained using the Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning framework, where an adversary perturbs the environment (aerodynamic model) to expose the agent (sUAS) to demanding scenarios. In our formulation, the adversary introduces rate-bounded perturbations to the aerodynamic model coefficients. We demonstrate that adversarial training improves robustness compared to controllers trained using stochastic model uncertainty. The learned controller is also benchmarked against a switched uncertain initial condition controller. The effectiveness of the approach is validated through high-fidelity simulations using a realistic six-degree-of-freedom fixed-wing aircraft model, showing accurate and robust path-following performance under a variety of uncertain aerodynamic conditions.</description>

      <title>Robust Dynamic Staffing with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a natural dynamic staffing problem in which a decision-maker sequentially hires workers over a finite horizon to meet an unknown demand revealed at the end. Predictions about demand arrive over time and become increasingly accurate, while worker availability decreases. This creates a fundamental trade-off between hiring early to avoid understaffing (when workers are more available but forecasts are less reliable) and hiring late to avoid overstaffing (when forecasts are more accurate but availability is lower). This problem is motivated by last-mile delivery operations, where companies such as Amazon rely on gig-economy workers whose availability declines closer to the operating day.
  To address practical limitations of Bayesian models (in particular, to remain agnostic to the underlying forecasting method), we study this problem under adversarial predictions. In this model, sequential predictions are adversarially chosen uncertainty intervals that (approximately) contain the true demand. The objective is to minimize worst-case staffing imbalance cost. Our main result is a simple and computationally efficient online algorithm that is minimax optimal. We first characterize the minimax cost against a restricted adversary via a polynomial-size linear program, then show how to emulate this solution in the general case. While our base model focuses on a single demand, we extend the framework to multiple demands (with egalitarian/utilitarian objectives), to settings with costly reversals of hiring decisions, and to inconsistent prediction intervals. We also introduce a practical "re-solving" variant of our algorithm, which we prove is also minimax optimal. Finally we conduct numerical experiments showing that our algorithms outperform Bayesian heuristics in both cost and speed, and are competitive with (approximate or exact) Bayesian-optimal policies when those can be computed.</description>

      <title>Geometric Control Theory Over Networks: Minimal Node Cardinality Disturbance Decoupling Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show how to formulate and solve disturbance decoupling problems over networks while choosing a minimal number of input and output nodes. Feedback laws that isolate and eliminate the impact of disturbance nodes on specific target nodes to be protected are provided using state, output, and dynamical feedback. For that, we leverage the fact that when reformulated in terms of sets of nodes rather than subspaces, the controlled and conditional invariance properties admit a simple graphical interpretation. For state and dynamical feedback, the minimal input and output cardinality solutions can be computed exactly in polynomial time, via min-cut/max-flow algorithms.</description>

      <title>Local integral input-to-state stability for non-autonomous infinite-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove comparison principles for nonlinear differential equations with time-varying coefficients and develop Lyapunov analytical tools for the integral input-to-state stability (iISS) analysis of nonlinear non-autonomous infinite-dimensional systems, which involve nonlinearities satisfying a superlinear growth, {bringing} difficulties to the iISS {analysis.} Specifically, our approach starts by establishing several forms of comparison principles for a wide range of ordinary differential equations having time-varying coefficients and superlinear terms, paving the way to conduct iISS assessment for general nonlinear non-autonomous infinite-dimensional systems within the Lyapunov stability framework. Then, by using the comparison principles, we prove a local {iISS} {(LiISS)} Lyapunov theorem for the nonlinear non-autonomous infinite-dimensional systems in the framework of Banach spaces. {Furthermore,} we provide sufficient conditions of the existence of a local iISS Lyapunonv functional (LiISS-LF) and construct LiISS-LFs for the systems in the framework of Hilbert spaces. Finally, we preset two examples to illustrate the proposed {Lyapunov} method for the LiISS analysis: one is to show how to obtain the LiISS of a nonlinear finite-dimensional system with time-varying coefficients and superlinear terms under linear state feedback control law while another one is to show how to employ the interpolation inequalities to handle superliner terms and establish the LiISS-LF for a class of multi-dimensional parabolic equations with space-time-varying coefficients. To demonstrate the validity of the results, numerical experiments are also conducted to verify the LiISS of these two classes of systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Invariant Extended Kalman Filter for Legged Robot State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State estimation is crucial for legged robots as it directly affects control performance and locomotion stability. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Invariant Extended Kalman Filter to improve proprioceptive state estimation for legged robots. The proposed method adaptively adjusts the noise level of the contact foot model based on online covariance estimation, leading to improved state estimation under varying contact conditions. It effectively handles small slips that traditional slip rejection fails to address, as overly sensitive slip rejection settings risk causing filter divergence. Our approach employs a contact detection algorithm instead of contact sensors, reducing the reliance on additional hardware. The proposed method is validated through real-world experiments on the quadruped robot LeoQuad, demonstrating enhanced state estimation performance in dynamic locomotion scenarios.</description>

      <title>Ultra High Sensitivity Soil Moisture Detection Using Photonic Crystal Cavity with SIW Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soil nutrients and water content are two crucial factors that significantly affect agricultural production yields. Hence, monitoring and measuring the water content and soil type are critical requirements. This study proposes a two-dimensional structure of photonic crystals centered around a symmetrical cross-shaped slot. The cross-slots act as resonators, and the photonic crystals surrounding the slots tune the resonance frequency of the resonators to enhance mode confinement within the resonator. The various resonant modes are located in the 2.1 GHz, 5.2 GHz, and 8.1 GHz bands, which correspond to the S band, C band, and X band, respectively. These bands are used to compare the absorption, whereas the upper resonant mode is of the order of 20 GHz. Band structure analysis was performed using the Plane Wave Method (PWM). The resonant frequency is computed using a 3D electromagnetic (EM) simulation software that utilizes the Finite Element Method (FEM) and lies in the radiation mode region of the band structure of the photonic crystal. Varying the incident angle had a negligible effect on the absorption characteristics of the sensor, allowing it to produce accurate sensing results regardless of the incident angle. The sensor's sensitivity is maximized using this design, which results in a sensitivity of 85.4 % in the 2.1 GHz resonant frequency, which is much higher than that of a single column of photonic crystal-based SIW, resulting in 50.6 % of sensitivity at 2.1 GHz, at which there is a frequency shift of the order of GHz. In contrast, in the proposed design, the frequency shift is on the order of MHz, resulting in ultra-high sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution for Virtual Power Plant Communication: A Lightweight Key-Aware Scheduler with Provable Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual power plants (VPPs) are becoming a cornerstone of future grids, aggregating distributed PV, wind, storage, and flexible loads for market participation and real-time balancing. As operations move to minute-- and second--level feedback, communication security shifts from a compliance item to an operational constraint: latency, reliability, and confidentiality jointly determine whether dispatch, protection, and settlement signals arrive on time. Conventional PKI and key-rotation schemes struggle with cross-domain, high-frequency messaging and face long-term quantum threats. Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers information-theoretic key freshness, but its key yield is scarce and stochastic, often misaligned with bursty VPP traffic. This paper proposes a key-aware priority and quota framework that treats quantum keys as first-class scheduling resources. The design combines (i) forecast-driven long-term quotas and short-term tokens, (ii) key-aware deficit-round-robin arbitration, (iii) a preemptive emergency key reserve, and (iv) graceful degradation via encryption-mode switching and controlled down-sampling for non-critical traffic. A drift-plus-penalty analysis establishes strong stability under average supply--demand balance with quantifiable bounds on backlog and tail latency, providing interpretable operating guarantees. We build a reproducible testbed on IEEE 33- and 123-bus VPP systems and evaluate normal, degraded, and outage regimes with industry-consistent message classes and TTLs. Against FIFO, fixed-priority, and static-quota baselines, the proposed scheme consistently reduces tail delay and passive timeouts for critical messages, improves per-bit key utility, and enhances power-tracking reliability during key scarcity and regime switches.</description>

      <title>Floating-Base Deep Lagrangian Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grey-box methods for system identification combine deep learning with physics-informed constraints, capturing complex dependencies while improving out-of-distribution generalization. Yet, despite the growing importance of floating-base systems such as humanoids and quadrupeds, current grey-box models ignore their specific physical constraints. For instance, the inertia matrix is not only positive definite but also exhibits branch-induced sparsity and input independence. Moreover, the 6x6 composite spatial inertia of the floating base inherits properties of single-rigid-body inertia matrices. As we show, this includes the triangle inequality on the eigenvalues of the composite rotational inertia. To address the lack of physical consistency in deep learning models of floating-base systems, we introduce a parameterization of inertia matrices that satisfies all these constraints. Inspired by Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN), we train neural networks to predict physically plausible inertia matrices that minimize inverse dynamics error under Lagrangian mechanics. For evaluation, we collected and released a dataset on multiple quadrupeds and humanoids. In these experiments, our Floating-Base Deep Lagrangian Networks (FeLaN) achieve highly competitive performance on both simulated and real robots, while providing greater physical interpretability.</description>

      <title>Breaking and Fixing Defenses Against Control-Flow Hijacking in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control-flow hijacking attacks manipulate orchestration mechanisms in multi-agent systems into performing unsafe actions that compromise the system and exfiltrate sensitive information. Recently proposed defenses, such as LlamaFirewall, rely on alignment checks of inter-agent communications to ensure that all agent invocations are "related to" and "likely to further" the original objective.
  We start by demonstrating control-flow hijacking attacks that evade these defenses even if alignment checks are performed by advanced LLMs. We argue that the safety and functionality objectives of multi-agent systems fundamentally conflict with each other. This conflict is exacerbated by the brittle definitions of "alignment" and the checkers' incomplete visibility into the execution context.
  We then propose, implement, and evaluate ControlValve, a new defense inspired by the principles of control-flow integrity and least privilege. ControlValve (1) generates permitted control-flow graphs for multi-agent systems, and (2) enforces that all executions comply with these graphs, along with contextual rules (generated in a zero-shot manner) for each agent invocation.</description>

      <title>A polynomial-based QCQP solver for encrypted optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel method for solving a class of quadratically constrained quadratic optimization problems using only additions and multiplications. This approach enables solving constrained optimization problems on private data since the operations involved are compatible with the capabilities of homomorphic encryption schemes. To solve the constrained optimization problem, a sequence of polynomial penalty functions of increasing degree is introduced, which are sufficiently steep at the boundary of the feasible set. Adding the penalty function to the original cost function creates a sequence of unconstrained optimization problems whose minimizer always lies in the admissible set and converges to the minimizer of the constrained problem. A gradient descent method is used to generate a sequence of iterates associated with these problems. For the algorithm, it is shown that the iterate converges to a minimizer of the original problem, and the feasible set is positively invariant under the iteration. Finally, the method is demonstrated on an illustrative cryptographic problem, finding the smaller value of two numbers, and the encrypted implementability is discussed.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Quality of a Set of Basis Functions for Inverse Optimal Control via Projection onto Global Minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse optimization (Inverse optimal control) is the task of imputing a cost function such that given test points (trajectories) are (nearly) optimal with respect to the discovered cost. Prior methods in inverse optimization assume that the true cost is a convex combination of a set of convex basis functions and that this basis is consistent with the test points. However, the consistency assumption is not always justified, as in many applications the principles by which the data is generated are not well understood. This work proposes using the distance between a test point and the set of global optima generated by the convex combinations of the convex basis functions as a measurement for the expressive quality of the basis with respect to the test point. A large minimal distance invalidates the set of basis functions. The concept of a set of global optima is introduced and its properties are explored in unconstrained and constrained settings. Upper and lower bounds for the minimum distance in the convex quadratic setting are implemented by bi-level gradient descent and an enriched linear matrix inequality respectively. Extensions to this framework include max-representable basis functions, nonconvex basis functions (local minima), and applying polynomial optimization techniques.</description>

      <title>Process Automation Architecture Using RFID for Transparent Voting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a process automation architecture leveraging Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for secure, transparent and efficient voting systems. The proposed architecture automates the voting workflow through RFID-enabled voter identification, encrypted vote casting, and secure data transmission. Each eligible voter receives a smart RFID card containing a uniquely encrypted identifier, which is verified using an RC522 reader interfaced with a microcontroller. Upon successful verification, the voter interacts with a touchscreen interface to cast a vote, which is then encrypted using AES-128 and securely stored on a local SD card or transmitted via GSM to a central server. A tamper-proof monitoring mechanism records each session with time-stamped digital signatures, ensuring auditability and data integrity. The architecture is designed to function in both online and offline modes, with an automated batch synchronization mechanism that updates vote records once network connectivity is restored. System testing in simulated environments confirmed 100% voter authentication accuracy, minimized latency (average voting time of 11.5 seconds), and robustness against cloning, double voting, and data interception. The integration of real-time monitoring and secure process control modules enables electoral authorities to automate data logging, detect anomalies, and validate system integrity dynamically. This work demonstrates a scalable, automation-driven solution for voting infrastructure, offering enhanced transparency, resilience, and deployment flexibility, especially in environments where digital transformation of electoral processes is critically needed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology that integrates trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) with an energy-efficient robotic arm for intelligent waste classification and sorting. By utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) enhanced through transfer learning with MobileNetV2, the system accurately classifies waste into six categories: plastic, glass, metal, paper, cardboard, and trash. The model achieved a high training accuracy of 99.8% and a validation accuracy of 80.5%, demonstrating strong learning and generalization. A robotic arm simulator is implemented to perform virtual sorting, calculating the energy cost for each action using Euclidean distance to ensure optimal and efficient movement. The framework incorporates key elements of trustworthy AI, such as transparency, robustness, fairness, and safety, making it a reliable and scalable solution for smart waste management systems in urban settings.</description>

      <title>Inverse Optimal Control of Muscle Force Sharing During Pathological Gait</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muscle force sharing is typically resolved by minimizing a specific objective function to approximate neural control strategies. An inverse optimal control approach was applied to identify the "best" objective function, among a positive linear combination of basis objective functions, associated with the gait of two post-stroke males, one high-functioning (subject S1) and one low-functioning (subject S2). It was found that the "best" objective function is subject- and leg-specific. No single function works universally well, yet the best options are usually differently weighted combinations of muscle activation- and power-minimization. Subject-specific inverse optimal control models performed best on their respective limbs (\textbf{RMSE 178/213 N, CC 0.71/0.61} for non-paretic and paretic legs of S1; \textbf{RMSE 205/165 N, CC 0.88/0.85} for respective legs of S2), but cross-subject generalization was poor, particularly for paretic legs. Moreover, minimizing the root mean square of muscle power emerged as important for paretic limbs, while minimizing activation-based functions dominated for non-paretic limbs. This may suggest different neural control strategies between affected and unaffected sides, possibly altered by the presence of spasticity. Among the 15 considered objective functions commonly used in inverse dynamics-based computations, the root mean square of muscle power was the only one explicitly incorporating muscle velocity, leading to a possible model for spasticity in the paretic limbs. Although this objective function has been rarely used, it may be relevant for modeling pathological gait, such as post-stroke gait.</description>

Abstract: The vision of a smart wireless factory (SWF) demands highly flexible, low-latency, and reliable connectivity that goes beyond conventional wireless solutions. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered communications, when integrated with the open radio access network (O-RAN) architectures, have emerged as a promising enabler to meet these challenging requirements. This article introduces the methodology for the orchestration of RIS with xApps (ORIX), bringing the RIS technology into the O-RAN ecosystem through xApp-based control for SWF environments. ORIX features three key components: an O-RAN-compliant RIS service model for dynamic configuration, an RIS channel simulator that supports 3GPP indoor factory models with multiple industrial scenarios, and practical RIS optimization strategies with finite-resolution control. Together, these elements provide a realistic end-to-end emulation platform for evaluating RIS placement, control, and performance in SWF environments prior to deployment. The presented case study demonstrates how ORIX enables the evaluation of achievable performance gains, exploration of trade-offs among key RIS design parameters, and identification of deployment strategies that balance system performance with practical implementation constraints. By bridging theoretical advances with industrial feasibility, ORIX lays the groundwork for RIS-assisted O-RAN networks to power next-generation wireless communication in industrial scenarios.</description>

      <title>A condensing approach for linear-quadratic optimization with geometric constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization problems with convex quadratic cost and polyhedral constraints are ubiquitous in signal processing, automatic control and decision-making. We consider here an enlarged problem class that allows to encode logical conditions and cardinality constraints, among others. In particular, we cover also situations where parts of the constraints are nonconvex and possibly complicated, but it is practical to compute projections onto this nonconvex set. Our approach combines the augmented Lagrangian framework with a solver-agnostic structure-exploiting subproblem reformulation. While convergence guarantees follow from the former, the proposed condensing technique leads to significant improvements in computational performance.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Lagrangian Methods in Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In safety-critical domains such as robotics, navigation and power systems, constrained optimization problems arise where maximizing performance must be carefully balanced with associated constraints. Safe reinforcement learning provides a framework to address these challenges, with Lagrangian methods being a popular choice. However, the effectiveness of Lagrangian methods crucially depends on the choice of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$, which governs the trade-off between return and constraint cost. A common approach is to update the multiplier automatically during training. Although this is standard in practice, there remains limited empirical evidence on the robustness of an automated update and its influence on overall performance. Therefore, we analyze (i) optimality and (ii) stability of Lagrange multipliers in safe reinforcement learning across a range of tasks. We provide $\lambda$-profiles that give a complete visualization of the trade-off between return and constraint cost of the optimization problem. These profiles show the highly sensitive nature of $\lambda$ and moreover confirm the lack of general intuition for choosing the optimal value $\lambda^*$. Our findings additionally show that automated multiplier updates are able to recover and sometimes even exceed the optimal performance found at $\lambda^*$ due to the vast difference in their learning trajectories. Furthermore, we show that automated multiplier updates exhibit oscillatory behavior during training, which can be mitigated through PID-controlled updates. However, this method requires careful tuning to achieve consistently better performance across tasks. This highlights the need for further research on stabilizing Lagrangian methods in safe reinforcement learning. The code used to reproduce our results can be found at https://github.com/lindsayspoor/Lagrangian_SafeRL.</description>

      <title>FlipDyn with Control: Resource Takeover Games with Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce FlipDyn with control, a finite-horizon zero-sum resource takeover game, where a defender and an adversary decide when to takeover and how to control a common resource. At each discrete-time step, the players can take over or retain control, incurring state and control-dependent costs. The system is modeled as a hybrid dynamical system, with a discrete \texttt{FlipDyn} state determining control authority. Our contributions are: (i) For arbitrary non-negative costs, we derive the saddle-point value of the \texttt{FlipDyn} game and the corresponding Nash equilibria (NE) takeover strategies. (ii) For linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, we establish sufficient conditions under which the game admits an NE. (iii) For scalar linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, we derive parameterized NE takeover strategies and saddle-point values independent of the continuous state. (iv) For higher-dimensional linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, we derive approximate NE takeover strategies and control policies, and compute bounds on the saddle-point values. We validate our results through a numerical study on adversarial control of a linear system.</description>

      <title>Interacting Particle Systems for Fast Linear Quadratic RL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the design of algorithms based on systems of interacting particles to represent, approximate, and learn the optimal control law for reinforcement learning (RL). The primary contribution is that convergence rates are greatly accelerated by the interactions between particles. Theory focuses on the linear quadratic stochastic optimal control problem for which a complete and novel theory is presented. Apart from the new algorithm, sample complexity bounds are obtained, and it is shown that the mean square error scales as $1/N$ where $N$ is the number of particles. The theoretical results and algorithms are illustrated with numerical experiments and comparisons with other recent approaches, where the faster convergence of the proposed algorithm is numerically demonstrated.</description>

      <title>A Volumetric Privacy Measure for Dynamical Systems With Bounded Disturbance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02893v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a volumetric privacy framework for dynamical systems subject to bounded disturbances, developed without requiring prior knowledge of their probability distributions. We consider systems with both public and private states, where a set containing the public state is shared as the observation. An adversary is assumed to execute an inference attack by exploiting the observed public state set to estimate an uncertainty set for the private state. The volume of this inferred set quantifies the adversary's estimation uncertainty and serves as the proposed volumetric privacy metric. Approximate set-membership estimation techniques are developed to compute the private-state uncertainty set, and the properties of the privacy measure are analyzed, demonstrating that it is bounded by the information gain from the observation set. Furthermore, an optimization-based privacy filter design problem is formulated, employing randomization and linear programming to enhance the volumetric privacy level. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through a production-inventory case study. Results show that the optimal privacy filter significantly improves robustness against inference attacks and outperforms two baseline mechanisms based on additive noise and quantization.</description>

      <title>Informativity Conditions for Multiple Signals: Properties, Experimental Design, and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies highlight the importance of persistently exciting condition in single signal sequence for model identification and data-driven control methodologies. However, maintaining prolonged excitation in control signals introduces significant challenges, as continuous excitation can reduce the lifetime of mechanical devices. In this paper, we introduce three informativity conditions for various types of multi-signal data, each augmented by weight factors. We explore the interrelations between these conditions and their rank properties in linear time-invariant systems. Furthermore, we introduce open-loop experimental design methods tailored to each of the three conditions, which can synthesize the required excitation conditions either offline or online, even in the presence of limited information within each signal segment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these informativity conditions in least-squares identification. Additionally, all three conditions can extend Willems' fundamental lemma and are utilized to assess the properties of the system. Illustrative examples confirm that these conditions yield satisfactory outcomes in both least-squares identification and the construction of data-driven controllers.</description>

      <title>Passivity-Based Robust Shape Control of a Cable-Driven Solar Sail Boom for the CABLESSail Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar sails provide a means of propulsion using solar radiation pressure, which offers the possibility of exciting new spacecraft capabilities. However, solar sails have attitude control challenges because of the significant disturbance torques that they encounter due to imperfections in the sail and its supporting structure, as well as limited actuation capabilities. The Cable-Actuated Bio-inspired Lightweight Elastic Solar Sail (CABLESSail) concept was previously proposed to overcome these challenges by controlling the shape of the sail through cable actuation. The structural flexibility of CABLESSail introduces control challenges, which necessitate the design of a robust feedback controller for this system. The purpose of the proposed research here is to design a robust controller to ensure precise and reliable control of CABLESSail's boom. Taking into account the system dynamics and the dynamic properties of the CABLESSail concept, a passivity-based proportional-derivative (PD) controller for a single boom on the CABLESSail system is designed. To reach the nonzero desired setpoints, a feedforward input is additionally applied to the control law and a time-varying feedforward input is used instead of the constant one to effectively track a time-varying desired boom tip deflection. This control law is assessed by numerical simulations and by tests using a smaller-scale prototype of Solar Cruiser. Both the simulation and the test results show that this PD control with the time-varying feedforward input robustly controls the flexible cable-actuated solar sail.</description>

      <title>Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics Enhanced by Ensemble Learning, Multi-Step Prediction Evaluation, Elite Strategy, and Classification Techniques for Applications to Industrial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) with control and exogenous inputs for highly accurate and reliable prediction. Although SINDy is recognized as a remarkable approach for identifying nonlinear systems, several challenges remain. Its application to industrial systems remains limited, and multi-step predictions are not guaranteed due to overfitting and noisy data. This phenomenon is often caused by the increase in basis functions resulting from the extension of coordinates, such as time-delay embedding. To address these problems, this study proposes an emphasized SINDy framework by integrating ensemble-learning, multi-step prediction evaluations, elite strategy, and classification techniques (EMEC-SINDy), while preserving convex optimization. The proposed method employs library bagging and extracts elites with an R-squared greater than 90%. Then, clustering is performed on the surviving elites because physically motivated basis functions are not always available, and the elites obtained do not always have similar basis functions. After the classification, discrete model candidates are obtained by taking the mean of each classified elite. Finally, the best model is selected. Simulation results demonstrate that EMEC-SINDy significantly outperforms original SINDy approaches in multi-step prediction accuracy under noisy conditions, validating its applicability to the diesel engine airpath system, which is known as a complex and highly coupled nonlinear multi-input multi-output system.</description>

      <title>An ANN-Enhanced Approach for Flatness-Based Constrained Control of Nonlinear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks have proven practical for a synergistic combination of advanced control techniques. This work analyzes the implementation of rectified linear unit neural networks to achieve constrained control in differentially flat systems. Specifically, the class of flat systems enjoys the benefit of feedback linearizability, i.e., the systems can be linearized by means of a proper variable transformation. However, the price for linearizing the dynamics is that the constraint descriptions are distorted geometrically. Our results show that, by using neural networks, these constraints can be represented as a union of polytopes, enabling the use of mixed-integer programming tools to guarantee constraint satisfaction. We further analyze the integration of the characterization into efficient settings such as control Lyapunov function-based and model predictive control (MPC). Interestingly, this description also allows us to explicitly compute the solution of the MPC problem for the nonlinear system. Several examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Nash equilibrium seeking in coalition games for multiple Euler-Lagrange systems: Analysis and application to USV swarm confrontation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses a class of Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking problems in coalition games involving both local and coupling constraints for multiple Euler-Lagrange (EL) systems subject to disturbances of unknown bounds. Within each coalition, agents cooperatively minimize a shared cost function while competing against other coalitions. A distributed strategy is proposed to seek the NE under informational constraints, where each agent has access only to its own action, cost function, and constraint parameters. In the proposed distributed NE seeking strategy, adaptive techniques are combined with sign functions to handle model uncertainties and disturbances with unknown bounds in the EL systems. To deal with the Lagrange multipliers associated with local and coupling constraints, primal-dual techniques are integrated with consensus protocols. Additionally, a dynamic average consensus algorithm is employed to estimate the gradient of the coalition cost function, while a leader-following protocol is utilized to estimate the actions of other agents. Under standard convexity and graph-connectivity assumptions, global convergence of the closed-loop EL system to the NE is established. As an illustrative application, a swarm confrontation of unmanned surface vehicles involving formation, encirclement, and interception tasks is modeled within the coalition game framework, and numerical simulations are conducted under this model to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>The impact of large-scale EV charging on the real-time operation of distribution systems: A comprehensive review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the large-scale integration of electric vehicles (EVs) in the distribution grid, the unpredictable nature of EV charging introduces considerable uncertainties to the grid's real-time operations. This can exacerbate load fluctuations, compromise power quality, and pose risks to the grid's stability and security. However, due to their dual role as controllable loads and energy storage devices, EVs have the potential to mitigate these fluctuations, balance the variability of renewable energy sources, and provide ancillary services that support grid stability. By leveraging the bidirectional flow of information and energy in smart grids, the adverse effects of EV charging can be minimized and even converted into beneficial outcomes through effective real-time management strategies. This paper explores the negative impacts of EV charging on the distribution system's real-time operations and outlines methods to transform these challenges into positive contributions. Additionally, it provides an in-depth analysis of the real-time management system for EV charging, focusing on state estimation and management strategies.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating missing values in trajectories of linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems. We solve this interpolation problem for the class of shifted-affine LPV systems. Conditions for the existence and uniqueness of solutions are given and a direct data-driven algorithm for its computation is presented, i.e., the data-generating system is not given by a parametric model but is implicitly specified by data. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed solution on illustrative examples of a mass-spring-damper system with exogenous and endogenous parameter variation.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Underwater Optical Wireless Communication Using O-RIS and Fiber Optic Backhaul (Extended version)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Letter presents a novel hybrid underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) system that integrates underwater optical access points (UOAPs) with a passive optical network (PON)-based fiber-optic backhaul to provide a resilient backbone. A hard switching mechanism is employed between direct and optical reconfigurable intelligent surface (O-RIS)-assisted links to ensure reliable connectivity. Unlike previous studies, the proposed system is evaluated under both active and multiple passive O-RIS configurations. To enhance reliability, the Selection Combining (SC) and Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) schemes are applied. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that optimal O-RIS placement significantly enhances system performance. However, in the linear regime, placing it too close to the receiver causes degradation due to increased path loss and beam jitter in an identical water type. Moreover, increasing the number of O-RIS elements within practical limits further improves overall system performance and enhances adaptability to variations in the underwater channel.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Dynamic Consensus in Multi-Agent Systems: A Q-Function Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new method for achieving dynamic consensus in linear discrete-time homogeneous multi-agent systems (MAS) with marginally stable or unstable dynamics. The guarantee of consensus in this setting involves a set of constraints based on the graph's spectral properties, complicating the design of the coupling gains. This challenge intensifies for large-scale systems with diverse graph Laplacian spectra. The proposed approach reformulates the dynamic consensus problem with a prescribed convergence rate using a state-action value function framework inspired by optimal control theory. Specifically, a synthetic linear quadratic regulation (LQR) formulation is introduced to encode the consensus objective, enabling its translation into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. The resulting SDP is applicable in both model-based and model-free settings for jointly designing the local feedback and coupling gains. To handle the inherent non-convex feasibility conditions, a convex-concave decomposition strategy is employed. Adaptation of the method in a completely model-free set-up eliminates the need for system identification or knowledge of the agents' dynamics. Instead, it relies on input-state data collection and offers an entirely data-driven equivalent SDP formulation. Finally, a new algorithm balancing feasibility, convergence rate, robustness, and energy efficiency, is established to provide design flexibility. Numerical simulations validate the method's effectiveness in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Robust Closed-Form Control for MIMO Nonlinear Systems under Conflicting Time-Varying Hard and Soft Constraints (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel robust closed-form control law to handle time-varying hard and soft constraints in uncertain high-relative-degree nonlinear MIMO systems. These constraints represent spatiotemporal specifications in mechanical systems' operational space, with hard constraints ensuring safety-critical requirements and soft constraints encoding performance or task objectives. Initially, all constraints are consolidated into two separate scalar time-varying hard and soft constraint functions, whose positive level sets define feasible regions. A closed-form control law is developed to enforce these constraints using appropriately designed reciprocal barriers and nonlinear transformation functions. When conflicts between hard and soft constraints arise, the control law prioritizes hard constraints by virtually relaxing soft constraints via a dynamic relaxation law. Notably, the proposed control law maintains low complexity by avoiding approximation schemes for coping with system uncertainties. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Human-Vector Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible Model for Analyzing and Controlling the Spread of Vector-Borne Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an epidemic model for the spread of vector-borne diseases. The model, which is built extending the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible model, accounts for two populations -- humans and vectors -- and for cross-contagion between the two species, whereby humans become infected upon interaction with carrier vectors, and vectors become carriers after interaction with infected humans. We formulate the model as a system of ordinary differential equations and leverage monotone systems theory to rigorously characterize the epidemic dynamics. Specifically, we characterize the global asymptotic behavior of the disease, determining conditions for quick eradication of the disease (i.e., for which all trajectories converge to a disease-free equilibrium), or convergence to a (unique) endemic equilibrium. Then, we incorporate two control actions: namely, vector control and incentives to adopt protection measures. Using the derived mathematical tools, we assess the impact of these two control actions and determine the optimal control policy.</description>

      <title>Observer Design over Hypercomplex Quaternions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop observer design over hypercomplex quaternions in a characteristic-polynomial-free framework. Using the standard right-module convention, we derive a right observable companion form and its companion polynomial that encodes error dynamics via right-eigenvalue similarity classes. The design mirrors the real/complex case - coefficient updates in companion coordinates, followed by a similarity back - yet avoids determinants, characteristic/minimal polynomials, and Cayley-Hamilton identities that do not transfer to quaternions. We also give an Ackermann-type construction for the important case of closed-loop companion polynomials with real coefficients, ensuring similarity-equivariant evaluation. The results yield simple recipes for full-order observers directly over quaternions, clarify the role of right spectra and their similarity classes, and pinpoint when classical one-shot formulas remain valid. Numerical examples illustrate the method and advantages over vectorized or complex-adjoint surrogates.</description>

      <title>Identification and Adaptive Control of Markov Jump Systems: Sample Complexity and Regret Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.07018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning how to effectively control unknown dynamical systems is crucial for intelligent autonomous systems. This task becomes a significant challenge when the underlying dynamics are changing with time. Motivated by this challenge, this paper considers the problem of controlling an unknown Markov jump linear system (MJS) to optimize a quadratic objective. By taking a model-based perspective, we consider identification-based adaptive control of MJSs. We first provide a system identification algorithm for MJS to learn the dynamics in each mode as well as the Markov transition matrix, underlying the evolution of the mode switches, from a single trajectory of the system states, inputs, and modes. Through martingale-based arguments, sample complexity of this algorithm is shown to be $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$. We then propose an adaptive control scheme that performs system identification together with certainty equivalent control to adapt the controllers in an episodic fashion. Combining our sample complexity results with recent perturbation results for certainty equivalent control, we prove that when the episode lengths are appropriately chosen, the proposed adaptive control scheme achieves $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, which can be improved to $\mathcal{O}(polylog(T))$ with partial knowledge of the system. Our proof strategy introduces innovations to handle Markovian jumps and a weaker notion of stability common in MJSs. Our analysis provides insights into system theoretic quantities that affect learning accuracy and control performance. Numerical simulations are presented to further reinforce these insights.</description>

      <title>FIRE: A Failure-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Framework for Edge Computing Migrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14399v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In edge computing, users' service profiles are migrated due to user mobility. Reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks have been proposed to do so, often trained on simulated data. However, existing RL frameworks overlook occasional server failures, which although rare, impact latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving and real-time obstacle detection. Nevertheless, these failures (rare events), being not adequately represented in historical training data, pose a challenge for data-driven RL algorithms. As it is impractical to adjust failure frequency in real-world applications for training, we introduce FIRE, a framework that adapts to rare events by training a RL policy in an edge computing digital twin environment. We propose ImRE, an importance sampling-based Q-learning algorithm, which samples rare events proportionally to their impact on the value function. FIRE considers delay, migration, failure, and backup placement costs across individual and shared service profiles. We prove ImRE's boundedness and convergence to optimality. Next, we introduce novel deep Q-learning (ImDQL) and actor critic (ImACRE) versions of our algorithm to enhance scalability. We extend our framework to accommodate users with varying risk tolerances. Through trace driven experiments, we show that FIRE reduces costs compared to vanilla RL and the greedy baseline in the event of failures.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of stochastic reaction networks with entropic control cost and emergence of mode-switching strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the stochastic dynamics of biological populations is a challenge that arises across various biological contexts. However, these dynamics are inherently nonlinear and involve a discrete state space, i.e., the number of molecules, cells, or organisms. Additionally, the possibility of extinction has a significant impact on both dynamics and control strategies, particularly when the population size is small. These factors hamper the direct application of conventional control theories to biological systems. To address these challenges, we formulate the optimal control problem for stochastic population dynamics by utilizing control cost functions based on the f-divergence, which naturally accounts for population-specific factors. If Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is adopted for the cost function, the complex nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is simplified into a linear form, facilitating efficient computation of optimal solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the control of interacting random walkers, Moran processes, and SIR models, and observe the mode-switching phenomena in the control strategies. Our approach provides new opportunities for applying control theory to a wide range of biological problems.</description>

      <title>Axial current as the origin of quantum intrinsic orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the axial current density is the physical origin (generator) of quantum intrinsic orbital angular momentum (IOAM). Without the axial current, the IOAM of particles vanishes. Broadly speaking, we argue that the spiral or interference characteristics of the axial current density determine the occurrence of nonlinear or tunneling effects in any spacetime-dependent quantum systems. Our findings offer a comprehensive theoretical framework that addresses the limitations of Keldysh's ionization theory and provides new insights into the angular momentum properties of quantum systems, particularly in tunneling-dominated regimes. Using Wigner function methods, fermionic generalized two-level model, and Berry phase simulations, we predict that IOAM effect can persist even in pure quantum tunneling processes. These results open the door for experimental verification of IOAM effects in future high-intensity QED experiments, such as those using X-ray free electron lasers.</description>

      <title>Whole-Body Model-Predictive Control of Legged Robots with MuJoCo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the surprising real-world effectiveness of a very simple approach to whole-body model-predictive control (MPC) of quadruped and humanoid robots: the iterative LQR (iLQR) algorithm with MuJoCo dynamics and finite-difference approximated derivatives. Building upon the previous success of model-based behavior synthesis and control of locomotion and manipulation tasks with MuJoCo in simulation, we show that these policies can easily generalize to the real world with few sim-to-real considerations. Our baseline method achieves real-time whole-body MPC on a variety of hardware experiments, including dynamic quadruped locomotion, quadruped walking on two legs, and full-sized humanoid bipedal locomotion. We hope this easy-to-reproduce hardware baseline lowers the barrier to entry for real-world whole-body MPC research and contributes to accelerating research velocity in the community.

      <title>Subgradient Method for System Identification with Non-Smooth Objectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a subgradient-based algorithm to solve the system identification problem for linear time-invariant systems with non-smooth objectives. This is essential for robust system identification in safety-critical applications. While existing work provides theoretical exact recovery guarantees using optimization solvers, the design of fast learning algorithms with convergence guarantees for practical use remains unexplored. We analyze the subgradient method in this setting, where the optimization problems to be solved evolve over time as new measurements are collected, and we establish linear convergence to the ground-truth system for both the best and Polyak step sizes after a burn-in period. We further characterize sublinear convergence of the iterates under constant and diminishing step sizes, which require only minimal information and thus offer broad applicability. Finally, we compare the time complexity of standard solvers with the subgradient algorithm and support our findings with experimental results. This is the first work to analyze subgradient algorithms for system identification with non-smooth objectives.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Deep B-Spline Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning offers a promising framework for solving complex partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating observational data with governing physical laws. However, learning PDEs with varying parameters and changing initial conditions and boundary conditions (ICBCs) with theoretical guarantees remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose physics-informed deep B-spline networks, a novel technique that approximates a family of PDEs with different parameters and ICBCs by learning B-spline control points through neural networks. The proposed B-spline representation reduces the learning task from predicting solution values over the entire domain to learning a compact set of control points, enforces strict compliance to initial and Dirichlet boundary conditions by construction, and enables analytical computation of derivatives for incorporating PDE residual losses. While existing approximation and generalization theories are not applicable in this setting - where solutions of parametrized PDE families are represented via B-spline bases - we fill this gap by showing that B-spline networks are universal approximators for such families under mild conditions. We also derive generalization error bounds for physics-informed learning in both elliptic and parabolic PDE settings, establishing new theoretical guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate in experiments that the proposed technique has improved efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs compared to existing techniques in a dynamical system problem with discontinuous ICBCs and can handle nonhomogeneous ICBCs and non-rectangular domains.</description>

      <title>Guided Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Data-driven Controller Tuning with Digital Twins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a \textit{guided multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization} framework for data-efficient controller tuning that integrates corrected digital twin simulations with real-world measurements. The method targets closed-loop systems with limited-fidelity simulations or inexpensive approximations. To address model mismatch, we build a multi-fidelity surrogate with a learned correction model that refines digital twin estimates using real data. An adaptive cost-aware acquisition function balances expected improvement, fidelity, and sampling cost. Our method ensures adaptability as new measurements arrive. The digital twin accuracy is re-estimated, dynamically adapting both cross-source correlations and the acquisition function. This ensures that accurate simulations are used more frequently, while inaccurate simulation data are appropriately downweighted. Experiments on robotic drive hardware and supporting numerical studies demonstrate that our method enhances tuning efficiency compared to standard Bayesian optimization and multi-fidelity methods.</description>

      <title>Architecture Is All You Need: Diversity-Enabled Sweet Spots for Robust Humanoid Locomotion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments requires architectures that balance fast low-level stabilization with slower perceptual decision-making. We show that a simple layered control architecture (LCA), a proprioceptive stabilizer running at high rate, coupled with a compact low-rate perceptual policy, enables substantially more robust performance than monolithic end-to-end designs, even when using minimal perception encoders. Through a two-stage training curriculum (blind stabilizer pretraining followed by perceptual fine-tuning), we demonstrate that layered policies consistently outperform one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware. On a Unitree G1 humanoid, our approach succeeds across stair and ledge tasks where one-stage perceptual policies fail. These results highlight that architectural separation of timescales, rather than network scale or complexity, is the key enabler for robust perception-conditioned locomotion.</description>

      <title>CBF-RL: Safety Filtering Reinforcement Learning in Training with Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often prioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead to catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally deployed online via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior, the fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to conservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating safe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs in training. CBF-RL has two key attributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety constraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in training. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be deployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically, we demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned policy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards -- enabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We validate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid robot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without a runtime safety filter.</description>
