      <title>Exploring the case for hard-X-ray beaming in NGC 6946 X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to understand the nature of super-Eddington accretion we must explore both the emission emerging directly from the inflow and its impact on the surroundings. In this paper we test whether we can use the optical line emission of spatially resolved, ionized nebulae around ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) as a proxy for their X-ray luminosity. We choose the ULX NGC 6946 X-1 and its nebula, MF16, as a test case. By studying how the nebular optical line emission responds to assumed irradiation, we can infer the degree to which we require the UV or X-ray emission from the inflow to be collimated by optically thick winds seemingly ubiquitously associated with ULXs. We find that the nebula is highly sensitive to compact UV emission but mostly insensitive to hard X-rays. Our attempts to quantify the beaming of the soft and hard X-rays therefore strongly depends on the UV luminosity of the ULX in the center of the nebula. We find that it is not possible to conclude a lack of geometrical beaming of hard X-rays from such sources via nebula feedback.</description>

      <title>Particle motion and accretion disk around rotating accelerating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of test particles and the properties of accretion disks around rotating, accelerating black hole spacetimes with non-zero cosmological constants. To do so, we explore the impact of both rotation and acceleration on massive particle dynamics in motion around these configurations. In this respect, we derive the geodesic equations in the Pleba{\'n}ski-Demia{\'n}ski spacetime and analyse the characteristics of circular orbits, including the innermost and outermost stable circular orbits. Accordingly, we find that the acceleration parameter significantly influences the radii and angular momenta of these orbits. Further, we examine the precession of non-circular orbits and find that the precession is in the same direction as the black hole rotation regardless of the direction of the black hole spin. We also investigate the thermal spectra of geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disks described by the Novikov-Thorne model. We consider both co-rotating and counter-rotating disks and show that the radiative flux and luminosity are significantly larger for co-rotating disks. We compare the spectral features and luminosity of accretion disks around accelerating black holes with those around non-accelerating Kerr black holes, revealing that acceleration generally reduces the luminosity and flux of emitted light. Our results provide insights into the complex interplay between black hole acceleration, rotation, and the surrounding accretion disk dynamics.</description>

      <title>One Year of SN 2023ixf: Breaking Through the Degenerate Parameter Space in Light-Curve Models with Pulsating Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and analyze the extensive optical broadband photometry of the Type II SN 2023ixf up to one year after explosion. We find that, when compared to two pre-existing model grids, the pseudo-bolometric light curve is consistent with drastically different combinations of progenitor and explosion properties. This may be an effect of known degeneracies in Type IIP light-curve models. We independently compute a large grid of ${\tt MESA+STELLA}$ single-star progenitor and light-curve models with various zero-age main-sequence masses, mass-loss efficiencies, and convective efficiencies. Using the observed progenitor variability as an additional constraint, we select stellar models consistent with the pulsation period and explode them according to previously established scaling laws to match plateau properties. Our hydrodynamic modeling indicates that SN 2023ixf is most consistent with a moderate-energy ($E_{\rm exp}\approx7\times10^{50}$ erg) explosion of an initially high-mass red supergiant progenitor ($\gtrsim 17\ M_{\odot}$) that lost a significant amount of mass in its prior evolution, leaving a low-mass hydrogen envelope ($\lesssim 3\ M_{\odot}$) at the time of explosion, with a radius $\gtrsim 950\ R_{\odot}$ and a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.07\ M_{\odot}$. We posit that previous mass transfer in a binary system may have stripped the envelope of SN 2023ixf's progenitor. The analysis method with pulsation period presented in this work offers a way to break degeneracies in light-curve modeling in the future, particularly with the upcoming Vera C.~Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, when a record of progenitor variability will be more common.</description>

      <title>New radio continuum study of the Large Magellanic Cloud Supernova Remnant N49</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) radio observations toward N49, one of the brightest extragalactic Supernova remnants (SNRs) located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our new and archival ATCA radio observations were analysed along with $Chandra$ X-ray data. These observations show a prominent `bullet' shaped feature beyond the southwestern boundary of the SNR. Both X-ray morphology and radio polarisation analysis support a physical connection of this feature to the SNR. The 'bullet' feature's apparent velocity is estimated at $\sim$1300 km s$^{-1}$, based on its distance ($\sim$10 pc) from the remnant's geometric centre and estimated age ($\sim$7600 yrs). we estimated the radio spectral index, $\alpha= -0.55 \pm 0.03$ which is typical of middle-age SNRs. Polarisation maps created for N49 show low to moderate levels of mean fractional polarisation estimated at 7$\pm$1% and 10$\pm$1% for 5.5 and 9 GHz, respectively. These values are noticeably larger than found in previous studies. Moreover, the mean value for the Faraday rotation of SNR N49 from combining CABB data is 212$\pm$65 rad m$^{-2}$ and the maximum value of RM is 591$\pm$103 rad m$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>IC 10 X-1: A Double Black Hole Progenitor Probably Formed through Stable Mass Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IC 10 X-1 is one of close X-ray binaries containing a Wolf-Rayet donor, which can provide an evolutionary link between high-mass X-ray binaries and gravitational wave sources. It is still unclear about the precise nature of the accreting compact object in IC 10 X-1, although it looks more like a black hole than a neutron star. In this work, we use a binary population synthesis method to simulate the formation of IC 10 X-1 like binaries by assuming different common-envelope ejection efficiencies. This work represents a big step forward over previous studies since we adopt new criteria of mass-transfer stability. These criteria allow the formation of IC 10 X-1 like systems without experiencing common envelope evolution. Based on our calculations, we propose that the compact object in IC 10 X-1 is a black hole with mass of $\sim 10-30M_\odot$ and the progenitor evolution of this binary probably just experienced stable mass transfer.</description>

      <title>Combined search in dwarf spheroidal galaxies for branon dark matter annihilation signatures with the MAGIC telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive brane fluctuations, called branons, behave as weakly interacting massive particles, which is one of the most favored class of candidates to fulfill the role of the dark matter (DM), an elusive kind of matter beyond the Standard Model. We present a multi-target search in dwarf spheroidal galaxies for branon DM annihilation signatures with a total exposure of 354 hours with the ground-based gamma-ray telescope system MAGIC. This search led to the most constraining limits on branon DM in the sub-TeV and multi-TeV DM mass range. Our most stringent limit on the thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section (at $95\%$ confidence level) corresponds to $ \langle \sigma v \rangle \simeq 1.9 \times 10^{-24}{\text{cm}^{3}\text{s}^{-1}} $ at a branon mass of $ \sim 1.5~\text{TeV}$.</description>

      <title>Radiative plasma simulations of black hole accretion flow coronae in the hard and soft states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes in x-ray binary systems are powered by mass transfer from a companion star. The accreted gas forms an accretion disk around the black hole and emits x-ray radiation in two distinct modes: hard and soft state. The origin of the states is unknown. We perform radiative plasma simulations of the electron-positron-photon corona around the inner accretion flow. Our simulations extend previous efforts by self-consistently including all the prevalent quantum electrodynamic processes. We demonstrate that when the plasma is turbulent, it naturally generates the observed hard-state emission. In addition, we show that when soft x-ray photons irradiate the system -- mimicking radiation from an accretion disk -- the turbulent plasma transitions into a new equilibrium state that generates the observed soft-state emission. Our findings demonstrate that turbulent motions of magnetized plasma can power black-hole accretion flow coronae and that quantum electrodynamic processes control the underlying state of the plasma.</description>

      <title>Radio Proper Motions and a Search for the Origin of PSR B1849+00</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Until now it has not been possible to obtain the proper motions of PSR B1849+00 with timing techniques or VLBI imaging given the enhanced interstellar scattering along its line of sight. We present an analysis of archive Very Large Array observations at epochs from 2012 to 2022 that indicates a total proper motion of 23.9$\pm$5.5 mas yr$^{-1}$ toward the southwest. After correction for the proper motions produced by galactic rotation, we find a peculiar transverse velocity of $\simeq$740 km s$^{-1}$. We searched unsuccessfully along the past trajectory of the pulsar for an associated supernova remnant. In particular, W44 is in this trajectory but its distance is different to that of PSR B1849+00.</description>

      <title>Constraining light QCD axions with isolated neutron star cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of lighter-than-expected QCD axions can lead to a new ground state of matter, where the sourced axion field reduces the nucleon effective mass. The presence of the axion field has structural consequences, in particular, it results in a thinner (or even prevents its existence) heat-blanketing envelope, significantly altering the cooling patterns of neutron stars. We exploit the anomalous cooling behavior to constrain previously uncharted regions of the axion parameter space by comparing model predictions with existing data from isolated neutron stars. Notably, this analysis does not require the lighter-than-expected QCD axion to be the dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>The impact of cosmic variance on PTAs anisotropy searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations have recently found evidence for a Gravitational Wave Background (GWB) by measuring the perturbations that this background induces in the time-of-arrivals of pulsar signals. These perturbations are expected to be correlated across different pulsars and, for isotropic GWBs, the expected values of these correlations (obtained by averaging over different GWB realizations) are a simple function of the pulsars' angular separations, known as the Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation function. On the other hand, anisotropic GWBs would induce deviations from these HD correlations in a way that can be used to search for anisotropic distributions of the GWB power. However, even for isotropic GWBs, interference between GW sources radiating at overlapping frequencies induces deviations from the HD correlation pattern, an effect known in the literature as "cosmic variance". In this work, we study the impact of cosmic variance on PTA anisotropy searches. We find that the fluctuations in cross-correlations related to cosmic variance can lead to the miss-classification of isotropic GWBs as anisotropic, leading to a false detection rate of $\sim 50\%$ for frequentist anisotropy searches. We also observe that cosmic variance complicates the reconstruction of the GWB sky map, making it more challenging to resolve bright GW hotspots, like the ones expected to be produced from a Supermassive Black Hole Binaries population. These findings highlight the need to refine anisotropy search techniques to improve our ability to reconstruct the GWB sky map and accurately assess the significance of any isotropy deviations we might find in it.</description>

      <title>Fast wavelet basis search for generic gravitational wave bursts in Pulsar Timing Array data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As we move into an era of more sensitive pulsar timing array data sets, we may be able to resolve individual gravitational wave sources from the stochastic gravitational wave background. While some of these sources, like orbiting massive black hole binaries, have well-defined waveform models, there could also be signals present with unknown morphology. This motivates the search for generic gravitational-wave bursts in a signal-agnostic way. However, these searches are computationally prohibitive due to the expansive parameter space. In this paper we present QuickBurst, an algorithm with a re-defined likelihood that lets us expedite Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for a subset of the signal parameters by avoiding repeated calculations of costly inner products. This results in an overall speedup factor of $\sim$200 on realistic simulated datasets, which is sufficient to make generic gravitational-wave burst searches feasible on current and growing pulsar timing array datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider trajectories of massless particles in the presence of charged black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions. We study the properties of the photon ring in the (near-)extremal limit and show that the photon ring can probe the near-horizon region in two different scenarios: in high enough number of spacetime dimensions or when the massless particle carries an electric charge. We propose a simple $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription for implementing the JWKB approximation and show its utility in various contexts. We calculate the quasi-normal modes for charged fields in the eikonal limit and show the emergence of a new time-scale of relaxation in the dual field theory side. In the near-extremal limit, we show generally that the time-scale of decay of the perturbations is governed by the chemical potential. We also verify our analytical results numerically. The $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription allows us to study the superradiant modes and the associated instabilities in the eikonal limit easily. We comment on some related aspects regarding near-extremal black holes.</description>

      <title>A 9-Month Hubble Space Telescope Near-UV Survey of M87. II. A Strongly Enhanced Nova Rate near the Jet of M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 135 classical novae that we have discovered in M87 with two $\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$ imaging surveys appear to be strongly concentrated along that galaxy's jet. Detailed simulations show that the likelihood that this distribution occurred by chance is of order $0.3\%$. The novae near the jet display outburst characteristics (peak luminosities, colors and decline rates) that are indistinguishable from novae far from the jet. We explore whether the remarkable nova distribution could be caused by the jet's irradiation of the hydrogen-rich donors in M87's cataclysmic binaries. This explanation, and others extant in the literature which rely on increased binary mass transfer rates, fail by orders of magnitude in explaining the enhanced nova rate near the jet. An alternate explanation is the presence of a genuine surplus of nova binary systems near the jet, perhaps due to jet-induced star formation. This explanation fails to explain the lack of nova enhancement along M87's counterjet. The enhanced rate of novae along M87's jet is now firmly established, and unexplained.</description>

      <title>Formation of GW230529 from Isolated Binary Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this {\em{Letter}}, we explore the formation of the mass-gap black hole-neutron star (mgBHNS) merger detected in gravitational wave (GW) event, i.e., GW230529, from the isolated binary evolution channel, and study potential signatures of its electromagnetic counterparts. By adopting the `delayed' supernova prescription and reasonable model realizations, our population synthesis simulation results can simultaneously match the rate densities of mgBHNS and total BHNS mergers inferred from the population analyses, along with the population distribution of the BH mass in BHNS mergers reported by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Because GW230529 contributes significantly to the inferred mgBHNS rate densities, we suggest that GW230529 can be explained through the isolated binary evolution channel. Considering the AP4 (DD2) equation of state, the probability that GW230529 can make tidal disruption is $12.8\%$ ($63.2\%$). If GW230529 is a disrupted event, its kilonova peak apparent magnitude is predicted $\sim23-24\,{\rm{mag}}$, and hence, can be detected by the present survey projects and LSST. Since GW230529 could be an off-axis event inferred from the GW observation, its associated gamma-ray burst (GRB) might be too dim to be observed by $\gamma$-ray detectors, interpreting the lack of GRB observations. Our study suggests the existence of mgBHNS mergers formed through the isolated binary evolution channel due to the discovery of GW230529, indicating that BHNS mergers are still likely to be multimessenger sources that emit GWs, GRBs, and kilonovae. Although mgBHNS mergers account for $\sim50\%$ cosmological BHNS population, we find that $\gtrsim90\%$ disrupted BHNS mergers are expected to originate from mgBHNS mergers.</description>

Abstract: Our understanding of neutrino flavor conversion in the supernova core is still preliminary, despite its likely relevance to the neutrino-driven supernova mechanism. We present multi-angle and multi-energy numerical simulations of neutrino quantum kinetics within a spherically symmetric shell in the proximity of the region of neutrino decoupling. We rely on inputs from a one-dimensional core-collapse supernova model with a mass of $18.6\ M_\odot$ and find that, at early post-bounce times ($t_{\mathrm pb} \lesssim 0.5$~s), no crossing is present in the angular distribution of the electron neutrino lepton number and flavor conversion is triggered by slow collective instabilities. Angular crossings appear for $t_{\textrm{pb}} \gtrsim 0.5$~s and fast flavor conversion leads to flavor equipartition, with the spectral energy distribution of $\nu_{e}$ ($\bar{\nu}_{e}$) and $\nu_{x}$ ($\bar{\nu}_{x}$) becoming comparable. Notably, flavor equipartition is not a generic outcome of fast flavor conversion, rather it is a consequence of the relatively similar properties of neutrinos of different flavors characterizing the late accretion phase. Artificially tweaking the collision term to introduce an electron lepton number angular crossing for $t_{\mathrm{pb}} \lesssim 0.05$~s, we observe that flavor equipartition is not achieved. While our findings are restricted to a specific supernova model, and they only take into account the feedback of the neutrino background on the flavor conversion, they suggest a rich phenomenology in the supernova core as a function of the post-bounce time which needs to be further explored to assess its impact on the explosion mechanism.</description>

      <title>Sudden polarization angle jumps of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 20201124A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first detection of polarization angle (PA) orthogonal jumps, a phenomenon previously only observed from radio pulsars, from a fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB 20201124A. We find three cases of orthogonal jumps in over two thousand bursts, all resembling those observed in pulsar single pulses. We propose that the jumps are due to the superposition of two orthogonal emission modes that could only be produced in a highly magnetized plasma, and they are caused by the line of sight sweeping across a rotating magnetosphere. The shortest jump timescale is of the order of one-millisecond, which hints that the emission modes come from regions smaller than the light cylinder of most pulsars or magnetars. This discovery provides convincing evidence that FRB emission originates from the complex magnetosphere of a magnetar, suggesting an FRB emission mechanism that is analogous to radio pulsars despite a huge luminosity difference between two types of objects.</description>

      <title>Pair creation in the vortex-driven magnetic fields of black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the effects of the pair creation in the vortex-driven magnetic field on the radiation pattern of giant black holes. In particular, for a sufficiently wide spectrum of supermassive black holes, we studied what energy photons will decay under the influence of a strong magnetic field, producing electron-positron pairs. Depending on particular physical parameters, it has been shown that in certain scenarios high or very high energy emission generated by black holes will be strongly suppressed, thus, will be unable to escape a zone where radiation is generated.</description>

      <title>The conceptual design of the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The submillimeter and millimeter ((sub-)mm) sky contains a vast wealth of information that is both complementary and inaccessible to other wavelengths. Over half the light we receive is observable at (sub-)mm wavelengths, yet we have mapped only a small portion of the sky at sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect and resolve distant galaxies or star forming cores within their their large-scale environment. For decades the astronomical community has highlighted the need for a large, high-throughput (sub-)mm ($\lambda\sim0.35-10$ mm) single dish; The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), with its 50-m aperture and $2^\circ$ maximal field of view, aims to be such a facility. We present here the full design concept for AtLAST, developed through an EU-funded project. Our design approach begins with a long lineage of (sub-)mm telescopes, relies on calculations and simulations to realize the optics, and uses finite element analysis to optimize the mechanical structure and subsystems. The demanding design requirements for AtLAST, set by transformative science goals, combine novel concepts with lessons learned from past experience. The result is an innovative rocking chair design with six instrument bays, two of which are mounted on Nasmyth platforms. AtLAST will be capable of $3^\circ\,\rm s^{-1}$ scanning and $1^\circ\,\rm s^{-2}$ acceleration, and aims to feature a surface accuracy of $\leq 20~\mu$m half wavefront error under static deformations, allowing observations up to $\approx 950$~GHz. Crucially, AtLAST will be a sustainable, visionary facility that will allow upgrades for decades to come. While some aspects require further testing, prototyping, and field demonstrations, we estimate that the design will be construction-ready this decade.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Supermassive Black Hole Evolution on the Spectral and Spatial Anisotropy of Nano-Hertz Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains an open question in the field of modern cosmology. The detection of nanohertz (n-Hz) gravitational waves via pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) in the form of individual events and the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) offers a promising avenue for studying SMBH evolution across cosmic time, with SGWB signal being the immediately detectable signal with the currently accessible telescope sensitivities. By connecting the galaxy properties in the large scale (Gpc scale) cosmological simulation such as \texttt{MICECAT} with the small scale ($\sim$ Mpc scale) galaxy simulations from \texttt{ROMULUS}, we show that different scenarios of galaxy-SMBH evolution with redshift leads to a frequency-dependent spatial anisotropy in the SGWB signal. The presence of slow evolution of the SMBHs in the Universe leads to a pronounced blue anisotropic spectrum of the SGWB. In contrast, if SMBHs grow faster in the Universe in lighter galaxies, the frequency-dependent spatial anisotropy exhibits a more flattened anisotropic spectrum. This additional aspect of the SGWB signal on top of the monopole SGWB signal, can give insight on how the SMBHs form in the high redshift Universe and its interplay with the galaxy formation from future measurements.</description>

      <title>Ringdown amplitudes of nonspinning eccentric binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Closed-form expressions for the ringdown complex amplitudes of nonspinning unequal-mass binaries in arbitrarily eccentric orbits are presented. They are built upon 237 numerical simulations contained within the RIT catalog, through the parameterisation introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 101401]. Global fits for the complex amplitudes, associated to linear quasinormal mode frequencies of the dominant ringdown modes, are obtained in a factorised form immediately applicable to any existing quasi-circular model. Similarly to merger amplitudes, ringdown ones increase by more than 50% compared to the circular case for high impact parameters (medium eccentricities), while strongly suppressed in the low impact parameter (highly eccentric) limit. Such reduction can be explained by a transition between an "orbital-type" and an "infall-type" dynamics. The amplitudes (phases) fits accuracy lies around a few percent (deciradians) for the majority of the dataset, comparable to the accuracy of current state-of-the-art quasi-circular ringdown models, and well within current statistical errors of current LIGO-Virgo-Kagra ringdown observations. These expressions constitute another building block towards the construction of complete general-relativistic inspiral-merger-ringdown semi-analytical templates, and allow to extend numerically-informed spectroscopic analyses beyond the circular limit. Such generalisations are key to achieve accurate inference of compact binaries astrophysical properties, and tame astrophysical systematics within observational investigations of strong-field general relativistic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Estimating the possible QPOs of M87* from the parameters of a hairy Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamics of the shock cone formed around the hairy Kerr black hole due to BHL accretion and investigate the QPO behaviors resulting from the black hole-cone interaction, aiming to predict the QPO frequencies that may occur around the M87* black hole. To achieve this, we use the hairy Kerr black hole parameters consistent with the observed shadow parameters of M87* as initial conditions in numerical simulations, revealing the structure of the resulting shock cone and QPOs in a strong gravitational field. Numerical calculations show that the deviation of the hairy Kerr black hole from the Kerr metric and the hair parameters significantly influence the complex behavior of the resulting QPOs. It is found that the Lense-Thirring effect and the pressure modes trapped within the cone lead to the excitation of QPOs. The hair parameter has been observed to suppress the resulting QPO frequencies. The Lense-Thirring effect, in a strong gravitational field with a black hole spin parameter of a/M &gt; 0.7, also suppresses other modes and generates high-frequency QPOs. It is predicted that the QPO frequencies observed around the M87* black hole could span a wide range from nHz to mHz. Using both Kerr and hairy Kerr gravities, the QPO frequencies formed around the M87* black hole can be explained. Especially in cases where the black hole is spinning rapidly, PSD analyses have shown very distinct low-frequency QPOs and resonance conditions in both gravities. By comparing the results obtained from numerical calculations with observational and analytical results, we discuss the observability of the QPO frequencies that may occur around the M87* black hole.</description>
