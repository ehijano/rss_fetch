      <title>On the equivalence problem of Smith forms for multivariate polynomial matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into the equivalence problem of Smith forms for multivariate polynomial matrices. Generally speaking, multivariate ($n \geq 2$) polynomial matrices and their Smith forms may not be equivalent. However, under certain specific condition, we derive the necessary and sufficient condition for their equivalence. Let $F\in K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]^{l\times m}$ be of rank $r$, $d_r(F)\in K[x_1]$ be the greatest common divisor of all the $r\times r$ minors of $F$, where $K$ is a field, $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ are variables and $1 \leq r \leq \min\{l,m\}$. Our key findings reveal the result: $F$ is equivalent to its Smith form if and only if all the $i\times i$ reduced minors of $F$ generate $K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ for $i=1,\ldots,r$.</description>

      <title>A Neurosymbolic Approach to Adaptive Feature Extraction in SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robots, autonomous vehicles, and humans wearing mixed-reality headsets require accurate and reliable tracking services for safety-critical applications in dynamically changing real-world environments. However, the existing tracking approaches, such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), do not adapt well to environmental changes and boundary conditions despite extensive manual tuning. On the other hand, while deep learning-based approaches can better adapt to environmental changes, they typically demand substantial data for training and often lack flexibility in adapting to new domains. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging the neurosymbolic program synthesis approach to construct adaptable SLAM pipelines that integrate the domain knowledge from traditional SLAM approaches while leveraging data to learn complex relationships. While the approach can synthesize end-to-end SLAM pipelines, we focus on synthesizing the feature extraction module. We first devise a domain-specific language (DSL) that can encapsulate domain knowledge on the important attributes for feature extraction and the real-world performance of various feature extractors. Our neurosymbolic architecture then undertakes adaptive feature extraction, optimizing parameters via learning while employing symbolic reasoning to select the most suitable feature extractor. Our evaluations demonstrate that our approach, neurosymbolic Feature EXtraction (nFEX), yields higher-quality features. It also reduces the pose error observed for the state-of-the-art baseline feature extractors ORB and SIFT by up to 90% and up to 66%, respectively, thereby enhancing the system's efficiency and adaptability to novel environments.</description>

      <title>Hyperion - A fast, versatile symbolic Gaussian Belief Propagation framework for Continuous-Time SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous-Time Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (CTSLAM) has become a promising approach for fusing asynchronous and multi-modal sensor suites. Unlike discrete-time SLAM, which estimates poses discretely, CTSLAM uses continuous-time motion parametrizations, facilitating the integration of a variety of sensors such as rolling-shutter cameras, event cameras and Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). However, CTSLAM approaches remain computationally demanding and are conventionally posed as centralized Non-Linear Least Squares (NLLS) optimizations. Targeting these limitations, we not only present the fastest SymForce-based [Martiros et al., RSS 2022] B- and Z-Spline implementations achieving speedups between 2.43x and 110.31x over Sommer et al. [CVPR 2020] but also implement a novel continuous-time Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) framework, coined Hyperion, which targets decentralized probabilistic inference across agents. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in motion tracking and localization settings, complemented by empirical ablation studies.</description>

      <title>Communication Optimal Unbalanced Private Set Union</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the private set union (PSU) problem, where two parties each hold a private set of elements, and they want one of the parties (the receiver) to learn the union of the two sets and nothing else. Our protocols are targeted for the unbalanced case where the receiver's set size is larger than the sender's set size, with the goal of minimizing the costs for the sender both in terms of communication volume and local computation time. This setting is motivated by applications where the receiver has significantly more data (input set size) and computational resources than the sender which might be realized on a small, low-power device. Asymptotically, we achieve communication cost linear in the sender's (smaller) set size, and computation costs for sender and receiver which are nearly-linear in their respective set sizes. To our knowledge, ours is the first algorithm to achieve nearly-linear communication and computation for PSU in this unbalanced setting. Our protocols utilize fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and, optionally, linearly homomorphic encryption (LHE) to perform the necessary computations while preserving privacy. The underlying computations are based on univariate polynomial arithmetic realized within homomorphic encryption, namely fast multiplication, modular reduction, and multi-point evaluation. These asymptotically fast HE polynomial arithmetic algorithms may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Combining Neural Networks and Symbolic Regression for Analytical Lyapunov Function Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose CoNSAL (Combining Neural networks and Symbolic regression for Analytical Lyapunov function) to construct analytical Lyapunov functions for nonlinear dynamic systems. This framework contains a neural Lyapunov function and a symbolic regression component, where symbolic regression is applied to distill the neural network to precise analytical forms. Our approach utilizes symbolic regression not only as a tool for translation but also as a means to uncover counterexamples. This procedure terminates when no counterexamples are found in the analytical formulation. Compared with previous results, our algorithm directly produces an analytical form of the Lyapunov function with improved interpretability in both the learning process and the final results. We apply our algorithm to 2-D inverted pendulum, path following, Van Der Pol Oscillator, 3-D trig dynamics, 4-D rotating wheel pendulum, 6-D 3-bus power system, and demonstrate that our algorithm successfully finds their valid Lyapunov functions.</description>
