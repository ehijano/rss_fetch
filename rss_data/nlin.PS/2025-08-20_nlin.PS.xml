      <title>Next-generation soliton frequency combs in photonic-crystal and nanocomposite microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microresonator frequency combs offer tremendous opportunity to advance applications in fundamental research and technology by linking the optical and microwave frequency domains. Kerr-nonlinear microresonators further enable the generation of portable, integrated optical frequency combs, which are called microcombs. However, the dispersion engineering usually suffers from the small, geometric parameter space, and achieving soliton microcombs is challenging and usually requires complicated experimental techniques and setups. In recent years, the invention of photonic-crystal resonators (PhCRs) provides access to solitons in a convenient and stable way while its mechanism has not been fully understood. In this article, we highlight the perspectives of generating solitons for various applications in PhCRs and give a thorough understanding of the dynamics of soliton formation. We also propose a nanocomposite waveguide structure for the optimization of group velocity dispersion (GVD), lifting the limitation on geometric parameter space. We apply it to the design of the pump-harmonic microcomb, a new concept for f-2f self-referencing in microcombs. Inspired by the pulse-driven microresonator, we provide a scheme of two-microresonator network, retaining the convenience of using a continuous wave laser for microcomb generation. Our work depicts a blueprint of achieving the next generation soliton frequency combs in PhCR and nanocomposite microresonators and highlights their great prospects in optical metrology, precision measurement and optical data transmission.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of water waves over nonuniformly periodic bottom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By numerical simulation of exact equations of motion (in terms of conformal variables) for planar non-stationary potential flows of an ideal fluid with a free surface over a strongly non-uniform bottom profile, the effect of nonlinear compression of a long wavepacket during its Bragg reflection from domain of gradually increasing, periodically placed barriers has been detected. In this case, a short and tall packet of standing waves with sharp crests is formed, and then it is transformed into the backward wave. It is essential that with variation of frequency of the incident wave, the effect is absent in the middle of the barrier-induced spectral gap, but it is quite prominent closely to the upper edge of the gap, when the forward wave penetrates deeply into the scattering domain and there, together with emerged backward wave, they form a semblance of Bragg soliton for some time interval.</description>

      <title>Realization and characterization of an all-bands-flat electronic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an electronic all-bands-flat (ABF) lattice and experimentally generate compact localized states (CLSs) therein. The lattice is a diamond (rhombic) chain and implemented as a network of capacitors and inductors, as well as voltage inverters (using operational amplifiers) in order to introduce a \(\pi\)-phase flux within each diamond. The network's normal modes split into three flat bands, and the corresponding CLSs can be excited in isolation via a two-node driving at the flat band frequencies. We also examine the role of the lattice edges and their interaction with the CLSs. Finally, we compare the experimental results to tight-binding predictions and obtain very good agreement. This analysis paves the way for further experimental implementations of ABF systems in electric networks, especially with an eye towards exploring their interplay with nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous symmetry breaking in spontaneous Floquet states: temporal Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone modes, Floquet thermodynamics, and the time operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10784v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study simultaneous symmetry breaking in spontaneous Floquet states, focusing on the specific case of an atomic condensate. We first describe the quantization of the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes for a stationary state simultaneously breaking several symmetries of the Hamiltonian by invoking the generalized Gibbs ensemble, which enables a thermodynamical description of the problem. The quantization procedure involves a Berry-Gibbs connection, which depends on the macroscopic conserved charges associated to each broken symmetry and whose curvature is not invariant under generalized gauge transformations. We extend the formalism to Floquet states, where Goldstone theorem translates into the emergence of Floquet-Nambu-Goldstone (FNG) modes with zero quasi-energy. In the case of a spontaneous Floquet state, there is a genuine temporal FNG mode arising from the continuous time-translation symmetry breaking, whose quantum amplitude provides a rare realization of a time operator in Quantum Mechanics. Furthermore, since they conserve energy, spontaneous Floquet states can be shown to possess a conserved Floquet charge. Conventional Floquet systems also admit a thermodynamic description in terms of the Floquet enthalpy, the Legendre transform of the energy with respect to the Floquet charge, as these operate at fixed frequency. We apply our formalism to a particular realization of spontaneous Floquet state, the CES state, which breaks $U(1)$ and time-translation symmetries, representing a time supersolid. We numerically compute its density-density correlations, predicted to be dominated by the temporal FNG mode at long times, observing a remarkable agreement between simulation and theory. Based on these results, we propose a feasible experimental scheme to observe the temporal FNG mode of the CES state.</description>

      <title>On-chip multi-timescale spatiotemporal optical synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mode-locking mechanisms are key resources in nonlinear optical phenomena, such as micro-ring solitonic states, and have transformed metrology, precision spectroscopy, and optical communication. However, despite significant efforts, mode-locking has not been demonstrated in the independently tunable multi-timescale regime. Here, we vastly expand the nonlinear mode-locking toolbox into multi-timescale synchronization on a chip. We use topological photonics to engineer a 2D lattice of hundreds of coupled silicon nitride ring resonators capable of hosting nested mode-locked states with a fast (near 1 THz) single-ring and a slow (near 3 GHz) topological super-ring timescales. We demonstrate signatures of multi-timescale mode-locking including quadratic distribution of the pump noise with the two-time azimuthal mode dimensions, as expected by mode-locking theory. Our observations are further corroborated by direct signatures of the near-transform-limit repetition beats and the formation of the temporal pattern on the slow timescale. Moreover, we show that these exotic properties of edge-confined mode-locked states are in sharp contrast to bulk and single-ring counterparts and establish a clear pathway for their identification. Our unprecedented demonstration of mode-locking in topological combs unlocks the implementation of lattice-scale synchronization and independently tunable multi-timescale mode-locking phenomena, also the exploration of the fundamental nonlinearity-topology interplay on a chip.</description>
