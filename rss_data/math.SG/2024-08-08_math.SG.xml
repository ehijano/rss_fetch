      <title>A universal mirror to $(\mathbb{P}^2, \Omega)$ as a birational object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study homological mirror symmetry for $(\mathbb{P}^2, \Omega)$ viewed as an object of birational geometry, with $\Omega$ the standard meromorphic volume form. First, we construct universal objects on the two sides of mirror symmetry, focusing on the exact symplectic setting: a smooth complex scheme $U_\mathrm{univ}$ and a Weinstein manifold $M_\mathrm{univ}$, both of infinite type; and we prove homological mirror symmetry for them. Second, we consider autoequivalences. We prove that automorphisms of $U_\mathrm{univ}$ are given by a natural discrete subgroup of $\operatorname{Bir} (\mathbb{P}^2, \pm \Omega)$; and that all of these automorphisms are mirror to symplectomorphisms of $M_\mathrm{univ}$. We conclude with some applications.</description>

      <title>On infinite staircases in toric symplectic four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.13062v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An influential result of McDuff and Schlenk asserts that the function that encodes when a four-dimensional symplectic ellipsoid can be embedded into a four-dimensional ball has a remarkable structure: the function has infinitely many corners, determined by the odd-index Fibonacci numbers, that fit together to form an infinite staircase.
  This work has recently led to considerable interest in understanding when the ellipsoid embedding function for other symplectic 4-manifolds is partly described by an infinite staircase. We provide a general framework for analyzing this question for a large family of targets, called finite type convex toric domains, which we prove generalizes the class of closed toric symplectic 4-manifolds. When the target is of finite type, we prove that any infinite staircase must have a unique accumulation point a_0, given as the solution to an explicit quadratic equation. Moreover, we prove that the embedding function at a_0 must be equal to the classical volume lower bound. In particular, our result gives an obstruction to the existence of infinite staircases that we show is powerful.
  In the special case of rational convex toric domains, we can say more. We conjecture a complete answer to the question of existence of infinite staircases, in terms of six families that are distinguished by the fact that their moment polygon is reflexive. We then provide a uniform proof of the existence of infinite staircases for our six families, using two tools. For the first, we use recursive families of almost toric fibrations to find symplectic embeddings. For the second tool, we find recursive families of convex lattice paths that provide obstructions to embeddings. We conclude by reducing our conjecture that these are the only infinite staircases among rational convex toric domains to a question in number theory related to a classic work of Hardy and Littlewood.</description>

      <title>Even Order Explicit Symplectic Geometric Algorithms for Solving Quaternions in Guidance Navigation and Control via Diagonal Pad\'{e} Approximation and Cayley Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06414v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quaternion kinematical differential equation (QKDE) plays a key role in navigation, control and guidance systems. Although explicit symplectic geometric algorithms (ESGA) for this problem are available, there is a lack of a unified way for constructing high order symplectic difference schemes with configurable order parameter and the fractional interval sampling problem should be treated carefully. We present even order explicit symplectic geometric algorithms to solve the QKDE with diagonal Pad\'{e} approximation via a four-step strategy. Firstly, the Pad\'{e}-Cayley lemma is proved and used to simplify the symplectic Pad\'{e} approximation for the linear Hamiltonian system with infinitesimal symplectic structure. Secondly, both parallel and alternative iterative methods are proposed to construct the symplectic difference schemes with even order accuracy. Thirdly, the symplecity, orthogonality and invertibility of the single-step transition matrices are proved rigorously. Finally, the explicit symplectic geometric algorithms are designed for both the linear time-invariant and linear time-varying QKDE. The maximum absolute error for solving the QKDE is $\mathcal{O}((t_f-t_0)\tau^{2\ell})$ where $\tau$ is the time step, $\ell$ is the order parameter and $[t_0,t_f]$ is the time span. The linear time complexity and constant space complexity of computation as well as the simple algorithmic structure show that our algorithms are appropriate for real-time applications in aeronautics, astronautics, robotics and so on. The performance of the proposed algorithms are verified and validated by mathematical analysis and numerical simulation.</description>
