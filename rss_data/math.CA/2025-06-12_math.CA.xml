      <title>Analytic Dilogarithm Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By showing that the ratio of two beta-like integrals equals an integer, new Dilogarithm identities are derived, as well as analytic proofs to conjectured identities. New, non-trivial 2-term and ladder-like Dilogarithm identities are derived about ${Q}[\sqrt{2}]$, ${Q}[\sqrt{5}]$, ${Q}[\sqrt{-7}]$, and ${Q}[\sqrt{3}]$, . This also leads also to a connection between identities ${Q}[\sqrt{13}]$ and ${Q}[\sqrt{3}]$. Single-term and two-term complex Dilogarithm identities are derived, in addition to new Dilogarithm ladders of quartic and sextic bases; a new analytic proof of the Loxton-Lewin $\pi/9$ identities; and proofs of various conjectured identities.</description>

      <title>Lambert's problem in orbital dynamics: a self--contained introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lambert's problem is a classical boundary value problem in analytical mechanics. It arises when trying to determine the energy required to place a particle, subject to a central gravitational potential, in a free fall trajectory connecting two given points on a desired travel time. Due to its mathematical beauty and its relevance in aerospace engineering, it has been and remains the object of attention of countless engineers, mathematicians (pure and applied), and physicists seeking to produce efficient solution algorithms. In this expository article, didactic in nature, we present a unified and comprehensive derivation that assumes only a minimal background in physics and mathematics. We focus on the simplest two--body case and carefully develop the argument for elliptical trajectories. The goal is to provide a single reference that can serve as an accelerated introduction for students and researchers interested in a quick introduction to the subject.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity and dimensions of fractal Fourier series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09806v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in number theory, analysis, and fractal geometry, we consider regularity properties and dimensions of graphs associated with Fourier series of the form $F(t)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)e^{2\pi i nt}/n$, for a large class of coefficient functions $f$. Our main result states that if, for some constants $C$ and $\alpha$ with $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, we have $|\sum_{1\le n\le x}f(n)e^{2\pi i nt}|\le C x^{\alpha}$ uniformly in $x\ge 1$ and $t\in \mathbb{R}$, then the series $F(t)$ is H\"older continuous with exponent $1-\alpha$, and the graph of $|F(t)|$ on the interval $[0,1]$ has box-counting dimension $\leq 1+\alpha$. As applications we recover the best-possible uniform H\"older exponents for the Weierstrass functions $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a^k\cos(2\pi b^k t)$ and the Riemann function $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \sin(\pi n^2 t)/n^2$. Moreoever, under the assumption of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, we obtain nontrivial bounds for H\"older exponents and dimensions associated with series of the form $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(n)e^{2\pi i n^kt}/n^k$, where $\mu$ is the M\"obius function.</description>

      <title>The Laplace asymptotic expansion in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the classical Laplace asymptotic expansion (AE) of $\int_{\mathbb R^d} g(x)e^{-nu(x)}dx$, $n\gg1$ extends to the high-dimensional regime in which $d$ may grow large with $n$. More specifically, we use new techniques suitable to high-$d$ to derive an AE which formally coincides with the classical one because the terms are the same, but which now has a new small parameter. Namely under classical assumptions on $z$ and $g$ and additional bounds on the growth of $\|\nabla^kz\|$ and $\|\nabla^kg\|$ with $d$, we show the new small parameter is $d^2/n$, in the sense that $|\text{Rem}_L|\leq C_L(d^2/n)^L$ for each $L=1,2,3,\dots$, where $\text{Rem}_L$ is the $L$th order remainder. As an example, we show that the derivative bounds are satisfied with high probability for a random function $z$ arising in a standard statistical model. We also show that if the derivative bounds are relaxed, then we still obtain a valid AE in powers of a "larger" small parameter.
  To prove these results, we derive a very general nonasymptotic bound on $\text{Rem}_L$ which is explicit in its dependence on $g,z,d,n$. The bound holds with nearly no apriori restrictions on the magnitude of the derivative norms. We show the bound is tight for each $L$ by proving a matching lower bound for a quartic $z$ and $g\equiv1$. When $d,z,g$ are fixed and $n\to\infty$, our bound shows that $\text{Rem}_L=O(n^{-L})$. Thus our work subsumes the classical theory of the Laplace expansion, and significantly extends it into the high-$d$ regime. This broadened applicability of the expansion is extremely useful for the many modern applications requiring the computation of high-$d$ Laplace integrals. In settings where the expansion is already in use, our precise and explicit error bound is valuable both for numerical estimates and theoretical analysis, especially near the boundary of applicability of the expansion.</description>

      <title>Characterizations for arbitrary B\'ekoll\'e-Bonami weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We precisely characterize the relationships between the reverse H\"older inequality, the Fujii-Wilson condition, the B\'ekoll\'e-Bonami $\mathrm{B}_p$ condition, the $\mathrm{B}_\infty$ condition, and the reverse Jensen inequality, for arbitrary weights in the unit disc. This is achieved by introducing new side conditions that turn out to be necessary and sufficient. The side conditions are simple and testable, and can be interpreted as integral versions of the much stronger condition of bounded hyperbolic oscillation, which has been considered earlier in the literature.</description>

      <title>On the transcendentality condition for Gaussian Gabor frames and Hermite super/multiwindow frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08415v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a criterion for higher-dimensional Gaussian Gabor frames, which is a reformulation of one of the main results in in a previous article by the first and last authors in more explicit terms. We use this formulation in order to extend a result of Romero, Ulanovskii, and Zlotnikov to lattices given by irrational rotations. We also show that this density criterion for Gaussian Gabor frames is generic in a certain sense. In addition, we also extend the methods of the first and last named authors to the pseudoeffective threshold which gives a condition for uniqueness in the Bargmann-Fock space. We also use this viewpoint to study super and multi-window Gabor frames with Hermitian windows. In particular, we find a density criterion for transcendental lattices.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ averages of the Fourier transform in finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fourier transform plays a central role in many geometric and combinatorial problems cast in vector spaces over finite fields. If a set admits optimal $L^\infty$ bounds on its Fourier transform (that is, it is a Salem set), then it can often be analysed more easily. However, in many cases obtaining good \emph{uniform} bounds is not possible, even if `most' points admit good pointwise bounds. Motivated by this, we propose a framework where one systematically studies the $L^p$ averages of the Fourier transform and keeps track of how good the $L^p$ bounds are as a function of $p$. This captures more nuanced information about a set than, for example, asking whether it is Salem or not. We explore this idea by considering several examples and find that a rich theory emerges. Further, we provide various applications of this approach; including to sumset type problems, the finite fields distance conjecture, and the problem of counting $k$-simplices inside a given set. Our typical application is of the form: if a set admits good $L^p$ bounds on its Fourier transform, then we are able to make strong geometric conclusions.</description>
