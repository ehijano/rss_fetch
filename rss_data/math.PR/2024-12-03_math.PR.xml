      <title>Optimal local storage policy based on stochastic intensities and its large scale behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the optimal management of local memory systems, using the tools of stationary point processes. We provide a rigorous setting of the problem, building upon recent work, and characterize the optimal causal policy that maximizes the hit probability. We specialize the result for the case of renewal request processes and derive a suitable large scale limit as the catalog size N grows to infinity, when a fixed fraction c of items can be stored. We prove that in the limiting regime, the optimal policy amounts to comparing the stochastic intensity (observed hazard rate) of the process with a fixed threshold, defined by a quantile of an appropriate limit distribution, and derive asymptotic performance metrics, as well as sharp estimates for the pre-limit case. Moreover, we establish a connection with optimal timer based policies for the case of monotonic hazard rates. We also present detailed validation examples of our results, including some close form expressions for the miss probability that are compared to simulations. We also use these examples to exhibit the significant superiority of the optimal policy for the case of regular traffic patterns.</description>

      <title>Extinction behaviour for a mutually interacting continuous-state population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of two stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with negative two-way interactions driven by Brownian motions and spectrally positive $\alpha$-stable random measures. Such a SDE system can be identified as a Lotka-Volterra type population model. We find close to sharp conditions for one of the population to go extinct or extinguishing.</description>

      <title>Stability of long run functionals with respect to stationary Markov controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we study dependence of long run functionals and limit characteristics assuming that Borel measurable Markov controls converge pointwise. We consider two kinds of functionals: average cost per unit time and long run risk sensitive. We impose uniform ergodicity assumption, which is later is relaxed and suitable convergence of controlled transition probabilities.</description>

      <title>A new approach to strong convergence II. The classical ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first paper in this series introduced a new approach to strong convergence of random matrices that is based primarily on soft arguments. This method was applied to achieve a refined qualitative and quantitative understanding of strong convergence of random permutation matrices and of more general representations of the symmetric group. In this paper, we introduce new ideas that make it possible to achieve stronger quantitative results and that facilitate the application of the method to new models.
  When applied to the Gaussian ensembles GUE/GOE/GSE of dimension $N$, these methods achieve strong convergence for noncommutative polynomials with matrix coefficients of dimension $\exp(o(N))$. This provides a sharp form of a result of Pisier on strong convergence with coefficients in a subexponential operator space. Analogous results up to logarithmic factors are obtained for Haar-distributed random matrices in $\mathrm{U}(N)/\mathrm{O}(N)/\mathrm{Sp}(N)$. We further illustrate the methods of this paper in three applications: we obtain improved rates for strong convergence of random permutation matrices; we obtain a quantitative form of strong convergence of the model introduced by Hayes for the solution of the Peterson-Thom conjecture; and we prove strong convergence of all nontrivial representations of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ of dimension up to $\exp(N^{1/3-\delta})$, improving a recent result of Magee and de la Salle.</description>

      <title>Joint Poisson Convergence of Monochromatic Hyperedges in Multiplex Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a sequence of $r$-uniform hypergraphs $H_n$, denote by $T(H_n)$ the number of monochromatic hyperedges when the vertices of $H_n$ are colored uniformly at random with $c = c_n$ colors. In this paper, we study the joint distribution of monochromatic hyperedges for hypergraphs with multiple layers (multiplex hypergraphs). Specifically, we consider the joint distribution of ${\bf T} _n:= (T(H_n^{(1)}), T(H_n^{(2)}))$, for two sequences of hypergraphs $H_n^{(1)}$ and $H_n^{(2)}$ on the same set of vertices. We will show that the joint distribution of ${\bf T}_n$ converges to (possibly dependent) Poisson distributions whenever the mean vector and the covariance matrix of ${\bf T}_n$ converge. In other words, the joint Poisson approximation of ${\bf T}_n$ is determined only by the convergence of its first two moments. This generalizes recent results on the second moment phenomenon for Poisson approximation from graph coloring to hypergraph coloring and from marginal convergence to joint convergence. Applications include generalizations of the birthday problem, counting monochromatic subgraphs in randomly colored graphs, and counting monochromatic arithmetic progressions in randomly colored integers. Extensions to random hypergraphs and weighted hypergraphs are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Critical threshold for regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the critical percolation threshold $p_c$ for $d$-regular graphs. It is well-known that $p_c \geq \frac{1}{d-1}$ for such graphs, with equality holding for the $d$-regular tree. We prove that among all quasi-transitive $d$-regular graphs, the equality $p_c(G) = \frac{1}{d-1}$ holds if and only if $G$ is a tree. Furthermore, we provide counterexamples that illustrate the necessity of the quasi-transitive assumption.</description>

      <title>Stochastic PDE approach to fluctuating interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new type of SPDEs, singular or with regularized noises, motivated by a study of the fluctuation of the density field in a microscopic interacting particle system. They include a large scaling parameter $N$, which is the ratio of macroscopic to microscopic size, and another scaling parameter $K=K(N)$, which controls the formation of the interface of size $K^{-1/2}$ in the density field. They are derived heuristically from the particle system, assuming the validity of the so-called ``Boltzmann-Gibbs principle", that is, a combination of the local ensemble average due to the local ergodicity and its asymptotic expansion. We study a simple situation where the interface is flat and immobile. Under making a proper stretch to the normal direction to the interface, we observe a Gaussian fluctuation of the interface. We also heuristically derive a nonlinear SPDE which describes the fluctuation of the interface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and study the ideal Poisson--Voronoi tessellation of the product of two hyperbolic planes $\mathbb{H}_{2}\times \mathbb{H}_{2}$ endowed with the $L^{1}$ norm. We prove that its law is invariant under all isometries of this space and study some geometric features of its cells. Among other things, we prove that the set of points at equal separation to any two corona points is unbounded almost surely. This is analogous to a recent result of Fr\k{a}czyk-Mellick-Wilkens for higher rank symmetric spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work revisits the well-posedness of non-degenerate McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations with H\"older continuous coefficients, recently established by Chaudru de Raynal. We provide a streamlined and direct proof that leverages standard Gaussian estimates for uniformly parabolic PDEs, bypassing the need for derivatives with respect to the measure argument and extending applicability to hypoelliptic PDEs under weaker assumptions.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Structural Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of structural independence characterizing all independencies implied by the independence of a family of random elements. More formally, let $U = (U_{i})_{i \in I}$ be an independent family of random elements on some probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},\mathbb{P})$ and let $X,Y$ and $Z$ be arbitrary $\sigma(U)$-measurable random elements. We characterize all independencies $X \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}} Y | Z$ implied by the independence of $U$. Formally, these are the independencies which hold in all probability measures $P$ that render $U$ independent and are absolutely continuous with respect to $\mathbb{P}$, i.e. for all such $P$, it needs to hold that $X \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}}_P Y | Z$. We first introduce random index sets and random families that generalize families of random elements by allowing the index set of the family to be random. Then, we introduce the history, a combinatorial object that measures the dependance of $X$ on $U_i$ for each $i \in I$ given $Z$. More precisely, the history of $X$ given $Z$ is a random index set $\mathcal{H}(X|Z) : \Omega \to \mathfrak{P}(I)$ such that the independence of $X$ and $Y$ given $Z$ is implied by the independence of $U$ if and only if $\mathcal H(X|Z) \cap \mathcal{H}(Y|Z) = \emptyset$ $\mathbb{P}$-almost surely.</description>

      <title>On the spectral problem and fractional diffusion limit for Fokker-Planck with(-out) drift and for a general heavy tail equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of a kinetic Fokker-Planck equation with general heavy-tailed equilibrium without an explicit formula, such as $C_\beta \langle v \rangle^{-\beta}$, in particular non-symmetric and non-centred. This work extends the results obtained in [Dechicha and Puel, 2023] and [Dechicha and Puel, Asymptot. Anal., 2024]. We prove that if the equilibrium behaves like $\langle v \rangle^{-\beta}$ at infinity with $\beta &gt; d$, along with an other assumption, there exists a unique eigenpair solution to the spectral problem associated with the Fokker-Planck operator, taking into account the advection term. As a direct consequence of this construction, and under the hypothesis of the convergence of the rescaled equilibrium, we obtain the fractional diffusion limit for the kinetic Fokker-Planck equation, with or without drift, depending on the decay of the equilibrium and whether or not the first moment is finite. This latter result generalizes all previous results on the fractional diffusion limit for the Fokker-Planck equation and rigorously justifies the remarks and results mentioned in [Bouin and Mouhot, PMP, 2022, Section 9].</description>

      <title>Classical beta ensembles and related eigenvalues processes at high temperature and the Markov--Krein transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to identify the limit in a high temperature regime of classical beta ensembles on the real line and related eigenvalue processes by using the Markov--Krein transform. We show that the limiting measure of Gaussian beta ensembles (resp.\ beta Laguerre ensembles and beta Jacobi ensembles) is the inverse Markov--Krein transform of the Gaussian distribution (resp.\ the gamma distribution and the beta distribution). At the process level, we show that the limiting probability measure-valued process is the inverse Markov--Krein transform of a certain 1d stochastic process.</description>

      <title>A note on L\'evy-driven McKean-Vlasov SDEs under monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, under a weak monotonicity and a weak coercivity, we address strong well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by L\'{e}vy jump processes, where the coefficients are Lipschitz continuous (with respect to the measure variable) under the $L^\beta$-Wasserstein distance for $\beta\in[1,2].$ Moreover, the issue on the weak propagation of chaos (i.e., convergence in distribution via the convergence of the empirical measure) and the strong propagation of chaos (i.e., at the level paths by coupling) is explored simultaneously. To treat the strong well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov SDEs we are interested in, we investigate strong well-posedness of classical time-inhomogeneous SDEs with jumps under a local weak monotonicity and a global weak coercivity. Such a result is of independent interest, and, most importantly, can provide an available reference on strong well-posedness of L\'{e}vy-driven SDEs under the monotone condition, which nevertheless is missing for a long time. Based on the theory derived, along with the interlacing technique and the Banach fixed point theorem, the strong well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov SDEs driven by L\'{e}vy jump processes can be established. Additionally, as a potential extension, strong well-posedness and conditional propagation of chaos are treated for L\'{e}vy-driven McKean-Vlasov SDEs with common noise under a weak monotonicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide estimates for the spectral radii of an $n\times n$ sparse non-Hermitian random matrix $Z$ with general entries in the regime $p=d/n$ where $0&lt;d&lt;1$ is fixed. Utilizing the structural results of ({\L}uczak, '90), we show that the spectral radius $\rho (Z)$ is $0$ with probability converging to some nonzero value, and satisfies the inequality $(\phi (n))^{-1}\leq \rho (Z)\leq \phi (n)$ in the asymptotic sense for any function $\phi$ satisfying $\lim_{n\to\infty}\phi (n)=\infty$ with the remaining probability.</description>

Abstract: The work concerns about multivalued stochastic differential equations with jumps. First of all, by the weak convergence approach we establish the Freidlin-Wentzell uniform large deviation principle and the Dembo-Zeitouni uniform large deviation principle for these equations. Then based on these results, by proving upper and lower bounds large deviations for invariant measures of these equations are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish general conditions for stochastic evolution equations with locally monotone drift and degenerate additive L\'evy noise in variational formulation resulting in the existence of a unique invariant measure for the associated weakly ergodic Markovian Feller semigroup. We prove improved moment estimates for the solutions and the so-called $e$-property of the semigroup. Examples include the stochastic incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations, shear thickening stochastic power-law fluid equations, the stochastic heat equation, as well as, stochastic semilinear equations such as the 1D stochastic Burgers equation.</description>

      <title>One- and two-particle spectral gap identities for the symmetric inclusion process and related models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetric inclusion process (SIP) models particles diffusing on a graph with mutual attraction. We recently showed that, in the log-concave regime (where diffusivity dominates interaction), the spectral gap of the conservative SIP matches that of a single particle. In this paper, our main result demonstrates that this identity generally fails outside this regime, but always holds for the non-conservative SIP, regardless of the interaction strength. When this one-particle spectral gap identity breaks down, we derive sharp bounds for the gap in terms of diffusivity, and reveal a two-particle spectral gap identity in the vanishing diffusivity limit. Our approach leverages the rigid eigenstructure of SIP, refined comparisons of Dirichlet forms for arbitrary diffusivity and particle numbers, and techniques from slow-fast system analysis. These findings extend to the dual interacting diffusion known as Brownian energy process, and shed some light on the spectral gap behavior for related Dirichlet-reversible systems on general, non-mean-field, geometries.</description>

      <title>On the Weak Convergence of the Function-Indexed Sequential Empirical Process and its Smoothed Analogue under Nonstationarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sequential empirical process indexed by general function classes and its smoothed set-indexed analogue. Sufficient conditions for asymptotic equicontinuity and weak convergence are provided for nonstationary arrays of time series, in terms of uniform moment bounds for partial sums and, for the set-indexed smoothed process, $L_p$-Lipschitz regularity. This yields comprehensive general results on the weak convergence of sequential empirical processes, which are applicable to various notions of dependence. Especially, we show that our moment conditions imply the weak convergence of the sequential process under essentially the same mild assumptions (on the degree of dependence and the complexity of the indexing function class) as known for the classical empirical process. This is exemplified in detail for nonstationary $\alpha$-mixing time series. Core ingredients of the proofs are a novel maximal inequality for nonmeasurable stochastic processes, uniform chaining arguments and suitable pathwise uniform Lipschitz properties.</description>

      <title>Regularisation by Gaussian rough paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to show the probabilistically strong well-posedness of rough differential equations with distributional drifts driven by the Gaussian rough path lift of fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in(1/3,1/2)$. We assume that the noise is nondegenerate and the drift lies in the Besov-H\"older space $\mathcal{C}^\alpha$ for some $\alpha&gt;1-1/(2H)$. The latter condition matches the one of the additive noise case, thereby providing a multiplicative analogue of Catellier-Gubinelli in the regime $H\in(1/3,1/2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we use a new approach to study the spread of an infectious disease. Indeed, we study a SIR epidemic model with variable infectivity, where the individuals are distributed over a compact subset $D$ of $\R^d$. We define empirical measures which describe the evolution of the state (susceptible, infectious, recovered) of the individuals in the various locations, and the total force of infection in the population. In our model, the individuals do not move. We establish a law of large numbers for these measures, as the population size tends to infinity.</description>

Abstract: The article uses an arithmetic-geometric Fibonacci series to find the expected value of trials needed to observe k consecutive successes for the first time in a Bernoulli experiment using a recurrence relation. It is important to note that this is not a new result, but to the best of the authors' knowledge at the time of uploading, this is a novel derivation of a well-established result.

      <title>Electricity Price Prediction Using Multi-Kernel Gaussian Process Regression combined with Kernel-Based Support Vector Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new hybrid model for predicting German electricity prices. The algorithm is based on combining Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). While GPR is a competent model for learning the stochastic pattern within the data and interpolation, its performance for out-of-sample data is not very promising. By choosing a suitable data-dependent covariance function, we can enhance the performance of GPR for the tested German hourly power prices. However, since the out-of-sample prediction depends on the training data, the prediction is vulnerable to noise and outliers. To overcome this issue, a separate prediction is made using SVR, which applies margin-based optimization, having an advantage in dealing with non-linear processes and outliers, since only certain necessary points (support vectors) in the training data are responsible for regression. Both individual predictions are later combined using the performance-based weight assignment method. A test on historic German power prices shows that this approach outperforms its chosen benchmarks such as the autoregressive exogenous model, the naive approach, as well as the long short-term memory approach of prediction.</description>

      <title>Functional worst risk minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend worst risk minimization, also called worst average loss minimization, to the functional realm. This means finding a functional regression representation that will be robust to future distribution shifts on the basis of data from two environments. In the classical non-functional realm, structural equations are based on a transfer matrix $B$. In section~\ref{sec:sfr}, we generalize this to consider a linear operator $\mathcal{T}$ on square integrable processes that plays the the part of $B$. By requiring that $(I-\mathcal{T})^{-1}$ is bounded -- as opposed to $\mathcal{T}$ -- this will allow for a large class of unbounded operators to be considered. Section~\ref{sec:worstrisk} considers two separate cases that both lead to the same worst-risk decomposition. Remarkably, this decomposition has the same structure as in the non-functional case. We consider any operator $\mathcal{T}$ that makes $(I-\mathcal{T})^{-1}$ bounded and define the future shift set in terms of the covariance functions of the shifts. In section~\ref{sec:minimizer}, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for existence of a minimizer to this worst risk in the space of square integrable kernels. Previously, such minimizers were expressed in terms of the unknown eigenfunctions of the target and covariate integral operators (see for instance \cite{HeMullerWang} and \cite{YaoAOS}). This means that in order to estimate the minimizer, one must first estimate these unknown eigenfunctions. In contrast, the solution provided here will be expressed in any arbitrary ON-basis. This completely removes any necessity of estimating eigenfunctions. This pays dividends in section~\ref{sec:estimation}, where we provide a family of estimators, that are consistent with a large sample bound. Proofs of all the results are provided in the appendix.</description>

Talagrand on the relation between "expectation thresholds" and "fractional expectation thresholds" follows easily from a strong version of a second conjecture of Talagrand, on "selector processes." The selector process conjecture was proved by Park and Pham, and the quantitative strengthening used here is due to Bednorz, Martynek, and Meller.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the phase diagram of a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model where the couplings are forced to thermalize at different times scales. Besides being a challenging generalization of the SK model, such settings may arise naturally in physics whenever part of the many degrees of freedom of a system relaxes to equilibrium considerably faster than the others. For this model we compute the asymptotic value of the second moment of the overlap distribution. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous sufficient condition for an annealed solution to hold, identifying a high temperature region. In addition, we also prove that for sufficiently low temperature the solution must present a number of replica symmetry breaking levels at least equal to the number of time scales already present in the multiscale model. Finally, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of gaps in the support of the functional order parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Wasserstein barycenter problem in the setting of non-compact, non-smooth extended metric measure spaces. We introduce a couple of new concepts and obtain the existence, uniqueness, absolute continuity of the Wasserstein barycenter, and prove Jensen's inequality in an abstract framework.
  This generalized several results on Euclidean space, Riemannian manifolds and Alexandrov spaces, to metric measure spaces satisfying Riemannian Curvature-Dimension condition \`a la Lott--Sturm--Villani, and some extended metric measure spaces including abstract Wiener spaces and configuration spaces over Riemannian manifolds.
  We also introduce a new curvature-dimesion condition, we call Barycenter-Curvature-Dimension condition {\rm BCD}. We prove its stability under measured-Gromov--Hausdorff convergence and prove the existence of the Wasserstein barycenter under this new condition. In addition, we get some geometric inequalities including a multi-marginal Brunn--Minkowski inequality and a functional Blaschke--Santal\'o type inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for constructing Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithms for rotationally-invariant models. By employing a general iterative algorithm template and reducing it to long-memory Orthogonal AMP (OAMP), we systematically derive the correct Onsager terms of AMP algorithms. This approach allows us to rederive an AMP algorithm introduced by Fan and Opper et al., while shedding new light on the role of free cumulants of the spectral law. The free cumulants arise naturally from a recursive centering operation, potentially of independent interest beyond the scope of AMP. To illustrate the flexibility of our framework, we introduce two novel AMP variants and apply them to estimation in spiked models.</description>

      <title>A Heavy Traffic Theory of Matching Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by emerging applications in online matching platforms and marketplaces, we study a matching queue. Customers and servers that arrive in a matching queue depart as soon as they are matched. While state-dependent control is an effective lever to regulate the throughput and delay, it often comes at a cost in practice for matching platforms. Optimizing this fundamental trade-off motivates the use of small amounts of control, so we study a matching queue in an asymptotic regime where the state-dependent control decreases to zero. Unlike the heavy traffic regime in classical queues, there are two different ways the control can be sent to zero, via a magnitude scaling parameter $\epsilon$ that goes to zero and a time scaling parameter $\tau$ that goes to infinity.
  Depending on the cost of control, we show that the rates of $\epsilon$ and $\tau$ that optimize the trade-off between delay and cost of control could correspond to three different regimes. As we traverse these regimes, we observe a phase transition in the limiting distribution of the matching queue. We show that a low cost of control corresponds to the regime $\epsilon \tau \rightarrow 0$ and we call it the delay-driven regime. The limiting behavior in this regime is an asymmetrical Laplace distribution. On the other hand, $\epsilon \tau \rightarrow \infty$ is the cost-driven regime corresponding to a high cost of control where the limiting behavior is either a uniform or a truncated exponential distribution. We christen the in-between regime of $\epsilon\tau \rightarrow (0, \infty)$ the hybrid regime where the limiting behavior is a Gibbs distribution. These results are obtained by novel generalizations of the transform method, where each regime requires new ideas. The hybrid regime employs inverse Fourier transforms while the other two regimes engineer multiple complex exponential test functions.</description>

      <title>Dispersion on the Complete Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a synchronous process of particles moving on the vertices of a graph $G$, introduced by Cooper, McDowell, Radzik, Rivera and Shiraga (2018). Initially, $M$ particles are placed on a vertex of $G$. At the beginning of each time step, for every vertex inhabited by at least two particles, each of these particles moves independently to a neighbour chosen uniformly at random. The process ends at the first step when no vertex is inhabited by more than one particle.
  Cooper et al. showed that when the underlying graph is the complete graph on~$n$ vertices, then there is a phase transition when the number of particles $M = n/2$. They showed that if $M&lt;(1-\varepsilon)n/2$ for some fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$, then the process finishes in a logarithmic number of steps, while if $M&gt;(1+\varepsilon)n/2$, an exponential number of steps are required with high probability. Here we provide a thorough asymptotic analysis of the dispersion time around criticality, where $\varepsilon = o(1)$, and describe the transition from logarithmic to exponential time. As a consequence of our results we establish, for example, that the dispersion time is in probability and in expectation in $\Theta(n^{1/2})$ when $|\varepsilon| = O(n^{-1/2})$, and provide qualitative bounds for its tail behavior.</description>

Abstract: We study the joint asymptotic distribution of the least squares estimator of the parameter $(\theta,\,\mu)$ for the non-ergodic Vasicek models driven by seven specific Gaussian processes. %The similar result concerning to the non-ergodic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is a by-product. To facilitate the proofs, we extract two common hypotheses from the covariance functions of the seven Gaussian processes and develop two types of new inner product formulas for functions of bounded variation in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the Gaussian processes. The integration by parts for normalized bounded variation functions is essential to the inner product formulas. We apply the inner product formulas of the seven Gaussian processes to check the set of conditions of Es-Sebaiy, Es.Sebaiy (2021).</description>

      <title>Gaussian Rough Paths Lifts via Complementary Young Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by recent advances in singular SPDE theory, we use the Poincar\'e inequality on Wiener space to show that controlled complementary Young regularity is sufficient to obtain Gaussian rough paths lifts. This allows us to completely bypass assumptions on the 2D variation regularity of the covariance and, as a consequence, we obtain cleaner proofs of approximation statements (with optimal convergence rates) and show the convergence of random Fourier series in rough paths metrics under minimal assumptions on the coefficients (which are sharper than those in the existent literature).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11217v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first show that the Airy$_1$ process is associated using the association property of the solution to the stochastic heat equation and convergence of the KPZ equation to the KPZ fixed point. Then we apply Newman's inequality to establish the ergodicity and central limit theorem for the Airy$_1$ process. Combined with the asymptotic behavior of the tail probability, we derive a Poisson limit theorem for the Airy$_1$ process and give a precise estimate on the asymptotic behavior of the maximum of the Airy$_1$ process over an interval. Analogous results for the Airy$_2$ process are also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09040v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a new approach in the definition of two-dimensional heavy-tailed distributions. Namely, we introduce the classes of two-dimensional long-tailed, of twodimensional dominatedly varying and of two-dimensional consistently varying distributions. Next, we define the closure property with respect to two-dimensional convolution and to joint max-sum equivalence in order to study if they are satisfied by these classes. Further we examine the joint behavior of two random sums, under generalized tail asymptotic independence. Afterward we study the closure property under scalar product and two dimensional product convolution and by these results we extended our main result in the case of jointly randomly weighted sums. Our results contained some applications where we establish the asymptotic expression of the ruin probability in a two-dimensional discrete-time risk model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Stochastic Burgers equation was introduced in [H. van Beijeren, R. Kutner and H. Spohn, Excess noise for driven diffusive systems, PRL, 1985] as a continuous approximation of the fluctuations of the asymmetric simple exclusion process. It is formally given by $$\partial_t\eta =\frac{1}{2}\Delta\eta+ \mathfrak w\cdot\nabla(\eta^2) + \nabla\cdot\xi,$$ where $\xi$ is $d$-dimensional space time white noise and $\mathfrak w$ is a fixed non-zero vector. In the critical dimension $d=2$ at stationarity, we show that this system exhibits superdiffusve behaviour: more specifically, its bulk diffusion coefficient behaves like $(\log t)^\frac23$, in a Tauberian sense, up to $\log\log\log t$ corrections. This confirms a prediction made in the physics literature and complements [G. Cannizzarro, M. Gubinelli, F. Toninelli, Gaussian Fluctuations for the stochastic Burgers equation in dimension $d\geq 2$, CMP, 2024], where the same equation was studied in the weak-coupling regime. Furthermore this model can be seen as a continuous analogue to [H.T. Yau, $(\log t)^\frac{2}{3}$ law of the two dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion process, Annals of Mathematics, 2004].</description>

In this model the branching rate while at some location $x\in\mathbb{Z}$ is randomized in an i.i.d. manner.

      <title>Probability Flow Approach to the Onsager--Machlup Functional for Jump-Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Onsager--Machlup action functional is an important concept in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics to describe the probability of fluctuations in nonequilibrium systems. It provides a powerful tool for analyzing and predicting the behavior of complex stochastic systems. For diffusion process, the path integral method and the Girsanov transformation are two main approaches to construct the Onsager--Machlup functional. However, it is a long-standing challenge to apply these two methods to the jump-diffusion process, because the complexity of jump noise presents intrinsic technical barriers to derive the Onsager--Machlup functional. In this work, we propose a new strategy to solve this problem by utilizing the equivalent probabilistic flow between the pure diffusion process and the jump-diffusion process. For the first time, we rigorously establish the closed-form expression of the Onsager--Machlup functional for jump-diffusion processes with finite jump activity, which include an important term of the L\'{e}vy intensity at the origin. The same probability flow approach is further applied to the L\'{e}vy process with infinite jump activity, and yields a time-discrete version of the Onsager--Machlup functional.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic sewing lemma recently introduced by Le~(2020) allows to construct a unique limit process from a doubly indexed stochastic process that satisfies some regularity. This lemma is stated in a given probability space on which these processes are defined. The present paper develops a version of this lemma for probability measures: from a doubly indexed family of maps on the set of probability measures that have a suitable probabilistic representation, we are able to construct a limit flow of maps on the probability measures. This result complements and improves the existing result coming from the classical sewing lemma. It is applied to the case of law-dependent jump SDEs for which we obtain weak existence result as well as the uniqueness of the marginal laws.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize an ergodic theory framework to explore sublinear expectation theory. Specifically, we investigate the pointwise Birkhoff's ergodic theorem for invariant sublinear expectation systems. By further assuming that these sublinear expectation systems are ergodic, we derive stronger results. Furthermore, we relax the conditions for the law of large numbers and the strong law of large numbers under sublinear expectations from independent and identical distribution to $\alpha$-mixing. These results can be applied to a class of stochastic differential equations driven by $G$-Brownian motion (i.e., $G$-SDEs), such as $G$-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.
  As byproducts, we also obtain a series of applications for classical ergodic theory and capacity theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a straightforward formulation of Stein's method for the semicircular distribution, specifically designed for the analysis of non-commutative random variables. Our approach employs a non-commutative version of Stein's heuristic, interpolating between the target and approximating distributions via the free Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. A key application of this work is to provide a new perspective for obtaining precise estimates of accuracy in the semicircular approximation for sums of weakly dependent variables, measured under the total variation metric. We leverage the simplicity of our arguments to achieve robust convergence results, including: (i) A Berry-Esseen theorem under the total variation distance and (ii) Enhancements in rates of decay under the non-commutative Wasserstein distance towards the semicircular distribution, given adequate high-order moment matching conditions.</description>

      <title>On matrix product ansatz for Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process with open boundary in the singular case</title>

      <description>arXiv:1904.09536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a substitute for the matrix product ansatz for Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process with open boundary in the ``singular case'' $\alpha\beta=q^N\gamma\delta$, when the standard form of the matrix product ansatz of Derrida, Evans, Hakim and Pasquier does not apply. In our approach, the matrix product ansatz is replaced with a pair of linear functionals on an abstract algebra. One of the functionals, $\varphi_1$, is defined on the entire algebra, and determines stationary probabilities for large systems on $L\geq N+1$ sites. The other functional, $\varphi_0$, is defined only on a finite-dimensional linear subspace of the algebra, and determines stationary probabilities for small systems on $L&lt; N+1$ sites. Functional $\varphi_0$ vanishes on non-constant Askey-Wilson polynomials and in non-singular case becomes an orthogonality functional for the Askey-Wilson polynomials.</description>

      <title>On the existence of powerful p-values and e-values for composite hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16539v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a composite null $ \mathcal P$ and composite alternative $ \mathcal Q$, when and how can we construct a p-value whose distribution is exactly uniform under the null, and stochastically smaller than uniform under the alternative? Similarly, when and how can we construct an e-value whose expectation exactly equals one under the null, but its expected logarithm under the alternative is positive? We answer these basic questions, and other related ones, when $ \mathcal P$ and $ \mathcal Q$ are convex polytopes (in the space of probability measures). We prove that such constructions are possible if and only if $ \mathcal Q$ does not intersect the span of $ \mathcal P$. If the p-value is allowed to be stochastically larger than uniform under $P\in \mathcal P$, and the e-value can have expectation at most one under $P\in \mathcal P$, then it is achievable whenever $ \mathcal P$ and $ \mathcal Q$ are disjoint. More generally, even when $ \mathcal P$ and $ \mathcal Q$ are not polytopes, we characterize the existence of a bounded nontrivial e-variable whose expectation exactly equals one under any $P \in \mathcal P$. The proofs utilize recently developed techniques in simultaneous optimal transport. A key role is played by coarsening the filtration: sometimes, no such p-value or e-value exists in the richest data filtration, but it does exist in some reduced filtration, and our work provides the first general characterization of this phenomenon. We also provide an iterative construction that explicitly constructs such processes, and under certain conditions it finds the one that grows fastest under a specific alternative $Q$. We discuss implications for the construction of composite nonnegative (super)martingales, and end with some conjectures and open problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the homogenisation problem for the $\phi^4_2$ equation on the torus $\mathbb{T}^2$, namely the behaviour as $\varepsilon \to 0$ of the solutions to the equation suggestively written as $$ \partial_t u_\varepsilon - \nabla\cdot {A}(x/\varepsilon,t/\varepsilon^2) \nabla u_\varepsilon = -u^3_\varepsilon +\xi $$ where $\xi$ denotes space-time white noise and $A: \mathbb{T}^2\times \mathbb{R}$ is uniformly elliptic, periodic and H\"older continuous. When the noise is regularised at scale $\delta \ll 1$ we show that any joint limit $\varepsilon,\delta \to 0$ recovers the classical dynamical $\phi^4_2$ model. In certain regimes or if the regularisation is chosen in a specific way adapted to the problem, we show that the counterterms can be chosen as explicit local functions of $A$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08711v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A method for analyzing non-asymptotic guarantees of numerical discretizations of ergodic SDEs in Wasserstein-2 distance is presented by Sanz-Serna and Zygalakis in ``Wasserstein distance estimates for the distributions of numerical approximations to ergodic stochastic differential equations". They analyze the UBU integrator which is strong order two and only requires one gradient evaluation per step, resulting in desirable non-asymptotic guarantees, in particular $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/4}\epsilon^{-1/2})$ steps to reach a distance of $\epsilon &gt; 0$ in Wasserstein-2 distance away from the target distribution. However, there is a mistake in the local error estimates in Sanz-Serna and Zygalakis (2021), in particular, a stronger assumption is needed to achieve these complexity estimates. This note reconciles the theory with the dimension dependence observed in practice in many applications of interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the connection between the ranks of the magnitude homology groups of a graph and the structure of its subgraphs. To this end, we introduce variants of magnitude homology called eulerian magnitude homology and discriminant magnitude homology. Leveraging the combinatorics of the differential in magnitude homology, we illustrate a close relationship between the ranks of the eulerian magnitude homology groups on the first diagonal and counts of subgraphs which fall in specific classes. We leverage these tools to study limiting behavior of the eulerian magnitude homology groups for Erdos-Renyi random graphs and random geometric graphs, producing for both models a vanishing threshold for the eulerian magnitude homology groups on the first diagonal. This in turn provides a characterization of the generators for the corresponding magnitude homology groups. Finally, we develop an explicit asymptotic estimate the expected rank of eulerian magnitude homology along the first diagonal for these random graph models.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of domino tilings on a pentagonal domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the six-vertex model at its free-fermion point with domain wall boundary conditions, which is equivalent to random domino tilings of the Aztec diamond. We compute the scaling limit of a particular non-local correlation function, essentially equivalent to the partition function for the domino tilings of a pentagon-shaped domain, obtained by cutting away a triangular region from a corner of the initial Aztec diamond. We observe a third-order phase transition when the geometric parameters of the obtained pentagonal domain are tuned to have the fifth side exactly tangent to the arctic ellipse of the corresponding initial model.</description>
