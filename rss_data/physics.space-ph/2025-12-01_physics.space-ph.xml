      <title>High-Energy Atmospheric Radiation: From Thunderstorm Ground Enhancements to Terrestrial Gamma-Ray Flashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a unified conceptual and observational framework that reinterprets these radiation bursts as manifestations of the same runaway processes happening at different atmospheric depths (Dual-stage model, DSM). We review recent results from satellite (ASIM), aircraft (ALOFT), balloon (HELEN), and ground-based (SEVAN and KANAZAWA) experiments to demonstrate the advantages of this integrated approach. This study addresses key contradictions in the field, introduces new classification criteria based on physics rather than detector location, and enhances our understanding of particle acceleration in thunderstorms.</description>

      <title>On the Relation between Source Region and In-situ Variability of Low $\delta B$ Solar Wind Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observed a high speed stream near the Sun ($\sim 9.8 R_\odot$) in March 2025. As this stream was observed near the Sun, it allowed for an unparalleled opportunity to observe pristine, coronal hole wind with little evolution (expansion, stream interaction, etc) effects impacting its properties. Through an ensemble of magnetic connectivity analysis utilizing Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) modeling and ballistic propagation, we make estimates of the footpoints, and corresponding source region parameters, associated with the stream. We then look at how the low variability regions (small gradient in the in-situ $B_r$) are related to the variability in the field strength at their source ($B_0$). We find that about half of these periods are associated with low source region variability. Lastly, we examine the low $\delta B / B$ periods between switchback patches and similarly find that they show statistically less variability in their associated $B_0$ value than their switchback patch counterparts. We believe that these results point to a solar source of these ``low-variability" periods, that warrants further investigation with composition diagnostics and more complex modeling techniques.</description>

      <title>Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA): The Properties of Quasar Host Galaxies: Star Formation Histories and Stellar Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the star formation history and stellar populations of a sample of 205 Type I quasar host galaxies (0.1$&lt;$z$&lt;$0.35) and compared with normal (non-active) galaxies of the same mass and redshift within the volume of the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) redshift survey. We find that quasar host galaxies tend to be star-forming galaxies ($\sim$ 80%) lying on the star-forming MS; the fraction of quasar host galaxies that are quiescent ($\sim$ 20%) is lower than the fraction of quiescent galaxies in the comparison sample of normal galaxies (54%). We find that the mean star formation rate of quasar host galaxies has increased over the past 100 Myr by a factor of 2--3, but these galaxies were star-forming at all times previously. Our data are more consistent with quasar activity originating together with an increase in the star formation rate of otherwise normal galaxies, similar to episodic star formation in normal spirals. We argue that this indicates that secular processes and minor mergers may be the favored triggers of nuclear activity in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>The Solar Close Observations and Proximity Experiments (SCOPE) mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar Close Observations and Proximity Experiments (SCOPE) mission will send a spacecraft into the solar atmosphere at a low altitude of just 5 R_sun from the solar center. It aims to elucidate the mechanisms behind solar eruptions and coronal heating, and to directly measure the coronal magnetic field. The mission will perform in situ measurements of the current sheet between coronal mass ejections and their associated solar flares, and energetic particles produced by either reconnection or fast-mode shocks driven by coronal mass ejections. This will help to resolve the nature of reconnections in current sheets, and energetic particle acceleration regions. To investigate coronal heating, the mission will observe nano-flares on scales smaller than 70 km in the solar corona and regions smaller than 40 km in the photosphere, where magnetohydrodynamic waves originate. To study solar wind acceleration mechanisms, the mission will also track the process of ion charge-state freezing in the solar wind. A key achievement will be the observation of the coronal magnetic field at unprecedented proximity to the solar photosphere. The polar regions will also be observed at close range, and the inner edge of the solar system dust disk may be identified for the first time. This work presents the detailed background, science, and mission concept of SCOPE and discusses how we aim to address the questions mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Mode Composition Shapes Magnetic Anisotropy in Solar Wind Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence is a ubiquitous process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales, thereby influencing particle transport and heating. Recent progress has improved our understanding of the anisotropy of turbulence with respect to the mean magnetic field; however, its exact form and implications for magnetic topology and energy transfer remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the nature of magnetic anisotropy in compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence within low-$\beta$ solar wind using measurements from the Cluster spacecraft. By decomposing small-amplitude fluctuations into Alfv\'en and compressible modes, we reveal that magnetic anisotropy is largely mode dependent: Alfvenic fluctuations are broadly distributed in propagation angle, whereas compressible fluctuations are concentrated near the quasi-parallel (slab) direction, a feature closely linked to collisionless damping of compressible modes. For $\beta\rightarrow0$, compressible modes become dominant within the slab component at smaller scales. These findings advance our understanding of magnetic anisotropy in solar wind turbulence and offer a new perspective on the three-dimensional turbulence cascade, with broad implications for particle transport, acceleration, and magnetic reconnection.</description>
