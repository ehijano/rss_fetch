      <title>Non-Hermitian Skin Effect Along Hyperbolic Geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has been revealed that a variety of novel phenomena emerge in hyperbolic spaces, while non-Hermitian physics has significantly enriched the landscape of condensed matter physics. Building on these developments, we construct a geodesic-based method to study the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in non-reciprocal hyperbolic lattices. Additionally, we develop a geodesic-periodic boundary condition (geodesic-PBC), akin to the Euclidean periodic boundary condition (PBC), that complements its open boundary condition. Importantly, we find that the non-reciprocal directionality within a hyperbolic regular polygon and the geodesic-based boundary determine the spectral sensitivity, and hence, the NHSE. Unlike in Euclidean models, however, we must utilize boundary localization to distinguish non-trivial skin modes from their trivial boundary counterpart due to the extensive boundary volume of hyperbolic lattices. We also relate the spatial density profile with the finite-size scaling of hyperbolic lattices. These aspects highlight the profound impact of hyperbolic geometry on non-Hermitian systems and offer new perspectives on the intricate relationship between the geometric characteristics of hyperbolic lattices and non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Cooperative non-reciprocal emission and quantum sensing of symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal propagation of energy and information is fundamental to a wide range of quantum technology applications. In this work, we explore the quantum many-body dynamics of a qubit ensemble coupled to a shared bath that mediates coherent and dissipative inter-qubit interactions with both symmetric and anti-symmetric components. We find that the interplay between anti-symmetric (symmetric) coherent and symmetric (anti-symmetric) dissipative interactions results in non-reciprocal couplings, which, in turn, generate a spatially asymmetric emission pattern. We demonstrate that this pattern arises from non-reciprocal interactions coupling different quantum many-body states within a specific excitation manifold. Focusing on solid-state baths, we show that their lack of time-reversal and inversion symmetry is a key ingredient for generating non-reciprocal dynamics in the qubit ensemble. With the plethora of quantum materials that exhibit this symmetry breaking at equilibrium, our approach paves the way for realizing cooperative non-reciprocal transport in qubit ensembles without requiring time-modulated external drives or complex engineering. Using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers coupled to a generic non-centrosymmetric ferromagnetic bath as a concrete example, we demonstrate that our predictions can be tested in near-future experiments. As the spatial asymmetry in the relaxation dynamics of the qubit ensemble is a direct probe of symmetry breaking in the solid-state bath, our work also opens the door to developing model-agnostic quantum sensing schemes capable of detecting bath properties invisible to current state-of-the-art protocols, which operate solid-state defects as single-qubit sensors.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions Disentangle Higher-Order Topology in 2D Non-Hermitian Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the exact closed-form solutions for higher-order topological states as well as explicit energy-spectrum relationships in two-dimensional (2D) non-Hermitian multi-orbital lattices with generalized boundary conditions. These analytical solutions unequivocally confirm that topological edge states in a 2D non-Hermitian system which feature point-gap topology must undergo the non-Hermitian skin effect along the edge. Under double open boundary conditions, the occurrence of the non-Hermitian skin effect for either topological edge states or bulk states can be accurately predicted by our proposed winding numbers. We unveil that the zero-energy topological corner state only manifests itself on a corner where two nearby gapped edge states intersect, and thus can either disappear completely or strengthen drastically due to the non-Hermitian skin effect of gapped topological edge states. Our analytical results offer direct insight into the non-Bloch band topology in two or higher dimensions and trigger experimental investigations into related phenomena such as quadrupole topological insulators and topological lasing.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Resolved Fingerprint of Mottness in Layer-Dimerized Nb$_3$Br$_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a well-ordered crystalline solid, insulating behaviour can arise from two mechanisms: electrons can either scatter off a periodic potential, thus forming band gaps that can lead to a band insulator, or they localize due to strong interactions, resulting in a Mott insulator. For an even number of electrons per unit cell, either band- or Mott-insulators can theoretically occur. However, unambiguously identifying an unconventional Mott-insulator with an even number of electrons experimentally has remained a longstanding challenge due to the lack of a momentum-resolved fingerprint. This challenge has recently become pressing for the layer dimerized van der Waals compound Nb$_3$Br$_8$, which exhibits a puzzling magnetic field-free diode effect when used as a weak link in Josephson junctions, but has previously been considered to be a band-insulator. In this work, we present a unique momentum-resolved signature of a Mott-insulating phase in the spectral function of Nb$_3$Br$_8$: the top of the highest occupied band along the out-of-plane dimerization direction $k_z$ has a momentum space separation of $\Delta k_z=2\pi/d$, whereas the valence band maximum of a band insulator would be separated by less than $\Delta k_z=\pi/d$, where $d$ is the average spacing between the layers. As the strong electron correlations inherent in Mott insulators can lead to unconventional superconductivity, identifying Nb$_3$Br$_8$ as an unconventional Mott-insulator is crucial for understanding its apparent time-reversal symmetry breaking Josephson diode effect. Moreover, the momentum-resolved signature employed here could be used to detect quantum phase transition between band- and Mott-insulating phases in van der Waals heterostructures, where interlayer interactions and correlations can be easily tuned to drive such transition.</description>

      <title>Bound States-to-Bands in the Continuum in Cylindrical Granular Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate and experimentally demonstrate that genuine bound states in the continuum (BICs) -- polarization-protected BICs -- can be completely localized within finite-size solid resonators. This bound mode is realized in a highly tunable mechanical system made of cylindrical granular crystals, where tunning the contact boundaries enables the in situ transition from the BICs to quasi-BICs in a controllable manner. Since a single-particle resonator can support BICs itself, these bound states can extend to form bound bands within periodic structures composed of such resonators. We experimentally demonstrate the emergence of a quasi-bound (flat) band in a finite chain with broken resonator symmetry, using a laser Doppler vibrometer. Remarkably, we show that all cylindrical resonators within the entire chain exhibit high-Q and dispersionless resonance.</description>
