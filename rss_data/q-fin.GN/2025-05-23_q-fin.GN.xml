      <title>Corporate Non-Disclosure Disputes: equilibrium settlement where increasing legal liability encourages voluntary disclosures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How should a court resolve a shareholder-management dispute after an unexpected price drop, when it is suspected that at an earlier time management chose not to update (disclose to) the market about a material event that was privately observed? An earlier fundamental result in this area (Dye, 2017) has shown that if the court chooses to make public that it will increase awards of damages to try and deter non-disclosure, then this may have the perverse effect that management may rationally choose to disclose less. Schantl and Wagenhofer (2024) call this the pure-insurance effect shareholders receive from higher damages payments. They show that the result may be relaxed if management also face a fixed exogenous reputational cost from non-disclosure. In this research we probe the increased-damages versus reduced-disclosure result via a different route. We introduce a dynamic continuous-time model of management's equilibrium disclosure decision and show that as awards of damages increase this has in a dynamic setting a hitherto unrecognized effect: management rationally switch their disclosure strategy. We characterize the range of damage awards, which we term the legal consistency zone, in which increased awards of damages evoke an endogenous increase in voluntary disclosure.</description>

      <title>Vague Knowledge: Evidence from Analyst Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People in the real world often possess vague knowledge of future payoffs, for which quantification is not feasible or desirable. We argue that language, with differing ability to convey vague information, plays an important but less known-role in representing subjective expectations. Empirically, we find that in their reports, analysts include useful information in linguistic expressions but not numerical forecasts. Specifically, the textual tone of analyst reports has predictive power for forecast errors and subsequent revisions in numerical forecasts, and this relation becomes stronger when analyst's language is vaguer, when uncertainty is higher, and when analysts are busier. Overall, our theory and evidence suggest that some useful information is vaguely known and only communicated through language.</description>
