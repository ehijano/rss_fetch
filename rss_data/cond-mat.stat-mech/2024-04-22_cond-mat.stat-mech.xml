      <title>Reclassification of thermal equilibrium phase transitions in thermodynamic limit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For relaxor-ferroelectrics and relaxor-ferromagnets, Ehrenfest classification of phase transitions based on the discontinuity of entropy or specific heat etc. with temperature (T) gives no transition that contradicts the measured order parameter, i.e. spontaneous polarization and magnetization, at low temperatures, while Landau classification based on the minimum derivative of the order parameter to T raises the question about the relationships between the phase transition and the specific heat peak above and near the transition temperature. Here, based on the free energy of the thermodynamic limit systems with T when the external field tends to 0, thermal equilibrium phase transitions are reclassified into three categories, i.e. 1) First-order phase transition, 2) Second-order phase transition, and 3) Diffuse phase transition, naturally giving the the relation of the phase transition to the specific heat peak. Deep analyses indicate that the classification of this paper is based on both the long-range and short-range correlation orders of the systems, while the Ehrenfest's or Landau's independently on the short-range or long-range order, respectively.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Oscillator Staging for Efficient Path Integral Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaginary-time path integral (PI) is a rigorous quantum mechanical tool to compute static properties. However, the stiff nature of the internal PI modes poses a sampling challenge. This is commonly tackled using staging coordinates, in which the free particle (FP) contribution of the PI action is diagonalized. We introduce novel and simple staging coordinates that diagonalize the entire action of the harmonic oscillator (HO), rendering it efficiently applicable to systems with a harmonic character, such as quantum oscillators and crystals. Unlike FP staging, the HO staging provides a unique treatment of the centroid mode. We provide implementation schemes for PIMC and PIMD simulations. Sampling efficiency is assessed in terms of precision and accuracy of estimating the energy and heat capacity of a 1D HO, along with an anharmonic oscillator (AO) to investigate anharmonic effects. In PIMC, the HO coordinates propose collective moves that perfectly sample the HO contribution, then (for AO) the residual anharmonic term is sampled using Metropolis method. This results in a high acceptance rate and, hence, high precision, in comparison to the FP staging. In PIMD, the HO coordinates naturally prescribe definitions for the fictitious masses, yielding equal frequencies of all modes when applied to the HO model. This allows for a substantially larger time step sizes relative to standard staging, without affecting accuracy. For completeness, we also present results using normal mode (NM) coordinates, based on both HO and FP models. While staging and NM coordinates show similar performance, staging is computationally cheaper due to its linear, rather than quadratic, scaling with system size. The simplicity and the enhanced sampling gained by the HO coordinates open avenues for efficient estimation of nuclear quantum effects in more complex systems, such as molecular bonds and quantum crystals.</description>

      <title>Universality of giant diffusion in tilted periodic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant diffusion, where the diffusion coefficient of a Brownian particle in a periodic potential with an external force is significantly enhanced by the external force, is a non-trivial non-equilibrium phenomenon. We propose a simple stochastic model of giant diffusion, which is based on a biased continuous-time random walk (CTRW). In this model, we introduce a flight time in the biased CTRW. We derive the diffusion coefficients of this model by the renewal theory and find that there is a maximum diffusion coefficient when the bias is changed. Giant diffusion is universally observed in the sense that there is a peak of the diffusion coefficient for any tilted periodic potentials and the degree of the diffusivity is greatly enhanced especially for low-temperature regimes. The biased CTRW models with flight times are applied to diffusion under three tilted periodic potentials. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the maximum diffusion coefficient and the external force that attains the maximum are presented for diffusion under a tilted sawtooth potential.</description>

      <title>Simple and efficient methods for local structural analysis in polydisperse hard disk systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nonequilibrium statistical physics, quantifying the nearest (and higher-order) neighbors and free volumes of particles in many-body systems is crucial to elucidating the origin of macroscopic collective phenomena, such as glass/granular jamming transitions and various aspects of the behavior of active matter. However, conventional techniques (based on a fixed-distance cutoff or the Voronoi construction) have mainly been applied to equilibrated, homogeneous, and monodisperse particle systems. In this paper, we implement simple and efficient methods for local structure analysis in nonequilibrium, inhomogeneous, and polydisperse hard disk systems. We show how these novel methods can overcome the difficulties encountered by conventional techniques, as well as demonstrating some applications.</description>

      <title>Impact of non-reciprocal interactions on colloidal self-assembly with tunable anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal (NR) effective interactions violating Newton's third law occur in many biological systems, but can also be engineered in synthetic, colloidal systems. Recent research has shown that such NR interactions can have tremendous effects on the overall collective behaviour and pattern formation, but can also influence aggregation processes on the particle scale. Here we focus on the impact of non-reciprocity on the self-assembly of an (originally passive) colloidal system with anisotropic interactions whose character is tunable by external fields. In the absence of non-reciprocity, that is, under equilibrium conditions, the colloids form aggregates with extremely long life times [Kogler et al., Soft Matter 11, 7356 (2015)], indicating kinetic trapping. Here we study, based on Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations in 2D, a NR version of this model consisting of two species with reciprocal isotropic, but NR anisotropic interactions. We find that NR induces an effective propulsion of particle pairs and small aggregates forming at initial stages of self-assembly, an indication of the NR-induced non-equilibrium. The shape and stability of these initial clusters strongly depends on the degree of anisotropy. At longer times we find, for weak NR interactions, large (even system-spanning) clusters where single particles can escape and enter at the boundaries, in stark contrast to the small rigid aggregates appearing at the same time in the passive case. In this sense, weak NR shortcuts the aggregation. Increasing the degree of NR (and thus, propulsion), we even observe large-scale phase separation if the interactions are weakly anisotropic. In contrast, system with strong NR and anisotropy remain essentially disordered. Overall, NR interactions are shown to destabilize the rigid aggregates interrupting self-assembly in the passive case, helping the system to overcome kinetic barriers.</description>

      <title>Scalable spin squeezing from critical slowing down in short-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range spin-spin interactions are known to generate non-equilibrium dynamics which can squeeze the collective spin of a quantum spin ensemble in a scalable manner, leading to states whose metrologically useful entanglement grows with system size. Here we show theoretically that scalable squeezing can be produced in 2d U(1)-symmetric systems even by short-range interactions, i.e. interactions that at equilibrium do not lead to long-range order at finite temperatures, but rather to an extended, Berezhinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) critical phase. If the initial state is a coherent spin state in the easy plane of interactions, whose energy corresponds to a thermal state in the critical BKT phase, the non-equilibrium dynamics exhibits critical slowing down, corresponding to a power-law decay of the collective magnetization in time. This slow decay protects scalable squeezing, whose scaling reveals in turn the decay exponent of the magnetization. Our results open the path to realizing massive entangled states of potential metrological interest in many relevant platforms of quantum simulation and information processing -- such as Mott insulators of ultracold atoms, or superconducting circuits -- characterized by short-range interactions in planar geometries.</description>

      <title>Limits on Inferring T-cell Specificity from Partial Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in molecular biology is to decipher the mapping of protein sequence to function. To perform this mapping requires the identification of sequence features most informative about function. Here, we quantify the amount of information (in bits) that T-cell receptor (TCR) sequence features provide about antigen specificity. We identify informative features by their degree of conservation among antigen-specific receptors relative to null expectations. We find that TCR specificity synergistically depends on the hypervariable regions of both receptor chains, with a degree of synergy that strongly depends on the ligand. Using a coincidence-based approach to measuring information enables us to directly bound the accuracy with which TCR specificity can be predicted from partial matches to reference sequences. We anticipate that our statistical framework will be of use for developing machine learning models for TCR specificity prediction and for optimizing TCRs for cell therapies. The proposed coincidence-based information measures might find further applications in bounding the performance of pairwise classifiers in other fields.</description>

      <title>Deciding factor for detecting a particle within a subspace via dark and bright states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a measurement-induced continuous-time quantum walk, we address the problem of detecting a particle in a subspace, instead of a fixed position. In this configuration, we develop an approach of bright and dark states based on the unit and vanishing detection probability respectively for a particle-detection in the subspace. Specifically, by employing the rank-nullity theorem, we determine several properties of dark and bright states in terms of energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian used for a quantum walk and the projectors applied to detect the subspace. We provide certain conditions on the position and the rank of the subspace to be detected, resulting in the unit total detection probability, which has broad implications for quantum computing. Further, we illustrate the forms of dark as well as bright states and the dependence of detection probability on the number of dark states by considering a cyclic graph with nearest-neighbor and next nearest-neighbor hopping. Moreover, we observe that the divergence in the average number of measurements for detecting a particle successfully in a subspace can be reduced by performing high rank projectors.</description>

      <title>Diffusive contact between randomly driven colloidal suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relaxation process of two driven colloidal suspensions in diffusive contact to a steady state, similar to thermalization. We start by studying a single suspension, subjecting it to random driving forces via holographic optical tweezers, which agitate it to a higher effective temperature. Interestingly, the effective temperature of the suspension, defined by the Einstein relation, exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the driving frequency. Next, we follow the flux of particles between two such suspensions in diffusive contact, starting from a uniform density and relaxing to a state with zero net particle flux. The density remains uniform for systems with different frequencies but equal effective temperatures. At high driving frequencies, we show that the density distribution at steady state is determined by equating the ratio of the chemical potential to the effective temperature in both systems, mirroring thermal equilibrium behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement in the multicritical disordered Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, the entanglement entropy is calculated at the quantum multicritical point of the random transverse-field Ising model (RTIM). We use an efficient implementation of the strong disorder renormalization group method in two and three dimensions for two types of disorder. For cubic subsystems we find a universal logarithmic corner contribution to the area law b*ln(l) that is independent of the form of disorder. Our results agree qualitatively with those at the quantum critical points of the RTIM, but with new b prefactors due to having both geometric and quantum fluctuations at play. By studying the vicinity of the multicritical point, we demonstrate that the corner contribution serves as an `entanglement susceptibility', a useful tool to locate the phase transition and to measure the correlation length critical exponents.</description>

      <title>Entangled time-crystal phase in an open quantum light-matter system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-crystals are nonequilibrium many-body phases in which the state of the system dynamically approaches a limit cycle. While these phases are recently in the focus of intensive research, it is still far from clear whether they can host quantum correlations. In fact, mostly classical correlations have been observed so far and time-crystals appear to be effectively classical high-entropy phases. Here, we consider the nonequilibrium behavior of an open quantum light-matter system, realizable in current experiments, which maps onto a paradigmatic time-crystal model after an adiabatic elimination of the light field. The system displays a bistable regime, with coexistent time-crystal and stationary phases, terminating at a tricritical point from which a second-order phase transition line departs. While light and matter are uncorrelated in the stationary phase, the time-crystal phase features bipartite correlations, both of quantum and classical nature. Our work unveils that time-crystal phases in collective open quantum systems can sustain quantum correlations, including entanglement, and are thus more than effectively classical many-body phases.</description>

Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium dynamics of the Floquet quantum East model (a Trotterized version of the kinetically constrained quantum East spin chain) at its "deterministic point", where evolution is defined in terms of CNOT permutation gates. We solve exactly the thermalization dynamics for a broad class of initial product states by means of "space evolution". We prove: (i) the entanglement of a block of spins grows at most at one-half the maximal speed allowed by locality (i.e., half the speed of dual-unitary circuits); (ii) if the block of spins is initially prepared in a classical configuration, speed of entanglement is a quarter of the maximum; (iii) thermalization to the infinite temperature state is reached exactly in a time that scales with the size of the block.</description>

      <title>Exact first-order effect of interactions on the ground-state energy of harmonically-confined fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ spinless fermions, interacting with each other via a power-law interaction $\epsilon/r^n$, and trapped in an external harmonic potential $V(r) = r^2/2$, in $d=1,2,3$ dimensions. For any $0 &lt; n &lt; d+2$, we obtain the ground-state energy $E_N$ of the system perturbatively in $\epsilon$, $E_{N}=E_{N}^{\left(0\right)}+\epsilon E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}+O\left(\epsilon^{2}\right)$. We calculate $E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}$ exactly, assuming that $N$ is such that the "outer shell" is filled. For the case of $n=1$ (corresponding to a Coulomb interaction for $d=3$), we extract the $N \gg 1$ behavior of $E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}$, focusing on the corrections to the exchange term with respect to the leading-order term that is predicted from the local density approximation applied to the Thomas-Fermi approximate density distribution. The leading correction contains a logarithmic divergence, and is of particular importance in the context of density functional theory. We also study the effect of the interactions on the fermions' spatial density. Finally, we find that our result for $E_{N}^{\left(1\right)}$ significantly simplifies in the case where $n$ is even.</description>

      <title>Dirac walks on regular trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of matter fields on an ensemble of random geometries is a difficult problem still in need of new methods and ideas. We will follow a point of view inspired by probability theory techniques that relies on an expansion of the two point function as a sum over random walks. An analogous expansion for Fermions on non-Euclidean geometries is still lacking. Casiday et al. [\textit{Laplace and Dirac operators on graphs}, Linear and Multilinear Algebra (2022) 1] proposed a classical "Dirac walk" diffusing on vertices and edges of an oriented graph with a square root of the graph Laplacian. In contrast to the simple random walk, each step of the walk is given a sign depending on the orientation of the edge it goes through. In a toy model, we propose here to study the Green functions, spectrum and the spectral dimension of such "Dirac walks" on the Bethe lattice, a $d$-regular tree. The recursive structure of the graph makes the problem exactly solvable. Notably, we find that the spectrum develops a gap and that the spectral dimension of the Dirac walk matches that of the simple random walk ($d_s=1$ for $d=2$ and $d_s=3$ for $d\geq 3$).</description>

      <title>Classical action for the height within the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation for surface growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06481v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we write down a classical (not quantum) action for the surface height for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation for surface growth. We do so starting with the regular Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) action (which is quantum - contains the constraint field) and integrate out the quantum constraint field exactly. We analyze the classical action, we thereby obtain, within the gaussian and one loop approximations and find various instabilities to rough surfaces. The gaussian analysis predicts instabilities to rough surfaces below two dimensions while one loop predicts stronger surface stability to roughness and instabilities to roughness below one dimension rather than two dimensions. The one loop analysis shows that the KPZ action is incomplete and that we generate additional terms (not found in the initial action) in the action perturbatively. In the supplement we also modify the KPZ equation for growing surfaces to include the effect of surface tilt on the noise (that is have multiplicatively coupled noise).</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of the approximate analytic approaches describing the finite-temperature thermodynamic quantities of the Lieb-Liniger model of the one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas with contact repulsive interactions. This paradigmatic model of quantum many-body-theory plays an important role in many areas of physics -- thanks to its integrability and possible experimental realization using, e.g., ensembles of ultracold bosonic atoms confined to quasi-1D geometries. The thermodynamics of the uniform Lieb-Liniger gas can be obtained numerically using the exact thermal Bethe ansatz (TBA) method, first derived in 1969 by Yang and Yang. However, the TBA numerical calculations do not allow for the in-depth understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms that govern the thermodynamic behavior of the Lieb-Liniger gas at finite temperature. Our work is then motivated by the insights that emerge naturally from the transparency of closed-form analytic results, which are derived here in six different regimes of the gas and which exhibit an excellent agreement with the TBA numerics. Our findings can be further adopted for characterising the equilibrium properties of inhomogeneous (e.g., harmonically trapped) 1D Bose gases within the local density approximation and for the development of improved hydrodynamic theories, allowing for the calculation of breathing mode frequencies which depend on the underlying thermodynamic equation of state. Our analytic approaches can be applied to other systems including impurities in a quantum bath, liquid helium-4, and ultracold Bose gas mixtures.</description>

      <title>Ion Correlation Induced Non-monotonic Height Change and Microphase Separation of Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09103</link>

Abstract: Modeling ion correlations in inhomogeneous polymers and soft matters with spatially varying ionic strength or dielectric permittivity remains a great challenge. Here, we develop a new theory which systematically incorporates electrostatic fluctuations into the self-consistent field theory for polymers. Applied to polyelectrolyte brushes, the theory predicts that ion correlations induce non-monotonic change of the brush height: collapse followed by reexpansion. The scaling analysis elucidates the competition between the repulsive osmotic pressure due to translational entropy and the attraction induced by ion correlations. We also clarify the absence of causal relationship between the brush collapse-reexpansion and the inversion of the surface electrostatic potential. Furthermore, strong ion correlations can trigger microphase separation, either in the lateral direction as pinned micelles or in the normal direction as oscillatory layers. Our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>The birth of StatPhys: The 1949 Florence conference at the juncture of post-WWII reconstruction of national and international physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12156</link>

Abstract: In spring 1949 about 70 physicists from eight countries met in Florence to discuss recent trends in statistical mechanics. This scientific gathering, co-organized by the Commission on Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) and the Italian Physical Society (SIF), initiated a tradition of IUPAP-sponsored international conferences on statistical mechanics that lasts to this day. In 1977, when this conference series took the name of StatPhys, the foundational role of the Florence conference was recognized by retrospectively naming it StatPhys1. This paper examines the dual scientific and social significance of the conference, situating it in the broader contexts of the post-World War II reconstruction in Italian physics and of the revitalization of the international science organization. Through an analysis of IUPAP archives and Italian records, we illustrate how the event's success hinged on the aligned objectives of its organizers. Internationally, it was instrumental in defining the scientific and organizational foundations for the activities of IUPAP commissions during a critical phase of IUPAP's history, when the Union was resurging on the international stage post-interwar period inactivity. Nationally, the conference served as a cornerstone in SIF's strategy to re-establish Italian physics' international stature and to aid the domestic revitalization of physics through the internationalization of its activities, notably of its flagship journal, \textit{Il Nuovo Cimento}. This analysis not only sheds light on the conference's impact but also informs recent discussions in the history of science about the multiple roles of international scientific conferences.</description>
