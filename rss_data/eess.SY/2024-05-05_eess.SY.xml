      <title>Accounting for the Effects of Probabilistic Uncertainty During Fast Charging of Lithium-ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batteries are nonlinear dynamical systems that can be modeled by Porous Electrode Theory models. The aim of optimal fast charging is to reduce the charging time while keeping battery degradation low. Most past studies assume that model parameters and ambient temperature are a fixed known value and that all PET model parameters are perfectly known. In real battery operation, however, the ambient temperature and the model parameters are uncertain. To ensure that operational constraints are satisfied at all times in the context of model-based optimal control, uncertainty quantification is required. Here, we analyze optimal fast charging for modest uncertainty in the ambient temperature and 23 model parameters. Uncertainty quantification of the battery model is carried out using non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion and the results are verified with Monte Carlo simulations. The method is investigated for a constant current--constant voltage charging strategy for a battery for which the strategy is known to be standard for fast charging subject to operating below maximum current and charging constraints. Our results demonstrate that uncertainty in ambient temperature results in violations of constraints on the voltage and temperature. Our results identify a subset of key parameters that contribute to fast charging among the overall uncertain parameters. Additionally, it is shown that the constraints represented by voltage, temperature, and lithium-plating overpotential are violated due to uncertainties in the ambient temperature and parameters. The C-rate and charge constraints are then adjusted so that the probability of violating the degradation acceleration condition is below a pre-specified value. This approach demonstrates a computationally efficient approach for determining fast-charging protocols that take probabilistic uncertainties into account.</description>

      <title>A Feedback Linearized Model Predictive Control Strategy for Input-Constrained Self-Driving Cars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel real-time affordable solution to the trajectory tracking control problem for self-driving cars subject to longitudinal and steering angular velocity constraints. To this end, we develop a dual-mode Model Predictive Control (MPC) solution starting from an input-output feedback linearized description of the vehicle kinematics. First, we derive the state-dependent input constraints acting on the linearized model and characterize their worst-case time-invariant inner approximation. Then, a dual-mode MPC is derived to be real-time affordable and ensuring, by design, constraints fulfillment, recursive feasibility, and uniformly ultimate boundedness of the tracking error in an ad-hoc built robust control invariant region. The approach's effectiveness and performance are experimentally validated via laboratory experiments on a Quanser Qcar. The obtained results show that the proposed solution is computationally affordable and with tracking capabilities that outperform two alternative control schemes.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning control strategies for Electric Vehicles and Renewable energy sources Virtual Power Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for direct electric energy in the grid is also tied to the increase of Electric Vehicle (EV) usage in the cities, which eventually will totally substitute combustion engine Vehicles. Nevertheless, this high amount of energy required, which is stored in the EV batteries, is not always used and it can constitute a virtual power plant on its own. Bidirectional EVs equipped with batteries connected to the grid can therefore charge or discharge energy depending on public needs, producing a smart shift of energy where and when needed. EVs employed as mobile storage devices can add resilience and supply/demand balance benefits to specific loads, in many cases as part of a Microgrid (MG). Depending on the direction of the energy transfer, EVs can provide backup power to households through vehicle-to-house (V2H) charging, or storing unused renewable power through renewable-to-vehicle (RE2V) charging. V2H and RE2V solutions can complement renewable power sources like solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and wind turbines (WT), which fluctuate over time, increasing the self-consumption and autarky. The concept of distributed energy resources (DERs) is becoming more and more present and requires new solutions for the integration of multiple complementary resources with variable supply over time. The development of these ideas is coupled with the growth of new AI techniques that will potentially be the managing core of such systems. Machine learning techniques can model the energy grid environment in such a flexible way that constant optimization is possible. This fascinating working principle introduces the wider concept of an interconnected, shared, decentralized grid of energy. This research on Reinforcement Learning control strategies for Electric Vehicles and Renewable energy sources Virtual Power Plants focuses on providing solutions for such energy supply optimization models.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Optimal Trade-off Between V2G Activities and Battery Degradation in Electric Mobility-as-a-Service Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents optimization models for electric Mobility-as-a-Service systems, whereby electric vehicles not only provide on-demand mobility, but also perform charging and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) operations to enhance the fleet operator profitability. Specifically, we formulate the optimal fleet operation problem as a mixed-integer linear program, with the objective combining of operational costs and revenues generated from servicing requests and grid electricity sales. Our cost function explicitly captures battery price and degradation, reflecting their impact on the fleet total cost of ownership due to additional charging and discharging activities. Simulation results for Eindhoven, The Netherlands, show that integrating V2G activities does not compromise the number of travel requests being served. Moreover, we emphasize the significance of accounting for battery degradation, as the costs associated with it can potentially outweigh the revenues stemming from V2G operations.</description>

      <title>Obstacle Avoidance of Autonomous Vehicles: An LPVMPC with Scheduling Trust Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reference tracking and obstacle avoidance rank among the foremost challenging aspects of autonomous driving. This paper proposes control designs for solving reference tracking problems in autonomous driving tasks while considering static obstacles. We suggest a model predictive control (MPC) strategy that evades the computational burden of nonlinear nonconvex optimization methods after embedding the nonlinear model equivalently to a linear parameter-varying (LPV) formulation using the so-called scheduling parameter. This allows optimal and fast solutions of the underlying convex optimization scheme as a quadratic program (QP) at the expense of losing some performance due to the uncertainty of the future scheduling trajectory over the MPC horizon. Also, to ensure that the modeling error due to the application of the scheduling parameter predictions does not become significant, we propose the concept of scheduling trust region by enforcing further soft constraints on the states and inputs. A consequence of using the new constraints in the MPC is that we construct a region in which the scheduling parameter updates in two consecutive time instants are trusted for computing the system matrices, and therefore, the feasibility of the MPC optimization problem is retained. We test the method in different scenarios and compare the results to standard LPVMPC as well as nonlinear MPC (NMPC) schemes.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Lyapunov-based feedback stabilization of bipedal locomotion based on reference spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid formulation of the linear inverted pendulum model for bipedal locomotion, where the foot switches are triggered based on the center of mass position, removing the need for pre-defined footstep timings. Using a concept similar to reference spreading, we define nontrivial tracking error coordinates induced by our hybrid model. These coordinates enjoy desirable linear flow dynamics and rather elegant jump dynamics perturbed by a suitable extended class ${\mathcal K}_\infty$ function of the position error. We stabilize this hybrid error dynamics using a saturated feedback controller, selecting its gains by solving a convex optimization problem. We prove local asymptotic stability of the tracking error and provide a certified estimate of the basin of attraction, comparing it with a numerical estimate obtained from the integration of the closed-loop dynamics. Simulations on a full-body model of a real robot show the practical applicability of the proposed framework and its advantages with respect to a standard model predictive control formulation.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Load Estimation Problem: Cell Switching in HAPS-Assisted Sustainable 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to introduce and address the problem of traffic load estimation in the cell switching concept within the evolving landscape of vertical heterogeneous networks (vHetNets). The problem is that the practice of cell switching faces a significant challenge due to the lack of accurate data on the traffic load of sleeping small base stations (SBSs). This problem makes the majority of the studies in the literature, particularly those employing load-dependent approaches, impractical due to their basic assumption of perfect knowledge of the traffic loads of sleeping SBSs for the next time slot. Rather than developing another advanced cell switching algorithm, this study investigates the impacts of estimation errors and explores possible solutions through established methodologies in a novel vHetNet environment that includes the integration of a high altitude platform (HAPS) as a super macro base station (SMBS) into the terrestrial network. In other words, this study adopts a more foundational perspective, focusing on eliminating a significant obstacle for the application of advanced cell switching algorithms. To this end, we explore the potential of three distinct spatial interpolation-based estimation schemes: random neighboring selection, distance-based selection, and clustering-based selection. Utilizing a real dataset for empirical validations, we evaluate the efficacy of our proposed traffic load estimation schemes. Our results demonstrate that the multi-level clustering (MLC) algorithm performs exceptionally well, with an insignificant difference (i.e., 0.8%) observed between its estimated and actual network power consumption, highlighting its potential to significantly improve energy efficiency in vHetNets.</description>

      <title>CGD: Constraint-Guided Diffusion Policies for UAV Trajectory Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional optimization-based planners, while effective, suffer from high computational costs, resulting in slow trajectory generation. A successful strategy to reduce computation time involves using Imitation Learning (IL) to develop fast neural network (NN) policies from those planners, which are treated as expert demonstrators. Although the resulting NN policies are effective at quickly generating trajectories similar to those from the expert, (1) their output does not explicitly account for dynamic feasibility, and (2) the policies do not accommodate changes in the constraints different from those used during training.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Constraint-Guided Diffusion (CGD), a novel IL-based approach to trajectory planning. CGD leverages a hybrid learning/online optimization scheme that combines diffusion policies with a surrogate efficient optimization problem, enabling the generation of collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories. The key ideas of CGD include dividing the original challenging optimization problem solved by the expert into two more manageable sub-problems: (a) efficiently finding collision-free paths, and (b) determining a dynamically-feasible time-parametrization for those paths to obtain a trajectory. Compared to conventional neural network architectures, we demonstrate through numerical evaluations significant improvements in performance and dynamic feasibility under scenarios with new constraints never encountered during training.</description>

      <title>Learning Robust Autonomous Navigation and Locomotion for Wheeled-Legged Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous wheeled-legged robots have the potential to transform logistics systems, improving operational efficiency and adaptability in urban environments. Navigating urban environments, however, poses unique challenges for robots, necessitating innovative solutions for locomotion and navigation. These challenges include the need for adaptive locomotion across varied terrains and the ability to navigate efficiently around complex dynamic obstacles. This work introduces a fully integrated system comprising adaptive locomotion control, mobility-aware local navigation planning, and large-scale path planning within the city. Using model-free reinforcement learning (RL) techniques and privileged learning, we develop a versatile locomotion controller. This controller achieves efficient and robust locomotion over various rough terrains, facilitated by smooth transitions between walking and driving modes. It is tightly integrated with a learned navigation controller through a hierarchical RL framework, enabling effective navigation through challenging terrain and various obstacles at high speed. Our controllers are integrated into a large-scale urban navigation system and validated by autonomous, kilometer-scale navigation missions conducted in Zurich, Switzerland, and Seville, Spain. These missions demonstrate the system's robustness and adaptability, underscoring the importance of integrated control systems in achieving seamless navigation in complex environments. Our findings support the feasibility of wheeled-legged robots and hierarchical RL for autonomous navigation, with implications for last-mile delivery and beyond.</description>

      <title>New design of smooth PSO-IPF navigator with kinematic constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic applications across industries demand advanced navigation for safe and smooth movement. Smooth path planning is crucial for mobile robots to ensure stable and efficient navigation, as it minimizes jerky movements and enhances overall performance Achieving this requires smooth collision-free paths. Partial Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Potential Field (PF) are notable path-planning techniques, however, they may struggle to produce smooth paths due to their inherent algorithms, potentially leading to suboptimal robot motion and increased energy consumption. In addition, while PSO efficiently explores solution spaces, it generates long paths and has limited global search. On the contrary, PF methods offer concise paths but struggle with distant targets or obstacles. To address this, we propose Smoothed Partial Swarm Optimization with Improved Potential Field (SPSO-IPF), combining both approaches and it is capable of generating a smooth and safe path. Our research demonstrates SPSO-IPF's superiority, proving its effectiveness in static and dynamic environments compared to a mere PSO or a mere PF approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time environmental monitoring using a multi-agent system (MAS) has long been a focal point of cooperative control. It is still a challenging task to provide cost-effective services for potential emergencies in surface environments. This paper explores the transformation of a general surface into a two-dimensional (2D) disk through the construction of a conformal mapping. Multiple agents are strategically deployed within the mapped convex disk, followed by mapping back to the original surface environment. This approach circumvents the complexities associated with handling the difficulties and intricacies of path planning. Technical analysis encompasses the design of distributed control laws and the method to eliminate distortions introduced by the mapping. Moreover, the developed coverage algorithm is applied to a scenario of monitoring surface deformation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Zero-Sum Positional Differential Games as a Framework for Robust Reinforcement Learning: Deep Q-Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust Reinforcement Learning (RRL) is a promising Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm aimed at training robust to uncertainty or disturbances models, making them more efficient for real-world applications. Following this paradigm, uncertainty or disturbances are interpreted as actions of a second adversarial agent, and thus, the problem is reduced to seeking the agents' policies robust to any opponent's actions. This paper is the first to propose considering the RRL problems within the positional differential game theory, which helps us to obtain theoretically justified intuition to develop a centralized Q-learning approach. Namely, we prove that under Isaacs's condition (sufficiently general for real-world dynamical systems), the same Q-function can be utilized as an approximate solution of both minimax and maximin Bellman equations. Based on these results, we present the Isaacs Deep Q-Network algorithms and demonstrate their superiority compared to other baseline RRL and Multi-Agent RL algorithms in various environments.</description>

Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) body models designed to predict Radio-Frequency (RF) propagation are time-consuming methods which prevent their adoption in strict real-time computational imaging problems, such as human body localization and sensing. Physics-informed Generative Neural Network (GNN) models have been recently proposed to reproduce EM effects, namely to simulate or reconstruct missing data or samples by incorporating relevant EM principles and constraints. The paper discusses a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) model which is trained to reproduce the effects of human motions on the EM field and incorporate EM body diffraction principles. Proposed physics-informed generative neural network models are verified against both classical diffraction-based EM tools and full-wave EM body simulations.</description>

Abstract: Residential Load Profile (RLP) generation and prediction are critical for the operation and planning of distribution networks, particularly as diverse low-carbon technologies are increasingly integrated. This paper introduces a novel flow-based generative model, termed Full Convolutional Profile Flow (FCPFlow), which is uniquely designed for both conditional and unconditional RLP generation, and for probabilistic load forecasting. By introducing two new layers--the invertible linear layer and the invertible normalization layer--the proposed FCPFlow architecture shows three main advantages compared to traditional statistical and contemporary deep generative models: 1) it is well-suited for RLP generation under continuous conditions, such as varying weather and annual electricity consumption, 2) it shows superior scalability in different datasets compared to traditional statistical, and 3) it also demonstrates better modeling capabilities in capturing the complex correlation of RLPs compared with deep generative models.</description>

Abstract: Compact robotic platforms with powerful compute and actuation capabilities are key enablers for practical, real-world deployments of multi-agent research. This article introduces a tightly integrated hardware, control, and simulation software stack on a fleet of holonomic ground robot platforms designed with this motivation. Our robots, a fleet of customised DJI Robomaster S1 vehicles, offer a balance between small robots that do not possess sufficient compute or actuation capabilities and larger robots that are unsuitable for indoor multi-robot tests.

      <title>Asynchronous Distributed Reinforcement Learning for LQR Control via Zeroth-Order Block Coordinate Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.12416v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently introduced distributed zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) algorithms have shown their utility in distributed reinforcement learning (RL). Unfortunately, in the gradient estimation process, almost all of them require random samples with the same dimension as the global variable and/or require evaluation of the global cost function, which may induce high estimation variance for large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed zeroth-order algorithm by leveraging the network structure inherent in the optimization objective, which allows each agent to estimate its local gradient by local cost evaluation independently, without use of any consensus protocol. The proposed algorithm exhibits an asynchronous update scheme, and is designed for stochastic non-convex optimization with a possibly non-convex feasible domain based on the block coordinate descent method. The algorithm is later employed as a distributed model-free RL algorithm for distributed linear quadratic regulator design, where a learning graph is designed to describe the required interaction relationship among agents in distributed learning. We provide an empirical validation of the proposed algorithm to benchmark its performance on convergence rate and variance against a centralized ZOO algorithm.</description>

      <title>Performance Investigation of an Optimal Control Strategy for Zero-Emission Operations of Shipboard Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11760v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces an efficient power management approach for shipboard microgrids that integrates diesel generators, a fuel cell, and battery energy storage system. This strategy addresses both unit commitment and power dispatch, considering the zero-emission capability of the ship, as well as optimizing the ship's speed. The optimization is done through mixed integer linear programming with the objective of minimizing the operational cost of all the power resources. Evaluations are conducted on a notional all-electric ship, with electrical load simulated using a Markov chain based on actual measurement data. The findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in optimizing fuel consumption while ensuring protection against blackout occurrences.</description>

      <title>Koopman-based feedback design with stability guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method to design a state-feedback controller ensuring exponential stability for nonlinear systems using only measurement data. Our approach relies on Koopman-operator theory and uses robust control to explicitly account for approximation errors due to finitely many data samples. To simplify practical usage across various applications, we provide a tutorial-style exposition of the feedback design and its stability guarantees for single-input systems. Moreover, we extend this controller design to multi-input systems and more flexible nonlinear state-feedback controllers using gain-scheduling techniques to increase the guaranteed region of attraction. As the proposed controller design is framed as a semidefinite program, it allows for an efficient solution. Further, we enhance the geometry of the region of attraction through a heuristic algorithm that establishes a connection between the employed Koopman lifting and the dynamics of the system. Finally, we validate the proposed feedback design procedure by means of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Optimal Power Flow Pursuit via Feedback-based Safe Gradient Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of controlling the operation of inverter-interfaced distributed energy resources (DERs) in a distribution grid, to achieve operational and performance goals with limited system-level information. We develop an online feedback optimization method to drive the DERs' power setpoints to solutions of an AC optimal power flow (OPF) problem based only on voltage measurements (and without requiring measurements of the power consumption of non-controllable assets). The proposed method - grounded on the theory of control barrier functions - is based on a continuous approximation of the projected gradient flow, appropriately modified to accommodate measurements from the power network. We provide results in terms of local exponential stability, and assess the robustness to errors in the measurements and in the system Jacobian matrix. We show that the proposed method ensures anytime satisfaction of the voltage constraints when no model and measurement errors are present; if these errors are present and are small, the voltage violation is practically negligible. We also discuss extensions of the framework to virtual power plant setups. Numerical experiments on a 93-bus distribution system and with realistic load and production profiles show a superior performance in terms of voltage regulation relative to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Functional Estimation: Functional Detectability and Full Information Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the design of functional estimators, i.e., approaches to compute an estimate of a nonlinear function of the state of a general nonlinear dynamical system subject to process noise based on noisy output measurements. To this end, we introduce a novel functional detectability notion in the form of incremental input/output-to-output stability ($\delta$-IOOS). We show that $\delta$-IOOS is a necessary condition for the existence of a functional estimator satisfying an input-to-output type stability property. Additionally, we prove that a system is functional detectable if and only if it admits a corresponding $\delta$-IOOS Lyapunov function. Furthermore, $\delta$-IOOS is shown to be a sufficient condition for the design of a stable functional estimator by introducing the design of a full information estimation (FIE) approach for functional estimation. Together, we present a unified framework to study functional estimation with a detectability condition, which is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a stable functional estimator, and a corresponding functional estimator design. The practical need for and applicability of the proposed functional estimator design is illustrated with a numerical example of a power system.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear Observer Design for the Discrete-time Systems: Exploiting Matrix-Multiplier-based LMI Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter focuses on the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ observer design for a class of nonlinear discrete systems under the presence of measurement noise or external disturbances. A novel Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) condition is developed in this method through the utilisation of the reformulated Lipschitz property, a new variant of Young inequality and the well-known Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) approach. One of the key components of the proposed LMI is the generalised matrix multipliers. The deliberate use of these multipliers enables us to introduce more numbers of decision variables inside LMIs than the one illustrated in the literature. It aids in adding some extra degrees of freedom from a feasibility point of view, thus enhancing the LMI conditions. Thus, the proposed LMIs are less conservative than existing ones. Later on, the effectiveness of the developed LMIs and observer is highlighted through the numerical example and an application of state of charge (SoC) estimation in the Li-ion battery model.</description>

      <title>Mean-Square Stability and Stabilizability for LTI and Stochastic Systems Connected in Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the feedback stabilization of a linear time-invariant (LTI) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system cascaded by a linear stochastic system is studied in the mean-square sense. Here, the linear stochastic system can model a class of correlated stochastic uncertainties such as channel uncertainties induced by packet loss and random transmission delays in networked systems. By proposing a key parameter called coefficient of frequency variation to characterize the correlation of the stochastic uncertainties, we present a necessary and sufficient condition of the mean-square stability for this MIMO stochastic feedback system. After then a necessary and sufficient condition for the mean-square stabilizability is provided, which reveals a fundamental limit imposed by the system's unstable poles, nonminimum-phase (NMP) zeros, relative degrees (input delays), and the coefficient of frequency variation of the stochastic uncertainties. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the fundamental constraints in the mean-square stabilizability of MIMO networked systems with parallel communication channels.</description>

      <title>Why Studying Cut-ins? Comparing Cut-ins and Other Lane Changes Based on Naturalistic Driving Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensive research has been conducted to explore vehicle lane changes, while the study on cut-ins has not received sufficient attention. The existing studies have not addressed the fundamental question of why studying cut-ins is crucial, despite the extensive investigation into lane changes. To tackle this issue, it is important to demonstrate how cut-ins, as a special type of lane change, differ from other lane changes. In this paper, we explore to compare driving characteristics of cut-ins and other lane changes based on naturalistic driving data. The highD dataset is employed to conduct the comparison. We extract all lane-change events from the dataset and exclude events that are not suitable for our comparison. Lane-change events are then categorized into the cut-in events and other lane-change events based on various gap-based rules. Several performance metrics are designed to measure the driving characteristics of the two types of events. We prove the significant differences between the cut-in behavior and other lane-change behavior by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The results suggest the necessity of conducting specialized studies on cut-ins, offering valuable insights for future research in this field.</description>

Abstract: The theory of dual control was introduced more than seven decades ago. Although it has provided rich insights to the fields of control, estimation, and system identification, dual control is generally computationally prohibitive. In recent years, however, the use of Koopman operator theory for control applications has been emerging. This paper presents a new reformulation of the stochastic optimal control problem that, employing the Koopman operator, yields a standard LQR problem with the dual control as its solution. We provide a numerical example that demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with certainty equivalence control, when applied to systems with varying observability.</description>

      <title>Minimum energy density steering of linear systems with Gromov-Wasserstein terminal cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we newly formulate and solve the optimal density control problem with Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) terminal cost in discrete-time linear Gaussian systems. Differently from the Wasserstein or Kullback-Leibler distances employed in the existing works, the GW distance quantifies the difference in shapes of the distribution, which is invariant under translation and rotation. Consequently, our formulation allows us to find small energy inputs that achieve the desired shape of the terminal distribution, which has practical applications, e.g., robotic swarms. We demonstrate that the problem can be reduced to a Difference of Convex (DC) programming, which is efficiently solvable through the DC algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we confirm that the state distribution reaches the terminal distribution that can be realized with the minimum control energy among those having the specified shape.</description>
