      <title>Excited states of coherent harmonic qubits with long-range photon coupling and dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that ensembles of interacting oscillators or qubits can exhibit the phenomenon of quantum synchronization. In this work we consider a set of $N$ identical two-state systems that we call ``harmonic qubits'', because the kinetic part of their Hamiltonian is of the form $\omega_0 \sum_i a^\dagger_i a_i$, coupled through a multi-state ``photon'' mode subject to dissipation. It has been proven numerically that when the coupling between the qubits and the photon is sufficiently strong, the ensemble condenses into a ground state with negative energy, the energy gap is proportional to $N$ and there are clear cross correlations $\langle a^\dagger_i a_j \rangle$. Here we are interested into the energy spectrum of the excited states of this system. In order to obtain information on this spectrum we introduce a weak coupling of each qubit with an external oscillator of variable frequency $\omega$ and we check via Monte Carlo time evolution for which values of $\omega$ variations in the occupation of the external oscillator occur. After adding a second external oscillator coupled to the first only through the $N$ qubits, we also look at the energy transfer between the two external oscillators in dependence on their frequency, a transfer which is possible only through the excited states of the qubits. We find that below the threshold of strong coupling between qubits and photon mode (when the ground state energy $E_0$ is zero), the energy transfer only occurs at frequencies close to the base frequency $\omega_0$. On the other hand, above threshold (when $E_0&lt;0$) one finds resonant transfer at frequencies which are definitely higher, and growing with $N$. This signals the presence of collective excited states with large energy gaps, which are absent below threshold.</description>

      <title>Relative Reality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ``Hard Problem" of consciousness refers to a long-standing enigma about how qualia emerge from physical processes in the brain. Building on insights from the development of non-Euclidean geometry, this paper seeks to present a structured and logically coherent theory of qualia to address this problem. The proposed theory starts with a definition on what it means for an entity to be non-physical. A postulate about awareness is posed and utilized to rigorously prove that qualia are non-physical and thoughts are qualia. Then the paper introduces a key concept: relative reality, meaning that perceptions of reality are relative to the observer and time. The concept is analyzed through a mathematical model grounded in Hilbert space theory. The model also sheds new light on cognitive science and physics. In particular, the Schr\"{o}dinger equation can be derived easily through this model. Moreover, this model shows that eigenstates also exist for classical energy-conserving systems. Analyses on the G. P. Thomson experiment and the classical harmonic oscillator are made to illustrate this finding. The insight gained sheds new light on the Bohr-Einstein debate concerning the interpretation of quantum mechanics. At last, the paper proposes a postulate about qualia force and demonstrates that it constitutes a fundamental part of absolute reality, much like the four fundamental forces in nature.</description>

      <title>Kinematical breaking of symmetry : A physical interpretation of Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05495v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new interpretation of the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) mechanism is proposed. According to the basic premise of relativistic quantum field theory, quantum vacuum before symmetry is broken is not a quiet state, but a relativistic many-body state of virtual massless fermion and antifermion taking both timelike and spacelike paths. In order for the many-body state to have a physical meaning independently of observers, virtual massless fermions and antifermions there should move along a common direction of time, even if they are observed from any inertial fame. As a lowest-energy-state satisfying this condition, the physical vacuum with broken symmetry is derived. Since it is a kinematical breaking of symmetry, whatever effective interaction acts on massless fermion, it generates fermion's mass, because it is freed from the role of causing symmetry breaking. In the physical vacuum, virtual massless pairs of fermion and antifermion behave as quasi bosons. Due to Bose statistics, their transverse excitations are suppressed by an energy gap, which explains the origin of the vacuum condensate in the BEH potential. As a response to the dynamic part of the above effective interaction, a Higgs-like excitation appears. This interpretation sheds a new light on the BEH mechanism.</description>
