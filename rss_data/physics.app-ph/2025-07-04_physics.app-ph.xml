      <title>Experimental Multiport-Network Parameter Estimation and Optimization for Multi-Bit RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-consistent theoretical studies on RIS-parametrized wireless channels use models from multiport-network theory (MNT) to capture mutual-coupling (MC) effects. However, in practice, RIS design and radio environment are partially or completely unknown. We fill a research gap on how to estimate the MNT model parameters in such experimentally relevant scenarios. Our technique efficiently combines closed-form and gradient-descent steps, and it can be applied to multi-bit-programmable RIS elements. We discuss inevitable (but operationally irrelevant) parameter ambiguities. We experimentally validate our technique in an unknown rich-scattering environment parametrized by eight 8-bit-programmable RIS elements of unknown design. We experimentally evaluate the performance of RIS configurations optimized with the estimated MNT model and an MC-unaware cascaded model. While the models differ in accuracy by up to 17 dB, the end-to-end performance differences are small.</description>

      <title>On the Design of Corrugated Boards: A New FEM Modeling and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a simplified FEM modeling approach suitable for large structures made of corrugated boards, such as customized packages, based on a homogenization method, which is combined with correction factors for internal mechanisms. The homogenization process reduces computational time by transforming flute geometries into equivalent elastic models. In large deformations and in the presence of contact for a given geometry, the effective elastic modulus in the thickness direction, as well as the effective thickness of the structure, are corrected by two statistical Weibull distributions representing the contact and buckling mechanisms in a corrugated board. The Weibull parameters are obtained via experimental analysis, and such a process is then validated. The results demonstrate that the statistical parameters ($\beta_1 = 0.14$, $\beta_2 = 1.31$) can be used for the simplistic representation of corrugated boards, being computationally efficient. This research contributes to the optimization of corrugated packaging design, specifically by simplifying FEM models for faster yet equally accurate simulations.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Effective Elastic Modulus and Thickness of Corrugated Boards Using Gaussian Process Regression and Expected Hypervolume Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to model the hypersurface of the effective elastic modulus, \( E_{z, \text{eff}} \), and thickness, \( th_{\text{eff}} \), in corrugated boards. A Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is followed by Gaussian Process Regression (GP), enhanced by EHVI as a multi-objective acquisition function. Accurate modeling of \( E_{z, \text{eff}} \) and \( th_{\text{eff}} \) is critical for optimizing the mechanical properties of corrugated materials in engineering applications. LHS provides an efficient and straightforward approach for an initial sampling of the input space; GP is expected to be able to adapt to the complexity of the response surfaces by incorporating both prediction and uncertainty. Therefore, the next points being generated and evaluated are based on the complexity of the hypersurfaces, and some points, especially those with higher variance, are more exploited and carry more importance. The performance of GP with EHVI is measured by Mean Squared Error (MSE). Prediction of GP resulted in \( \text{MSE}(E_{z, \text{eff}}) = 5.24 \, \text{kPa}^2 \) and \( \text{MSE}(th_{\text{eff}}) = 1 \, \text{mm}^2 \). GP possesses then improved accuracy and adaptability for future applications in structural optimization.</description>

      <title>Optical Vortex Spin-Orbit Control of Refractive Index in Iron Garnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between light's angular momentum (AM) and material systems has unlocked new avenues in structured photonics, including in magneto-optical (MO) materials. While spin angular momentum (SAM) effects in MO systems are well-established, orbital angular momentum (OAM) introduces novel opportunities for new nonreciprocal light-matter interactions. In this study, we demonstrate a unique optical phenomenon where OAM states undergo state-specific nonreciprocal operation within an MO medium, reducing Faraday rotation. This effect arises from transverse momentum transfer into the material, inducing spin-orbit coupling (SOC) at a perturbed electronic transition rate. The resulting OAM-dependent optical SOC modifies the material's refractive index, directly linking structured light and MO response. Our findings extend previous observations of paraxial beams and reveal a deeper fundamental mechanism governing OAM-driven nonreciprocal interactions. These insights pave the way for OAM-selective nonreciprocal photonic devices, chiral optical logic, quantum memory elements, and ultrafast spintronic architectures. This work advances MO integration with structured light for enhanced control over photonic and spintronic systems.</description>

      <title>Experimental evaluation of advanced control strategies for high-blockage cross-flow turbine arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In river or tidal channels, cross-flow turbines can achieve higher blockage ratios than other turbine variants, and are therefore able to achieve higher efficiencies. Here, we experimentally investigate how array control strategies might further influence the efficiency of a high-blockage dual-rotor cross-flow turbine array. Array performance is evaluated under coordinated constant speed control, uncoordinated torque control, and coordinated intracycle speed control at blockage ratios of 35% - 55%. In contrast to prior work at lower blockage, the evaluated control strategies do not yield significant improvements in efficiency and intracycle control is found to generally reduce array performance. While these results suggest limited benefits to more advanced control strategies at high blockage, this has the benefit of simplifying the system design space for array-level control.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of the clock asynchrony model in space-borne gravitational wave detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-borne gravitational wave detection will open the observation window in the 0.1 mHz$-$1 Hz bandwidth, playing a crucial role in the development of cosmology and physics. Precise clock synchronization among satellites is essential for the accurate detection of gravitational wave signals. However, the independent clock counting mechanisms of each satellite pose a significant challenge. This work reports the mathematical model of clock asynchrony, which is mainly dominated by the constant term factor and the linear term factor. Moreover, it experimentally verifies the clock asynchronization technique based on a dual-phasemeter system. Through experimentation, the impacts of these two aspects of clock asynchrony were confirmed, and post-processing techniques were employed to reduce these impacts to as low as $\rm 2\pi \times 10^{-6} rad/Hz^{1/2}@ 3mHz$. Specifically, the constant term factor is measured by Time-delay Interferometry Ranging (TDIR), while the linear term factor can be gauged by clock transmission link. This study provides a reference for understanding the clock asynchrony mechanism and processing clock synchronization issues. Additionally, a low additional noise clock synchronization test system is introduced to support such measurements.</description>

      <title>Radiation stability of nanocomposite scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation hardness of scintillating nanocomposites consisting of inorganic scintillating nanocrystalline powders dispersed in organic matrices was studied under electron, X-ray and {\gamma}-ray irradiation. Samples including pure press-compacted pellets of powder ZnO:Ga and YSO:Ce, and the nanocomposites of powder ZnO:Ga and YSO:Ce embedded in polystyrene matrix with different fillings were investigated. Effects of radiation on radioluminescence and other optical properties of studied materials were evaluated. Bright burn effect related to nanocrystalline powder scintillators was observed at lower doses. Radiation damage in nanocomposite materials is related to the formation of radicals in polystyrene matrix. Extent of radiation damage decreases with ZnO:Ga filling. Presented results show the importance of systematic and complex study of the radiation stability of composite scintillators.</description>

      <title>Single Photon Emitters in Ultra-Thin Hexagonal Boron Nitride Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPE) in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are promising for applications ranging from single-photon sources to quantum sensors. Previous studies exclusively focused on the generation and characterization of SPEs in relatively thick h-BN layers ($\geq$ 30 nm). However, for electrical and magnetic sensing applications, the thickness of the h-BN limits the attainable spatial resolution. Here, we report the observation of blue-wavelength emitters (B-centers) activated by electron beam irradiation in ultra-thin ($\simeq$ 3 nm) h-BN. These SPEs in ultra-thin flakes exhibit reduced brightness, broader zero-phonon line, and enhanced photobleaching. Remarkably, upon encapsulation in thicker h-BN, we restore their brightness, narrow linewidth 230$\mu$eV at 5K, resolution limited), suppress photobleaching, and confirm single-photon emission with $ g^{(2)}(0) &lt; 0.4$ at room temperature. The possibility of generating SPEs in a few-layer h-BN and their subsequent incorporation into a van der Waals heterostructure paves the way for achieving quantum sensing with unprecedented nanometer-scale spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Optimal boron-doped graphene substrate for glucose Raman signal enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) is a highly sensitive and selective technique that greatly enhances the signal of an analyte, compared with its signal from classical Raman Spectroscopy, due to its interaction with a substrates surface. It has been shown that low concentration boron-doped graphene (B-graphene) enhances the Raman signal of simple organic molecules like pyridine. Recent studies also suggest that B-graphene can remain thermodynamically stable when doped with significantly higher concentrations of boron than previously observed. In this framework, we use quantum mechanical simulations to investigate the influence of dopant concentration and geometric distribution on the effectiveness of B-doped graphene as a SERS substrate, with glucose as analyte. By combining analysis of interatomic force constants and of phonon eigenvectors composition, we conclude that higher doping concentrations provide a larger enhancement to glucose's Raman signal, while the molecule orientation relative to the surface plays a fundamental role in the Raman response. We suggest that high concentration B-graphene presents itself as a potential substrate for SERS based detection of glucose, while the used phonon-based analysis can be promptly applied for the search of promising candidates as substrate materials for enhanced Raman response.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Chip-Scale Meta-Networks with LSPR Routing: A Theoretical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient chip-scale interconnects are essential for modern microelectronic-photonic systems, supporting high bandwidth and low-latency processing. Traditional wired links face high resistivity and latency, while millimeter-wave wireless solutions suffer from bandwidth congestion and interference. Terahertz (THz) plasmonic communication, based on surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), offers high data rates and broad bandwidth, and is compatible with nanophotonic platforms. This work introduces a Binary Field-Driven Meta-Routing Method supported by a semi-analytical framework that models the tunable interaction between THz plasmonic phenomena and graphene's electromagnetic properties. By modulating graphene's impedance, the method enables dynamic coupling and routing of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) across a meta-network, facilitating real-time beam steering in chip-scale systems. Combining analytical conductivity models, coupled-mode theory, and algorithmic control, the approach enables predictive configuration of LSPR-based steering in reconfigurable graphene metasurfaces. Four meta-pixel antenna configurations Y-MetaRouter, MetaSwitcher, Penta-MetaEmitter, and CP-MetaCore are designed to support unidirectional radiation, bi-directional steering, frequency-driven transitions, and circular polarization, respectively. Chemical potential modulation creates reconfigurable LSPR pathways and virtual SPP channels. A Coupled-Mode Theory for Field-Driven LSPR Meta-Networks is proposed to model current distributions and predict far-field characteristics. Results show strong agreement between theory and full-wave simulations. A point-to-point meta-wireless link is analyzed, demonstrating scalability for low-latency, high-performance THz communication in WiNoC and chiplet applications. System-level metrics confirm feasibility for space-constrained, high-speed interconnects.</description>
