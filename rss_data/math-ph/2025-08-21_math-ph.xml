      <title>Equivalence of mutually unbiased bases via orbits: general theory and a $d=4$ case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) represent orthonormal bases that are as "far apart" as possible, and their classification reveals rich underlying geometric structure. Given a complex inner product space, we construct the space of its orthonormal bases as a discrete quotient of the complete flag manifold. We introduce a metric on this space, which corresponds to the "MUBness" distance. This allows us to describe equivalence between sets of mutually unbiased bases in terms of the geometry of this space. The subspace of bases that are unbiased with respect to the standard basis decomposes into orbits under a certain group action, and this decomposition corresponds to the classification of complex Hadamard matrices. More generally, we consider a list of $k$ MUBs, that one wishes to extend. The candidates are points in the subspace comprising all bases which are unbiased with respect to the entire list. This space also decomposes into orbits under a group action, and we prove that points in distinct orbits yield inequivalent MUB lists. Thus, we generalize the relation between complex Hadamard matrices and MUBs. As an application, we identify new symmetries that reduce the parameter space of MUB triples in dimension $4$ by a factor of $4$.</description>

      <title>GW/DT invariants and 5D BPS indices for strips from topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological string theory partition function gives rise to Gromov-Witten invariants, Donaldson-Thomas invariants and 5D BPS indices. Via the remodeling conjecture connecting Topological Recursion and topological string theory for toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds, a more direct connection is studied for the subclass of strip geometries. In doing so, new developments in the theory of topological recursion are applied as its extension to Logarithmic Topological Recursion (Log-TR) and the universal $x$--$y$ duality. Through these techniques, our main result in this paper is a direct derivation of all free energies from topological recursion for general strip geometries. In analyzing the expression of free energy, we shed some light on the meaning and the influence of the $x$--$y$ duality in topological string theory and its interconnection to GW and DT invariants as well as the 5D BPS index.</description>

      <title>Cluster Expansion and Decay of Correlations for Multidimensional Long-Range Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the cluster expansion for the multidimensional multiscaled contours defined by three of us. These contours are suitable for long-range Ising models with interaction $J_{xy}=J(|x-y|)= J/|x-y|^\alpha$, $J&gt;0$, and $\alpha&gt;d$. As an application of the convergence of the cluster expansion at low temperatures, we study the decay of the truncated two-point correlation functions, showing that the decay is algebraic with coefficient $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>On the Fermi-Dirac-type Fisher information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider kinetic models for Fermi-Dirac-like particles obeying the exclusion principle. A generalized notion of Fisher information, tailored to kinetic equations of Fermi-Dirac-Fokker-Planck type, is introduced via the associated entropy dissipation identity. We show that, subject to a suitable upper bound on the initial data, this quantity decreases along solutions of the Fermi-Dirac-Fokker-Planck equation, while monotonicity can fail in the absence of such a bound. We also discuss the time evolution of this Fermi-Dirac-type Fisher information for the heat equation and the linear-type Landau-Fermi-Dirac equation with Maxwell molecules.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy and Topological Mass from a Constant Magnetic Field and Boundary Conditions in Coupled Scalar Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of a uniform magnetic field and boundary conditions on vacuum energy and topological mass generation in a coupled scalar field theory. The system consists of a real scalar field, subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions, interacting via self- and cross-couplings with a gauge-coupled complex scalar field obeying mixed boundary conditions between two perfectly reflecting parallel plates. The magnetic field induces Landau quantization, leading to novel contributions. Employing zeta-function regularization within the effective potential formalism, we derive the renormalized effective potential up to second order in the coupling constants without imposing a vanishing magnetic field in the renormalization scheme. Our renormalization approach preserves magnetic contributions while properly removing divergences, enabling a consistent treatment of finite-size corrections, magnetic effects, and interaction terms. We compute the vacuum energy per unit area of the plates, analyze the emergence of a topological mass from boundary and magnetic contributions, and evaluate the first-order coupling-constant corrections at two-loop order. Detailed asymptotic analysis are presented for both weak- and strong-field regimes, revealing exponential suppression at high magnetic fields and nontrivial polynomial and logarithmic behavior in the weak-field limit.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the invariant $F_K^{\mathfrak{sl}_3}\in\mathbb{Z}[q,q^{-1}][[x,y]]$ for any positive braid knot $K$, whose existence was conjectured by Park, building on earlier work of Gukov--Manolescu. The main step in our work extends a result by the first author on the invariant associated to symmetric representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ to all irreducible representations. We conclude with a conjectural framework for constructing $F_K^{\mathfrak{sl}_N}$ for arbitrary $N$.</description>

      <title>Dirac monopole magnets in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically establish that non-Hermitian perturbations induce a topological transformation of point-like Dirac monopoles into extended monopole distributions, characterized by distinct charge configurations emergent from three distinct Berry connection forms. Using piecewise adiabatic evolution, we confirm the validity of these configurations through observations of complex geometric phases. Most critically, we find a quantitative relation $\Delta \phi_d = \Delta \phi_g$, which quantifies how cumulative minute energy differences (\(\Delta \phi_d\)) manifest as geometric phase shifts (\(\Delta \phi_g\)) uniquely in non-Hermitian systems. We further propose a scheme leveraging soliton dynamics in dissipative two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, enabling direct measurement of these topological signatures. These results establish a milestone for understanding Dirac monopole charge distributions and measuring complex geometric phases in non-Hermitian systems, with far-reaching implications for topological quantum computing and non-Hermitian photonics.</description>

      <title>Frequency-adaptive tensor neural networks for high-dimensional multi-scale problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks, TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs algorithm.</description>

      <title>Mixed convection and onset of instability due to asymmetric wall heat fluxes in a porous channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of convective instability onset in a horizontal porous channel is explored. The channel's impermeable walls are heated with asymmetric thermal conditions modelled through unequal, but uniform, wall heat fluxes. A stationary solution describing the mixed convection flow is obtained from the governing local balance equations. Then, the linear instability of this flow is analysed by formulating an eigenvalue problem with normal modes. The research specifically highlights the role of the flow rate regime, parametrised through the P\'eclet number, where the Rayleigh number and the heat flux asymmetry ratio are key to defining when instability occurs. The numerical solution of the stability eigenvalue problem is achieved by employing the shooting method. Analytical results are also obtained by employing large-wavelength asymptotic expansions. A numerical analysis is performed to discuss the neutral stability curves and the critical values of the Rayleigh number under different flow and asymmetry conditions.</description>

      <title>The Haar State values of monomials and a method to pick orthonormal bases on $O(U_q(3))$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the evaluation problem of the Haar state on the quantum group $O(U_q(n))$ ($n\ge 3$) which is a $q$-deformation of the Haar measure on the Lie group $U(n)$. The relation between the Haar state values of monomials on $O(U_q(n))$ is studied. On $O(U_q(3))$, the Haar state values of monomials are explicitly computed and these values are expressed as a finite summation of rational polynomials in $q$. As an application, we compute the Gram matrices of the irreducible co-representations of $O(U_q(3))$ which is essential to the method of constructing orthonormal bases on $O(U_q(3))$ proposed by Noumi, Yamada, and Mimachi. New connections between the Haar state values of monomials and basic hypergeometric multi-summations are found during our computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number. We derive an analog of Moser's Path Method for $p$-adic analytic manifolds and use it to prove a $p$-adic analog of Darboux's Theorem. Hence, in the $p$-adic category there are also no local symplectic invariants other than the dimension, as it happens in the real case: locally near any point, a $2n$-dimensional $p$-adic analytic symplectic manifold is symplectomorphic to $((\mathbb{Q}_p)^{2n},\sum_{i=1}^n\mathrm{d} x_1\wedge\mathrm{d} y_i)$. We also prove a $p$-adic version of Weinstein's generalization of Darboux's Theorem to neighborhoods of compact manifolds (Darboux-Weinstein's Theorem). Finally we apply explicitly Darboux's Theorem to the physical models by Ablowitz-Ladik and Salerno of the Discrete Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Robust Self-Testing of Multiqudit Supersinglet Slater States via Constant Number of Binary Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-testing is a powerful device-independent technique that enables one to deduce the forms of both the quantum state and the measurements involved in a physical experiment based solely on observed correlations. Although numerous schemes for self-testing multipartite entangled states have been proposed, they are typically difficult to implement experimentally, as their complexity increases significantly with the number of subsystems or the local dimension. In this work, we introduce the first self-testing scheme of a relevant class of multiqudit genuinely entangled states that exploits only a constant number of binary measurements per observer, which significantly reduces the experimental effort to implement the scheme. Specifically, it enables the self-testing of multipartite Slater (or supersinglet) states composed of $d$ qu\textit{d}its with odd $d$ using only four two-outcome measurements per observer. Moreover, we prove that our scheme is robust to noise and experimental imperfections. For systems of even local dimension $d$, we also provide an adapted version of the scheme that requires only $d$ binary measurements per observer.</description>

      <title>The Liouville model in the $L^1$ phase: coupling and extreme values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a strong coupling between the Liouville model and the Gaussian free field on the two dimensional torus in the $L^1$ phase $\beta \in (0, 8\pi)$, such that the difference of the two fields is a H\"older continuous function. The coupling originates from a Polchinski renormalisation group approach, which was previously used to prove analogous results for other Euclidean field theories in dimension two. Our main observations for the Liouville model are that the Polchinski flow has a definite sign and can be controlled well thanks to an FKG argument.
  The coupling allows to relate extreme values of the Liouville model and the Gaussian free field, and as an application we show that the global maximum of the Liouville field converges in distribution to a randomly shifted Gumbel distribtion.</description>

      <title>Trotter-based quantum algorithm for solving transport equations with exponentially fewer time-steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extent to which quantum computers can simulate physical phenomena and solve the partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern them remains a central open question. In this work, one of the most fundamental PDEs is addressed: the multidimensional transport equation with space- and time-dependent coefficients. We present a quantum numerical scheme based on three steps: quantum state preparation, evolution, and measurement of relevant observables. The evolution step combines a high-order centered finite difference with a time-splitting scheme based on product formula approximations, also known as Trotterization. Novel numerical analysis is introduced to bound the different sources of error and we prove that, for the product formula approximations, vector norm analysis guarantees similar accuracy with exponentially fewer time steps than operator-norm-based approaches, thereby significantly reducing the projected computational resources. We also present efficient quantum circuits and numerical simulations that confirm the predicted vector-norm scaling. We report results on real quantum hardware for the one-dimensional convection equation, and solve a non-linear ordinary differential equation via its associated Liouville equation, a particular case of transport equations. This work provides a practical framework for efficiently simulating transport phenomena on quantum computers, with potential applications in plasma physics, molecular gas dynamics and non-linear dynamical systems, including chaotic systems.</description>

Abstract: This work develops an analytic framework for the study of the $\zeta$-function associated with general sequences of complex numbers. We show that a contour integral representation, commonly used when studying spectral $\zeta$-functions associated with self-adjoint differential operators, can be extended far beyond its traditional setting. In contrast to representations utilizing integrals of $\theta$-functions, our method applies to arbitrary sequences of complex numbers with minimal assumptions. This leads to a set of universal identities, including sum rules and meromorphic properties, that hold across a broad class of $\zeta$-functions. Additionally, we discuss the connection to regularized (modified) Fredholm determinants of $p$-Schatten--von Neumann class operators. We illustrate the versatility of this representation by computing special values and residues of the $\zeta$-function for a variety of sequences of complex numbers, in particular, the zeros of Airy functions, parabolic cylinder functions, and confluent hypergeometric functions. Furthermore, we employ the adaptive Antoulas--Anderson (AAA) algorithm for rational interpolation in the study of the Airy $\zeta$-function.</description>

      <title>Tautological Tuning of the Kostant-Souriau Quantization Map with Differential Geometric Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.11480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For decades, mathematical physicists have searched for a coordinate independent quantization procedure to replace the ad hoc process of canonical quantization. This effort has largely coalesced into two distinct research programs: geometric quantization and deformation quantization. Though both of these programs can claim numerous successes, neither has found mainstream acceptance within the more experimentally minded quantum physics community, owing both to their mathematical complexities and their practical failures as empirical models. This paper introduces an alternative approach to coordinate-independent quantization called tautologically tuned quantization. This approach uses only differential geometric structures from symplectic and Riemannian geometry, especially the tautological one form and vector field (hence the name). In its focus on physically important functions, tautologically tuned quantization hews much more closely to the ad hoc approach of canonical quantization than either traditional geometric quantization or deformation quantization and thereby avoid some of the mathematical challenges faced by those methods. Given its focus on standard differential geometric structures, tautologically tuned quantization is also a better candidate than either traditional geometric or deformation quantization for application to covariant Hamiltonian field theories, and therefore may pave the way for the geometric quantization of classical fields.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Multidimensional Long-Range Random Field Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14150v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend a recent argument by Ding and Zhuang from nearest-neighbor to long-range interactions and prove the phase transition in a class of ferromagnetic random field Ising models. Our proof combines a generalization of Fr\"ohlich-Spencer contours to the multidimensional setting, proposed by two of us, with the coarse-graining procedure introduced by Fisher, Fr\"ohlich, and Spencer. Our result shows that the Ding-Zhuang strategy is also useful for interactions $J_{xy}=|x-y|^{- \alpha}$ when $\alpha &gt; d$ in dimension $d\geq 3$ if we have a suitable system of contours, yielding an alternative approach that does not use the Renormalization Group Method (RGM), since Bricmont and Kupiainen suggested that the RGM should also work on this generality. We can consider i.i.d. random fields with Gaussian or Bernoulli distributions.</description>

      <title>Parametric set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation: p-racks, solutions &amp; quantum algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of the parametric set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation is established from a purely algebraic point of view. The first step towards this objective is the introduction of certain generalizations of the familiar shelves and racks called parametric ($p$)-shelves and racks. These objects satisfy a parametric self-distributivity condition and lead to solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Novel, non-reversible solutions are obtained from p-shelf/rack solutions by a suitable parametric twist, whereas all reversible set-theoretic solutions are reduced to the identity map via a parametric twist. The universal algebras associated to both $p$-rack and generic parametric, set-theoretic solutions are next presented and the corresponding universal R-matrices are derived. The admissible universal Drinfel'd twist is constructed allowing the derivation of the general set-theoretic universal R-matrix. By introducing the concept of a parametric coproduct we prove the existence of a parametric co-associativity. We show that the parametric coproduct is an algebra homomorphism and the universal R-matrices satisfy intertwining relations with the algebra coproducts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let \( P \) and \( Q \) be the quantum-mechanical momentum and position operators on \( L^2(\R) \). Let $\zeta&gt;0.$ We provide estimates for the {\it Riesz means} $\varkappa(\lambda)$ associated with the system of eigenvalues of the operator
  \begin{align} H(\zeta) = \e^{-bP} + \e^{bP} + \e^{2\pi b Q} + \zeta \e^{-2\pi b Q} = U + U^{-1} + V + \zeta V^{-1}, \end{align} when $\lambda\rightarrow\infty.$ This operator arises in the quantisation of the local {\it del Pezzo Calabi-Yau threefold}, defined as the total space of the anti-canonical bundle over the {\it Hirzebruch surface} \( S = \mathbb{P}^{1} \times \mathbb{P}^{1} \). Our approach is motivated by the spectral analysis of $\varkappa(\lambda)$ in the framework developed by Laptev, Schimmer and Takhtajan in [13].</description>

      <title>Transforming antiunitary symmetries to a normal form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We look at explicit ways to bring one or two antiunitary symmetries into a standard form via unitary conjugation. We carefully reproduce Wigner's proof in two special cases, where the antiunitary operators square to $+I$, or to $-I$. Wigner's method is constructive and we show how leads to two algorithms to compute the needed unitaries in small examples.
  We then adapt these algorithms to deal with two such antiunitary matrices that commute up to a sign. This leads to a proof a finite-dimensional version of the well-known ten-fold way of topological physics. This will allow physicists to perform a change of basis on any finite-dimensional model in one of the Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes to a standardized version of that symmetry class in which time-reversal and and particle-hole symmetry are standard operations that can be implemented efficiently in standard numerical software. This will also make it easier to find formulas for some key isomorphisms between graded real $C^{*}$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Cohomotopy, Framed Links, and Abelian Anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a natural identification of cobordism classes of framed links with the fundamental group of the group-completed configuration space of points in the plane, by appeal to Okuyama's previously underappreciated interval configuration model for the latter. Under Segal's theorem, these classes are integers generated by the Hopf generator in the 2-cohomotopy of the 3-sphere, and we identify these knot-theoretically with the writhe sum of the linking and framing number of links. We observe that this link invariant is the properly regularized Wilson line observable of abelian Chern-Simons theory, and show, in consequence of the main theorem, that this arises equivalently as the expectation value of pure quantum states on the group algebra, under link sum, of cobordism classes of framed links. Observing that these quantum states regard framed links as worldlines of anyons in that they assign a fixed complex phase factor to each crossing (braiding) of strands, we close with an outlook on implications for the identification of anyonic solitons in 2D electron gases as exotic flux quantized in Cohomotopy instead of in ordinary cohomology.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of embedded eigenvalues of asymptotically periodic magnetic Schr\"odinger operators on a cylinder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the persistence of embedded eigenvalues for a class of magnetic Laplacians on an infinite cylindrical domain. The magnetic potential is assumed to be $C^2$ and asymptotically periodic along the unbounded direction, with an algebraic decay rate towards a periodic background potential. Under the condition that the embedded eigenvalue of the unperturbed operator lies away from the thresholds of the continuous spectrum, we show that the set of nearby potentials for which the embedded eigenvalue persists forms a smooth manifold of finite and even codimension. The proof employs tools from Floquet theory, exponential dichotomies, and Lyapunov--Schmidt reduction. Additionally, we give an example of a potential which satisfies the assumptions of our main theorem.</description>

      <title>Null infinity as a Killing horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12514v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetries are ubiquitous in modern physics. They not only allow for a more simplified description of physical systems but also, from a more fundamental perspective, can be seen as determining a theory itself. In the present paper, we propose a new definition of asymptotic symmetries that unifies and generalizes the usual notions of symmetry considered in asymptotically flat spacetimes and expanding universes with cosmological horizons. This is done by considering BMS-like symmetries for "asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons", or A(C)KHs, here defined as null hypersurfaces that are tangent to a vector field satisfying the (conformal) Killing equation in a limiting sense. The construction is theory-agnostic and extremely general, for it makes no use of the Einstein equations and can be applied to a wide range of scenarios with different dimensions or hypersurface cross sections. While we reproduce the results by Dappiaggi, Moretti, and Pinamonti in the case of asymptotic Killing horizons, the conformal generalization does not yield only the BMS group, but a larger group. The enlargement is due to the presence of "superdilations". We speculate on many implications and possible continuations of this work, including the exploration of gravitational memory effects beyond general relativity, understanding antipodal matching conditions at spatial infinity in terms of bifurcate horizons, and the absence of superrotations in de Sitter spacetime and Killing horizons.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss algebraic universality in the sense of P. Vogel for the simplest refined quantity, the Macdonald dimensions. The main known source of universal quantities is given by Chern-Simons theory. Refinement of Chern-Simons theory means introducing additional parameters. At the level of symmetric functions, the refinement is the transition from the Schur functions to the Macdonald polynomials. We consider the Macdonald polynomials associated with the simple Lie algebras, define Macdonald dimensions and dual Macdonald dimensions, and present a universal formula for them that unifies these quantities for algebras associated with simply laced root systems. We also consider mixed Macdonald dimensions that depend on two different root systems.</description>
