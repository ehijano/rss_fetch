      <title>Unlocking Quantum Control and Multi-Order Correlations via Terahertz Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (THz-2DCS) is transforming our ability to probe, visualize, and control quantum materials far from equilibrium. This emerging technique brings multi-dimensional resolution to the ultrafast dynamics of nonequilibrium phases of matter, enabling new capabilities demanding precise coherent control and measurement of many-body dynamics and multi-order correlations. By mapping complex excitations across time and frequency dimensions, THz-2DCS delivers coherence tomography of driven quantum matter, thus revealing hidden excitation pathways, measuring higher order nonlinear response functions, disentangling various quantum pathways, capturing collective modes on ultrafast timescales and at terahertz frequencies. These experimental features frequently remain obscured in traditional single particle measurements, ultrafast spectroscopy techniques, and equilibrium-based probes. This Review traces the early development of THz-2DCS and showcases significant recent progress in leveraging this technique to probe and manipulate quantum material properties, including nonequilibrium superconductivity, nonlinear magnonics, dynamical topological phases, and the detection of novel excitations and exotic collective modes with potential technological impact. Looking forward, we identify critical opportunities in advancing THz-2DCS instrumentation and experimental strategies that are shaping future applications in THz optoelectronics, quantum information processing, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Ternary Zirconium Telluride Zr6RuTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zr6CoAl2-type Zr6RuTe2 is found to show bulk superconductivity below the superconducting transition temperature Tc = 1.1 K, according to the electrical resistivity, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements using synthesized polycrystalline samples. This Tc exceeds that of Zr6MTe2 compounds in which M is other transition metals, indicating that M = Ru is favorable for superconductivity in Zr6CoAl2-type Zr6MX2.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of electron interactions in Hubbard models of unconventional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use symmetry arguments to show that the matrix elements of electron-electron interaction on a lattice reach extrema in states composed of wavevectors near high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. The mechanism is illustrated by minimal models of cuprates and Fe-based superconductors, where this dependence originates from the wavevector-dependent orbital composition of wavefunctions. We discuss how these dependences can facilitate finite-momentum pairing. Our results provide symmetry-based guidance for the search for new high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau theory for unconventional surface superconductivity in PtBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental evidence suggests the presence of an unconventional, nodal surface-superconducting state in trigonal PtBi\textsubscript{2}. We construct a Ginzburg--Landau theory for the three superconducting order parameters, which correspond to the three irreducible representations of the point group $C_{3v}$. The irreducible representations $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the most likely. We develop a systematic method to determine the symmetry-allowed terms and apply it to derive all terms up to fourth order in the three order parameters. The Ginzburg--Landau functional also includes coupling to the magnetic field. The functional is employed to determine the effect of an applied uniform magnetic field on the nodal structure for $A_1$ and $A_2$ pairing. The results facilitate clear-cut experimental differentiation between these symmetries. We also predict field-induced pair-density waves.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Induced Superconductivity in Bilayer Octagraphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the energy bands, magnetism, and superconductivity of bilayer octagraphene with A-A stacking under a perpendicular electric field. A tight-binding model is used to analyze the band structure of the system. The doubling of the unit cell results in each band of the single layer splitting into two. We find that applying a perpendicular electric field increases the band splitting. As the electric field strength increases, the nesting of the Fermi Surface(FS) weakens, eventually disrupting the antiferromagnetic order and bilayer octagraphene exhibits superconductivity. Spin fluctuations can induce unconventional superconductivity with s+--wave pairing. Applying a perpendicular electric field to bilayer octagraphene parent weakens the nesting of the FS, ultimately killing the spin-density-wave (SDW) ordered state and transitioning it into the superconducting state, whichworks as a doping effect. We use the random-phase approximation approach to obtain the pairing eigenvalues and pairing symmetries of the perpendicular electric field-tuned bilayer octagraphene in the weak coupling limit. By tuning the strength of the perpendicular electric field, the critical interaction strength for SDW order can be modified, which in turn may promote the emergence of unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall Andreev Conversion in Graphene Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Andreev conversion in clean nanostructures containing an interface between graphene in the quantum Hall (QH) state and a superconductor, focusing on the lowest Landau level. First, several graphene nanostructures formed from zigzag edges with sharp corners are considered using a tight-binding model. We find the scattering state for an electron impinging on the interface from the upstream QH edge state, together with the probability of it exiting as a hole in the downstream QH edge state (Andreev conversion). From these results, we deduce the behavior for edges at an arbitrary angle and for rounded corners. A key issue is whether the graphene-superconductor interface is fully transparent or only partially transparent. For full transparency, we recover previous results. In contrast, interfaces with partial but substantial transparency (well away from the tunneling limit) behave very differently: (i) the hybrid electron-hole interfacial modes are not valley degenerate and (ii) intervalley scattering can occur at the corners, even when rounded. As a result, interference between the two hybrid modes can occur, even in the absence of disorder. Finally, we compare the sensitivity of Andreev conversion to interface transparency in the QH regime to that in the absence of a magnetic field. While the zero-field result closely follows the classic Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk relation, Andreev conversion in the QH regime is considerably more robust.</description>

      <title>From pure to mixed: Altermagnets as intrinsic symmetry-breaking indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the presence of altermagnetism on physical observables in the presence of explicit or spontaneous symmetry-breaking fields. We focus on unconventional superconductivity as a potential source of spontaneous symmetry-breaking fields and derive the symmetry considerations for the transmutation of altermagnets from pure to mixed, which can give rise to unusual phenomena. Based on this analysis, we put forward scenarios that could explain the apparent onset of time-reversal symmetry breaking at the superconducting critical temperature in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, and the hidden magnetic phase and magnetic memory in 4Hb-TaS$_2$.</description>
