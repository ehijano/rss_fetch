      <title>Statisticians Training STEM Educators in Statistics Methods and Pedagogy: A Case Study of Instructor Training in Bayesian Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Educating the next generation of scientists in statistical methodology is an important task. Educating their instructors in statistical content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge is as important and provides an indirect impact of students' learning. Statisticians are in a place to lead train-the-trainer (TTT) programs in different methods. We present our instructor training program in Bayesian methods as an effective case study of a TTT model. In addition to describing the details of the structure of our training program, we share our experience in designing and implementing our program including the challenges we face, the opportunities created, and our recommendations for TTT programs led by statisticians.</description>

      <title>Bhirkuti's Test of Bias Acceptance (BTBA): Examining Its Performance in Psychometric Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Bhirkuti's Test of Bias Acceptance (BTBA), a standardized framework for evaluating estimator bias in Monte Carlo simulation studies. BTBA uses a simulation-specific standardized score (Z*) and a decision matrix to assess bias acceptability based on the mean and variance of Z* distributions. Under ideal conditions, Z* values should approximate a standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) with a mean near zero and variance near one in the context of simulation research. Systematic deviations from these patterns such as shifted means or inflated variances indicate bias or estimator instability in simulation-based research. BTBA visualizes these patterns using ridgeline density plots, which reveal distributional features such as central tendency, spread, skewness, and outliers. Demonstrated in a latent growth modeling context, BTBA offers a reproducible and interpretable method for diagnosing bias across varying simulation conditions. By addressing key limitations of traditional relative bias (RB) metrics, BTBA provides a theoretically grounded, distribution-aware, transparent, and replicable alternative for evaluating estimator quality, particularly in psychometric modeling, structural equation modeling, and missing data research. Through this framework, we aim to enhance methodological decision-making by integrating statistical reasoning with comprehensive visualization techniques.</description>
