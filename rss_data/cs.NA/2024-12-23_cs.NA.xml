      <title>Local Divergence-Free Immersed Finite Element-Difference Method Using Composite B-Splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the class of immersed boundary (IB) methods, the choice of the delta function plays a crucial role in transferring information between fluid and solid domains. Most prior work has used isotropic kernels that do not preserve the divergence-free condition of the velocity field, leading to loss of incompressibility of the solid when interpolating velocity to Lagrangian markers. To address this issue, in simulations involving large deformations of incompressible hyperelastic structures immersed in fluid, researchers often use stabilization approaches such as adding a volumetric energy term. Composite B-spline (CBS) kernels offer an alternative by maintaining the discrete divergence-free property. This work evaluates CBS kernels in terms of volume conservation and accuracy, comparing them with isotropic kernel functions using a construction introduced by Peskin (IB kernels) and B-spline (BS) kernels. Benchmark tests include pressure-loaded and shear-dominated flows, such as an elastic band under pressure loads, a pressurized membrane, a compressed block, Cook's membrane, and a slanted channel flow. Additionally, we validate our methodology using a complex fluid-structure interaction model of bioprosthetic heart valve dynamics. Results demonstrate that CBS kernels achieve superior volume conservation compared to isotropic kernels, eliminating the need for stabilization techniques. Further, CBS kernels converge on coarser fluid grids, while IB and BS kernels need finer grids for comparable accuracy. Unlike IB and BS kernels, which perform better with larger mesh ratios, CBS kernels improve with smaller mesh ratios. Wider kernels provide more accurate results across all methods, but CBS kernels are less sensitive to grid spacing variations than isotropic kernels.</description>

      <title>Analysis of nonquadratic energy-conservative schemes for KdV type-equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical schemes that conserve invariants have demonstrated superior performance in various contexts, and several unified methods have been developed for constructing such schemes. However, the mathematical properties of these schemes remain poorly understood, except in norm-preserving cases.
  This study introduces a novel analytical framework applicable to general energy-preserving schemes. The proposed framework is applied to Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)-type equations, establishing global existence and convergence estimates for the numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>Random Batch Method with Momentum Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Random Batch Method (RBM) is an effective technique to reduce the computational complexity when solving certain stochastic differential problems (SDEs) involving interacting particles. It can transform the computational complexity from O(N^2) to O(N), where N represents the number of particles. However, the traditional RBM can only be effectively applied to interacting particle systems with relatively smooth kernel functions to achieve satisfactory results. To address the issue of non-convergence of the RBM in particle interaction systems with significant singularities, we propose some enhanced methods to make the modified algorithm more applicable. The idea for improvement primarily revolves around a momentum-like correction, and we refer to the enhanced algorithm as the Random Batch Method with Momentum Correction ( RBM-M). We provide a theoretical proof to control the error of the algorithm, which ensures that under ideal conditions it has a smaller error than the original algorithm. Finally, numerical experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the RBM-M algorithm.</description>

      <title>Robust path following for autonomous vehicles with spatial PH quintic splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distinctive feature of a polynomial parametric speed let polynomial Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curves be attractive for the design of accurate and efficient application algorithms. We propose a robust path following scheme for the construction of smooth spatial motions by exploiting PH spline curves. In order to cover a general configuration setting, we present a guidance law which is suitable both for fully-actuated and (more common) under-actuated vehicles, which cannot control all the degrees of freedom. The robustness of the guidance law is enhanced by also taking into account the influence of wind or currents into the equations of motion. A selection of numerical experiments validates the effectiveness of the control strategy when $C^1$ spatial PH quintic interpolants are suitably considered for both kinematic and dynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a Hyperbolic Thermodynamically Compatible Finite Volume scheme for the Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convergence of a novel family of thermodynamically compatible schemes for hyperbolic systems (HTC schemes) in the framework of dissipative weak solutions, applied to the Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics. Two key novelties of our method are i) entropy is treated as one of the main field quantities and ii) the total energy conservation is a consequence of compatible discretization and application of the Abgrall flux.</description>

      <title>A non-recursive Schur-Decomposition Algorithm for $N$-Dimensional Matrix Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an iterative method, based on the Bartels-Stewart algorithm to solve $N$-dimensional matrix equations, that relies on the Schur decomposition of the matrices involved. We remark that, unlike other possible implementations of that algorithm, ours avoids recursivity, and makes an efficient use of the available computational resources, which enables considering arbitrarily large problems, up to the size of the available memory. In this respect, we have successfully solved matrix equations in up to $N = 29$ dimensions.
  We explain carefully all the steps, and calculate accurately the computational cost required. Furthermore, in order to ease the understanding, we offer both pseudocodes and full Matlab codes, and special emphasis is put on making the implementation of the method completely independent from the number of dimensions. As an important application, the method allows to compute the solution of linear $N$-dimensional systems of ODEs of constant coefficients at any time $t$, and, hence, of evolutionary PDEs, after discretizing the spatial derivatives by means of matrices. In this regard, we are able to compute with great accuracy the solution of an advection-diffusion equation on $\mathbb R^N$.</description>

      <title>Local analysis of iterative reconstruction from discrete generalized Radon transform data in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local reconstruction analysis (LRA) is a powerful and flexible technique to study images reconstructed from discrete generalized Radon transform (GRT) data, $g=\mathcal R f$. The main idea of LRA is to obtain a simple formula to accurately approximate an image, $f_\epsilon(x)$, reconstructed from discrete data $g(y_j)$ in an $\epsilon$-neighborhood of a point, $x_0$. The points $y_j$ lie on a grid with step size of order $\epsilon$ in each direction. In this paper we study an iterative reconstruction algorithm, which consists of minimizing a quadratic cost functional. The cost functional is the sum of a data fidelity term and a Tikhonov regularization term. The function $f$ to be reconstructed has a jump discontinuity across a smooth surface $\mathcal S$. Fix a point $x_0\in\mathcal S$ and any $A&gt;0$. The main result of the paper is the computation of the limit $\Delta F_0(\check x;x_0):=\lim_{\epsilon\to0}(f_\epsilon(x_0+\epsilon\check x)-f_\epsilon(x_0))$, where $f_\epsilon$ is the solution to the minimization problem and $|\check x|\le A$. A numerical experiment with a circular GRT demonstrates that $\Delta F_0(\check x;x_0)$ accurately approximates the actual reconstruction obtained by the cost functional minimization.</description>

      <title>A bound-preserving Runge--Kutta discontinuous Galerkin method with compact stencils for hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop bound-preserving techniques for the Runge--Kutta (RK) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with compact stencils (cRKDG method) for hyperbolic conservation laws. The cRKDG method was recently introduced in [Q. Chen, Z. Sun, and Y. Xing, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 46: A1327--A1351, 2024]. It enhances the compactness of the standard RKDG method, resulting in reduced data communication, simplified boundary treatments, and improved suitability for local time marching. This work improves the robustness of the cRKDG method by enforcing desirable physical bounds while preserving its compactness, local conservation, and high-order accuracy. Our method is extended from the seminal work of [X. Zhang and C.-W. Shu, J. Comput. Phys., 229: 3091--3120, 2010]. We prove that the cell average of the cRKDG method at each RK stage preserves the physical bounds by expressing it as a convex combination of three types of forward-Euler solutions. A scaling limiter is then applied after each RK stage to enforce pointwise bounds. Additionally, we explore RK methods with less restrictive time step sizes. Because the cRKDG method does not rely on strong-stability-preserving RK time discretization, it avoids its order barriers, allowing us to construct a four-stage, fourth-order bound-preserving cRKDG method. Numerical tests on challenging benchmarks are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Robust Blockwise Random Pivoting: Fast and Accurate Adaptive Interpolative Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16002v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interpolative decomposition (ID) aims to construct a low-rank approximation formed by a basis consisting of row/column skeletons in the original matrix and a corresponding interpolation matrix. This work explores fast and accurate ID algorithms from comprehensive perspectives for empirical performance, including accuracy in both skeleton selection and interpolation matrix construction, efficiency in terms of asymptotic complexity and hardware efficiency, as well as rank adaptiveness. While many algorithms have been developed to optimize some of these aspects, practical ID algorithms proficient in all aspects remain absent. To fill in the gap, we introduce robust blockwise random pivoting (RBRP) that is asymptotically fast, hardware-efficient, and rank-adaptive, providing accurate skeletons and interpolation matrices comparable to the best existing ID algorithms in practice. Through extensive numerical experiments on various synthetic and natural datasets, we demonstrate the appealing empirical performance of RBRP from the aforementioned perspectives, as well as the robustness of RBRP to adversarial inputs.</description>

      <title>Damped energy-norm a posteriori error estimates for fully discrete approximations of the wave equation using C2-reconstructions with the leapfrog scheme</title>

Abstract: We derive a posteriori error estimates for the the scalar wave equation discretized in space by continuous finite elements and in time by the explicit leapfrog scheme. Our analysis combines the idea of invoking extra time-regularity for the right-hand side, as previously introduced in the space semi-discrete setting, with a novel, piecewise quartic, globally twice-differentiable time-reconstruction of the fully discrete solution. Our main results show that the proposed estimator is reliable and efficient in a damped energy norm. These properties are illustrated in a series of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning correction equations in Jacobi--Davidson type methods for computing partial singular value decompositions of large matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a Jacobi--Davidson (JD) type method for singular value decomposition (SVD) problems, called JDSVD, a large symmetric and generally indefinite correction equation is solved iteratively at each outer iteration, which constitutes the inner iterations and dominates the overall efficiency of JDSVD. In this paper, a convergence analysis is made on the minimal residual (MINRES) method for the correction equation. Motivated by the results obtained, at each outer iteration a new correction equation is derived that extracts useful information from current subspaces to construct effective preconditioners for the correction equation and is proven to retain the same convergence of outer iterations of JDSVD.The resulting method is called inner preconditioned JDSVD (IPJDSVD) method; it is also a new JDSVD method, and any viable preconditioner for the correction equations in JDSVD is straightforwardly applicable to those in IPJDSVD. Convergence results show that MINRES for the new correction equation can converge much faster when there is a cluster of singular values closest to a given target. A new thick-restart IPJDSVD algorithm with deflation and purgation is proposed that simultaneously accelerates the outer and inner convergence of the standard thick-restart JDSVD and computes several singular triplets. Numerical experiments justify the theory and illustrate the considerable superiority of IPJDSVD to JDSVD, and demonstrate that a similar two-stage IPJDSVD algorithm substantially outperforms the most advanced PRIMME\_SVDS software nowadays for computing the smallest singular triplets.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order modeling of neutron transport separated in axial and radial space by Proper Generalized Decomposition with applications to nuclear reactor physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we demonstrate the novel use of Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) to separate the axial and, optionally, polar dimensions of neutron transport. Doing so, the resulting Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) can exploit the fact that nuclear reactors tend to be tall, but geometrically simple, in the axial direction $z$, and so the 3D neutron flux distribution often admits a low-rank "2D/1D" approximation. Through PGD, this approximation is computed by alternately solving 2D and 1D sub-models, like in existing 2D/1D models of reactor physics. However, the present methodology is more general in that the decomposition is arbitrary-rank, rather than rank-one, and no simplifying approximations of the transverse leakage are made. To begin, we derive two original models: that of axial PGD -- which separates only $z$ and the sign of the polar angle $\alpha\in\{-1,+1\}$ -- and axial-polar PGD -- which separates both $z$ and the full polar angle $\mu$ from the radial domain. Additionally, we grant that the energy dependence $E$ may be ascribed to either radial or axial modes, or both, bringing the total number of candidate 2D/1D ROMs to six. To assess performance, these PGD ROMs are applied to two few-group benchmarks characteristic of Light Water Reactors. Therein, we find both the axial and axial-polar ROMs are convergent and that the latter are often more economical than the former. Ultimately, given the popularity of 2D/1D methods in reactor physics, we expect a PGD ROM which achieves a similar effect, but perhaps with superior accuracy, a quicker runtime, and/or broader applicability, would be eminently useful, especially for full-core problems.</description>

      <title>A variational front-tracking method for multiphase flow with triple junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and analyze a variational front-tracking method for a sharp-interface model of multiphase flow. The fluid interfaces between different phases are represented by curve networks in two space dimensions (2d) or surface clusters in three space dimensions (3d) with triple junctions where three interfaces meet, and boundary points/lines where an interface meets a fixed planar boundary. The model is described by the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations in the bulk domains, with classical interface conditions on the fluid interfaces, and appropriate boundary conditions at the triple junctions and boundary points/lines. We propose a weak formulation for the model, which combines a parametric formulation for the evolving interfaces and an Eulerian formulation for the bulk equations. We employ an unfitted discretization of the coupled formulation to obtain a fully discrete finite element method, where the existence and uniqueness of solutions can be shown under weak assumptions. The constructed method admits an unconditional stability result in terms of the discrete energy. Furthermore, we adapt the introduced method so that an exact volume preservation for each phase can be achieved for the discrete solutions. Numerical examples for three-phase flow and four-phase flow are presented to show the robustness and accuracy of the introduced methods.</description>

Abstract: The evolution of floating-point computation has been shaped by algorithmic advancements, architectural innovations, and the increasing computational demands of modern technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC). This paper examines the historical progression of floating-point computation in scientific applications and contextualizes recent trends driven by AI, particularly the adoption of reduced-precision floating-point types. The challenges posed by these trends, including the trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and precision, are discussed, as are innovations in mixed-precision computing and emulation algorithms that offer solutions to these challenges. This paper also explores architectural shifts, including the role of specialized and general-purpose hardware, and how these trends will influence future advancements in scientific computing, energy efficiency, and system design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we explore the fidelity of numerical approximations to continuous spectra of hyperbolic partial differential equation systems with variable coefficients. We are particularly interested in the ability of discrete methods to accurately discover sources of physical instabilities. By focusing on the perturbed equations that arise in linearized problems, we apply high-order accurate summation-by-parts finite difference operators, with weak enforcement of boundary conditions through the simultaneous-approximation-term technique, which leads to a provably stable numerical discretization with formal order of accuracy given by p = 2, 3, 4 and 5. We derive analytic solutions using Laplace transform methods, which provide important ground truth for ensuring numerical convergence at the correct theoretical rate. We find that the continuous spectrum is better captured with mesh refinement, although dissipative strict stability (where the growth rate of the discrete problem is bounded above by the continuous) is not obtained. We also find that sole reliance on mesh refinement can be a problematic means for determining physical growth rates as some eigenvalues emerge (and persist with mesh refinement) based on spatial order of accuracy but are non-physical. We suggest that numerical methods be used to approximate discrete spectra when numerical stability is guaranteed and convergence of the discrete spectra is evident with both mesh refinement and increasing order of accuracy.</description>

      <title>NIPG-DG schemes for transformed master equations modeling open quantum systems</title>

Abstract: This work presents a numerical analysis of a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for a transformed master equation modeling an open quantum system: a quantum sub-system interacting with a noisy environment. It is shown that the presented transformed master equation has a reduced computational cost in comparison to a Wigner-Fokker-Planck model of the same system for the general case of non-harmonic potentials via DG schemes. Specifics of a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) numerical scheme adequate for the system of convection-diffusion equations obtained for our Lindblad master equation in position basis are presented. This lets us solve computationally the transformed system of interest modeling our open quantum system problem. The benchmark case of a harmonic potential is then presented, for which the numerical results are compared against the analytical steady-state solution of this problem. Two non-harmonic cases are then presented: the linear and quartic potentials are modeled via our DG framework, for which we show our numerical results.</description>

      <title>Residual Multi-Fidelity Neural Network Computing</title>

Abstract: In this work, we consider the general problem of constructing a neural network surrogate model using multi-fidelity information. Motivated by error-complexity estimates for ReLU neural networks, we formulate the correlation between an inexpensive low-fidelity model and an expensive high-fidelity model as a possibly non-linear residual function. This function defines a mapping between 1) the shared input space of the models along with the low-fidelity model output, and 2) the discrepancy between the outputs of the two models. The computational framework proceeds by training two neural networks to work in concert. The first network learns the residual function on a small set of high- and low-fidelity data. Once trained, this network is used to generate additional synthetic high-fidelity data, which is used in the training of the second network. The trained second network then acts as our surrogate for the high-fidelity quantity of interest. We present four numerical examples to demonstrate the power of the proposed framework, showing that significant savings in computational cost may be achieved when the output predictions are desired to be accurate within small tolerances.</description>

      <title>Latent Neural Operator for Solving Forward and Inverse PDE Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03923v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators effectively solve PDE problems from data without knowing the explicit equations, which learn the map from the input sequences of observed samples to the predicted values. Most existing works build the model in the original geometric space, leading to high computational costs when the number of sample points is large. We present the Latent Neural Operator (LNO) solving PDEs in the latent space. In particular, we first propose Physics-Cross-Attention (PhCA) transforming representation from the geometric space to the latent space, then learn the operator in the latent space, and finally recover the real-world geometric space via the inverse PhCA map. Our model retains flexibility that can decode values in any position not limited to locations defined in the training set, and therefore can naturally perform interpolation and extrapolation tasks particularly useful for inverse problems. Moreover, the proposed LNO improves both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments show that LNO reduces the GPU memory by 50%, speeds up training 1.8 times, and reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on four out of six benchmarks for forward problems and a benchmark for inverse problem.

      <title>Martingale deep learning for very high dimensional quasi-linear partial differential equations and stochastic optimal controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14395v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a highly parallel and derivative-free martingale neural network learning method is proposed to solve Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations arising from stochastic optimal control problems (SOCPs), as well as general quasilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). In both cases, the PDEs are reformulated into a martingale formulation such that loss functions will not require the computation of the gradient or Hessian matrix of the PDE solution, while its implementation can be parallelized in both time and spatial domains. Moreover, the martingale conditions for the PDEs are enforced using a Galerkin method in conjunction with adversarial learning techniques, eliminating the need for direct computation of the conditional expectations associated with the martingale property. For SOCPs, a derivative-free implementation of the maximum principle for optimal controls is also introduced. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, which is capable of solving HJB and quasilinear parabolic PDEs accurately in dimensions as high as 10,000.</description>

      <title>Fast and Robust Hexahedral Mesh Optimization via Augmented Lagrangian, L-BFGS, and Line Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new software package, ``HexOpt,'' for improving the quality of all-hexahedral (all-hex) meshes by maximizing the minimum mixed scaled Jacobian-Jacobian energy functional, and projecting the surface points of the all-hex meshes onto the input triangular mesh. The proposed HexOpt method takes as input a surface triangular mesh and a volumetric all-hex mesh. A constrained optimization problem is formulated to improve mesh quality using a novel function that combines Jacobian and scaled Jacobian metrics which are rectified and scaled to quadratic measures, while preserving the surface geometry. This optimization problem is solved using the augmented Lagrangian (AL) method, where the Lagrangian terms enforce the constraint that surface points must remain on the triangular mesh. Specifically, corner points stay exactly at the corner, edge points are confined to the edges, and face points are free to move across the surface. To take the advantage of the Quasi-Newton method while tackling the high-dimensional variable problem, the Limited-Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm is employed. The step size for each iteration is determined by the Armijo line search. Coupled with smart Laplacian smoothing, HexOpt has demonstrated robustness and efficiency, successfully applying to 3D models and hex meshes generated by different methods without requiring any manual intervention or parameter adjustment.</description>

      <title>Exact simulation of the first-passage time of SDEs to time-dependent thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first-passage time (FPT) is a fundamental concept in stochastic processes, representing the time it takes for a process to reach a specified threshold for the first time. Often, considering a time-dependent threshold is essential for accurately modeling stochastic processes, as it provides a more accurate and adaptable framework. In this paper, we extend an existing Exact simulation method developed for constant thresholds to handle time-dependent thresholds. Our proposed approach utilizes the FPT of Brownian motion and accepts it for the FPT of a given process with some probability, which is determined using Girsanov's transformation. This method eliminates the need to simulate entire paths over specific time intervals, avoids time-discretization errors, and directly simulates the first-passage time. We present results demonstrating the method's effectiveness, including the extension to time-dependent thresholds, an analysis of its time complexity, comparisons with existing methods through numerical examples, and its application to predicting spike times in a neuron.</description>
