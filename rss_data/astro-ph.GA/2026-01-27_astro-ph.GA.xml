      <title>The Impact of Star Formation Histories on the Inner Dark Matter Density Slopes of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We aim to investigate the connection between star formation histories (SFHs) and the inner dark matter density profiles of simulated galaxies. In particular, we test whether the burstiness and temporal distribution of star formation influence the formation of cored versus cuspy dark matter profiles. Methods. We homogeneously analysed simulated galaxies from the NIHAO and FIRE-2 projects. For each galaxy, we derived dark matter density profiles and measured the logarithmic slope in the inner region of the dark matter halo (1-2% of R$_{\rm vir}$). To characterise star formation burstiness, we introduced a criterion based on comparing the star formation rate (SFR) averaged over two distinct timescales. We further quantified the duration of SFHs by computing $M_{\star, \rm post}$ / $M_{\star, \rm pre}$, the ratio of stellar mass formed after versus before the epoch of reionisation at redshift z $\sim$ 6.5. Results. Homogeneous analysis reveals that inner slope versus stellar-to-halo mass ratio trends for NIHAO and FIRE-2 galaxies are in much better agreement than reported in previous works. The burstiness and duration of the SFH explain the scatter in the inner slope versus stellar-to-halo mass ratio relation, revealing that galaxies with above average burstiness and more extended SFHs are more efficient at developing cored dark matter profiles. In contrast, galaxies with smoother SFHs and earlier stellar mass assembly tend to maintain cuspier dark matter profiles. We present an analytic expression that improves predictions for the inner slope using the parameter $M_{\star \rm,post}$ / $M_{\star \rm,pre}$, which reduces the mean squared error in both simulation suites relative to previous formulations based solely on the stellar-to-halo mass ratio.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced Isothermal Jeans Approach to Constraining Dark Matter Self-Interactions from Galactic Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an improved semi-analytical model to predict density profiles of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos and apply it to constrain the self-scattering cross section using SPARC galaxy rotation curves. Building on the isothermal Jeans approach, our model incorporates (i) velocity-dependent cross sections, (ii) an empirical treatment of core collapse, and (iii) enhanced robustness for identifying solutions. These advances allow us to fit a large sample of galaxies, including systems with baryon-dominated centers often excluded in earlier studies. We find that roughly 1/6 of galaxies admit both a core-growth and a core-collapse solution, while the rest favor a unique evolutionary state. Joint constraints across the sample reveal clear velocity dependence: the allowed parameter space forms an L-shaped degeneracy, where both nearly constant, low cross sections ($\sigma_0\sim2\,{\rm cm}^2$/g, $\omega\gtrsim500\,$km/s) and strongly velocity-dependent models ($\sigma_0\sim100\,{\rm cm}^2$/g, $\omega\sim60\,$km/s) are viable. Adopting the core-growth interpretation yields best-fit values $\sigma_0\simeq5\,{\rm cm}^2$/g and $\omega\simeq250\,$km/s. Our constraints are remarkably consistent with previous results derived from a variety of independent probes. Compared to cold dark matter (CDM) models, SIDM outperforms simple adiabatic-contraction profiles and rivals empirical feedback-based CDM profiles, yet shows no correlation with stellar-to-halo mass ratio, a proxy for feedback strength, offering a distinct explanation for dwarf galaxy diversity. Moreover, SIDM does not affect galaxy-halo scaling relations significantly and makes concentration systematically lower. Our results highlight SIDM as a compelling framework for small-scale structure, while future low-mass kinematic data will be crucial for breaking degeneracies in velocity-dependent cross-section models.</description>

      <title>The mass distribution in and around the Local Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our Galaxy, Andromeda and their companion dwarf galaxies form the Local Group. Most of the mass in and around it is believed to be dark matter rather than gas or stars, so its distribution must be inferred from the effect of gravity on the motion of visible objects. Modelling efforts have long struggled to reproduce the quiet Hubble flow around the Local Group, as they require unrealistically little mass beyond the haloes of the two main galaxies. Here we revisit this using $\Lambda$CDM simulations of Local Group analogues with initial conditions constrained to match the observed dynamics of the two main haloes and the surrounding flow. The observations are reconcilable within $\Lambda$CDM, but only if mass is strongly concentrated in a plane out to 10 Mpc, with the surface density rising away from the Local Group and with deep voids above and below. This configuration, dynamically inferred, mirrors known structures in the nearby galaxy distribution. The resulting Hubble flow is quiet yet strongly anisotropic, a fact obscured by the paucity of tracers at high supergalactic latitude. This flattened geometry reconciles the dynamical mass estimates of the Local Group with the surrounding velocity field, thus demonstrating full consistency within the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>The multiple coherence scales of C IV at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial and kinematic structure of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) remains poorly constrained observationally. In this article we compute the clustering of CIV absorption systems at cosmic noon using quasar pairs. We analyze VLT/UVES and Keck/HIRES high-resolution spectra (R = 45000) of a sample of 8 projected and 4 lensed quasar pairs that probe transverse separations, $\Delta r$, from sub-kpc to a few Mpc, over the redshift range 1.6 &lt; z &lt; 3.3. We detect and fit Voigt profiles to a total of 141 CIV systems, corresponding to 620 velocity components across all quasar lines-of-sight. We compute the two-point correlation function of CIV, $\xi(\Delta v, \Delta r)$, where $\Delta v$ is the velocity difference between components across all available scales. We find a strong dependence of $\xi(\Delta r)$ with $\Delta r$ at all velocities. $\xi(\Delta r)$ reaches a sharp peak at the smallest scales analyzed here, $\Delta r\approx 0.1$ kpc, decreases steadily up to $\Delta r\approx 5$ kpc and remains flat up to $\Delta r\approx 500$ kpc, where it begins to decrease again. By fitting power-laws to the projected transverse correlation function $\Xi(\Delta r)$, we infer two coherence lengths: $r_1 = 654^{+100}_{-87}$ kpc, which we interpret as a representative size for the CIV enriched regions at $z\approx 2$, and $r_2 = 4.70^{+1.60}_{-1.19}$ kpc for the individual CIV-bearing "clouds". Projecting instead in $\Delta r$, we find consistent amplitudes of $\xi(\Delta v)$ with previous work using quasars and extended background sources. Our results suggest that CIV may be a good tracer of not only the small, internal structure of the circumgalactic medium, but also of the way in which galaxies cluster at cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Direct Abundance Maps and Radial Metallicity Gradients of two Galaxies at z~4-5 in the GARDEN Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate galaxies in the GARDEN (Galaxies at All Redshifts Deciphered and Explained with the NIRSpec MSA) survey that show auroral emission lines, enabling spatially resolved measurements of electron temperature and direct oxygen abundances. Two galaxies have spectra suitable for this analysis: CANDELS 8005 at z=3.794 and CANDELS 7986 at z=4.702. For both, we measure auroral and key nebular emission-line fluxes across their full extent, allowing direct-method oxygen abundance determinations in individual spaxels. These observations demonstrate the viability of deep JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy for spatially resolved chemical analyses at high redshift, aided by weak nebular continua and low interstellar extinction. We derive global direct abundances of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.008 (+0.025, -0.027) for CANDELS 8005 and 7.89 (+0.027, -0.028) for CANDELS 7986. Emission-line diagnostics indicate neither galaxy hosts an active galactic nucleus. A first-order kinematic analysis suggests a potential merger in CANDELS 8005. The direct abundances agree with strong-line estimates from our data and recent high-redshift calibrations. We build emission line, radial velocity, strong-line abundance, electron temperature, and direct abundance maps for both galaxies. From these maps, we measure linear radial metallicity gradients of -0.111 (+0.026, -0.025) dex/kpc for CANDELS 8005 (statistically significant) and -0.093 +/- 0.088 dex/kpc for CANDELS 7986, where the large uncertainties limit significance. These results represent the first detection of a radial metallicity gradient from direct-method abundances with measurements taken in galaxies at z&gt;0, supporting inside-out galaxy growth with feedback-regulated chemical enrichment.</description>

      <title>Galactic Dust Polarization in Turbulent Multiphase ISM: On the Origin of the $EE/BB$ Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized thermal emission from Galactic dust is the dominant foreground for CMB polarization measurements at high frequencies, with its statistical properties set by the interplay between turbulence and magnetic fields in the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM). Variations in turbulence regime and density-magnetic-field alignment across the warm (WNM), unstable (UNM), and cold (CNM) neutral media should imprint distinct signatures on the power spectra and $EE/BB$ power ratio, yet the relative phase contributions remain poorly constrained. Using high-resolution 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a turbulent multiphase ISM coupled with synthetic dust polarization maps, we quantify phase-dependent turbulence, anisotropy, and alignment properties. We find that the trans-Alfv\'enic and transonic WNM and UNM are strongly anisotropic, exhibiting tight alignment of density and velocity structures with the local magnetic field. In contrast, the super-Alfv\'enic and supersonic CNM displays reduced anisotropy and weak alignment. These dynamical differences are reflected in the statistical scaling of fluctuations: the square root of the second-order velocity structure function exhibits a slope near $1/3$ in the WNM, near $1/2$ in the CNM, and intermediate in the UNM. Our synthetic observations reproduce the polarization power spectra measured by Planck. We find that polarization from UNM dust yields spectral indices most consistent with Planck, whereas WNM and CNM dust produce steeper and shallower spectra, respectively. The WNM yields $EE/BB&gt;2$, the UNM gives $EE/BB\sim2$, and the CNM yields $EE/BB\approx1$. These results indicate that UNM dust could be the dominant contributor to the polarized foreground. We present predictions at 150 GHz to improve foreground separation.</description>

      <title>The rest ultraviolet to infrared spectral energy distributions of heavily reddened quasars are "V-shaped" and hot-dust poor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rest-ultraviolet to infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of 63 heavily reddened quasars (HRQs) at redshifts z=0.7-2.7 and with dust extinctions E(B-V)=0.4-1.8. Our analysis demonstrates that SEDs with red optical and blue UV continua are very common in HRQs, with more than 82 per cent of the sample showing a UV-excess relative to the reddened quasar continuum. We model the SEDs by combining a reddened quasar and an unobscured scattered light component, though contributions from a star-forming host galaxy cannot be ruled out. The average scattering fraction is small (0.3 per cent). Higher scattering fractions are ruled out by the (i-K)=2.5 colour-cut used to select HRQs which pre-dates the discovery of the JWST "Little Red Dot" (LRD) population. Hence, LRDs generally have bluer UV continua. Nevertheless, four HRQs satisfy the LRD UV/optical continuum slope selections and are therefore massive, cosmic noon analogues of LRDs. Analysis of the near-infrared SEDs of HRQs reveals a deficit of hot dust relative to blue quasars, similar to what is observed in LRDs. This suggests HRQs trace a phase where strong AGN feedback processes eject dust from the inner torus. The UV scattering fraction of HRQs is weakly correlated with the amount of hot dust emission and anti-correlated with the line-of-sight extinction, E(B-V). This is consistent with the hot dust acting as the scattering medium, and the line-of-sight extinction being dominated by dust on interstellar medium scales in the host galaxy.</description>

      <title>The Supermassive Black Hole in the Nearby Spiral Galaxy M81: A Robust Mass from JWST/NIRSpec Stellar Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its proximity, the mass of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the spiral galaxy M81 (NGC~3031) has remained uncertain, with previous dynamical measurements being unreliable. We present the first robust stellar-dynamical measurement of its mass using high-resolution, two-dimensional kinematics from JWST/NIRSpec observations of the central $3''\times3''$. By tracing stellar motions in the near-infrared, our data penetrate the obscuring nuclear dust and allow for the separation of stellar light from the non-thermal AGN continuum. We modeled the kinematics using JAM within a Bayesian framework, exploring a comprehensive suite of models that systematically account for uncertainties in the point-spread function, orbital anisotropy, and stellar mass-to-light ratio. This ensemble modeling approach demonstrates that a central dark mass unambiguously drives the central rise in velocity dispersion. The models yield a robust SMBH mass of $M_{\rm BH} = (4.78^{+0.07}_{-0.10})\times10^7$ M$_\odot$. This result resolves a long-standing uncertainty in the mass of M81's black hole and provides a crucial, reliable anchor point for SMBH-galaxy scaling relations.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an Extremely Metal-Poor Galaxy at $z=3.654$ Using JWST Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an extremely metal-poor galaxy at a redshift of z = 3.654, identified through infrared spectroscopy using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This galaxy, CAPERS-39810, exhibits a metallicity of 12 + log(O/H) = $6.73\pm0.13$, indicative of its primitive chemical composition, resembling the early stages of galaxy formation in the Universe. We use JWST NIRSpec/MSA for spectroscopic analysis, complemented by photometric data from the COSMOS2025 catalog. Our analysis employs the R3 strong-line diagnostic method to estimate metallicity, due to the lack of auroral lines in the spectrum. The galaxy's emission lines, including Hb, [O III], Ha and He I, are clearly detected. The rest-frame equivalent widths of the strong hydrogen recombination lines are EW_0(Hb) = $184\pm48$ \AA and EW_0(Ha) = $1144\pm48$ \AA. Furthermore, we perform detailed spectral energy distribution modeling to derive a galaxy logarithmic stellar mass of $8.02^{+0.22}_{-0.34}$ $M_\odot$. This discovery adds to the growing body of evidence for the existence of very low-metallicity galaxies existed at cosmic noon of $z\approx3$, which are crucial for understanding the processes of chemical enrichment and star formation in young galaxies at the cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Drivers of Disk Warps in Tilted and Tumbling TNG50 Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) halos in $\Lambda$ Cold DM cosmological simulations are triaxial. Most exhibit figure rotation. We study 40 isolated halos with stellar disks from the TNG50 simulation suite across $\sim 4$~Gyr to understand whether and how a triaxial halo's tumbling and orientation relative to the disk can drive warps. We measure a warp angle $\psi$ and find even our isolated disks are all at least slightly warped, with each galaxy's maximum $\psi &gt; 1.8^{\circ}$. We perform a modified cross-correlation analysis between $\psi$ and the figure rotation pattern speed, as well as the misalignment between the disk spin axis and (a) the figure rotation axis, (b) the halo minor axis, and (c) the gas angular momentum axis. We use snapshots spanning a lookback time $t_{lb} ~4$ Gyr with 25 linearly-spaced lags from $ 0 - 2.33$ Gyr. We do not find evidence for a consistent lag between the onset of a warp and any of the aforementioned factors on the population level. However, we find significant correlations between individual time-series at various lags. These maximum correlation coefficients were significantly offset from random chance at the population level, suggesting that several of these factors do correlate with disk warping in specific situations. By examining four case studies whose maximum correlation coefficients were significantly higher than random chance, we establish clear qualitative relationships between these factors and warps. While a non-warped galaxy typically shows minimal halo tilt and figure rotation, warped galaxies can have strong/weak tilts and/or strong/weak figure rotation.

      <title>Tracing Galaxy Evolution in the Nearby Universe: The Role of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a sample of $\sim$126,000 late-type galaxies (LTGs) from SDSS, we analyzed stellar mass as a function of dynamical mass. Stellar masses were estimated using eight SPS models with constant IMFs, while dynamical masses were derived from seven formulations based on Newtonian dynamics and virial equilibrium, incorporating both stellar and gas velocity dispersions. We account for key factors affecting dynamical mass estimation, including inclination, colour, concentration, and S\'ersic index. We find that the difference between dynamical and stellar mass ($\Delta \log \mathbf{M}$) ranges from nearly zero to $\sim$95% of the dynamical mass, depending on mass and redshift. $\Delta \log \mathbf{M}$ appears to decreases with increasing redshift, but exhibits a saddle-like shape at low mass and low redshift-especially in disk-dominated LTGs-transitioning into a steep, linear trend at higher masses and redshifts. In the high-mass regime, the behavior resembles that of early-type galaxies. Moreover, our results indicate that this evolution is not discrete but follows a continuous transition between morphological regimes. Dark matter within LTGs is at most equal to $\Delta \log \mathbf{M}$, depending on the impact of the IMF and SPS on stellar mass estimation. Although SPS-based stellar masses do not include the gas component, previous studies have shown that galaxies with log($\mathbf{M_{Stellar}/M_{Solar}}) &gt; 10$ at $z \leq 0.3$ are predominantly stellar-mass dominated. Most galaxies in our sample fall within this regime, minimizing the impact of gas exclusion. Our findings go beyond the scope of single galaxies, providing insight into the nearby Universe and highlighting the influence of dark matter in determining the Universe's structure and evolution.</description>

      <title>Escaping ionizing photons from massive spiral galaxies at $z\sim 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons from three massive ($\text{M}_{*}&gt;10^{10}\:\text{M}_{\odot}$) spiral galaxies at a redshift of nearly 1 in the AstroSat UV Deep Field South. Notably, all three systems are viewed at low inclination (i.e., nearly face-on), prompting an investigation into the role of galaxy orientation in the detectability of LyC emission from disk systems. Two of the three galaxies, however, host active galactic nuclei (AGNs), adding complexity to the interpretation of the LyC signal. We present a detailed analysis of the likely star-forming case, and report tentative evidence that a face-on viewing angle may enhance the likelihood of LyC detection in disk galaxies. This represents the first detection of LyC emission from well-characterized spiral galaxies at high redshift, offering a new window into LyC escape mechanisms in such systems. Our findings highlight the need to consider geometric factors and anisotropic escape pathways facilitated by feedback processes alongside more traditional density-bounded scenarios that imply isotropic escape.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Gas Depletion in Quasars with Moderate Radio Emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy released by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is considered to have a profound impact on the cold gas properties of their host galaxies, potentially heating or removing the gas and further suppressing star formation. To understand the feedback from AGN radio activity, we investigate its impacts on the cold gas reservoirs in AGNs with different radio activity levels. We construct a quasar sample with a mean $z\sim1.5$ and a mean $L_{\rm bol}\sim10^{45.8}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$, all with Herschel detections to enable estimates of the total gas mass through the galactic dust continuum emission. The sample is then cross-matched with radio catalogs and divided into radio loud (RL) quasars, radio-detected radio quiet (RQ) quasars and radio-undetected quasars based on their radio loudness. Through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, we find the radio-detected RQ quasars exhibit evidence of gas deficiency with host galaxies possessing $\sim 0.3$ dex lower dust and gas masses compared to the other two groups, despite being matched in $M_{\rm BH}$, $L_{\rm bol}$, $M_{*}$ and SFR. Furthermore, evidence from optical spectra shows that both the fraction and velocity of outflows are higher in the radio-detected RQ group, suggesting a connection between the ionized gas outflows and the moderate radio activity. These results suggest that the AGN feedback could be more efficient in AGNs with weak/moderate radio emission than in those without radio detection or those with strong radio emission. Further high-resolution observations are needed to understand the interaction between the interstellar medium and the weak/moderate AGN radio activity.</description>

      <title>JWST Spectroscopic Census of ALMA Faint Submillimeter Galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a JWST/NIRSpec rest-frame optical spectroscopic census of ALMA 1-mm continuum sources in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) identified by the deep ALMA UDF and ASPECS programs. Our sample is composed of the ALMA flux-limited ($S_{1\,\mathrm{mm}}\gtrsim 0.1\,\mathrm{mJy}$) sources observed with medium-resolution NIRSpec spectroscopy from JADES and SMILES, 16 faint submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at spectroscopic redshifts of $z\sim 1$-$4$. These SMGs show bright longer-wavelength optical lines (H$\alpha$, [N II]$\lambda\lambda6548,6583$, and [S II]$\lambda\lambda6717,6731$) and faint shorter-wavelength optical lines (H$\beta$ and [O III]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$) with a large nebular attenuation, $E(B-V)\sim0.3$-$1.8$. We test the SMGs using BPT diagnostics and Chandra X-ray fluxes, and find that most SMGs are classified as AGNs; the AGN fraction is $\sim80\%$ for the SMGs at $M_*&gt;10^{10.5} M_\odot$. We find only one SMG ($&lt;10\%$) with a broad Balmer line, indicating that the SMGs are predominantly obscured AGNs. With the optical lines, we estimate the metallicities of the SMGs to be moderately high, $\sim0.4$-$2 Z_\odot$, exceeding the model-predicted dust-growth critical metallicity ($\sim0.1$-$0.2Z_\odot$), which naturally explains the dusty nature of the SMGs. Interestingly, the SMGs fall in the mass-metallicity relation and the star-formation main sequence, showing no significant differences from other high-$z$ galaxies. Similarly, we find electron densities of $n_e\sim10^2$-$10^3\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ for the SMGs that are comparable with other high-$z$ galaxies. Together with the high SMG fraction ($\sim 100\%$) at the massive end ($M_*&gt;10^{10.5} M_\odot$), these results indicate that the SMGs are mostly not special, but typical massive star-forming galaxies at high redshift.</description>

      <title>In-depth analysis of bar formation mechanisms of disk galaxies in halos of different concentrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use $N$-body simulations to investigate the distinct bar formation processes in disks residing in halos of various concentrations. In a highly concentrated halo, the bar development is limited by the dominant multi-arm modes as a result of the swing amplification in the early stage. Only after the multi-arm modes decay, the bar growth proceeds mechanically owing to the particle trapping in continuation of that bar seed. In this scheme, the corotation resonance of the bar modes does not come into play at all, justified by a low amount of disk-halo angular momentum transfer and a modestly decreasing bar pattern speed. On the other hand, although reducing the halo concentration suggests the reduction of the preferred swing-amplified modes to be bi-symmetric, the bar formation in a lowly concentrated halo does not involve the swing amplification at all. Rather, the fast-growing linearly unstable bar modes of a single uniform frequency is solely the governing factor, attributed to a mild shearing. The bar modes trigger the corotation resonance since the beginning and such resonance is maintained until the end, which leads to a high amount of angular momentum transfer and a fast slowdown. For the intermediate halo concentration, the kinematical analyses of multiple non-axisymmetric modes suggests that the linear modes, the swing amplification, and the particle trapping are all present in the evolution chronology. To specify bars formed in the different halo concentrations, full analyses of the isophotal shape, the radial Fourier amplitude, and the resonance diagram can be of use.</description>

      <title>Chemical study of two starless cores in the B213/L1495 filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical evolution of pre-stellar cores during their transition to a protostellar stage is not yet fully understood. Detailed chemical characterizations of these sources are needed to better define their chemistry during star formation. Our goal is to characterize the chemistry of the starless cores C2 and C16 in the B213/L1495 filament of the Taurus Molecular Cloud, and to understand how it relates to the environmental conditions and the evolutionary state of the cores. We made use of two complete spectral surveys at 7 mm of these sources, carried out using the Yebes 40-m telescope. Derived molecular abundances were compared with those of other sources in different evolutionary stages and with values computed by chemical models. Including isotopologs, 22 molecules were detected in B213-C2, and 25 in B213-C16. The derived rotational temperatures have values of between $\sim$ 5 K and $\sim$ 9 K. A comparison of the two sources shows lower abundances in C2, except for l-C$_{3}$H and HOCO$^{+}$, which have similar values in both cores. Model results indicate that both cores are best fit assuming early-time chemistry, and point to C2 being in a more advanced evolutionary stage, as it presents a higher molecular hydrogen density and sulfur depletion, and a lower cosmic-ray ionization rate. Our chemical modeling successfully accounts for the abundances of most molecules, including complex organic molecules and long cyanopolynes (HC$_{5}$N, HC$_{7}$N), but fails to reproduce those of the carbon chains CCS and C$_{3}$O. Chemical differences between C2 and C16 could stem from the evolutionary stage of the cores, with C2 being closer to the pre-stellar phase. Both cores are better fit assuming early-time chemistry of t $\sim$ 0.1 Myr. The more intense UV radiation in the northern region of B213 could account for the high abundances of l-C$_{3}$H and HOCO$^{+}$ in C2.</description>

      <title>The Most Luminous H$\beta$ Reverberation Mapping of E1821+643 Indicates the Lower Boundary of the Radius-Luminosity Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radius-luminosity ($R_{\rm BLR}$-$L_{5100}$) relation is fundamental to active galactic nucleus (AGN) studies, enabling supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass estimates and AGN-based cosmology applications. However, its high-luminosity end remains poorly calibrated due to insufficient reliable reverberation mapping (RM) data. We present a four-year RM campaign of the luminous quasar E1821+643 using the Lijiang 2.4-m telescope, supplemented by archival multi-wavelength data. E1821+643 is the most luminous AGN with an \hb\ RM measurement to date. The measured time lag of $83.2_{-18.7}^{+17.5}$ days is a factor of 5.6 shorter than predicted by the canonical $R_{\rm BLR}$-$L_{5100}$ relation. By compiling the full \hb\ RM sample, we find that such deviation defines a lower envelope ($0.2R_{\rm BLR}$) of measured lags across the entire luminosity range, while the upper envelope lies near $2R_{\rm BLR}$, implying that the scatter for individual AGNs can reach 1 dex. Spectral decomposition reveals two distinct \hb\ components: a core component with a lag of $267.0_{-17.6}^{+16.6}$ days closer to the $R_{\rm BLR}$-$L_{5100}$ relation, and a redshifted tail with a much shorter lag of $-49.0_{-34.5}^{+50.5}$ days. The short-lag component not only accounts for the significantly shortened overall lag, but also leads to an opposite interpretation of the intrinsic BLR kinematics. These effects can introduce systematic uncertainties in black hole mass estimates by factors of up to tens. Our findings demonstrate that shortened lags in high-accretion-rate AGNs arise from multi-component BLR structures, posing substantial challenges to single-epoch mass estimates and impacting SMBH demographics and cosmological applications.</description>

      <title>Galactic Large-scale Filaments Resident in Asymmetric Environments: Clues from Cross-filament Profiles of Density and Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale filaments ubiquitously exist in the Galactic interstellar medium, and their radial profiles offer insights into their formation mechanisms. We present a statistical analysis of molecular hydrogen column density ($\rm N(H_2)$) and dust temperature ($\rm T_d$) radial profiles for 35 Galactic large-scale filaments. We divided their spines into 315 segments, extracted the radial profiles of each segment using $\rm N(H_2)$ and $\rm T_d$ maps derived from $Herschel$ Hi-GAL data, and estimated the asymmetry degree within the radial profiles ($\alpha_{\rm asy}$), as well as the length proportion of segments with asymmetric profiles across the entire filament ($f_{\rm asy}$). We found that Galactic large-scale filaments reside in surroundings distinctly asymmetric and varied in $\rm N(H_2)$, and mild asymmetric yet stable in $\rm T_d$. Different filament morphology types do not show significant differences in $\alpha_{\rm asy}$ or $f_{\rm asy}$. A bent filament shape does not necessarily correspond to an asymmetric radial profile, whereas a straight filament shape may be associated with a symmetric profile. Segments with asymmetric surroundings in $\rm N(H_2)$ may not simultaneously appear asymmetric in $\rm T_d$, and vice versa. We found three filaments with 4-44% of their spine show asymmetric $\rm N(H_2)$ and $\rm T_d$ radial profiles in inverse trends, likely caused by nearby HII region. HII regions of similar scale to large filaments can induce asymmetric radial profiles within them, indicating their influence on filament evolution. However, they are unlikely to independently trigger the formation of an entire Galactic large-scale filament, in contrast to their role in small-scale filament formation.</description>

      <title>Ancient relic moderately metal-rich bulge cluster Tonantzintla 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assembly history of the Galactic bulge is intimately tied to the formation of the proto-Milky Way, yet reconstructing this early phase is difficult because mergers and secular evolution have erased most of its original structure. Among present-day stellar systems, only globular clusters retain the ancient signatures needed to trace these primordial building blocks. Here we present the most detailed characterization to date of Tonantzintla 2, a prime candidate for a relic of the Milky Way's primordial bulge. It is a moderately metal-rich globular cluster projected onto the bulge that has remained largely unexplored despite its potential to constrain the early formation of the inner Milky Way. We derive its fundamental parameters using proper motion-corrected Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 and ACS photometry. By applying an isochrone fitting to very clean data, we obtain an age of 13.58 Gyr, a reddening E(B-V) = 1.44, a metallicity [M/H]=-0.68, and a heliocentric distance of d = 7.38 kpc. A complementary chemical-abundance analysis of seven member stars from APOGEE high-resolution spectroscopy reveals an enrichment pattern consistent with an in-situ origin. Tonantzintla 2 is among the oldest globular clusters studied in the literature, and the oldest so far analyzed in the Galactic bulge. Its age places a stringent constraint on the onset of the bulge formation, implying that star formation in the inner Galaxy began within ~0.2 Gyr of the Big Bang and that Tonantzintla 2 represents an exceptional relic of the Milky Way's earliest chemical enrichment.</description>

      <title>The AIDA-TNG project: gas distributions inside and around haloes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of Dark Matter (DM) is one of the most outstanding mysteries of modern astrophysics. While the standard Cold DM (CDM) model successfully explains observations on most astrophysical scales, DM particles have not yet been detected, leaving room for a plethora of different models. In order to identify their observable signatures, we use the AIDA-TNG cosmological simulation suite to predict the distributions of gas and neutral hydrogen (HI) in the CDM, Self-Interacting DM (SIDM), velocity-dependent SIDM (vSIDM), and Warm DM (WDM) models.
  We find that the DM models investigated have very limited impact on the median gas and HI profile of haloes. In particular, for the most massive haloes ($M_{\rm vir}\sim10^{14}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$), we find that DM self-interactions can shallow the central potential and thereby enhance gas cooling. We find that, in all models, the halo-to-halo variation in the HI profiles is explained by AGN feedback, and that the specific characteristics of DM model is largely subdominant. Nevertheless, we detect some systematic difference in the case of SIDM, with more HI surviving close to the centre with respect to other models. We provide fitting functions for the gas and HI profiles.
  We investigate the galaxy-Ly$\alpha$ cross-correlation function (\galacc) for different halo masses, redshift and observation strategies. We find that at $z=0$ vSIDM can be distinguished from CDM in haloes with $10^{12}\lesssim M_{\rm vir}\lesssim10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$, while SIDM1 can be distinguished from CDM in haloes with $M_{\rm vir}\gtrsim10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$. We estimate that statistically-robust detection requires sampling $\sim160$ haloes with $\sim20$ sightlines each, a task that can be achieved with current and future facilities like WEAVE, 4MOST, PFS, ELT and WST.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-ATOMS survey: Methanol emission in a large sample of hot molecular cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methanol (CH$_{3}$OH) is a key complex organic molecule (COM) in the interstellar medium, widely used as a tracer of dense gas and hot molecular cores (HMCs). Using high-resolution ALMA observations from the ATOMS survey, we investigate the excitation and abundance of methanol nuclear spin isomers and their relationship to chemical complexity in massive star-forming cores. We identify 20 methanol transitions, including A- and E-type lines in the v=0 state and E-type lines in the v$_{t}$=1 state, and detect 94 HMC candidates. Rotational temperature analysis under the LTE assumption yields average values of 194 $\pm$ 33 K for CH$_{3}$OH-E v$_{t}$=1, 178 $\pm$ 33 K for CH$_{3}$OH-A v=0, and 75 $\pm$ 33K for CH$_{3}$OH-E v=0. Emission from COMs other than methanol is detected in 87 of the 94 cores, with the CH$_{3}$OH-E v$_{t}$=1 line intensity showing a strong correlation with the channel detection ratio (CDR). These results demonstrate that CH$_{3}$OH-E v$_{t}$=1 lines are reliable tracers of HMCs and chemical complexity, and that the CDR provides a robust indicator of molecular richness. The temperature difference between A- and E-type methanol transitions is driven by anomalously strong J(2,J-2)$-$J(-1,J-1) lines, highlighting the importance of analyzing methanol symmetry types separately.</description>

      <title>New parameters for star cluster dynamics: observational results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently used a large set of Monte Carlo simulations of globular clusters (GCs) to define new fully empirical parameters (named A5, P5, and S2.5) able to trace the internal dynamical evolution of dense stellar systems. These parameters are specifically designed to quantify the steepness of the cumulative radial distribution of stars in the innermost region of the host system, which tends to progressively increase with dynamical aging due to core contraction. Following the original definitions, here we measure A5 and P5 in a sample of 40 Galactic GCs homogeneously surveyed through HST photometric observations. In agreement with the predictions of our simulations, the largest values of A5 and P5 are found for the most dynamically evolved GCs, i.e., those previously classified as post-core collapse systems based on the shape of their density profile, and those characterized by the shortest central relaxation times. Moreover, the new dynamical parameters here measured strongly correlate with A+rh, another fully empirical, independent parameter that traces the dynamical age of star clusters through the level of central segregation of blue straggler stars.</description>

      <title>Intracluster light as a dark matter tracer: how their spatial and kinematic relationship is shaped by satellite demographics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the orbital evolution and mass distribution of infalling satellite galaxies shape the phase-space and radial distributions of intracluster light (ICL) relative to the underlying cluster dark matter (DM) halo. Using N-body simulations, we follow the tidal stripping and orbital evolution of satellite galaxies as they are accreted into a live cluster halo, systematically varying satellite-to-host mass ratio and orbital circularity. We measure the specific orbital energy and angular momentum of stripped stellar and DM material, finding that the stripped stars consistently occupy lower-energy and lower-angular momentum regions of phase-space than the stripped DM. The magnitude of this difference increases strongly towards more equal satellite--to--host mass ratios, while the dependence on orbital circularity is weak. We construct a predictive model for the phase-space properties of stripped stars and DM from a whole infalling satellite population and find that the resulting phase-space difference between the components are driven primarily by the characteristic mass of the infalling satellite stellar mass function. We find that the ICL is always more centrally concentrated than the DM. The magnitude of this offset depends on the characteristic mass and increases towards higher characteristic masses. Comparisons with four independent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations show that, once the infalling satellite stellar mass function is matched, the model reproduces the radial stellar-to-DM density profile offsets to better than the inter-simulation scatter. This demonstrates that the radial relationship between the ICL and the DM distribution is largely governed by satellite demographics. With adequate constraints on the infalling satellite population, ICL density profiles can therefore be used as informative tracers of the underlying radial DM distribution in clusters.</description>

      <title>Virgo Filaments VI: H$\alpha$ clumps in the filaments around the Virgo galaxy cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is still not clear which environmental processes operate in filaments. Given the ubiquity of filaments and their importance in feeding clusters, a proper understanding of these mechanisms is crucial to a more complete picture of galaxy evolution. To investigate them, we need large galaxy samples with resolved imaging. For this study, we analyse resolved H$\alpha$ maps of 685 galaxies inside and outside the filaments around the Virgo cluster in addition to extensive measurements of integrated physical properties. We create a pipeline to decompose the H$\alpha$ images into individual clumps. We find that the number and average size of clumps in a galaxy are well-defined functions of distance and angular resolution. In particular, the power-law relation between the number of clumps and the distance of a galaxy is consistent with a fractal structure of star forming regions. We formulate an algorithm to compare filament and non-filament galaxies after removing observational differences. Although we do not have any conclusive evidence for a difference in clump size distributions between filament and non-filament galaxies, we do find that filament galaxies have slightly more peripheral clumps than their non-filament counterparts.</description>

      <title>Effect of different Non-Gravitational accelerations on the trajectory of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comet C/2025 N1 or 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object. It has passed perihelion on 2025 October 29, and is currently on a path to leave the solar system. During its outbound journey, it will pass close to Jupiter at a distance of 0.358 au. NASA JPL \textsc{Horizons} has updated the non-gravitational parameters of the comet based on the CO$_2$ sublimation model, where $g(r)= 1/r^2$. In this research note, we use the non-gravitational accelerations from \textsc{Horizons} together with symmetric and asymmetric H$_2$O sublimation models derived using \texttt{Find\_Orb} software. We calculate the resulting perijove distances and compare them with our earlier results at epoch JD 2460867.5.</description>

      <title>Extragalactic Planetary Nebulae (xPNe). Chemical evolution and assembly histories of nearby galaxies using Oxygen and Argon abundances. From the local universe to cosmic dawn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How galaxies formed and evolved in the expanding Universe is the main science goal of Near-Field Cosmology research. Studies of the properties of galaxies' resolved stars open a widow on their ancient galactic components, probing star formation during epochs more than 10 billion years ago. Extragalactic Planetary Nebulae (xPNe) can help decipher the signatures of mergers and interactions persisting over many dynamical times by tracing elemental abundances coupled with their kinematics and spatial distributions. With new facilities, reaching higher angular resolution, area coverage and sensitivity, one can use xPNe to map Oxygen and Argon element abundances, in addition to their kinematics, to extend the Galactic Archeology investigation to the oldest stellar aggregates in our Local Universe.</description>

      <title>Detached eclipsing binary star science in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detached eclipsing binary stars (DEBS) are currently the best source of accurate and precise fundamental stellar parameters. This makes DEBS crucial targets for constraining the impact of various physical processes on stellar structure and evolution. Long-period binaries are particularly interesting because their separation minimises interactions between the components. This makes long-period binaries more comparable to single stars. However, the current sample of DEBS with high precision stellar parameters are dominated by short-period systems (e.g. ~90% of the Gaia DR3 eclipsing binaries have periods &lt; 5 days). Facilities capable of performing detailed studies of long-period DEBS will be essential to further improve our understanding of stellar structure and evolution. Such facilities would need to be able to obtain spectroscopic observations of more distant objects at high resolution and cadence. 2-8m class telescopes with echelle spectrographs and an ability to monitor a large sample of stars would be required.</description>

      <title>An ultra-high-resolution map of (dark) matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordinary matter-including particles such as protons and neutrons-accounts for only about one sixth of all matter in the Universe. The rest is dark matter, which does not emit or absorb light but plays a fundamental role in galaxy and structure evolution. Because it interacts only through gravity, one of the most direct probes is weak gravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by intervening mass. Here we present an extremely detailed, wide-area weak-lensing mass map, covering 0.77 deg x 0.70 deg, using high-resolution imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as part of the COSMOS-Web survey. By measuring the shapes of 129 galaxies per square arcminute-many independently in the F115W and F150W bands-we achieve an angular resolution of 1.00 +/- 0.01 arcmin. Our map has more than twice the resolution of earlier Hubble Space Telescope maps, revealing how dark and luminous matter co-evolve across filaments, clusters, and under-densities. It traces mass features out to z ~ 2, including the most distant structure at z ~ 1.1. The sensitivity to high-redshift lensing constrains galaxy environments at the peak of cosmic star formation and sets a high-resolution benchmark for testing theories about the nature of dark matter and the formation of large-scale cosmic structure</description>

Abstract: This review of the rapid-neutron-capture (i.e. r-) process starts with determining the Solar System r-abundance pattern via first obtaining (and subtracting) the contribution from the slow-neutron capture (s-) process. We emphasize the extensive work in this area by our late colleague Roberto Gallino and continue in an overview, concentrating on attempts to reproduce the solar r-process pattern with historical site-independent approaches, based on nuclear physics far from stability. In a second step we address the existing proposals for astrophysical sites. Among stellar observations we start with available observations of individual events before analyzing low-metallicity stars, which witness r-process contributions in the early Galaxy.We conclude with a comparison of observations and model predictions, focusing on our present ability to identify the responsible individual astrophysical sites by their imprint in Galactic evolution.</description>

      <title>Stellar Disruption of Axion Minihalos and Consequences for Direct Axion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scenarios such as the QCD axion with the Peccei-Quinn symmetry broken after inflation predict an enhanced matter power spectrum on sub-parsec scales. These theories lead to the formation of dense dark matter structures known as minihalos, which provide insights into early Universe dynamics and have implications for direct detection experiments. We examine the mass loss of minihalos during stellar encounters, building on previous studies that derived formulas for mass loss and performed N-body simulations. We propose a new formula for the mass loss that accounts for changes in the minihalo profile after disruption by a passing star. We also investigate the mass loss for multiple stellar encounters. We demonstrate that accurately assessing the mass loss in minihalos due to multiple stellar encounters necessitates considering the alterations in the minihalo's binding energy after each encounter, as overlooking this aspect results in a substantial underestimation of the mass loss.
  We further extend our analysis to the Galactic environment by more accurately incorporating multiple stellar encounters and dynamical relaxation timescales, simulating minihalo orbits in the Galactic potential. Our results show stellar interactions are more destructive than previously estimated, reducing minihalo mass retention at the solar system to ~30%, compared to earlier estimates of ~60%. This enhanced loss arises from cumulative energy injections when relaxation periods between stellar encounters are accounted for. The altered minihalo mass function implies a larger fraction of axion dark matter occupies inter-minihalo space, potentially increasing the local axion density and improving haloscope detection prospects. This thesis highlights the significance of detailed modeling of stellar disruptions in shaping the axion dark matter distribution.</description>

      <title>JOYS: JWST MIRI/MRS spectra of the inner 500 au region of the L1527 IRS bipolar outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study characterizes the physical and kinematic properties within the innermost 500 au region of the L1527 bipolar outflow, a Class 0/I low-mass protostar using JWST MIRI/MRS spectroscopy across 5-28 micron at 0.2-1.0 arcsec resolution. We identify emission lines from molecular and ionized species and analyze their spatial morphology using line integrated intensity maps. We derive gas temperature and column density through excitation diagram analysis of H2 rotational lines and compared results with shock models. The observations reveal extended molecular hydrogen emission tracing the bipolar outflow, with the H2 gas temperatures distributed into warm (~550 K) and hot (~2500 K) components, likely originating from moderate velocity J-type shocks and some UV irradiation. We detect forbidden atomic and ionized emission lines of [Ni ii], [Ar ii], [Ne ii], [Ne iii], [S i], and [Fe ii] showing spatially extended morphology. Double peaked emission profiles were seen in [Ar ii], [Ne iii], and [Fe ii], in the eastern region, suggesting that the high velocity component traces a fast, highly ionized jet. Radial velocity map derived from [Ne ii] emission shows the eastern region to be redshifted and the western region blueshifted, contrary to earlier interpretations. The analysis of the MIRI/MRS observations reveals the presence of molecular, atomic, and ionized emission lines in this low-mass protostar connected with active outflow signatures. The most striking feature discovered is the presence of a poorly collimated high velocity ionized jet, embedded within a broader wide-angle molecular outflow likely driven by a disk wind. The co-existence of these components supports a stratified outflow structure and suggest L1527 exhibits unique jet-launching characteristics atypical for its early evolutionary stage.</description>

Abstract: We present a study of the interstellar medium associated with the two middle-aged supernova remnants (SNRs) W41 and G22.7-0.2, both detected in TeV gamma-rays. Using high-angular-resolution $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0) data from the Nobeyama 45-m telescope and HI data from the VLA, we investigated the spatial and kinematic properties of molecular and atomic gas that interact with the SNRs. We identified associated clouds in the velocity ranges of +50-+80 km s$^{-1}$ for W41 and +76-+110 km s$^{-1}$ for G22.7-0.2. Column density analysis indicates that target protons are dominated by molecular hydrogen, while atomic hydrogen contributes less than $\sim$10-15% even after correction for self-absorption. The mean proton densities are $\sim$1.2$\times$10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$ for W41 and $\sim$5.3$\times$10$^{2}$ cm$^{-3}$ for G22.7-0.2. From the gamma-ray luminosities, we estimate the total energy of accelerated cosmic-ray protons as $W_\mathrm{p}$ $\sim$3$\times$10$^{47}$~erg for W41 and $\sim$1$\times$10$^{48}$ erg for G22.7-0.2, corresponding to 0.03-0.1% of the canonical supernova explosion energy. hese $W_\mathrm{p}$ values agree with the decreasing trend in $W_\mathrm{p}$ observed in the middle-aged SNRs within the previously reported SNR age-$W_\mathrm{p}$ relation.</description>

      <title>Multi-epoch VLBI observations of the blazar 3C 66A: Spatial twisting and temporal oscillation of the parsec-scale jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous VLBI kinematic studies of the blazar 3C 66A have unveiled complex jet kinematic behaviors. Using follow-up high-resolution VLBI observations and archival data, we investigate the morphology and the variations in orientation and core flux density of the 3C 66A jet to gain a deeper insights into its kinematic behavior and physical origins. We performed KVN and VERA array (KaVA) observations at 22/43 GHz over three epochs in 2014 and collected 109 sets of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) archival data at 43 GHz between 1996 - 2025. We imaged the parsec-scale jet and parameterized it using circular Gaussian fittings to the UV visibilities. Finally, we derived the inner jet PA and the core flux densities for the VLBA data. The jet presents a twisted morphology in the KaVA maps. The PA of the fitted Gaussian components is in the range between 170 deg and 195 deg. Our kinematic analysis using the VLBA data indicates that the PA oscillates with an amplitude of 7.77 pm 0.79 deg and a period of 10.94 pm 0.22 years, presented for the first time in this work. This oscillation is topped by a continuous clockwise shift of the PA by -0.83 pm 0.07 deg/year. We also identified a strong core flux variability with possible periodicity and a 2 sigma correlation between the core flux density and the inner jet PA change. We discuss possible physical models that could explain the observed features for this object; in particular, a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) system, Lense Thirring (LT) effect, and jet or disk instabilities. The oscillation and continuous shift of the PA and the possible radio flux periodicity, together with the optical flux periodicity of approximately 2 years that had previously been confirmed in several independent studies, favor a jet precession scenario driven by orbital motion and disk-orbit misalignment in a SMBHB system.</description>

      <title>A Novel Lensed Point Source Modeling Pipeline using GIGA-Lens with Application to SN Zwicky and SN iPTF16geu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel modeling pipeline for strongly lensed point sources, using the GIGA-Lens framework, running on four A100 GPUs via the JAX platform. Using simulations, we demonstrate accurate and precise recovery of image positions, fluxes, and time delays, together with inference of complex lens mass distributions -- including the mass density slope, $\gamma$ -- from images of lensed point sources alone. We further show that we can achieve statistical uncertainty of $\sim 3.6\%$ ($\sim 2.5\, \mathrm{km\, s^{-1}/Mpc}$) on $H_0$ from a single system, with full forward modeling, i.e., simultaneous inference of all lens model parameters together with $H_0$. We apply our pipeline to two well-studied lensed SNe Ia, Zwicky and iPTF16geu. For SN iPTF16geu, unlike previous modeling efforts, we model only the images of the lensed point source (the SN) and do not use the lensed images of the extended host-galaxy. Nevertheless, we are able to infer all of the mass parameters modeled in earlier studies, and our best-fit values, including $\gamma$, are fully consistent with published results. In the case of SN Zwicky, taking the same approach, however, we obtain an alternative best-fit model compared to published results, underscoring the importance of fully exploring the model parameter space.</description>

Abstract: The results of spectral observations of NGC 3516 with the 2-m telescope of the Shamakhy Astrophysical Observatory during 2016-2020 are presented. In the first half of 2016, the intensive broad component Hbeta was found, which indicates a spectral type change compared to 2014, when the broad component was almost invisible. In the second half of 2016, the broad component H${\beta}$ again was weakened and was practically not observed, remaining as weak until the end of 2019. At the end of 2019, the broad component Hbeta strengthened again, and in May 2020 reached a typical level for the high state of the object. During 2016-2020 we observed several changing looks of NGC 3516.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Assembly of Massive Galaxies. III: Quiescent Galaxies Loose Angular Momentum as They Evolve in a Mass-dependent Fashion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of stellar kinematics of a sample of 952 massive quiescent galaxies with $M_*&gt;10^{10.5}M_\odot$ at $0.6&lt;z&lt;1$. Utilizing spatially integrated spectroscopy from the LEGA-C survey, we focus on the relationship between the observed integrated stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma^\prime_{star}$) and the morphological axial ratio ($q$), and its variation with the stellar age and mass of quiescent galaxies. For the youngest quiescent galaxies, regardless of stellar mass, $\sigma^\prime_{star}$ decreases with increasing $q$, a trend that is consistent with a system having significant rotation and hence suggests that massive galaxies still retain significant amount of angular momentum in the aftermath of quenching. As they continue to evolve, the variation of the $\sigma^\prime_{star}$-$q$ relationship depends on stellar mass. For quiescent galaxies with $M_*&lt;10^{11.3}M_\odot$, $\sigma^\prime_{star}$ decreases with $q$ in all stellar-age bins, suggesting that the quiescent populations of this mass regime retain significant rotation even long time after quenching. In contrast, for more massive quiescent galaxies with $M_*&gt;10^{11.3}M_\odot$, the relationship between $\sigma^\prime_{star}$ and $q$ becomes significantly flattened with increasing stellar age. This indicates that, as the very massive galaxy populations continue to evolve after quenching, angular momentum gradually reduces, which eventually transforms them into velocity-dispersion supported systems. We suggest that incoherent, continuous merging and accretion events onto the galaxies are the main drivers of the observed mass-dependent, posting-quenching dynamical evolution, because more massive galaxies are more likely to undergo such interactions. We are witnessing the early formation epoch of fast and slow rotators at $z \sim 0.8$, when the Universe was only half of its age nowadays.</description>

      <title>NGC3521 as the Milky Way analogue: spectral energy distributon from UV to Radio and photometric variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the multiwavelength properties of NGC 3521, the Milky Way galaxy-twin, from UV- to radio, exploring the data from GALEX for UV-, SDSS for optical, 2MASS, WISE, MIPS (Spitzer) and PACS, SPIRE (Herschel) for IR-, and NRAO VLA for radio ranges. To obtain the spectral energy distribution (SED), we exploited the CIGALE software and constructed SEDs without (model A) and with (model B) AGN module. The type of nuclear activity of NGC 3521 is confirmed as the LINER. We also present the results of the photometric data processing. Exploring the ZTF observations in 2018-2024, we found, for the first time, a weak photometric variability of the nuclear activity, where the correlation between g-r color indices and g-magnitude for long-term timescale shows a BWB trend (bluer-when-brighter) with a Pearson coefficient r(g-r)=0.56, which is a medium correlation. To detect the variability of NGC 3521 during the day (IDV), we provided observations using a Zeiss-600 telescope with an aperture size of 8" at the Terskol observatory. The data obtained in the R-filter with an exposure of 90 sec for three hours on Feb 11, 2022, serve in favor of a trend towards an increase in brightness with the amplitude of variability of 0.04 +- 0.001 mag. According to the results of the simulations, the best fit to the observed SED is provided by model A, which considers the contribution to the radiation from all galaxy components, assuming that the galaxy nucleus is inactive. Within this model, we derived the stellar mass M$_{star}$ = 2.13 * 10$^{10} M_{Sun}$, the dust mass M$_{dust}$ = 8.45 * 10$^{7} M_{Sun}$, and the star formation rate SFR = 1.76 $M_{Sun}$ * yr$^{-1}$ with $\chi^{2}$/d.o.f = 1.8. Also, based on the HIPASS radio data, we estimated the mass of neutral hydrogen to be M$_{HI}$ = 1.3 * 10$^{10} M_{Sun}$, which is an order of magnitude greater than the mass of the stellar component.</description>

      <title>The Role of Large-Scale Environment in Shaping the Stellar Mass-Gas Metallicity Relation Across Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stellar mass-gas metallicity relation (MZR) which shows a significant scatter for a fixed stellar mass. By defining global environments, nodes, filaments, and voids within the Horizon Run 5 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, we explore when and where the enrichment of galaxies occurs, analysing key evolution parameters such as star-formation rate and changes in gas-fraction and gas-metallicity per unit time. At high redshift ($z&gt;4.5$), there are minimal deviations from the MZR due to environment, however, larger deviations emerge as redshift decreases. Low stellar mass galaxies in nodes, $M_{\star} &lt; 10^{9.8}\,\text{M}_{\odot}$, start showing deviations at $z = 3.5$, whilst other environments do not. For, $z &lt; 2$, filaments and voids begin to show deviations above and below the MZR, respectively. By $z = 0.625$, the last epoch of HR5, deviations exist for all stellar masses and environments, with a maximum value of 0.13 dex at $M_{\star} \approx 10^{9.35}\,\text{M}_{\odot}$, between the median gas metallicities of node and void galaxies. To explain this environmental variance we discuss gas accretion, AGN, ram-pressure-stripping and strangulation as regulators of $Z_{g}$. Concurrently, at high metallicities, for $z &lt; 2$, while massive galaxies in nodes show increasing $Z_{g}$ and decreasing [O/Fe], void galaxies show a turnover where $Z_{g}$ falls with decreasing [O/Fe]. This directly points to the importance of cold-gas accretion in retaining lower $Z_{g}$ in massive void galaxies for $z &lt; 2$, whilst its absence in nodes allowed $Z_{g}$ to access higher values.</description>

      <title>The Tantalizing Case of the Quasar J0950+5128 -- I. Presentation of the Data and Detailed Exploration of the Binary Supermassive Black Hole Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06221v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations of the quasar J0950$+$5128 spanning 22 years reveal monotonic radial velocity variations in its broad H$\beta$ emission line. Moreover, the line profile becomes broader over time, necessitating careful measurements. We present robust H$\beta$ velocity shift measurements obtained via cross correlation, applied to both the full spectra and to isolated broad H$\beta$ components derived from spectral decomposition. We also examine the light curves for variability consistent with the spectroscopic trends. Using Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis we find no significant periodic signal. We consider several interpretations for the observed changes, including a binary supermassive black hole, dust-cloud obscuration, outflows, a recoiling black hole, and a single perturbed, disk-like broad-line region. We deem the binary and perturbed broad-line region scenarios to be physically plausible. The binary interpretation is the only one for which we can immediately compare a physical model to the available data. Thus, we incorporate radial velocity ''jitter'' to emulate typical quasar variability and fit the radial velocity curve with a Keplerian model to examine whether it can reproduce the observations. In this context, the available observations trace only a segment of the putative orbit. The fit yields a period of 33 years (observed frame) and an eccentricity of 0.65, with lower limits on the semi-major axis and black hole mass of $10^{-2}\;$pc and $10^7\;{\rm M}_\odot$, respectively. Thus, J0950$+$5128 is a binary candidate deserving further study. The single, perturbed broad-line region interpretation remains viable but requires additional observations and modeling for further evaluation. Continued monitoring is, therefore, essential.</description>

      <title>Cusp-to-Core Transition of Dark Matter Halos across Galaxy Mass Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the diversity of dark matter (DM) density profiles in a large sample of late-type galaxies from the SPARC database, with the goal of testing whether a cusp-to-core transition occurs across galaxy mass scales. We perform Bayesian fits to high-quality rotation curves using flexible halo models that allow for variations in the inner slopes of DM density profiles. We quantify the central dark matter structure using the surface density within the inner region of the halo, defined as $\Sigma_{\rm DM}(&lt;0.01r_{V_{\rm max}})$, and compare the SPARC galaxies with Milky Way dwarf satellites as well as galaxy groups and clusters. Our results reveal significant diversity in the inner density slopes of SPARC galaxies, ranging from steep cusps to shallow cores, and show that many of them lie below the cuspy profiles predicted by the cold dark matter model, consistent with core-like structures. In contrast, both lower-mass dwarf galaxies and higher-mass galaxy clusters tend to follow the cuspy DM halos. These findings suggest that baryonic feedback may induce a cusp-to-core transition in Milky Way-mass galaxies, as predicted by hydrodynamical simulations. However, observational limitations and modeling uncertainties still prevent a definitive conclusion. This study provides new empirical insights into the halo mass-dependent nature of DM inner structures and the role of baryonic processes in shaping them.</description>

      <title>Multi-resolution kinematic modelling of nearby galaxies: a demonstration using MHONGOOSE observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method of combining kinematic models obtained at multiple spatial resolution levels in a self-consistent manner. The MHONGOOSE survey has mapped atomic hydrogen emission in $30$ nearby dwarf and spiral galaxies. Each galaxy is imaged at multiple resolution levels with unprecedented dynamic range in spatial resolution (from $\sim 10''$ to $ 90''$) and HI sensitivity, with the latter varying by almost a factor of $30$ across all resolution scales. We use radial weighting functions to combine kinematic models from all resolution levels. The weights are derived from the residuals of model fits to a set of observations of synthetic model galaxies with known rotation curves and geometries. We obtain combined (weighted and smoothed) inclination and position angle profiles for each galaxy. These suppress the sharp, often unphysical radial fluctuations arising in single-resolution profiles. We then fit the rotation speed and velocity dispersion profiles at each resolution level with the geometric profiles fixed to the combined profiles, finally combining these using the same weighting and smoothing approach. The combined rotation curves utilise all of the available information and have smaller typical systematic errors compared to those obtained using a single resolution level, particularly near the centres and outer edges of models. This initial demonstration is promising; there is scope to further refine the process to use such information-rich observations to their full potential.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray impact on optical and mid-infrared emission line diagnostics in NGC 5728</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs), from active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets and supernovae (SNe), serve as a significant feedback mechanism influencing emission lines in narrow line region (NLR) clouds. These highly energetic particles, propelled by shocks, heat the interstellar medium (ISM) and modify its chemical composition. This study investigates the role of CRs, particularly in their ability to excite gas and align with observed line ratios across UV and optical diagnostics. We employ CLOUDY to explore CR ionization rate, ionization parameter, and initial hydrogen density effects on optical and mid-infrared (MIR) emission. Our analysis includes high-quality optical data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) for NGC 5728, supplemented by infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our previous results indicate that CRs are instrumental in heating the inner regions of gas clouds, enhancing emission of low-ionization optical lines. Mid-infrared data reveal that emission lines like [Ar II] and [Ne II] within the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) field of view are sensitive to CRs. In contrast, high-ionization lines (for example, [Ne V]) serve as robust tracers of photoionization insensitive to CRs. Moreover, mixed optical and MIR diagnostics offer insight into the relative roles of CRs and shocks, which often produce similar signatures in emission lines. We find that while both mechanisms can elevate certain line ratios, their influence on MIR diagnostics diverges: shocks and CRs affect low-ionization lines differently, allowing for a better understanding when multi-wavelength data are available. Our approach not only helps to resolve the degeneracy between metallicity and CR ionization but also enables the potential differentiation of shocks and CR-driven processes in AGN.</description>

      <title>Influence of the Spectral Energy Distribution of Reionization-Era Sources on the Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpreting Lyman-$\alpha$ forest properties during the epoch of reionization requires assumptions about the spectral energy distribution (SED) of ionizing sources. These are often simplified to blackbody or power-law spectra, potentially overlooking contributions from high-energy processes. In this work, we investigate how different SED models of reionization-era sources shape the thermal and ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and imprint on the Ly$\alpha$ forest during the late stages of reionization. We perform $3D$ radiative transfer simulations with CRASH, post-processed on Sherwood-type hydrodynamical outputs, exploring both physically motivated SEDs including X-ray binaries, Bremsstrahlung from shock-heated interstellar medium, and binary stars and idealized blackbody and power-law spectra. While the large-scale morphology of ionized regions is broadly similar across all models, harder spectral components extend partially ionized zones, produce larger He III regions, and heat the surrounding IGM. By adopting simplified spectra there is the risk of underestimating the contribution of high-energy sources, which for most models we consider are found to alter the effective optical depth, the flux power, and the local transmissivity within the current $\sim 1 \sigma$ measurement uncertainties. The differences across models are most pronounced in the behavior of the proximity zone and in the power at intermediate scales, offering the most promising diagnostics to disentangle source populations. With upcoming high precision measurements from ELT and DESI, realistic SED modelling will be essential for robustly connecting Ly$\alpha$ forest observations to the sources driving the end of reionization.</description>

Abstract: The environmental density of galaxies within the cosmic web constrains their 3D locations in filaments, voids, groups, and clusters. It traces the distribution of baryons and the influence of dark-matter halos on galaxy evolution, and helps diagnose external processes such as supernova and AGN feedback, tidal interactions, ram-pressure stripping, and large-scale flows. We focus on isolated barred galaxies, the parent population that includes Milky Way analogs. To measure local environmental density and verify isolation (|Delta v| &lt;= 500 km s^-1), we built a Python pipeline that works in two redshift regimes: low (z0 &lt; 0.02) and high (z0 &gt;= 0.02). Densities were estimated with k-nearest neighbors and Voronoi tessellations and classified as void (Sigma &lt; 0.05), filament (0.05 &lt;= Sigma &lt; 0.5), group (0.5 &lt;= Sigma &lt; 2.0), and cluster (Sigma &gt;= 2.0). Our northern-sky sample contains 311 isolated barred galaxies from 2MIG plus Milky Way analog systems (z &lt; 0.07). We find 157 void, 84 filament, 27 group, and 11 cluster galaxies; 30 have no detected neighbors. Sixty-seven lie in extremely low-density regions (Sigma_3D &lt; 0.01 gal Mpc^-3), and 22 have the nearest companion beyond 5 Mpc, indicating residence in extended voids. The Milky Way (Sigma_5NN ~ 0.13 gal Mpc^-3, R ~ 2.1 Mpc) and its close analog NGC 3521 both lie in filamentary environments at the edge of a nearby void. For z &gt; 0.02 we identify three additional Milky Way analog candidates from the density metrics: CGCG 208-043 (3D Voronoi) and NGC 5231 and CGCG 047-026 (5th-nearest neighbor). These results show that local environmental density is an effective, physically motivated criterion for selecting Milky Way analogs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecules harbouring sulfur are thought to have played a key role in the biological processes of life on Earth, and thus, they are of much interest when found in space. Here we report on the astronomical detection of a six-membered sulfur-bearing cyclic hydrocarbon in the interstellar medium. Observations of the Galactic Centre molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 reveal the presence of 2,5-cyclohexadien-1-thione, which is a structural isomer of thiophenol ($c$-C$_6$H$_6$S). For the astronomical identification, we first performed precise laboratory measurements of the thiophenol discharge products system. These measurements, conducted in the radio band using a chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave spectrometer, enabled us to characterize this highly polar molecular species and provided unambiguous fingerprints needed to identify this organosulfur compound in space, which now ranks as the largest interstellar sulfur-bearing molecule. These results herald the discovery of a family of prebiotically relevant sulfur-bearing species, which potentially act as a bridge between the chemical inventory of the interstellar medium and the composition of the minor bodies of the Solar System.</description>

Abstract: We present an analysis of archival JWST NIRSpec IFS and HST imaging observations of the z = 3 Lyman-Continuum Emitter (LCE) candidate LACES104037. We show that a nearby galaxy, denoted LACES104037-S, has a redshift offset from the main galaxy by only $\sim 450$ km/s. Together with the identification of tidal bridge features between the galaxies, this indicates that the galaxies are interacting and most likely in the early stages of a merger. We show that the restframe LCE cluster sits in a tidal bridge towards the companion, about 2.7 kpc from the galaxy's core. It is faint in non-ionizing stellar continuum, and shows faint but non-negligible H{\alpha} and [O III] emission, suggesting that much of the gas surrounding the LCE cluster has been dispersed by feedback in the shallower gravitational potential of the tidal bridge. From comparing the direct LyC escape and the local H{\alpha} emission, we find a total ionizing LyC escape fraction of $f_{\mathrm{esc}} = 57 \pm 8\%$ from the LCE cluster. We estimate the age of the LCE cluster to be $\lesssim 6.5$ Myr, indicating that the cluster must have formed in situ in the tidal bridge well after the time of closest interaction. LyC escape from tidal stripping or in-situ formed stars in tidal features would depend less on intrinsic galaxy properties than typically observed in low-z LCE surveys, and could help explain the higher cosmic escape fraction as well as the enhanced diversity of LCE galaxy properties observed at Cosmic Noon.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical bayesian inference: constraining population distribution of dark matter halo shapes via stellar streams</title>

Abstract: Stellar streams, the debris of tidally disrupted satellites, trace their host's gravitational potential and thus probe dark matter halo structure. While six-dimensional phase-space data of Galactic streams enable precise dark matter halo modelling in the Milky Way, streams around external galaxies are typically available only as low surface brightness features without kinematics (i.e. two-dimensional photometric data), providing only weak constraints when considered individually. We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework that infers the population distribution of halo flattening using only projected stream tracks. Streams are forward-modelled in StreaMAX, a new JAX-accelerated particle-spray package that achieves orders of magnitude faster stream generation when compared to traditional methods. For each stream we fit an axisymmetric dark matter halo model and obtain a posterior on the flattening. These posteriors are then combined through hierarchical reweighting to constrain the population distribution. Using mock data, we show that individual fits recover the correct flattening with modest precision and exhibit projection-induced multi-modalities. Nevertheless, aggregating these fits yields accurate and confident constraints on the underlying population distribution of dark matter halo morphologies, clearly distinguishing between oblate, spherical, and prolate populations. The total computational cost scales linearly with sample size. Our results demonstrate that ensembles of purely photometric streams carry sufficient information to constrain dark matter halo shapes in external galaxies at the population level. With the forthcoming samples from Euclid and Rubin/LSST, this approach offers a practical path to population-level inferences of halo morphology without any kinematic measurements.</description>

      <title>Testing the Shock-cooling Emission Model from Star-Disk Collisions for Quasiperiodic Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12762v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic eruptions (QPEs), the repeated outbursts observed in soft X-ray bands, have attracted broad interest, but their physical origin is under debate. One of the popular models, the star-disk collision model, suggests that QPEs can be produced through periodic collisions of an orbiting star with the accretion disk of a central black hole (BH). However, previous tests of the star-disk collision model mainly focus on the timing analysis. Other observed properties, such as peak luminosities $L_{\rm{p}}$, durations $t_{\rm{e}}$, and radiation temperatures $T_{\rm{p}}$ of the eruptions, are not systematically investigated. For a sample of six QPE sources and two QPE-like sources, we test the shock-cooling emission model from star-disk collisions by using these observables to derive the constraints on the stellar radius $R_\star$. We find that, except for two sources (eRO-QPE3 and eRO-QPE4), the rest of the sample either has no allowed $R_\star$ to simultaneously reproduce the observed $L_{\rm{p}}$ and $t_{\rm{e}}$, or the required $R_\star$ is too large to avoid being disrupted by the central BH. For the two exceptions, a stellar radius of the order of $1\ R_{\rm{\odot}}$ is necessary to satisfy all the constraints. Another issue with the simplest version of this model is that it predicts $k T_{\rm{p}} \sim 10\ \rm{eV}$, one order of magnitude lower than the observed value.</description>

      <title>Probing Stellar Kinematics with the Time-Asymmetric Hanbury Brown and Twiss Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intensity interferometry (II) offers a powerful means to observe stellar objects with a high resolution. In this work, we demonstrate that II can also probe internal stellar kinematics by revealing a time-asymmetric Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) effect, causing a measurable shift in the temporal correlation peak away from zero delay. We develop numerical models to simulate this effect for two distinct astrophysical scenarios: an emission-line circumstellar disk and an absorption-line binary system. Our simulations reveal a clear sensitivity of this temporal asymmetry to the system's inclination angle, velocity symmetry, and internal dynamics. This suggests that, with sufficiently high time resolution, II can be used to extract quantitative information about internal kinematics, offering a new observational window on stellar dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Dawes Review 13: A New Look at The Dynamic Radio Sky</title>

Abstract: Astronomical objects that change rapidly give us insight into extreme environments, allowing us to identify new phenomena, test fundamental physics, and probe the Universe on all scales. Transient and variable radio sources range from the cosmological, such as gamma-ray bursts, to much more local events, such as massive flares from stars in our Galactic neighbourhood. The capability to observe the sky repeatedly, over many frequencies and timescales, has allowed us to explore and understand dynamic phenomena in a way that has not been previously possible. In the past decade, there have been great strides forward as we prepared for the revolution in time domain radio astronomy that is being enabled by the SKA Observatory telescopes, the SKAO pathfinders and precursors, and other `next generation' radio telescopes. Hence it is timely to review the current status of the field, and summarise the developments that have happened to get to our current point. This review focuses on image domain (or `slow') transients, on timescales of seconds to years. We discuss the physical mechanisms that cause radio variability, and the classes of radio transients that result. We then outline what an ideal image domain radio transients survey would look like, and summarise the history of the field, from targeted observations to surveys with existing radio telescopes. We discuss methods and approaches for transient discovery and classification, and identify some of the challenges in scaling up current methods for future telescopes. Finally, we present our current understanding of the dynamic radio sky, in terms of source populations and transient rates, and look at what we can expect from surveys on future radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>Chemical Signatures of AGB Mass Transfer in Gaia White Dwarf Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a homogeneous abundance analysis of 160 main-sequence stars in astrometric white-dwarf + main-sequence (WD+MS) binaries with orbits from Gaia DR3. These systems have AU-scale separations and are thought to have undergone mass transfer (MT) when the WD progenitor was an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. Using high-resolution spectroscopy, we measure chemical abundances of the MS stars, focusing on s-process elements. Since s-process nucleosynthesis occurs mainly in AGB stars, s-process enhancement in the MS star is a key signature of accretion from an AGB companion. We identify 43 barium dwarfs -- 39 of them newly discovered -- roughly doubling the known population in astrometric WD+MS binaries and extending it to lower metallicities than previously studied. The s-process abundances show large star-to-star variations that correlate with component masses and with metallicity but not with orbital separation. At the lowest metallicities, three barium dwarfs display strong CH and $\rm C_2$ absorption bands, confirming a link between barium stars and CEMP-s stars and implying that AGB mass transfer usually leads to strong carbon enhancement at low metallicity. By comparing the observed abundance patterns to AGB nucleosynthesis models, we show that the diversity of s-process enhancements can be explained by variations in donor mass, metallicity, and most importantly, the number of thermal pulses the AGB star experienced before the onset of MT. Variation in the depth of the accretors' convective envelopes, with which accreted material is diluted, strengthens correlations with MS star mass and metallicity. Our results establish Gaia WD+MS binaries -- which are homogeneously selected and probe shorter orbital periods than previous barium-star samples -- as a powerful laboratory for constraining mass transfer physics and the origin of chemically peculiar stars.</description>

      <title>A Tidal Disruption Event from an Intermediate-mass Black Hole Revealed by Comprehensive Multi-wavelength Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star crosses the tidal radius of a black hole (BH) and is ripped apart, providing a powerful way to probe dormant BHs over a wide mass range. In this study, we present our late-time observations and comprehensive multi-wavelength analyses of AT2018cqh, a TDE at the center of a dwarf galaxy that exhibited successive flares in the optical, X-ray, and radio bands. We discovered an unexpected high-state X-ray plateau phase following the peak until the present time. Along with its reported prolonged rise lasting at least 550 days, these unique characteristics are consistent with the scenario of a TDE caused by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of approximately $(1-6) \times 10^5$ solar masses. Furthermore, scaling relations derived from the host-galaxy properties indicated a similar BH mass in concert. This discovery highlights the invaluable role of TDEs in the search for elusive IMBHs.</description>

      <title>Rate of Repeating Tidal Disruption Events with 5--19 years interval constrained by CRTS and ZTF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12691</link>

Abstract: Statistics on tidal disruption events (TDEs) may be contaminated by repeating TDEs (rTDEs), which have been extensively discovered recently. However, the origin of rTDEs remains unclear. In addition, no statistical research on rTDEs with time intervals $&gt;5$ years has been made yet. In this work, we searched for rTDEs with time intervals of 5--19 years using CRTS data in a sample of 16 ZTF BTS TDEs at $z&lt;0.05$. We found 2 rTDE candidates, AT 2019azh and AT 2024pvu, with time intervals of 13.2 and 17.1 years, respectively. The peak luminosities of CRTS flares are close to those of ZTF flares. For the CRTS flare of AT 2024pvu, using GALEX UV observations near the peak, we measured a blackbody temperature of $\sim19500$ K, consistent with TDEs and higher than SNe. Moreover, we estimated the expected number of SNe in the sample to be $\lesssim0.08$, and hence the probability that both CRTS flares are SNe is only 0.3\%. Therefore, the possibility that both CRTS flares are SNe can be ruled out, and it is likely that both are TDEs. Using the two rTDEs, we inferred that the TDE rate is 2--3 orders of magnitude higher than the average over 5--19 years prior to TDE detection. Considering another two rTDEs with intervals of $\sim$2 years in the sample and possible rTDEs missed by CRTS, rTDEs with intervals of $&lt;20$ years may account for 25\%--60\% of the TDE sample. We prefer to explain rTDEs as repeating partial TDEs. If so, the high fraction of rTDEs suggests that the observed optical TDE rate has been overestimated. However, the possibility of independent TDEs cannot be ruled out and requires future observational tests.</description>
