      <title>An ab initio description of the family of Cr selenides: structure, magnetism and electronic structure from bulk to the single-layer limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compounds based on Cr have been found to be among the first single-layer magnets. In addition, transition metal dichalcogenides are promising candidates to show long-range ferromagnetic order down to the two-dimensional limit. We use ab initio calculations to provide a description of the various Cr$_x$Se$_{x+1}$ stoichiometries that may occur by analyzing from the bulk materials to the monolayer limit. We study the different structural distortions, including charge density waves that each system can present by analyzing their phonon spectra and dynamic stability. We provide a description of their basic electronic structure and study their magnetic properties, including the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. The evolution of all these properties with the dimensionality of the systems is discussed. This intends to be a comprehensive view of the broad family of Cr selenides.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit torques in bulk collinear antiferromagnets:complete classifications and the induced spin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric field induced spin-orbit torques are the crucial mechanism for electric regulations of antiferromagnetic order. However, the spin-orbit torques in antiferromagnets and the induced spin dynamics remain largely unexplored. In this work, the full classifications of SOTs in bulk collinear AFMs have been achieved based on magnetic point group. Dependent on the symmetries connecting the opposite spin sublattices, the SOTs are classified into six distinct types. Among them, the SOTs and the induced Neel vector dynamics in three representative AFMs have been investigated, where the spin sublattices are connected by fractional translation, spatial inversion, and neither by translation nor inversion symmetry respectively. The SOTs on spin sublattices have been calculated by first-principles calculations based on Kubo linear response theory, and then the induced spin dynamics are simulated by LLG equations. In typical PT symmetric AFM and the inversion symmetry breaking altermagnet, the simulations indicate that the deterministic switching of Neel vectors can be driven by field like torques. What's more, the fully electric writing of multiple antiferromagnetic domains into single domain state with preset Neel vector direction and 180 deterministic switching may also be realized. Our work may shed light on the current control of antiferromagnetic orders in collinear AFMs. Especially, for inversion symmetry breaking altermagnet, the electric writing and reading of Neel vector are highly desirable for antiferromagnetic memory applications.</description>

      <title>Event-sparse stack denoising for 4D-STEM applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a denoising method for four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) that relies on processing local, scan position-independent electron event-sparse data stacks, called event-sparse stack denoising. This method adds an extra time dimension during data collection by recording multiple electron event-sparse diffraction patterns. The resulting datasets are effectively five-dimensional, referred to as locally time-resolved STEM (LTR-STEM). Diffraction data stacks at each scan position are processed using one of two sparsity denoising pipelines: 1) the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm followed by multi-step persistence thresholding, or 2) sparse principal component analysis (sparse PCA), followed by single-step thresholding. Both methods perform well for diffraction data denoising, as shown by simulated peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) curves, denoised experimental data for virtual imaging, and application-specific denoising for defect detection. PSNR analysis indicates that sparsity-denoised 4D-STEM data reaches the same PSNR as raw data at approximately 16% of the exposure time, demonstrating comparable image quality with a lower dose. In defect detection, a 4.1x increase in sensitivity to relative radial disk shift is observed in the denoised data. Moreover, the LTR-STEM technique may be used to inspect material degradation by tracking changes in diffraction disk intensity, allowing for critical dose estimation and exposure-selective imaging.</description>

      <title>Exciton spin structure in lead halide perovskite semiconductors explored via the spin dynamics in magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the spin structure and spin dynamics of excitons in bulk lead halide perovskite semiconductors with cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic crystal symmetry. The exciton spin structure and its modification by an external magnetic field are modeled for different regimes defined by the relative magnitude of the electron-hole exchange interaction (splitting between dark and bright states) and the Zeeman spin splitting. The effects of crystal symmetry and magnetic field orientation with respect to the crystal axes are considered for lead halide perovskite crystals with band gaps in the range 1.4 - 3.5 eV, having different ratios of electron and hole g-factors. For cubic symmetry, in a longitudinal magnetic field, our theory predicts quantum beats between the bright exciton states under linearly polarized excitation and detection, while the dark exciton remains optically inactive. In a transverse magnetic field, all exciton spin states become optically active and can be excited by circularly polarized light. Reduction of the crystal symmetry leads to a zero-field offset of the exciton Larmor precession frequencies, modifying the Zeeman splitting energy dependence on magnetic field. This theoretical framework allows for the extraction of the strength of the exchange interaction and the crystal symmetry. Experimentally, we measure the exciton spin coherence via time-resolved photoluminescence at a temperature of 1.6 K in longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields in orthorhombic MAPbI3 crystals. Polarization beats at the frequency of the bright exciton are observed in both configurations. Comparison with theory indicates that the excitons are in the strong exchange interaction regime, and the reduction of symmetry does not lead to a significant splitting of the exciton spin levels.</description>

      <title>Size-Dependent Skin Effect Transitions in Weakly Coupled Non-Reciprocal Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique boundary phenomena absent in their Hermitian counterparts, most notably the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). In this work, we explore a lattice model consisting of two coupled non-reciprocal chains, focusing on the interplay between system size, inter-chain coupling, and spectral topology. Using both analytical and numerical approaches, we systematically examine the evolution of the complex energy spectra and spectral winding numbers under periodic and open boundary conditions. Our results uncover a variety of size-dependent localization transitions, including the emergence and instability of concurrent bipolar skin effects in the $W=0$ region, and their crossover to unipolar and conventional bipolar NHSE as the system size increases. Notably, we demonstrate that these size-dependent behaviors persist even beyond the weak-coupling regime, highlighting their universality in non-Hermitian systems with complex spectral structures. This study provides insights into the mechanisms governing skin effects and offers practical guidelines for engineering non-Hermitian topological phases in synthetic lattices.</description>
