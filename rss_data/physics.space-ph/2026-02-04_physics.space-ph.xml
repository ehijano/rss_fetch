      <title>Ionospheric Observations from the ISS: Overcoming Noise Challenges in Signal Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electric Propulsion Electrostatic Analyzer Experiment (\`EP\`EE) is a compact ion energy bandpass filter deployed on the International Space Station (ISS) in March 2023 and providing continuous measurements through April 2024. This period coincides with the Solar Cycle 25 maximum, capturing unique observations of solar activity extremes in the mid- to low-latitude regions of the topside ionosphere. From these in situ spectra we derive plasma parameters that inform space-weather impacts on satellite navigation and radio communication. We present a statistical processing pipeline for \`EP\`EE that (i) estimates the instrument noise floor, (ii) accounts for irregular temporal sampling, and (iii) extracts ionospheric signals. Rather than discarding noisy data, the method learns a baseline noise model and fits the measurement surface using a scaled Vecchia Gaussian process approximation, recovering values typically rejected by thresholding. The resulting products increase data coverage and enable noise-assisted monitoring of ionospheric variability.</description>

      <title>Generation and Expansion-Driven Growth of Switchbacks in the Outer Solar Corona and Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze \emph{Parker Solar Probe} and \emph{Solar Orbiter} measurements of magnetic-field reversals (``switchbacks'') across the Alfv\'en surface ($M_a\simeq 1$), where $M_a$ is the Alfv\'en Mach number. The reported ``sub-Alfv\'enic switchback dropout'' follows from two diagnostic biases: conditioning on an instantaneous $M_a$, which is transiently elevated above unity by radial-velocity enhancements during large-amplitude Alfv\'enic rotations, and short-window local-mean backgrounds that partially track these rotations and suppress deflection angles. Treating $M_a$ as a bulk-stream property via rolling medians and referencing deflections to event-independent backgrounds -- a Parker-spiral direction or a sufficiently long rolling median -- recovers sub-Alfv\'enic switchbacks systematically. The mean deflection $\langle \theta \rangle$ separates into two regimes with $M_a$. For $M_a \lesssim 1$, $\langle \theta \rangle$ rises rapidly with weak dependence on the background window, consistent with expansion-driven amplification of Alfv\'enic fluctuations. For $M_a \gtrsim 1$, the evolution becomes scale dependent: large-scale $\langle \theta \rangle$ continues to grow with $M_a$ at reduced rate, while small-scale growth saturates, consistent with turbulent decay and dissipation. Collectively, these results indicate that switchbacks need not originate only in the super-Alfv\'enic solar wind. Instead, they are consistent with a formation pathway in which coronal fluctuations are amplified by large-scale expansion through the sub-Alfv\'enic regime, with subsequent propagation into the super-Alfv\'enic wind where turbulent decay modifies their scale-dependent properties.</description>

      <title>An Open Database of Lunar Regolith and Simulants Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lunar regolith, the layer of unconsolidated material covering the Moon's surface, is central to the science and technology developed for the Moon, notably related to in-situ science investigations, resource utilization, surface infrastructure, and mobility systems. However, data on lunar soil properties remain fragmented across decades of mission reports, often in formats that are difficult to access or interpret. We present a newly compiled database of lunar regolith physical and geotechnical properties, including data collected by direct in-situ measurements from crewed missions, estimates inferred from surface interactions on the Moon and using remote sensing, as well as laboratory analyses of samples returned to Earth. The data collected include, among others, the angle of internal friction and cohesion (both Mohr-Coulomb model parameters), bulk density, and static bearing capacity, extracted from Luna and Apollo-era historical mission documentation all the way to contemporary Lunar programs. The dataset specifies the type and location of the tests from which each value was obtained. Our database also includes parameters for lunar regolith simulants, providing a direct link between mission data and laboratory studies. In addition to centralizing this information, we developed a user interface that facilitates data retrieval, filtering, and visualization. This interface enables users to generate customized plots for comparative analysis. Developed in an open-science perspective, it is designed to evolve in response to the community's needs. The database and its associated tools significantly enhance the accessibility and usability of lunar regolith and simulants data for scientific and engineering research.</description>

      <title>Nonmodal growth and optimal perturbations in magnetohydrodynamic shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In astrophysical shear flows, the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability is generally suppressed by magnetic tension provided a sufficiently strong streamwise magnetic field. This is often used to infer upper (or lower) bounds on field strengths in systems where shear-driven fluctuations are (or are not) observed, on the basis that perturbations cannot grow in the absence of linear instability. On the contrary, by calculating the maximum growth that small-amplitude perturbations can achieve in finite time for such a system, we show that perturbations can grow in energy by orders of magnitude even when the flow is sub-Alfv\'enic, raising the possibility that shear-driven turbulence may be found even in the presence of strong magnetic fields, and challenging inferences from the observed presence or absence of shear-driven fluctuations. We further show that magnetic fields introduce additional nonmodal growth mechanisms relative to the hydrodynamic case, and that 2D simulations miss key aspects of these growth mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Solitary Alfv\'en Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the solitary Alfv\'en wave, an exact nonlinear solution of the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, and construct a three-dimensional numerical model -- an \emph{Alfv\'enon}. The model is characterized by an unperturbed far field, quasi-constant $|\boldsymbol{B}|$, and open field-line topology. Direct MHD simulations of the Alfv\'enon demonstrate remarkable stability, confirming that it behaves as a nonlinear solitary Alfv\'enic solution under ideal MHD evolution.</description>
