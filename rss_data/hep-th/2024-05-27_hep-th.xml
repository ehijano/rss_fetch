      <title>A mass for the dual axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study a modification of axion physics in which the dual axion acquires a mass. This mass explicitly breaks the shift symmetry of the dual axion. The potential breaking of this shift symmetry poses a dual axion quality problem. When the dual axion acquires a mass, the axion gets eaten and becomes the longitudinal degree of freedom of a massive vector field. In this phase, axion strings are screened and far-separated instanton configurations are exponentially suppressed. This confinement of instantons corresponds to the worldline action of a particle-like soliton traveling between the instantons analogous to Abrikosov/Nielsen-Oleson vortex solitons that stretch between confined magnetic monopoles in a superconductor. We calculate the cost of this additional worldline suppression and provide several models in which both the confined instantons and confining worldline are dynamical.</description>

      <title>Mapping 1+1-dimensional black hole thermodynamics to finite volume effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both black hole thermodynamics and finite volume effects in quantum field theory violate the null energy condition. Motivated by this, we compare thermodynamic features between two 1+1-dimensional systems: (i) a scalar field confined to a periodic spatial interval of length $a$ and tunneling between two degenerate vacua; (ii) a dilatonic black hole at temperature $T$ in the presence of matter fields. If we identify $a\propto T^{-1}$, we find similar thermodynamic behaviours, which suggests some deeper connection arising from the presence of non-trivial boundary conditions in both systems.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet Scalar Determinants On Two-Dimensional Constant Curvature Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute exactly the scalar determinants $\det(\Delta+M^{2})$ on the two-dimensional round disks of constant curvature $R=0$, $\mp 2$, for any finite boundary length $\ell$ and mass $M$, with Dirichlet boundary conditions, using the $\zeta$-function prescription. When $M^{2}=\pm q(q+1)$, $q\in\mathbb N$, a simple expression involving only elementary functions and the Euler $\Gamma$ function is found. Applications to two-dimensional Liouville and Jackiw-Teitelboim quantum gravity are presented in a separate paper.</description>

      <title>Timelike Kasner singularities and Floquet States in 2+1d AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model of a holographic 2+1d CFT interacting with an oscillating background gauge field. It is solved by an AdS-Vaidya metric describing Ohmic heating of the boundary field theory. However, we also show that if timelike singularities of Kasner type are permitted then a time independent solution that may be interpreted as a Floquet state of the system can be constructed. In this state the system exhibits either Hall conductivity or kinetic induction, and we numerically evaluate the Kasner exponents for a range of boundary conditions. This model may contribute to the ongoing discussion on the validity and meaning of the Kasner metric in the AdS/CFT correspondence and its application in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Correlation functions of boundary conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying the holographic method, we investigate one- and two-point correlation functions of a boundary conformal field theory. To describe boundary conformal field theory, we consider an end of the world brane in an asymptotic AdS space which behaves as a boundary of the dual conformal field theory. Using this geometry, we calculate correlation functions including the reflection effect at the boundary. We show that, when the end of the world brane has no degrees of freedom, the holographic calculation reproduces the correlation functions known in the boundary conformal field theory. We further consider an end of the world brane having nontrivial degrees of freedom and evaluate the correlation functions affected by the boundary entropy. We show that the reflected two-point function is related to the square of the one-point function with a coefficient relying on the boundary entropy.</description>

      <title>Time evolution of two-point function in expanding universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By applying the braneworld model, we investigate the time evolution of two-point functions holographically in expanding universes. In order to explain the FLRW cosmologies, we take into account a $p$-brane gas geometry. When we take the boundary of a $p$-brane gas geometry as the braneworld we are living in, $p$-branes are detected as $(p-1)$-dimensional objects to an observer living in the braneworld. These objects lead to the FLRW cosmology which is related to the radial motion of the braneworld in the $p$-brane gas geometry. Utilizing this $p$-brane gas geometry, we investigate the time-dependent two-point functions of FLRW cosmologies. For $p=4$, we reproduce the known two-point functions of the dS space and find a new analytic two-point function for $p=2$ which corresponds to an expanding universe with uniformly distributed cosmic strings. Moreover, we show that the two-point function suppresses in the late time era with a specific power that is associated with the equation of state parameter of the uniformly distributed matter.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic Holographic Renormalization for a Scalar Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the holographic correspondence, we introduce a purely extrinsic renormalization prescription, exemplified with the case of a minimally-coupled scalar field in AdS space. The counterterms depend only on the field and its radial derivatives. Consistency with the Dirichlet variational principle is achieved considering that the asymptotic structure of asymptotically locally AdS spacetimes relates the tangential and radial derivatives of the field. Crucially, as seen from a path integral definition of the bulk partition function involved in the standard GKPW formula, this relation is valid beyond the saddle. We find that the extrinsic renormalization prescription is maximally efficient when the scalar field is massless, which is suggestive of a connection with the Kounterterm method for renormalization of pure gravity.</description>

      <title>Superradiance Protects Unitary Evolution on the Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been argued that the rate at which the interior of an AdS black hole evolves is dual to the rate of unitary evolution of the strongly coupled matter on the boundary which, according to holography, is dual to the black hole. However, we have shown elsewhere that it seems to be possible, by adjusting the specific angular momentum of an AdS$_5$-Kerr black hole, to reduce this rate to (effectively) zero. We argue that this is unphysical, and that it is prevented by the intervention of a superradiant instability with a ``grey galaxy'' as the end state. We also argue that this claim (that unitary evolution is preserved by superradiance, and not by some other instability) might be confirmed by an experimental observation of a specific temperature-dependent upper bound on the specific angular momentum of actual strongly coupled matter -- $\,$ in particular, by the observation of such a bound in samples of the Quark-Gluon Plasma with extremely large vorticities.</description>

      <title>The ABCDEFGJK of maximally strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify all possible charge lattices and 1-form symmetry groups for $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs with characteristic dimension $\varkappa \neq \{1,2\}$. For rank-$r$ SCFTs that are not stacks of lower rank theories the order of the 1-form symmetry group can be 1,2,3,4 and $r+1$. As an application of the classification we show that $\mathcal{N}=2$ $S$-folds and Minahan-Nemeschansky SCFTs have trivial 1-form symmetry. We find two sporadic lattices compatible with the Coulomb branch geometries $\mathbb{C}^5/G_{33}$ and $\mathbb{C}^6/G_{34}$ that are not realized by any known SCFT. The former, if realized, would have a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ 1-form symmetry and a non-invertible topological defect.</description>

      <title>Modified 3D Massive Abelian 2-From Theory with a Single Pseudo-Scalar Field: BRST Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the off-shell nilpotent Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST symmetry transformations (corresponding to the infinitesimal classical gauge symmetry transformations) for the St${\ddot u}$ckelberg-modified massive three $(2 + 1)$-dimensional (3D) Abelian 2-form gauge theory with a single pseudo-scalar field. The latter field (having the negative kinetic term and a well-defined mass) has already been shown (i) to exist in the modified version of the standard 3D St${\ddot u}$ckelberg formalism (on solid mathematical grounds), (ii) to be a possible candidate for dark matter, and (iii) to correspond to the ``phantom" field of some of the cosmological models of the Universe. A couple of highlights of our present endeavor are (i) the observation that, even though the pseudo-scalar field does not transform under the gauge and (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations, it appears in the first-class constraints which annihilate the physical states at the quantum level, and (ii) the Noether conserved (anti-)BRST charges are found to be non-nilpotent. In our present investigation, we derive (i) the coupled (but equivalent) BRST and anti-BRST invariant Lagrangian densities, (ii) the conserved and off-shell nilpotent versions of the (anti-)BRST charges and the conserved ghost charge, (iii) the (anti-)BRST invariant Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restrictions, and (iv) the standard BRST algebra amongst the conserved and nilpotent (anti-)BRST and conserved ghost charges of our theory.</description>

      <title>Eikonal amplitudes on the celestial sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Celestial scattering amplitudes for massless particles are Mellin transforms of momentum-space scattering amplitudes with respect to the energies of the external particles, and behave as conformal correlators on the celestial sphere. However, there are few explicit cases of well-defined celestial amplitudes, particularly for gravitational theories: the mixing between low- and high-energy scales induced by the Mellin transform generically yields divergent integrals. In this paper, we argue that the most natural object to consider is the gravitational amplitude dressed by an oscillating phase arising from semi-classical effects known as eikonal exponentiation. This leads to gravitational celestial amplitudes which are analytic, apart from a set of poles at integer negative conformal dimensions, whose degree and residues we characterize. We also study the large conformal dimension limits, and provide an asymptotic series representation for these celestial eikonal amplitudes. Our investigation covers two different frameworks, related by eikonal exponentiation: $2\to2$ scattering of scalars in flat spacetime and $1\to1$ scattering of a probe scalar particle in a curved, stationary spacetime. These provide data which any putative celestial dual for Minkowski, shockwave or black hole spacetimes must reproduce. We also derive dispersion and monodromy relations for these celestial amplitudes and discuss Carrollian eikonal-probe amplitudes in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-invertible defects in two-dimensional $S_N$ orbifold CFTs. We construct universal defects which do not depend on the details of the seed CFT and hence exist in any orbifold CFT. Additionally, we investigate non-universal defects arising from the topological defects of the seed CFT. We argue that there exist universal defects that are non-trivial in the large-$N$ limit, making them relevant for the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence. We then focus on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times \mathcal M_4$ with one unit of NS-NS flux and propose an explicit realization of these defects on the worldsheet.</description>

      <title>Expansion by regions meets angular integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the small-mass asymptotic behavior of so-called angular integrals, appearing in phase-space calculations in perturbative quantum field theory. For this purpose we utilize the strategy of expansion by regions, which is a universal method both for multiloop Feynman integrals and various parametric integrals. To apply the technique to angular integrals, we convert them into suitable parametric integral representations, which are accessible to existing automation tools. We use the the code \texttt{asy.m} to reveal regions contributing to the asymptotic expansion of angular integrals. To evaluate the contributions of these regions in an epsilon expansion we apply the method of Mellin-Barnes representation. Our approach is checked against existing results on angular integrals revealing a connection between contributing regions and angular integrals constructed from an algebraic decomposition. We explicitly calculate the previously unknown asymptotics for angular integrals with three and four denominators and formulate a conjecture for the leading asymptotics and the pole part for a general number of denominators and masses.</description>

      <title>Arresting Quantum Chaos Dynamically in Transmon Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ergodic quantum many-body systems evolving under unitary time dynamics typically lose memory of their initial state via information scrambling. Here we consider a paradigmatic translationally invariant many-body Hamiltonian of interacting bosons -- a Josephson junction array in the transmon regime -- in the presence of a strong Floquet drive. Generically, such a time-dependent drive is expected to heat the system to an effectively infinite temperature, featureless state in the late-time limit. However, using numerical exact-diagonalization we find evidence of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency where the system develops {\it emergent} conservation laws, and {\it approximate} integrability. Remarkably, at these same set of points, the Lyapunov exponent associated with the semi-classical dynamics for the coupled many-body equations of motion drops by orders of magnitude, arresting the growth of chaos. We supplement our numerical results with an analytical Floquet-Magnus expansion that includes higher-order corrections, and capture the slow dynamics that controls decay away from exact freezing.</description>

      <title>Realizing triality and $p$-ality by lattice twisted gauging in (1+1)d quantum spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the twisted gauging on the (1+1)d lattice and construct various non-local mappings on the lattice operators. To be specific, we define the twisted Gauss law operator and implement the twisted gauging of the finite group on the lattice motivated by the orbifolding procedure in the conformal field theory, which involves the data of non-trivial element in the second cohomology group of the gauge group. We show the twisted gauging is equivalent to the two-step procedure of first applying the SPT entangler and then untwisted gauging. We use the twisted gauging to construct the triality (order 3) and $p$-ality (order $p$) mapping on the $\mathbb{Z}_p\times \mathbb{Z}_p$ symmetric Hamiltonians, where $p$ is a prime. Such novel non-local mappings generalize Kramers-Wannier duality and they preserve the locality of symmetric operators but map charged operators to non-local ones. We further construct quantum process to realize these non-local mappings and analyze the induced mappings on the phase diagrams. For theories that are invariant under these non-local mappings, they admit the corresponding non-invertible symmetries. The non-invertible symmetry will constrain the theory at the multicritical point between the gapped phases. We further give the condition when the non-invertible symmetry can have symmetric gapped phase with a unique ground state.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Groups in the presence of Cosmological Constant: Re-Mapping the close-by galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundaries of galaxy groups and clusters are defined by the interplay between the Newtonian attractive force and the local repulsion force caused by the expansion of the Universe. This research extends the definition of zero radial acceleration surface (ZRAS) and the turnaround surface (TS) for a general distribution of the masses in an expanding background, governed by the cosmological constant. We apply these definitions for different galaxy groups in the local Universe, mapping these groups up to ten megaparsec. We discuss the dipole and the quadrupole rate for the Local Group of Galaxies and the implementations for Hubble diagram correction and galaxy groups viralization. With these definitions, we indicate the surfaces showing the interplay between the local expansion vs the local Newtonian attraction for galaxy groups in the local Universe. The results show that it is important to include the cosmological constant in analyzing the Cosmic Flow of the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependent chirality as a smoking gun for Abelian gauge fields during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-inflation models are a compelling candidate as a mechanism behind the accelerated expansion in the early universe in light of the possibility to embed them in higher dimensional UV complete theories and the exciting prospect of testing them with next-generation cosmological probes. Adding an Abelian gauge sector to axion-inflation models makes for a rich, interesting, phenomenology spanning from primordial black holes to gravitational waves (GWs). Several recent studies employ an approximate analytic (Gaussian) template to characterize the effect of gauge field production on cosmological perturbations. In this work we go beyond such approximation and numerically study particle production and the ensuing scalar and tensor spectra. We find a significant deviation from results based on log-normally distributed vector field excitations. As an important phenomenological application of the improved method, we study the expected chirality and spectral index of the sourced GW background at scales relevant for current and next-generation GW detectors. One striking feature is that of a scale-dependent chirality. We derive a consistency relation between these two observables that can serve as an important tool in identifying key signatures of multi-field dynamics in axion inflation.</description>

      <title>Beta decay and related processes from an angular momentum perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We ask the question of how angular momentum is conserved in weak interaction processes, beginning with inverse beta decay for massless neutrinos and electrons, in which both the incident neutrino and final electron are in helicity eigenstates with respect, however, to {\em different} directions. To elucidate the problem we recast the final electron state in terms of a spherical Dirac wave. We then generalize these results to massive neutrinos and electrons, and finally examine electron-positron annihilation processes through the same lens. In all these processes, the apparent non-conservation of angular momentum is a result of the quantum measurement process in which the measuring apparatus is not in an initially well-defined quantum state, but is coupled to the outside world; the measuring process, being outside the rules of elementary quantum mechanics, does not allow a satisfactory accounting of the angular momentum transfer.</description>

      <title>Quantum Self-Propulsion of an Inhomogeneous Object out of Thermal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an earlier paper, we explored how quantum vacuum torque can arise: a body or nanoparticle that is out of thermal equilibrium with its environment experiences a spontaneous torque. But this requires that the body be composed of nonreciprocal material, which seems to necessitate the presence of an external influence, such as a magnetic field. Then the electric polarizability of the particle has a real part that is nonsymmetric. This effect occurs to first order in the polarizability. To that order, no self-propulsive force can arise. Here, we consider second-order effects, and show that spontaneous forces can arise in vacuum, without requiring exotic electromagnetic properties. Thermal nonequilibrium is still necessary, but the electric susceptibility of the body need only be inhomogeneous. We investigate four examples of such a body: a needle composed of distinct halves; a sphere and a ball, each hemisphere being made of a different substance; and a thin slab, each face of which is different. The results found are consistent with previous numerical investigations. Here, we take into account the skin depth of metal surfaces. We also consider the frictional forces that would cause the body to acquire a terminal velocity, which might be observable. More likely to be important is relaxation to thermal equilibrium, which can still lead to a readily observable terminal velocity. A general treatment of such forces on a moving body, expressed in momentum space, is provided, which incorporates both propulsive and frictional forces. The source of the propulsive force is the nonsymmetric pattern of radiation from different parts of the body, the higher reflectivity of the metal portion playing a crucial role.</description>

      <title>The Exact Relativistic Scalar Quasibound States of The Dyonic Kerr-Sen Black Hole: Quantized Energy, and Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Klein-Gordon equation in the Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole background, which is the charged rotating axially symmetric solution of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory of gravity. The black hole incorporates electric, magnetic, dilatonic and axionic charges and is constructed in 3+1 dimensional spacetime. We begin our investigations with the construction of the scalar field's governing equation, i.e., the covariant Klein-Gordon equation. With the help of the ansatz of separation of variables, we successfully separate the polar part, and find the exact solution in terms of Spheroidal Harmonics, while the radial exact solution is obtained in terms of the Confluent Heun function. The quantization of the quasibound state is done by applying the polynomial condition of the Confluent Heun function that gives rise to discrete complex-valued energy levels for massive scalar fields. The real part is the scalar field relativistic quantized energy, while the imaginary part represents the quasibound states's decay. We present all of the sixteen possible exact energy solutions for both massive and massless scalars. We also present the investigation the Hawking radiation of the Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole's apparent horizon, via the Sigurd-Sannan method by making use of the obtained exact scalar wave functions. The radiation distribution function, and the Hawking temperature are successfully obtained.</description>

      <title>SU(2) structures in four dimensions and Plebanski formalism for GR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An SU(2) structure in four dimensions can be described as a triple of 2-forms Sigma^i in Lambda^2(M), i=1,2,3 satisfying Sigma^i wedge Sigma^j ~ delta^{ij}. Such a triple defines a Riemannian signature metric on M. An SU(2) structure is said to be integrable if the holonomy of this Riemannian metric is contained in SU(2). It is well-known that this is the case if and only if the 2-forms are closed dSigma^i=0. The main purpose of the paper is to analyse the second order in derivatives diffeomorphism invariant action functionals that can be constructed for an SU(2) structure. The main result is that there is a unique such action functional if one imposes an additional requirement that the action is also SU(2) invariant, with SU(2) acting on the triple Sigma^i as in its vector representation. This action functional has a very simple expression in terms of the intrinsic torsion of the SU(2) structure. We show that its critical points are SU(2) structures whose associated metric is Einstein. The action we describe has also a first order in derivatives version, and we show how this is related to what in the physics literature is known as Plebanski formalism for GR.</description>

      <title>EGUP corrected thermodynamics of RN-AdS black hole with quintessence matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reissner-Nordstrom anti de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole, characterized by electric charge and negative cosmological constant,exhibits a rich thermodynamics structure. In this paper, we consider the influence of quintessence, a hypothetical dark energy component with negative pressure. we have computed the extended generalized uncertainty principle (EGUP) corrections to the thermodynamics of RN-AdS black hole, including Hawking temperature, heat capacity, entropy function and pressure. Furthermore, as a special case of EGUP, we have computed and compared the result obtained from the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) with those from the extended uncertainty principle (EUP). This work contributes to the understanding of the interplay between fundamental physics and the macroscopic properties of black holes, offering a novel perspective on the thermodynamics of RN-AdS black holes in the context of quintessence and quantum gravity corrections. More importantly, we found that, unlike in the case of the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black hole, the qualitative behavior for the RN-AdS black hole with quintessence remain largely unchanged, except for minor differences, at the equation of state parameters w=-1/3 and w=-2/3. In addition , unlike RN black holes, the phase transition point of RN-AdS black holes also disappears. Thus, small mass black holes can also exist stably, solving the black hole information paradox of RN-AdS space-time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore topological manipulations in one spatial dimension, which are defined for a system with a global symmetry and map the system to another one with a dual symmetry. In particular, we discuss fusion category symmetries enhanced by the invariance of the actions of topological manipulations, i.e., self-$G$-alities for topological manipulations. Based on the self-$G$-ality conditions, we provide LSM-type constraints on the ground states of many-body Hamiltonians. We clarify the relationship between different enhanced symmetries and introduce the notion of $\textit{codimension-two transitions}$. We explore concrete lattice models for such self-$G$-alities and find how the self-$G$-ality structures match the IR critical theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.03674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study abelian M5-brane field configurations representing BPS bound states of self-dual string solitons whose locations correspond to the endlines of M2-branes ending on the M5-branes. The BPS equations are obtained from appropriate Bogomolny completion of the effective abelian low energy functional with two transverse scalars, using two vectors representing the directions along which these endline strings extend. Then we impose boundary conditions on the scalars near the string soliton cores. This leads to a molecule-like equilibrium structure of two non-parallel string solitons at fixed transverse separations, with the M5-brane "prong" deformations comprising two "spikes", each shaped like a ridge. The resulting picture becomes increasingly accurate as one approaches the wall of marginal stability, on which these states decay. There are various parallels with wall-crossing phenomena for string web configurations obtained from D3-brane deformations.</description>

      <title>Master Actions and Helicity Decomposition for Spin-4 Models in $3D$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work introduces a master action that interpolates between four self-dual models, $SD(i)$, for describing massive spin-4 particles in $D=2+1$ dimensions. These models are designated by $i=1,2,3$ and $4$, representing the order in derivatives. Our results show that the four descriptions are quantum equivalent through comparison of their correlation functions, up to contact terms. A geometrical approach is demonstrated to be a useful tool in describing the third and fourth order models. The construction of the master action relies on the introduction of mixing terms, which must be free of particle content. We use the helicity decomposition method to verify the absence of particle content in these terms, ensuring the proper functioning of the master action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates holographic torus correlators of generic operators at conformal infinity and a finite cutoff within AdS$_3$ gravity coupled with a free scalar field. Using a near-boundary analysis and solving the gravitational boundary value problem, we solve Einstein's equation and calculate mixed correlators for massless and massive coupled scalar fields. The conformal ward identity on the torus has been reproduced holographically, which can be regarded as a consistency check. Further, recurrence relations for a specific class of higher-point correlators are derived, validating AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ with non-trivial boundary topology. While the two-point scalar correlator is accurately computed on the thermal AdS$_3$ saddle, the higher-point correlators associated with scalar and stress tensor operators are explored.</description>

Abstract: We consider the case of the SYK model with non-gaussian disorder in the large $N$ limit. After obtaining the effective action, we derive the density of states and the free energy of the modified theory. We show that the non-gaussian disorder corresponds to a non-local Liouville theory, and non-minimally coupled 2D gravity action. It also provides a nice realization of Colemania - Coleman's idea from the 80s of generating a small Cosmological Constant. Finally, we also calculate out of time order correlation functions (OTOC) for the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the doubly $\kappa$-dependent Yang quantum phase space which describes the generalization of $D = 4$ Yang model. We postulate that such model is covariant under the generalized Born map, what permits to derive this new model from the earlier proposed $\kappa$-Snyder model. Our model of $D=4$ relativistic Yang quantum phase space depends on five deformation parameters which form two Born map-related dimensionful pairs: $(M,R)$ specifying the standard Yang model and $(\kappa,\tilde{\kappa})$ characterizing the Born-dual $\kappa$-dependence of quantum space-time and quantum fourmomenta sectors; fifth parameter $\rho$ is dimensionless and Born-selfdual. In the last section, we propose the Kaluza-Klein generalization of $D=4$ Yang model and the new quantum Yang models described algebraically by quantum-deformed $\hat{o}(1,5)$ algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the concept of spread complexity, Krylov complexity for states, has been introduced as a measure of the complexity and chaoticity of quantum systems. In this paper, we study the spread complexity of the thermofield double state within \emph{integrable} systems that exhibit saddle-dominated scrambling. Specifically, we focus on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and the inverted harmonic oscillator as representative examples of quantum mechanical systems featuring saddle-dominated scrambling. Applying the Lanczos algorithm, our numerical investigation reveals that the spread complexity in these systems exhibits features reminiscent of \emph{chaotic} systems, displaying a distinctive ramp-peak-slope-plateau pattern. Our results indicate that, although spread complexity serves as a valuable probe, accurately diagnosing true quantum chaos generally necessitates additional physical input. We also explore the relationship between spread complexity, the spectral form factor, and the transition probability within the Krylov space. We provide analytical confirmation of our numerical results, validating the Ehrenfest theorem of complexity and identifying a distinct quadratic behavior in the early-time regime of spread complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06847v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perturbative renormalization provides the bedrock of understanding quantum field theories. In this work, I point out an alternative way of renormalizing quantum field theories, which is naturally encountered and well known for the case of large N scalar field theories. In terms of bare parameters, this non-perturbative alternative renormalization differs qualitatively from its perturbative cousin: in the continuum limit, the bare coupling constant goes to zero instead of infinity, and there is no wave-function counterterm. Despite these differences, the resulting n-point functions of the theory are finite. I provide explicit results for alternative renormalization for the O(N) model and QCD with $N_f=12$ flavors in 3+1 dimensions.</description>

Abstract: In the framework of the convolutional double copy, we investigate the asymptotic symmetries of the gravitational multiplet stemming from the residual symmetries of its single-copy constituents at null infinity. We show that the asymptotic symmetries of Maxwell fields in D=4 imply ``double-copy supertranslations", i.e. BMS supertranslations and two-form asymptotic symmetries, together with the existence of infinitely many conserved charges involving the double-copy scalar. With the vector fields in Lorenz gauge, the double-copy parameters display a radial expansion involving logarithmic subleading terms, essential for the corresponding charges to be nonvanishing.</description>

Abstract: The canonical Gross-Neveu model for $N$ two-component Dirac fermions in $2+1$ dimensions suffers a continuous phase transition at a critical interaction $g_{c1} \sim 1/N$ at large $N$, at which its continuous symmetry $\text{SO}(2N)$ is preserved and a discrete (Ising) symmetry becomes spontaneously broken. A recent mean-field calculation, however, points to an additional transition at a different critical $g_{c2}\sim -N g_{c1}$, at which $\text{SO}(2N) \rightarrow \text{SO}(N) \times \text{SO}(N)$. To study the latter phase transition we rewrite the Gross-Neveu interaction $g (\bar{\psi} \psi)^2$ in terms of three different quartic terms for the single ($L=1$) $4N$-component real (Majorana) fermion, and then extend the theory to $L&gt;1$. This allows us to track the evolution of the fixed points of the renormalization group transformation starting from $L\gg 1$, where one can discern three distinct critical points which correspond to continuous phase transitions into (1) $\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet mass-order-parameter, (2) $\text{SO}(2N)$-symmetric-tensor mass-order-parameters, and (3) $\text{SO}(2N)$-adjoint nematic-order-parameters, down to $L=1$ value that is relevant to the standard Gross-Neveu model. Below the critical value of $L_c (N)\approx 0.35 N$ for $N\gg1$ only the Gross-Neveu critical point (1) still implies a diverging susceptibility for its corresponding ($\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet) order parameter, whereas the two new critical points that existed at large $L$ ultimately become equivalent to the Gaussian fixed point at $L=1$. We interpret this metamorphosis of the $\text{SO}(2N)$-symmetric-tensor fixed point from critical to spurious as an indication that the transition at $g_{c2}$ in the original Gross-Neveu model is turned first-order by fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the existence of monotonic quantities along renormalization group flows using only the Null Energy Condition and the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for the entanglement entropy of field theories with anti-de Sitter gravity duals. In particular, we consider flows within the same dimension and holographically reprove the $c$-, $F$-, and $a$-theorems in dimensions two, three, and four. We focus on the family of maximally spherical entangling surfaces, define a quasi-constant of motion corresponding to the breaking of conformal invariance, and use a properly defined distance between minimal surfaces to construct a holographic $c$-function that is monotonic along the flow. We then apply our method to the case of flows across dimensions: There, we reprove the monotonicity of flows from $\mathrm{AdS}_{D+1}$ to $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ and prove the novel case of flows from $\mathrm{AdS}_5$ to $\mathrm{AdS}_4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take a fresh look at the relation between generalised K\"ahler geometry and $N=(2,2)$ supersymmetric sigma models in two dimensions formulated in terms of $(2,2)$ superfields. Dual formulations in terms of different kinds of superfield are combined to give a formulation with a doubled target space and both the original superfield and the dual superfield. For K\"ahler geometry, we show that this doubled geometry is Donaldson's deformation of the holomorphic cotangent bundle of the original K\"ahler manifold. This doubled formulation gives an elegant geometric reformulation of the equations of motion. We interpret the equations of motion as the intersection of two Lagrangian submanifolds (or of a Lagrangian submanifold with an isotropic one) in the infinite dimensional symplectic supermanifold which is the analogue of phase space. We then consider further extensions of this formalism, including one in which the geometry is quadrupled, and discuss their geometry.</description>

Abstract: We investigate Q-balls in a 1+1 dimensional complex scalar field theory. We find that the relaxation of a squashed Q-ball is dominated by the decay of a normal mode through nonlinear coupling to scattering modes and a long-lasting quasi-normal mode. We also study how these Q-balls behave when exposed to scalar radiation, finding that for certain conditions they can experience negative radiation pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1904.01048v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a family of models of particle and energy diffusion on a one-dimensional lattice, related to those studied previously in [Sasamoto-Wadati], [Barraquand-Corwin] and [Povolotsky] in the context of KPZ universality class. We show that they may be mapped onto an integrable $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ Heisenberg spin chain whose Hamiltonian density in the bulk has been already studied in the AdS/CFT and the integrable system literature. Using the quantum inverse scattering method, we study various new aspects, in particular we identify boundary terms, modeling reservoirs in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics models, for which the spin chain (and thus also the stochastic process) continues to be integrable. We also show how the construction of a "dual model" of probability theory is possible and useful. The fluctuating hydrodynamics of our stochastic model corresponds to the semiclassical evolution of a string that derives from correlation functions of local gauge invariant operators of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory (SYM), in imaginary-time. As any stochastic system, it has a supersymmetric completion that encodes for the thermal equilibrium theorems: we show that in this case it is equivalent to the $\mathfrak{sl}(2|1)$ superstring that has been derived directly from $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM.</description>

      <title>Axial vector transition form factors in holographic QCD and their contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.01596v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate axial vector transition form factors in holographic QCD models that have been shown to reproduce well recent experimental and theoretical results for the pion transition form factor. Comparing with L3 data on $f_1\to\gamma\gamma^*$ we find remarkable agreement regarding the shape of single-virtual form factors. In the double-virtual case, the holographic results differ strongly from a simple dipole form, and this has an important impact on the corresponding estimate of the axial vector contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $a_\mu$ through hadronic light-by-light scattering. We demonstrate that hard-wall models satisfy the Melnikov-Vainshtein short-distance constraint for the latter, if and only if the infinite tower of axial vector states is included. The results for $a_\mu$, however, are strongly dominated by the first few resonances. Numerically, these results turn out to be surprisingly large: (2.9 - 4.1)$\times 10^{-10}$ in the hard-wall models, 57-58% of which are due to the longitudinal contribution, which is the one responsible for the Melnikov-Vainshtein short-distance constraint. Rescaling the holographic result to obtain an optimal fit of L3 data, but then matching only 52% of the asymptotic constraint, the result is reduced to $2.2(5)\times 10^{-10}$, which is still significantly larger than most previous phenomenological estimates of the axial vector exchange contribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.01720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the integrable family of symmetric boundary-driven interacting particle systems that arise from the non-compact XXX Heisenberg model in one dimension with open boundaries. In contrast to the well-known symmetric exclusion process, the number of particles at each site is unbounded. We show that a finite chain of $N$ sites connected at its ends to two reservoirs can be solved exactly, i.e. the factorial moments of the non-equilibrium steady-state can be written in closed form for each $N$. The solution relies on probabilistic arguments and techniques inspired by integrable systems. It is obtained in two steps: i) the introduction of a dual absorbing process reducing the problem to a finite number of particles; ii) the solution of the dual dynamics exploiting a symmetry obtained from the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method. Long-range correlations are computed in the finite-volume system. The exact solution allows to prove by a direct computation that, in the thermodynamic limit, the system approaches local equilibrium. A by-product of the solution is the algebraic construction of a direct mapping between the non-equilibrium steady state and the equilibrium reversible measure.</description>

Abstract: Kitaev's quantum double model is a lattice gauge theoretic realization of Dijkgraaf-Witten topological quantum field theory (TQFT), its topologically protected ground state space has broad applications for topological quantum computation and topological quantum memory. We investigate the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry enriched generalization of the model for the cyclic Abelian group in a categorical framework and present an explicit Hamiltonian construction. This model provides a lattice realization of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry enriched topological (SET) phase. We discuss in detail the categorical symmetry of the phase, for which the electric-magnetic (EM) duality symmetry is a special case. The aspects of symmetry defects are investigated using the $G$-crossed unitary braided fusion category (UBFC). By determining the corresponding anyon condensation, the gapped boundaries and boundary-bulk duality are also investigated. Then we carefully construct the explicit lattice realization of EM duality for these SET phases.</description>

      <title>Radiative processes of single and entangled detectors on circular trajectories in (2+1) dimensional Minkowski spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.01305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the radiative processes involving two entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors that are moving on circular trajectories in $(2+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. We assume that the detectors are coupled to a massless, quantum scalar field, and calculate the transition probability rates of the detectors in the Minkowski vacuum as well as in a thermal bath. We also evaluate the transition probability rates of the detectors when they are switched on for a finite time interval with the aid of a Gaussian switching function. We begin by examining the response of a single detector before we go on to consider the case of two entangled detectors. As we shall see, working in $(2+1)$ spacetime dimensions makes the computations of the transition probability rates of the detectors relatively simpler. We find that the cross transition probability rates of the two entangled detectors can be comparable to the auto transition probability rates of the individual detectors. We discuss specific characteristics of the response of the entangled detectors for different values of the parameters involved and highlight the effects of the thermal bath as well as switching on the detector for a finite time interval.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the scaling of ground state entanglement entropy of various free fermionic models on one dimensional lattices, where the hopping and pairing terms decay as a power law. We seek to understand the scaling of entanglement entropy in generic models as the exponent of the power law $\alpha$ is varied. We ask if there exists a common $\alpha_{c}$ across different systems governing the transition to area law scaling found in local systems. We explore several examples numerically and argue that when applicable, the scaling of entanglement entropy in long-range models is constrained by predictions from the low-energy theory. In contrast, disordered models and models without a continuum limit show fractal scaling of entanglement approaching volume-law behavior as $\alpha$ approaches zero. These general features are expected to persist on turning on interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we look into binaries undergoing gravitational radiation during a hyperbolic passage. Such hyperbolic events can be a credible source of gravitational waves in future detectors. We systematically calculate fluxes of gravitational radiation from such events in the presence of dark matter with different profiles, also considering the effects of dynamical friction. We provide an estimate for the braking index and show how it evolves due to the presence of the dark matter medium. We also investigate the binary dynamics through the changes in the orbital parameters by treating the potential due to dark matter spike and the dynamical friction effects as a perturbation term. An insight into the effects of such a medium on the binaries from the corresponding osculating elements opens up avenues to study binary dynamics for such events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianity generated by additional fields present during inflation offers a compelling observational target for galaxy surveys. These fields are of significant theoretical interest since they offer a window into particle physics in the inflaton sector. They also violate the single-field consistency conditions and induce a scale-dependent bias in the galaxy power spectrum. In this paper, we explore this particular signal for light scalar fields and study the prospects for measuring it with galaxy surveys. We find that the sensitivities of current and future surveys are remarkably stable for different configurations, including between spectroscopic and photometric redshift measurements. This is even the case at non-zero masses where the signal is not obviously localized on large scales. For realistic galaxy number densities, we demonstrate that the redshift range and galaxy bias of the sample have the largest impact on the sensitivity in the power spectrum. These results additionally motivated us to explore the potentially enhanced sensitivity of Vera Rubin Observatory's LSST through multi-tracer analyses. Finally, we apply this understanding to current data from the last data release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR12) and place new constraints on light fields coupled to the inflaton.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies by LHAASO have shown the presence of high-luminosity PeVatrons in our Galaxy. We examine two notable sources, each consisting of two pulsars, detected by LHAASO. We study gamma and cosmic-ray emissions from the surroundings of these pulsars. We used the Gammapy software to perform gamma-ray measurements from these sources in anticipation of future analyses to be carried out with the CTA observatory, which is now under development. Furthermore, the particle propagation throughout the Galaxy was simulated using the GALPROP software, accounting for emission from energy losses due to spin-down. As a result, we present the particle spectra generated during this propagation phase along with the corresponding gamma-ray emission. The findings suggest that CTA may have the capability to detect these sources and show that the data can be explained by gamma rays coming from a leptonic model.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Phase Transition in Singlet Extensions of The Standard Model with Dimension-Six Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The significance of the electroweak phase transition is undeniable, and although initially it was believed that it was second-order, it is now believed that it is a first-order transition. However, it is not a strong first-order phase transition in the context of the Standard Model and the remedy to this issue is to use the Higgs portal and directly couple the Higgs to a hidden scalar sector. This can result in a strong electroweak phase transition, while the couplings to a hidden scalar are constrained by several phenomenological constraints, such as the sphaleron rate criterion and the branching ratio of the Higgs to invisible channels. In this work, we consider the standard singlet extensions of the Standard Model, including dimension-six non-renormalizable operators that couple a real singlet scalar field with the Higgs doublet. As a result, we examine the effects of those Higgs-singlet couplings on the electroweak phase transition. The effective theory, where the non-renormalizable couplings originate from, is considered to be active beyond 15$\,$TeV. As we show, the Universe experiences a two-step electroweak phase transition, a primary phase transition in the singlet sector at a high temperature, and then a subsequent first-order phase transition from the singlet vacuum to the electroweak vacuum. The singlet's phase transition can either be second-order or first-order, depending on the singlet mass and its couplings to the Higgs. In particular, we show that the dimension-six operator assists in generating a strong electroweak phase transition in regions of the parameter space that were excluded in the previous singlet extensions of the Standard Model. This is further apparent for low singlet masses \(m_S &lt; m_H/2\) which are rarely taken into account in the literature due to the invisible branching ratio of the Higgs boson.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic correlation functions in 2D critical percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is believed that the large-scale geometric properties of two-dimensional critical percolation are described by a logarithmic conformal field theory, but it has been challenging to exhibit concrete examples of logarithmic singularities and to find an explanation and a physical interpretation, in terms of lattice observables, for their appearance. We show that certain percolation correlation functions receive independent contributions from a large number of similar connectivity events happening at different scales. Combined with scale invariance, this leads to logarithmic divergences. We study several logarithmic correlation functions for critical percolation in the bulk and in the presence of a boundary, including the four-point function of the density (spin) field. Our analysis confirms previous findings, provides new explicit calculations and explains, in terms of lattice observables, the physical mechanism that leads to the logarithmic singularities we discover. Although we adopt conformal field theory (CFT) terminology to present our results, the core of our analysis relies on probabilistic arguments and recent rigorous results on the scaling limit of critical percolation and does not assume a priori the existence of a percolation CFT. As a consequence, our results provide strong support for the validity of a CFT description of critical percolation and a step in the direction of a mathematically rigorous formulation of a logarithmic CFT of two-dimensional critical percolation.</description>

      <title>Internal Lagrangians and spatial-gauge symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A direct reformulation of the Hamiltonian formalism in terms of the intrinsic geometry of infinitely prolonged differential equations is obtained. Concepts of spatial equation and spatial-gauge symmetry of a Lagrangian system of equations are introduced. A non-covariant canonical variational principle is proposed and demonstrated using the Maxwell equations as an example. A covariant canonical variational principle is formulated. The results obtained are applicable to any variational equations, including those that do not originate in physics.</description>

      <title>No $\nu$s is Good News</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) analysis from the first year of data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), when combined with data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), has placed an upper-limit on the sum of neutrino masses, $\sum m_\nu &lt; 70$ meV (95%). In addition to excluding the minimum sum associated with the inverted hierarchy, the posterior is peaked at $\sum m_\nu = 0$ and is close to excluding even the minumum sum, 58 meV at 2$\sigma$. In this paper, we explore the implications of this data for cosmology and particle physics. The sum of neutrino mass is determined in cosmology from the suppression of clustering in the late universe. Allowing the clustering to be enhanced, we extended the DESI analysis to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0$ and find $\sum m_\nu = - 160 \pm 90$ meV (68%), and that the suppression of power from the minimum sum of neutrino masses is excluded at 99% confidence. We show this preference for negative masses makes it challenging to explain the result by a shift of cosmic parameters, such as the optical depth or matter density. We then show how a result of $\sum m_\nu =0$ could arise from new physics in the neutrino sector, including decay, cooling, and/or time-dependent masses. These models are consistent with current observations but imply new physics that is accessible in a wide range of experiments. In addition, we discuss how an apparent signal with $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0$ can arise from new long range forces in the dark sector or from a primordial trispectrum that resembles the signal of CMB lensing.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Leptogenesis with sub-GeV Axion Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A derivative coupling of an axion like particle (ALP) with a B-L current may lead to the baryon asymmetry of the universe via spontaneous leptogenesis provided a lepton number breaking interaction prevails in thermal equilibrium. Conventionally, such scenario works only for heavy ALPs and high reheating temperature due to the fact that the same lepton number breaking contribution is tied up with neutrino mass generation also. In this work, we propose inert Higgs doublet assisted lepton number violating operator to relieve such tension so as to generate lepton asymmetry (of freeze-in/out type) with a much lower reheating temperature that can accommodate light (sub-GeV) ALPs sensitive to current and future ALP searches.</description>
