      <title>Spectral approaches to stress relaxation in epithelial monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the viscoelastic relaxation to equilibrium of a disordered planar epithelium described using the cell vertex model. In its standard form, the model is formulated as coupled evolution equations for the locations of vertices of confluent polygonal cells. Exploiting the model's gradient-flow structure, we use singular-value decomposition to project modes of deformation of vertices onto modes of deformation of cells. We show how eigenmodes of discrete Laplacian operators (specified by constitutive assumptions related to dissipation and mechanical energy) provide a spatial basis for evolving fields, and demonstrate how the operators can incorporate approximations of conventional spatial derivatives. We relate the spectrum of relaxation times to the eigenvalues of the Laplacians, modified by corrections that account for the fact that the cell network (and therefore the Laplacians) evolve during relaxation to an equilibrium prestressed state, providing the monolayer with geometric stiffness. While dilational modes of the Laplacians capture rapid relaxation in some circumstances, showing diffusive dynamics, geometric stiffness is typically a dominant source of monolayer rigidity, as we illustrate for monolayers exposed to unsteady stretching deformations.</description>

      <title>Shape dynamics and migration of branched cells on complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Migratory and tissue resident cells exhibit highly branched morphologies to perform their function and to adapt to the microenvironment. Immune cells, for example, display transient branched shapes while exploring the surrounding tissues. In another example, to properly irrigate the tissues, blood vessels bifurcate thereby forcing the branching of cells moving on top or within the vessels. In both cases microenvironmental constraints force migrating cells to extend several highly dynamic protrusions. Here, we present a theoretical model for the shape dynamics and migration of cells that simultaneously span several junctions, which we validated by using micropatterns with an hexagonal array, and a neuronal network image analysis pipeline to monitor the macrophages and endothelial cell shapes and migration. In our model we describe how the actin retrograde flow controls branch extension, retraction and global cell polarization. We relate the noise in this flow to the residency times and trapping of the cell at the junctions of the network. In addition, we found that macrophages and endothelial cells display very different migration regimes on the network, with macrophages moving faster and having larger changes in cell length in comparison to endothelial cells. These results expose how cellular shapes and migration are intricately coupled inside complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Multiple Modes of Motion for the Effectiveness of Outer Hair Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outer hair cells (OHCs) are essential for the sensitivity and frequency specificity of the mammalian ear. To perform this function, OHCs need to amplify the motion of the basilar membrane (BM), which is much stiffer than themselves. If OHCs and the BM are components of a single oscillator, this impedance mismatch seriously limits the effectiveness of OHCs. However, the elaborated structure of the organ of Corti can support multiple modes motion. Here, systems of two coupled oscillators are examined as the simplest models of the system with multiple modes of motion. It is found that some of these model systems have conditions, under which an OHC can function as an effective amplifier, overcoming the impedance mismatch. The present examination suggests that the presence of multiple modes of motion is a key to the exquisite performance of the mammalian ear.</description>

      <title>Restriction-induced time-dependent transcytolemmal water exchange: Revisiting the K\"arger exchange model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The K\"arger model and its derivatives have been widely used to incorporate transcytolemmal water exchange rate, an essential characteristic of living cells, into analyses of diffusion MRI (dMRI) signals from tissues. The K\"arger model consists of two homogeneous exchanging components coupled by an exchange rate constant and assumes measurements are made with sufficiently long diffusion time and slow water exchange. Despite successful applications, it remains unclear whether these assumptions are generally valid for practical dMRI sequences and biological tissues. In particular, barrier-induced restrictions to diffusion produce inhomogeneous magnetization distributions in relatively large-sized compartments such as cancer cells, violating the above assumptions. The effects of this inhomogeneity are usually overlooked. We performed computer simulations to quantify how restriction effects, which in images produce edge enhancements at compartment boundaries, influence different variants of the K\"arger-model. The results show that the edge enhancement effect will produce larger, time-dependent estimates of exchange rates in e.g., tumors with relatively large cell sizes (&gt;10 {\mu}m), resulting in overestimations of water exchange as previously reported. Moreover, stronger diffusion gradients, longer diffusion gradient durations, and larger cell sizes, all cause more pronounced edge enhancement effects. This helps us to better understand the feasibility of the K\"arger model in estimating water exchange in different tissue types and provides useful guidance on signal acquisition methods that may mitigate the edge enhancement effect. This work also indicates the need to correct the overestimated transcytolemmal water exchange rates obtained assuming the K\"arger-model.</description>

      <title>Exact moments for trapped active particles: inertial impact on steady-state properties and re-entrance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the behavior of inertial active Brownian particles in a $d$-dimensional harmonic trap in the presence of translational diffusion. While the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation is generally challenging, it can be utilized to compute the exact time evolution of all time-dependent dynamical moments using a Laplace transform approach. We present the explicit form for several moments of position and velocity in $d$-dimensions. An interplay of time scales assures that the effective diffusivity and steady-state kinetic temperature depend on both inertia and trap strength, unlike passive systems. We present detailed `phase diagrams' using kurtosis of velocity and position showing possibilities of re-entrance.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic dissipation does not bound replicator growth and decay rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a well-known paper, Jeremy England derived a bound on the free energy dissipated by a self-replicating system [England, "Statistical physics of self-replication", The Journal of Chemical Physics, 2013]. This bound is usually interpreted as a universal relationship that links thermodynamic dissipation to the replicator's per-capita decay and growth rates. Contrary to this interpretation, we argue from thermodynamic principles that such a relationship cannot exist. In particular, we show that it is impossible for a system to undergo both replication and per-capita decay back into reactants. While it is possible for a system to undergo replication and decay into separate waste products, in that case replication and decay are two independent physical processes, and there is no universal relationship between their thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of viscoelasticity of two-dimensional fluid membranes under oscillatory loadings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11074v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomembranes consisting of two opposing phospholipid monolayers, which comprise the so-called lipid bilayer, are largely responsible for the dual solid-fluid behavior of individual cells and viruses. Quantifying the mechanical characteristics of biomembrane, including the dynamics of their in-plane fluidity, can provide insight not only into active or passive cell behaviors but also into vesicle design for drug delivery systems. Despite numerous studies on the mechanics of biomembranes, their dynamical viscoelastic properties have not yet been fully described. We thus quantify their viscoelasticity based on a two-dimensional (2D) fluid membrane model, and investigate this viscoelasticity under small amplitude oscillatory loadings in micron-scale membrane area. We use hydrodynamic equations of bilayer membranes, obtained by Onsager's variational principle, wherein the fluid membrane is assumed to be an almost planar bilayer membrane. Simulations are performed for a wide range of oscillatory frequencies $f$ and membrane tensions. Our numerical results show that as frequencies increase, membrane characteristics shift from an elastic-dominant to viscous-dominant state. Furthermore, such state transitions obtained with a 1-$\mu$m-wide loading profile appear with frequencies between $O(f) = 10^1-10^2$ Hz, and almost independently of surface tensions. We discuss the formation mechanism of the viscous- or elastic-dominant transition based on relaxation rates that correspond to the eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix in the governing equations.</description>

      <title>A PNP ion channel deep learning solver with local neural network and finite element input data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a deep learning method for solving an improved one-dimensional Poisson-Nernst-Planck ion channel (PNPic) model, called the PNPic deep learning solver, is presented. In particular, it combines a novel local neural network scheme with an effective PNPic finite element solver. Since the input data of the neural network scheme only involves a small local patch of coarse grid solutions, which the finite element solver can quickly produce, the PNPic deep learning solver can be trained much faster than any corresponding conventional global neural network solvers. After properly trained, it can output a predicted PNPic solution in a much higher degree of accuracy than the low cost coarse grid solutions and can reflect different perturbation cases on the parameters, ion channel subregions, and interface and boundary values, etc. Consequently, the PNPic deep learning solver can generate a numerical solution with high accuracy for a family of PNPic models. As an initial study, two types of numerical tests were done by perturbing one and two parameters of the PNPic model, respectively, as well as the tests done by using a few perturbed interface positions of the model as training samples. These tests demonstrate that the PNPic deep learning solver can generate highly accurate PNPic numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>Stability distillation hypothesis for the origin of life</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The essence of life is a frequency distribution conversion process of molecules accompanied by changes in information. In wet-dry cycling hot springs, RNA of different sequences continuously undergoes polymerization and decomposition reactions, products with stable configurations will accumulate their frequency among all RNA molecules and finally become an important source of DNA coding and non-coding regions in primitive cells. This periodic extreme environmental change narrows the frequency distribution of macromolecules through the distillation process and new potential catalysts are searched. When enough macromolecules are accumulated and reliable reaction pathways are built, phospholipids randomly wrap the macromolecules in the hot springs which I would call it the pioneer pools, and these protocells become parallel calculators of molecule frequency distribution. Through the selective permeability of the cell membrane to different molecular weights and properties, cells with appropriate distribution have more opportunities to absorb small molecule substances and increase its intracellular frequencies of molecules. This will strongly induce the occurrence of macromolecules that can widely catalyze the synthesis of other macromolecules or themselves, such as ribosomes, etc. Rupture and fusion during cell division make all protocells share the same frequency distribution of molecules during the origin of life, thus ensuring that all present cells have very similar genetic materials and protein translation systems. This also suggests that viruses may have originated and evolved together with cells.</description>

      <title>Polarization-artifact reduction and accuracy improvement of Jones-matrix polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography by multi-focus averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) is a promising biomedical imaging tool for differentiation of various tissue properties. However, the presence of multiple-scattering (MS) signals can degrade the quantitative polarization measurement accuracy. We demonstrate a method to reduce MS signals and increase the measurement accuracy of Jones matrix PS-OCT. This method suppresses MS signals by averaging of multiple Jones matrix volumes measured using different focal positions. The MS signals are decorrelated among the volumes by focus position modulation and are thus reduced by averaging. However, the single scattering signals are kept consistent among the focus-modulated volumes by computational refocusing. We validated the proposed method using a scattering phantom and a postmortem medaka fish. The results showed reduced artifacts in birefringence and degree-of-polarization uniformity measurements, particularly in deeper regions in the samples. This method offers a practical solution to mitigate MS-induced artifacts in PS-OCT imaging and improves quantitative polarization measurement accuracy.</description>

      <title>Predicting the morphology of multiphase biomolecular condensates from protein interaction networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase-separated biomolecular condensates containing proteins and RNAs can assemble into higher-order structures by forming thermodynamically stable interfaces between immiscible phases. Using a minimal model of a protein/RNA interaction network, we demonstrate how a "shared" protein species that partitions into both phases of a multiphase condensate can function as a tunable surfactant that modulates the interfacial properties. We use Monte Carlo simulations and free-energy calculations to identify conditions under which a low concentration of this shared species is sufficient to trigger a wetting transition. We also describe a numerical approach based on classical density functional theory to predict concentration profiles and surface tensions directly from the model protein/RNA interaction network. Finally, we show that the wetting phase diagrams that emerge from our calculations can be understood in terms of a simple model of selective adsorption to a fluctuating interface. Our work shows how a low-concentration protein species might function as a biological switch for regulating multiphase condensate morphologies.</description>

      <title>Active drive towards elastic spinodals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active renewable matter, a distinctive feature of adaptive living materials, can exhibit highly unusual mechanical responses by actively navigating the space of material parameters. In particular, it can self-drive towards elastic spinodals where the presence of inhomogeneous floppy modes, makes the matter elastically degenerate. The main effect of the implied marginality is stress localization leading to the emergence of force chains which can be actively assembled and disassembled. In this Letter we formalize the concept of spinodal states for general elastic solids and show how such extreme mechanical regimes can be actively navigated.</description>
