      <title>Tubes in sub-Riemannian geometry and a Weyl's invariance result for curves in the Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of the paper is threefold: first, we prove optimal regularity results for the distance from $C^k$ submanifolds of general rank-varying sub-Riemannian structures. Then, we study the asymptotics of the volume of tubular neighbourhoods around such submanifolds. Finally, for the case of curves in the Heisenberg groups, we prove a Weyl's invariance result: the volume of small tubes around a curve does not depend on the way the curve is isometrically embedded, but only on its Reeb angle. The proof does not need the computation of the actual volume of the tube, and it is new even for the three-dimensional Heisenberg group.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Surfaces of Framed Curvature Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces the framed curvature flow, a generalization of both the curve shortening flow and the vortex filament equation. Here, the magnitude of the velocity vector is still determined by the curvature, but its direction is given by an associated time-dependent moving frame. After establishing local existence and global estimates, we analyze the trajectory surfaces generated by different variations of this flow, specifically those leading to surfaces of constant mean or Gaussian curvature.</description>

      <title>A remark on the linearization of nondegenerate Nambu structures of coorder 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we show that Nambu structures of coorder 1 can always be linearized if they admit a closed integrable differential form. In particular, we show that a unimodular Poisson structure whose isotropy Lie algebra at a singular point is $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$, can always be linearized.</description>

      <title>Convexity of sums of eigenvalues of a segment of unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a $n\times n$ unitary matrix $u=e^z$ with $z$ skew-Hermitian, the angles of $u$ are the arguments of its spectrum, i.e. the spectrum of $-iz$. For $1\le m\le n$, we show that $s_m(t)$, the sum of the first $m$ angles of the path $t\mapsto e^{tx}e^y$ of unitary matrices, is a convex function of $t$ (provided the path stays in a vecinity of the identity matrix). This vecinity is described in terms of the opertor norm of matrices, and it is optimal. We show that the when all the maps $t\mapsto s_m(t)$ are linear, then $x$ commutes with $y$. Several application to unitarily invariant norms in the unitary group are given. Then we extend these applications to $Ad$-invariant Finsler norms in the special unitary group of matrices. This last result is obtained by proving that any $Ad$-invariant Finsler norm in a compact semi-simple Lie group $K$ is the supremum of a family of what we call orbit norms, induced by the Killing form of $K$.</description>

      <title>On Pseudo $B$-symmetric spacetimes and $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article delivers the characterization of a pseudo $B$ symmetric spacetimes and we illustrate that a pseudo $B$ symmetric spacetime admitting Codazzi type of $B$-tensor represents a perfect fluid spacetime and if this spacetime admits the time-like convergence criterion, then the pseudo $B$ symmetric spacetime fulfills cosmic strong energy criterion and contains pure matter. Besides, we find in a pseudo $B$ symmetric spacetime with Codazzi type of $B$-tensor the electric part of the Weyl tensor vanishes and has Riemann and Weyl compatible vector fields. Furthermore, it is established that the chosen spacetime with Codazzi type of $B$-tensor is conformally flat and represents a Robertson-Walker spacetime. Also, we calculate the scale factor $\varPsi (t)$ for these spacetimes in a spatially flat Robertson-Walker spacetime. Finally, we study the impact of this spacetime under $f(R)$ gravity scenario and deduce several energy conditions by considering a new model $f\left(\mathcal{R}\right)= e^{(\alpha \mathcal{R})}-ln(\beta \mathcal{R})$ in which $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are positive constants.</description>

      <title>Uniformization of varieties with log-canonical singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of uniformizing quasi-projective varieties with logcanonical compactifications. More precisely, given a complex projective variety X with log-canonical singularities, we give criteria for X to be isomorphic to a Baily-Borel-Mok compactification of a ball quotient, asking on the one hand the equality case in a suitable Miyaoka-Yau (MY) inequality, and on the other hand some adequate assumptions on the singularities. We also give as a result of independent interest that log-resolutions of log-canonical singularities have their fibers connected by chains of special varieties in the sense of Campana; this is used in the proof to control the behaviour of the period map near the exceptional divisors of such resolutions. We also show that it is necessary to assume that the singularities are at least logcanonical: some examples of Deligne-Mostow-Deraux can be manipulated to provide examples of singular varieties satisfying the equality case in MY, while not being isomorphic to such Baily-Borel-Mok compactifications.</description>

      <title>Categorical quantization on K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing deformation quantizations with separation of variables of a K\"ahler manifold $M$, we adopt Fedosov's gluing argument to construct a category $\mathsf{DQ}$, enriched over sheaves of $\mathbb{C}[[\hbar]]$-modules on $M$, as a quantization of the category of Hermitian holomorphic vector bundles over $M$ with morphisms being smooth sections of hom-bundles.
  We then define quantizable morphisms among objects in $\mathsf{DQ}$, generalizing Chan-Leung-Li's notion [4] of quantizable functions. Upon evaluation of quantizable morphisms at $\hbar = \tfrac{\sqrt{-1}}{k}$, we obtain an enriched category $\mathsf{DQ}_{\operatorname{qu}, k}$. We show that, when $M$ is prequantizable, $\mathsf{DQ}_{\operatorname{qu}, k}$ is equivalent to the category $\mathsf{GQ}$ of holomorphic vector bundles over $M$ with morphisms being holomorphic differential operators, via a functor obtained from Bargmann-Fock actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04585v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the Minkowski average of two subsets of a Riemannian manifold, in which geodesics are replaced by an arbitrary family of parametrized curves. Under certain assumptions, we characterize families of curves on a Riemannian surface for which a Brunn-Minkowski inequality holds with respect to a given volume form. In particular, we prove that under these assumptions, a family of constant-speed curves on a Riemannian surface satisfies the Brunn-Minkowski inequality with respect to the Riemannian area form if and only if the geodesic curvature of its members is determined by a function $\kappa$ on the surface, and $\kappa$ satisfies the inequality $$K + \kappa^2 - |\nabla\kappa| \ge 0$$ where $K$ is the Gauss curvature.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of Harmonic Maps With Prescribed Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first in a series of two papers to establish the mass-angular momentum inequality for multiple black holes. We study singular harmonic maps from domains of 3-dimensional Euclidean space to the hyperbolic plane having bounded hyperbolic distance to extreme Kerr harmonic maps. We prove that every such harmonic map admits a unique tangent harmonic map at the extreme black hole horizon. The possible tangent maps are classified and shown to be shifted `extreme Kerr' geodesics in the hyperbolic plane that depend on two parameters, one determined by angular momentum and another by conical singularities. In addition, rates of convergence to the tangent map are established. Similarly, expansions in the asymptotically flat end are presented. These results, together with those of Li-Tian [24, 25] and Weinstein [35,36], provide a complete regularity theory for harmonic maps from $\mathbb R^3\setminus z\text{-axis}$ to $\mathbb H^2$ with these prescribed singularities. The analysis is additionally utilized to prove existence of the so called near horizon limit, and to compute the associated near horizon geometries of extreme black holes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we equate the analytic and the intersection Reidemeister torsions on spaces with a specific type of wedge singularities, which arise by turning the disc cross-sections in the tubular neighborhood of an embedded submanifold of even co-dimension into cones. Our result is related to a similar equation, in a setting disjoint from ours, which was previously obtained by Albin, Rochon and Sher.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial p-th Calabi Flows for Total Geodesic Curvatures in hyperbolic background geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In hyperbolic background geometry, we investigate a generalized circle packing (including circles, horocycles and hypercycles) with conical singularities on a surface with boundary, which has a total geodesic curvature on each generalized circle of this circle packing and a discrete Gaussian curvature on the center of each dual circle. The purpose of this paper is to find this type of circle packings with prescribed total geodesic curvatures on generalized circles and discrete Gaussian curvatures on centers of dual circles. To achieve this goal, we firstly establish existence and rigidity on this type of circle packings by the variational principle. Secondly, for $p&gt;1$, we introduce combinatorial $p$-th Calabi flows to find the circle packing with prescribed total geodesic curvatures on generalized circles and discrete Gaussian curvatures on centers of dual circles for the first time.</description>

      <title>Geometric Approaches to Matrix Normalization and Graph Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Normal matrices, or matrices which commute with their adjoints, are of fundamental importance in pure and applied mathematics. In this paper, we study a natural functional on the space of square complex matrices whose global minimizers are normal matrices. We show that this functional, which we refer to as the non-normal energy, has incredibly well-behaved gradient descent dynamics: despite it being non-convex, we show that the only critical points of the non-normal energy are the normal matrices, and that its gradient descent trajectories fix matrix spectra and preserve the subset of real matrices. We also show that, even when restricted to the subset of unit Frobenius norm matrices, the gradient flow of the non-normal energy retains many of these useful properties. This is applied to prove that low-dimensional homotopy groups of spaces of unit norm normal matrices vanish; for example, we show that the space of $d \times d$ complex unit norm normal matrices is simply connected for all $d \geq 2$. Finally, we consider the related problem of balancing a weighted directed graph -- that is, readjusting its edge weights so that the weighted in-degree and out-degree is the same at each node. We adapt the non-normal energy to define another natural functional whose global minima are balanced graphs and show that gradient descent of this functional always converges to a balanced graph, while preserving graph spectra and realness of the weights. Our results were inspired by concepts from symplectic geometry and Geometric Invariant Theory, but we mostly avoid invoking this machinery and our proofs are generally self-contained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very little is yet known regarding the Willmore flow of surfaces with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We consider surfaces with a rotational symmetry as initial data and prove a global existence and convergence result for solutions of the Willmore flow with initial data below an explicit, sharp energy threshold. Strikingly, this threshold depends on the prescribed boundary conditions - it can even be made to be $0$. We show sharpness for some critical boundary data by constructing surfaces above this energy threshold so that the corresponding Willmore flow develops a singularity. Finally, a Li-Yau inequality for open curves in $\mathbb{H}^2$ is proved.</description>

      <title>Optimality Conditions for Interval-Valued Optimization Problems on Riemannian Manifolds Under a Total Order Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09396v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article explores fundamental properties of convex interval-valued functions defined on Riemannian manifolds. The study employs generalized Hukuhara directional differentiability to derive KKT-type optimality conditions for an interval-valued optimization problem on Riemannian manifolds. Based on type of functions involved in optimization problems, we consider the following cases:
  1. objective function as well as constraints are real-valued;
  2. objective function is interval-valued, and constraints are real-valued;
  3. objective function as well as constraints are interval-valued.
  The whole theory is justified with the help of examples. The order relation that we use throughout the paper is a total order relation defined on the collection of all closed and bounded intervals in $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence of admissible (and strictly convex) smooth solutions to the prescribed $L_p$ quotient type curvature problem with $p&gt;1$. For cases where $p=k-l+1$ and $p&gt; k-l+1$, we obtain an admissible solution without any additional conditions, which is strictly spherically convex under a convexity condition. Under the same convexity condition, we establish the existence of a strictly spherically convex solution for the case $p&lt;k-l+1$, provided that the prescribed function is even, a condition known to be necessary.</description>

Abstract: Understanding intelligence is a central pursuit in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. Intelligence encompasses learning, problem-solving, creativity, and even consciousness. Recent advancements in geometric analysis have revealed new insights into high-dimensional information representation and organisation, exposing intrinsic data structures and dynamic processes within neural and artificial systems. However, a comprehensive framework that unifies the static and dynamic aspects of intelligence is still lacking. This manuscript proposes a mathematical framework based on Riemannian geometry to describe the structure and dynamics of intelligence and consciousness. Intelligence elements are conceptualised as tokens embedded in a high-dimensional space. The learned token embeddings capture the interconnections of tokens across various scenarios and tasks, forming manifolds in the intelligence space. Thought flow is depicted as the sequential activation of tokens along geodesics within these manifolds. During the navigation of geodesics, consciousness, as a self-referential process, perceives the thought flow, evaluates it against predictions, and provides feedback through prediction errors, adjusting the geodesic: non-zero prediction errors, such as learning, lead to the restructuring of the curved manifolds, thus changing the geodesic of thought flow. This dynamic interaction integrates new information, evolves the geometry and facilitates learning. The geometry of intelligence guides consciousness, and consciousness structures the geometry of intelligence. By integrating geometric concepts, this proposed theory offers a unified, mathematically framework for describing the structure and dynamics of intelligence and consciousness. Applicable to biological and artificial intelligence, this framework may pave the way for future research and empirical validation.</description>
