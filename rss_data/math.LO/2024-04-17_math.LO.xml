      <title>Witnessing Flows in Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the elegant achievements in the history of proof theory is the characterization of the provably total recursive functions of an arithmetical theory by its proof-theoretic ordinal as a way to measure the time complexity of the functions. Unfortunately, the machinery is not sufficiently fine-grained to be applicable on the weak theories on the one hand and to capture the bounded functions with bounded definitions of strong theories, on the other. In this paper, we develop such a machinery to address the bounded theorems of both strong and weak theories of arithmetic. In the first part, we provide a refined version of ordinal analysis to capture the feasibly definable and bounded functions that are provably total in $\mathrm{PA}+\bigcup_{\beta \prec \alpha} \mathrm{TI}(\prec_{\beta})$, the extension of Peano arithmetic by transfinite induction up to the ordinals below $\alpha$. Roughly speaking, we identify the functions as the ones that are computable by a sequence of $\mathrm{PV}$-provable polynomial time modifications on an initial polynomial time value, where the computational steps are indexed by the ordinals below $\alpha$, decreasing by the modifications. In the second part, and choosing $l \leq k$, we use similar technique to capture the functions with bounded definitions in the theory $T^k_2$ (resp. $S^k_2$) as the functions computable by exponentially (resp. polynomially) long sequence of $\mathrm{PV}_{k-l+1}$-provable reductions between $l$-turn games starting with an explicit $\mathrm{PV}_{k-l+1}$-provable winning strategy for the first game.</description>

      <title>Visceral theories without assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a theory with a definable topology. $T$ is t-minimal in the sense of Mathews if every definable set in one variable has finite boundary. If $T$ is t-minimal, we show that there is a good dimension theory for definable sets, satisfying properties similar to dp-rank in dp-minimal theories, with one key exception: the dimension of $\operatorname{dom}(f)$ can be less than the dimension of $\operatorname{im}(f)$ for a definable function $f$. Using the dimension theory, we show that any definable field in a t-minimal theory is perfect.
  We then specialize to the case where $T$ is visceral in the sense of Dolich and Goodrick, meaning that $T$ is t-minimal and the definable topology comes from a definable uniformity (i.e., a definable uniform structure). We show that almost all of Dolich and Goodrick's tame topology theorems for visceral theories hold without their additional assumptions of definable finite choice (DFC) and no space-filling functions (NSFF). Lastly, we produce an example of a visceral theory with a space-filling curve, answering a question of Dolich and Goodrick.</description>

      <title>On effective constructions of existentially closed groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existentially closed groups are, informally, groups that contain solutions to every consistent finite system of equations and inequations. They were introduced in 1951 in an algebraic context and subsequent research elucidated deep connections with group theory and computability theory. We continue this investigation, with particular emphasis on illuminating the relationship with computability theory.
  In particular, we show that existentially closed groups can be built at the level of the halting problem and that this is optimal. Moreover, using the the theory of the enumeration degrees and some work of Martin Ziegler in computable group theory, we show that the previous result relativises in a somewhat subtle way. We then tease apart the complexity contributed by ``global'' and ``local'' structure, showing that the finitely generated subgroups have complexity at the level of the PA degrees. Finally, we investigate the computability-theoretic complexity of omitting the non-principal quantifier-free types from a list of types, from which we obtain an upper bound on the complexity of building two existentially closed groups that are ``as different as possible''.</description>

      <title>Preservation of splitting families and cardinal characteristics of the continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.13500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to construct, via forcing, splitting families than are preserved by a certain type of finite support iterations. As an application, we construct a model where 15 classical characteristics of the continuum are pairwise different, concretely: the 10 (non-dependent) entries in Cicho\'n's diagram, $\mathfrak{m}(2\text{-Knaster})$, $\mathfrak{p}$, $\mathfrak{h}$, the splitting number $\mathfrak{s}$ and the reaping number $\mathfrak{r}$.</description>

      <title>Stability, corners, and other 2-dimensional shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a relaxation of stability, called robust stability, which is insensitive to perturbations by subsets of Loeb measure $0$ in a pseudofinite group. We show that robust stability satisfies a stationarity principle for measure independent elements. We apply this principle to deduce the existence of squares in dense robustly stable subsets of Cartesian products of non-standard finite groups, possibly non-abelian. Our results imply qualitative asymptotic versions for Cartesian products of finite groups. In the final section, we establish the existence of $3\times 2$-grids (and thus of $L$-shapes) in dense robustly stable $2$-dimensional subsets of finite abelian groups of odd order.</description>

      <title>Building models in small cardinals in local abstract elementary classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are many results in the literature where superstablity-like independence notions, without any categoricity assumptions, have been used to show the existence of larger models. In this paper we show that stability is enough to construct larger models for small cardinals assuming a mild locality condition for Galois types.
  $\mathbf{Theorem.}$ Suppose $\lambda&lt;2^{\aleph_0}$. Let $\mathbf{K}$ be an abstract elementary class with $\lambda \geq \operatorname{LS}(\mathbf{K})$. Assume $\mathbf{K}$ has amalgamation in $\lambda$, no maximal model in $\lambda$, and is stable in $\lambda$. If $\mathbf{K}$ is $(&lt;\lambda^+, \lambda)$-local, then $\mathbf{K}$ has a model of cardinality $\lambda^{++}$.
  The set theoretic assumption that $\lambda&lt;2^{\aleph_0}$ and model theoretic assumption of stability in $\lambda$ can be weaken to the model theoretic assumptions that $|\mathbf{S}^{na}(M)|&lt; 2^{\aleph_0}$ for every $M \in \mathbf{K}_\lambda$ and stability for $\lambda$-algebraic types in $\lambda$. We further use the result just mentioned to provide a positive answer to Grossberg's question for small cardinals assuming a mild locality condition for Galois types and without any stability assumptions. This last result relies on an unproven claim of Shelah (Fact 4.5 of this paper) which we were unable to verify.</description>

      <title>The complexity of non-stationary ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an overview of results on the question of whether the non-stationary ideal of an uncountable regular cardinal $\kappa$ can be defined by a $\Pi_1$-formula using parameters of hereditary cardinality at most $\kappa$. These results show that this question is deeply connected to several central topics of current research in set theory.</description>

      <title>Combining swap structures: the case of Paradefinite Ivlev-like modal logics based on FDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to combine several Ivlev-like modal systems characterized by 4-valued non-deterministic matrices (Nmatrices) with IDM4, a 4-valued expansion of Belnap-Dunn's logic FDE with an implication introduced by Pynko in 1999. In order to do this, we introduce a new methodology for combining logics which are characterized by means of swap structures, based on what we call superposition of snapshots. In particular, the combination of IDM4 with Tm, the 4-valued Ivlev's version of KT, will be analyzed with more details. From the semantical perspective, the idea is to combine the 4-valued swap structures (Nmatrices) for Tm (and several of its extensions) with the 4-valued twist structure (logical matrix) for IDM4. This superposition produces a universe of 6 snapshots, with 3 of them being designated. The multioperators over the new universe are defined by combining the specifications of the given swap and twist structures. This gives rise to 6 different paradefinite Ivlev-like modal logics, each one of them characterized by a 6-valued Nmatrix, and conservatively extending the original modal logic and IDM4. This important feature allows to consider the proposed construction as a genuine technique for combining logics. In addition, it is possible to define in the combined logics a classicality operator in the sense of logics of evidence and truth (LETs). A sound and complete Hilbert-style axiomatization is also presented for the 6 combined systems, as well as a Prolog program which implements the swap structures semantics for the 6 systems, producing a decision procedure for satisfiability, refutability and validity of formulas in these logics.</description>
