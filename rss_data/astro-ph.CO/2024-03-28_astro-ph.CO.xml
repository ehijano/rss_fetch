      <title>Limits on Early Matter Domination from the Isotropic Gamma-Ray Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cosmologies with hidden sector dark matter, the lightest hidden sector species can come to dominate the energy budget of the universe and cause an early matter-dominated era (EMDE). EMDEs amplify the matter power spectrum on small scales, leading to dense, early-forming microhalos which massively boost the dark matter annihilation signal. We use the Fermi-LAT measurement of the isotropic gamma-ray background to place limits on the parameter space of hidden sector models with EMDEs. We calculate the amplified annihilation signal by sampling the properties of prompt cusps, which reside at the centers of these microhalos and dominate the signal on account of their steep $\rho\propto r^{-3/2}$ density profiles. We also include the portions of the parameter space affected by the gravitational heating that arises from the formation and subsequent destruction of nonlinear structure during the EMDE. We are able to rule out significant portions of the parameter space, particularly at high reheat temperatures. Long EMDEs remain poorly constrained despite large structure-induced boosts to the annihilation signal.</description>

      <title>SN H0pe: The First Measurement of $H_0$ from a Multiply-Imaged Type Ia Supernova, Discovered by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first James Webb Space Telescope ({\it JWST}) Near InfraRed Camera (NIRCam) imaging in the field of the galaxy cluster PLCK G165.7+67.0 ($z=0.35$) uncovered a Type Ia supernova (SN~Ia) at $z=1.78$, called ``SN H0pe." Three different images of this one SN were detected as a result of strong gravitational lensing, each one traversing a different path in spacetime, thereby inducing a relative delay in the arrival of each image. Follow-up {\it JWST} observations of all three SN images enabled photometric and rare spectroscopic measurements of the two relative time delays. Following strict blinding protocols which oversaw a live unblinding and regulated post-unblinding changes, these two measured time delays were compared to the predictions of seven independently constructed cluster lens models to measure a value for the Hubble constant, $H_0=71.8^{+9.8}_{-7.6}$~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$. The range of admissible $H_0$ values predicted across the lens models limits further precision, reflecting the well-known degeneracies between lens model constraints and time delays. It has long been theorized that a way forward is to leverage a standard candle, however this has not been realized until now. For the first time, the lens models are evaluated by their agreement with the SN absolute magnification, breaking these degeneracies and producing our best estimate, $H_0=75.4^{+8.1}_{-5.5}$~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$. This is the first precision measurement of $H_0$ from a multiply-imaged SN~Ia, and provides a measurement in a rarely utilized redshift regime. This result agrees with other local universe measurements, yet exceeds the value of $H_0$ derived from the early Universe with $\gtrsim90\%$ confidence, increasing evidence of the Hubble tension. With the precision provided by only four more events, this approach could solidify this disagreement to $&gt;3\sigma$.</description>

      <title>JWST Photometric Time-Delay and Magnification Measurements for the Triply-Imaged Type Ia "Supernova H0pe" at z = 1.78</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) H0pe is a gravitationally lensed, triply-imaged, Type Ia SN (SN Ia) discovered in James Webb Space Telescope imaging of the PLCK G165.7+67.0 cluster of galaxies. Well-observed multiply-imaged SNe provide a rare opportunity to constrain the Hubble constant ($H_0$), by measuring the relative time delay between the images and modeling the foreground mass distribution. SN H0pe is located at $z=1.783$, and is the first SN Ia with sufficient light curve sampling and long enough time delays for an $H_0$ inference. Here we present photometric time-delay measurements and SN properties of SN H0pe. Using JWST/NIRCam photometry we measure time delays of $\Delta t_{ab}=-116.6^{+10.8}_{-9.3}$ and $\Delta t_{cb}=-48.6^{+3.6}_{-4.0}$ observer-frame days relative to the last image to arrive (image 2b; all uncertainties are $1\sigma$), which corresponds to a $\sim5.6\%$ uncertainty contribution for $H_0$ assuming $70 \rm{km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$. We also constrain the absolute magnification of each image to $\mu_{a}=4.3^{+1.6}_{-1.8}$, $\mu_{b}=7.6^{+3.6}_{-2.6}$, $\mu_{c}=6.4^{+1.6}_{-1.5}$ by comparing the observed peak near-IR magnitude of SN H0pe to the non-lensed population of SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Oscillating dark energy in light of the latest observations and its impact on the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we have performed a comparative study of different types of oscillating dark energy models using the Metropolis algorithm of MCMC. Eight different oscillating parameterization being examined herein which have demonstrated considerable ability to fit the overall cosmological observations including Pantheon sample of SnIa, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Cosmic Chronometer Hubble data and distance priors of Planck CMB. In order to compare the consistency of these models with observations, we have used both Akaike and Deviation information criteria. Although, the values of Akaike information criteria for different models indicate that there is no support for oscillating DE models, Deviation information criteria showed that there is significant support for some of these models. Our results showed that these models are capable of solving cosmic coincidence problem and alleviating the Hubble tension. Comparing the $H_0$ values obtained for different oscillating scenarios, with that of $\Lambda$CDM, we observe that our oscillating models led to $\bar{H_0}=69.78$ which is $0.29$ greater than $H_{0,\Lambda}$ and thus reduce the Hubble tension. Among all of models, Model(1) with $H_0=70.00 \pm 0.71$ is the most capable of alleviating the $H_0$ tension. Furthermore, we examined our models assuming $H_0=73.0 \pm 1.4$ from SHoES measurements. We find that adding this data point to our data combination, led to a $\Delta \bar{H_0}=0.95$ increase in $H_0$ value for different models.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Primordial Black Holes from $N$-body simulations of the Eridanus II Stellar Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tidal disruption of old, compact stellar structures provides strong constraints on macroscopic dark matter candidates such as primordial black holes. In view of recent, new observational data on the Eridanus II dwarf galaxy and on its central stellar cluster, we employ, for the first time, $N$-body simulations to assess the impact of compact massive dark matter candidates on the gravitational stability of the cluster. We find evidence that such candidates must be lighter than about one solar mass if they constitute the totality of the dark matter. We additionally derive robust constraints on the fraction of the dark matter in macroscopic objects as a function of mass, by suitably modeling the remainder of the dark matter as standard fluid-like cold dark matter.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Neutrino Decoupling and its Observable Imprints: Insights from Entropic-Dual Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very different processes characterize the decoupling of neutrinos to form the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) and the much later decoupling of photons from thermal equilibrium to form the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The C$\nu$B emerges from the fuzzy, energy-dependent neutrinosphere and encodes the physics operating in the early universe in the temperature range $T\sim 10\,{\rm MeV}$ to $T\sim10\,{\rm keV}$. This is the epoch where beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics may be influential in setting the light element abundances and the necessarily distorted fossil neutrino energy spectra. Here we use techniques honed in extensive CMB studies to analyze the C$\nu$B as calculated in detailed neutrino energy transport and nuclear reaction simulations. Our moment method, relative entropy, and differential visibility approach can leverage future high precision CMB and primordial abundance measurements to provide new insights into the C$\nu$B and any BSM physics it encodes. We demonstrate that the evolution of the energy spectrum of the C$\nu$B throughout the weak decoupling epoch is accurately captured in the Standard Model by only three parameters per species, a non-trivial conclusion given the deviation from thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, we can interpret each of the three parameters as physical characteristics of a non-equilibrium system. The success of our compact description within the Standard Model motivates its use also in BSM scenarios. We demonstrate how observations of primordial light element abundances can be used to place constraints on the C$\nu$B energy spectrum, deriving response functions that can be applied for general C$\nu$B spectral distortions. Combined with the description of those deviations that we develop here, our methods provide a convenient and powerful framework to constrain the impact of BSM physics on the C$\nu$B.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the uncertainty in the time-redshift relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The age of the Universe at a given redshift is a fundamental relationship in cosmology. For many years, the uncertainties in it were dauntingly large, close to a factor of 2. In this age of precision cosmology, they are now at the percent level and dominated solely by the Hubble constant. The uncertainties due to the parameters that describe the cosmological model are must less important. In decreasing order they are: uncertainty due to the dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w$, at most 0.9%; uncertainty due to the matter density $\Omega_M$, at most 0.5% and uncertainty due to the curvature parameter $\Omega_k$, at most 0.07%.</description>

      <title>Forecast of CMB TB and EB correlations for AliCPT-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlations between T, E modes and B modes in cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, which are expected to vanish under parity symmetry, have become a sensitive probe of the new physics beyond the standard model. In this paper, we forecast the estimation of TB and EB cross power spectra using NILC and cILC on AliCPT-1 simulations. We find that, NILC performs better than cILC on TB and EB correlations in light of its lower uncertainties. In terms of the birefringence angle estimation without assuming systematic errors, the combination of CMB TB and EB spectrum from NILC cleaned simulations could reach a sensitivity of $-0.049^\circ&lt;\beta&lt;0.056^\circ$ (95% CL).</description>

      <title>A new method to determine $H_0$ from cosmological energy-density measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for measuring the Hubble parameter from low-redshift large-scale observations that is independent of the comoving sound horizon. The method uses the baryon-to-photon ratio determined by the primordial deuterium abundance, together with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) calculations and the present-day CMB temperature to determine the physical baryon density $\Omega_b h^2$. The baryon fraction $\Omega_b/\Omega_m$ is measured using the relative amplitude of the baryonic signature in galaxy clustering measured by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, scaling the physical baryon density to the physical matter density. The physical density $\Omega_mh^2$ is then compared with the geometrical density $\Omega_m$ from Alcock-Paczynski measurements from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and voids, to give $H_0$. Including type Ia supernovae and uncalibrated BAO, we measure $H_0 = 67.1^{+6.3}_{-5.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We find similar results when varying analysis choices, such as measuring the baryon signature from the reconstructed correlation function, or excluding supernovae or voids. This measurement is currently consistent with both the distance-ladder and CMB $H_0$ determinations, but near-future large-scale structure surveys will obtain 3--4$\times$ tighter constraints.</description>

      <title>Measuring the baryon fraction using galaxy clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amplitude of the baryon signature in galaxy clustering depends on the cosmological baryon fraction. We consider two ways to isolate this signal in galaxy redshift surveys. First, we extend standard template-based Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) models to include the amplitude of the baryonic signature by splitting the transfer function into baryon and cold dark matter components with freely varying proportions. Second, we include the amplitude of the split as an extra parameter in Effective Field Theory (EFT) models of the full galaxy clustering signal. We find similar results from both approaches. For the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data we find $f_b\equiv\Omega_b/\Omega_m=0.173\pm0.027$ for template fits post-reconstruction, $f_b=0.153\pm0.029$ for template fits pre-reconstruction, and $f_b=0.154\pm0.022$ for EFT fits, with an estimated systematic error of 0.013 for all three methods. Using reconstruction only produces a marginal improvement for these measurements. Although significantly weaker than constraints on $f_b$ from the Cosmic Microwave Background, these measurements rely on very simple physics and, in particular, are independent of the sound horizon. In a companion paper we show how they can be used, together with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis measurements of the physical baryon density and geometrical measurements of the matter density from the Alcock-Paczynski effect, to constrain the Hubble parameter. While the constraints on $H_0$ based on density measurements from BOSS are relatively weak, measurements from DESI and Euclid will lead to errors on $H_0$ that are competitive with those from local distance ladder measurements.</description>

      <title>The Hierarchical Cosmic Web and Assembly Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of galaxy distributions is paramount for cosmological analysis using galaxy redshift surveys. However, this endeavor is often hindered by the computational complexity of resolving the dark matter halos that host these galaxies. To address this challenge, we propose the development of effective assembly bias models down to small scales, i.e., going beyond the local density dependence capturing non-local cosmic evolution. We introduce a hierarchical cosmic web classification that indirectly captures up to third-order long- and short-range non-local bias terms. This classification system also enables us to maintain positive definite parametric bias expansions. Specifically, we subdivide the traditional cosmic web classification, which is based on the eigenvalues of the tidal field tensor derived, with an additional classification based on the Hessian matrix of the negative density contrast. We obtain the large-scale dark matter field on a mesh with $\sim3.9\,h^{-1}$ Mpc cell side resolution through Augmented Lagrangian Perturbation Theory. To assess the effectiveness of our model, we conduct tests using a reference halo catalogue extracted from the UNIT project simulation, which was run within a cubical volume of 1 $h^{-1}$ Gpc side. The resulting mock halo catalogs, generated trough our approach, exhibit a high level of accuracy in terms of the one-, two- and three-point statistics. They reproduce the reference power spectrum within better than 2 percent accuracy up to wavenumbers $k\sim0.8\,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and provide accurate bispectra within the scales that are crucial for cosmological analysis. This effective bias approach provides a forward model appropriate for field-level cosmological inference and holds significant potential for facilitating cosmological analysis of galaxy redshift surveys, particularly in the context of projects such as DESI, EUCLID, and LSST.</description>

      <title>Cosmological inference from combining Planck and ACT cluster counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have adapted the Planck cluster likelihood in such a way that it can be applied to the sample of clusters detected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Applying it to the 2016 sample from Planck and the 2018 sample from ACT we find, by fixing the cosmology using CMB observations and the cluster model adopted by Planck, that the mass bias required by the two are $1-b_{\rm Planck}=0.61\pm 0.03$ and $1-b_{\rm ACT}=0.75\pm 0.06$. These are broadly in agreement but hint that the model could be adapted to reach a better agreement. By normalizing the cluster model using weak lensing observations, we find evidence for either evolution in the cluster model, quantified by the cluster modeling parameter describing redshift dependence $\beta=0.86 \pm 0.07$ using an updated CCCP-based normalization, or evolution in the cosmological model quantified by the dark energy equation of state parameter $w=-0.82 \pm 0.07$.</description>

      <title>Probing the dark Universe with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GW) are expected to interact with dark energy and dark matter, affecting their propagation on cosmological scales. In order to model this interaction, we derive a gauge invariant effective equation and action valid for all GWs polarizations, based on encoding the effects of the interaction of GWs at different order in perturbations, in a polarization, frequency and time dependent effective speed. The invariance of perturbations under time dependent conformal transformations and the gauge invariance of the GWs allow to obtain the unitary gauge effective action in any conformally related frame, making transparent the relation between Einstein and Jordan frame. The propagation time and luminosity distance of different GWs polarizations allow to probe at different frequencies and redshift the dark Universe, which act as an effective medium, whose physical properties can be modeled by the GWs effective speed.</description>

      <title>A search for super-imposed oscillations to the primordial power spectrum in Planck and SPT-3G 2018 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for super-imposed oscillations linearly or logarithmically spaced in Fourier wavenumbers in Planck and South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G) 2018 temperature and polarization data. The SPT-3G temperature and polarization data provide a new window to test these oscillations at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. We consider both models with a constant and a Gaussian modulated amplitude, which correspond to three and four additional parameters beyond power-law primordial power spectrum for the templates considered, respectively. We find that each of the four models considered can provide an improved fit to Planck data, consistently with previous findings, and to SPT-3G data, always compared to $\Lambda$CDM. For a constant amplitude of the superimposed oscillations, we find tighter constraints on the amplitude of the oscillations from the combined Planck/SPT-3G data set than in each individual data sets. When the ranges of parameters which provide a better fit to Planck and SPT-3G data overlap, as in the case of Gaussian modulated oscillations, we find a larger $\Delta \chi^2$ - $- 17 \, (-16)$ for logarithmic (linear) oscillations - in a combined Planck/SPT-3G data set than in each individual data sets. These findings will be further tested with upcoming CMB temperature and polarization measurements at high multipoles provided by ongoing ground experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Matter Power Spectrum Modeling in Interacting Dark Energy Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of the matter power spectrum on non-linear scales beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model is crucial for accurately predicting the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe in non-standard cosmologies. In this work, we present an analysis of the non-linear matter power spectrum within the framework of interacting dark energy-dark matter cosmologies (IDE). We employ N-body simulations and theoretical models to investigate the impact of IDE on these non-linear scales. Beginning with N-body simulations characterized by a fixed parameter space delineated by prior observational research, we adeptly fit the simulated spectra with a simple parametric function, achieving accuracy within 5\%. Subsequently, we refine a modified halo model tailored to the IDE cosmology, exhibiting exceptional precision in fitting the simulations down to scales of approximately 1 h/Mpc. To assess the model's robustness, we conduct a forecast analysis for the Euclid survey, employing our refined model. We find that the coupling parameter $\xi$ will be constrained to $\sigma(\xi) = 0.0046$. This marks a significant improvement by an order of magnitude compared to any other current observational tests documented in the literature. These primary findings pave the way for a novel preliminary approach, enabling the utilization of IDE models for observational constraints concerning LSS data on non-linear scales.</description>

      <title>Consistency of JWST Black Hole Observations with NANOGrav Gravitational Wave Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observations have opened a new chapter in studies of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), stimulating discussion of two puzzles: the abundance of SMBHs in the early Universe and the fraction of dual AGNs. In this paper we argue that the answers to these puzzles may be linked to an interpretation of the data on the nHz gravitational wave (GWs) discovered by NANOGrav and other Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) in terms of SMBH binaries losing energy by interactions with their environments as well as by GW emission. According to this interpretation, the SMBHs in low-$z$ AGNs are the tip of the iceberg of the local SMBH population, which are mainly in inactive galaxies. This interpretation would favour the observability of GW signals from BH binaries in LISA and deciHz GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Feedback in the dark: a critical examination of CMB bounds on primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If present in the early universe, primordial black holes (PBHs) will accrete matter and emit high-energy photons, altering the statistical properties of the {Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)}. This mechanism has been used to constrain the fraction of dark matter that is in the form of PBHs to be much smaller than unity for PBH masses well above one solar mass. Moreover, the presence of dense dark matter mini-halos around the PBHs has been used to set even more stringent constraints, as these would boost the accretion rates. In this work, we critically revisit CMB constraints on PBHs taking into account the role of the local ionization of the gas around them. We discuss how the local increase in temperature around PBHs can prevent the dark matter mini-halos from strongly enhancing the accretion process, in some cases significantly weakening previously derived CMB constraints. We explore in detail the key ingredients of the CMB bound and derive a conservative limit on the cosmological abundance of massive PBHs.</description>

      <title>A Deep Redshift Survey of the Perseus Cluster: Spatial Distribution and Kinematics of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the global kinematics of the Perseus galaxy cluster (Abell 426) at redshift z = 0.017 using a large sample of galaxies from our new MMT/Hectospec spectroscopic observation for this cluster. The sample includes 1447 galaxies with measured redshifts within 60' from the cluster center (1148 from this MMT/Hectospec program and 299 from the literature). The resulting spectroscopic completeness is 67% at r-band apparent magnitude $r_{\rm{Petro, 0}}\leq 18.0$ within 60' from the cluster center. To identify cluster member galaxies in this sample, we develop a new open-source Python package, CausticSNUpy. This code implements the algorithm of the caustic technique and yields 418 member galaxies within 60' of the cluster. We study the cluster using this sample of member galaxies. The cluster shows no significant signal of global rotation. A statistical test shows that the cluster does not have a noticeable substructure within 30'. We find two central regions where the X-ray emitting intracluster medium and galaxies show significant velocity differences ($&gt;7\sigma$). On a large scale, however, the overall morphology and kinematics between the intracluster medium and galaxies agree well. Our results suggest that the Perseus cluster is a relaxed system and has not experienced a recent merger.</description>

      <title>The long-lasting effect of X-ray preheating in the post-reionization intergalactic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray photons can penetrate deep into the intergalactic medium (IGM), leading to preheating of the IGM prior to cosmic reionization. X-ray preheating wipes out some of the small-scale structures that would otherwise be present prior to the passage of an ionization front. Accurate modeling of the small-scale structure is vital to the post-reionization IGM since the small-scale structure is ultimately the dominant source of long-lasting relics from hydrogen reionization. However, the precise impact of X-ray preheating in the fossils from hydrogen reionization is highly uncertain. In this work, we explore and establish for the first time, the long-lasting impact of X-ray preheating in the post-reionization IGM via hydrodynamic simulations with high-mass resolution. We find that the addition of X-ray preheating astrophysics leads to an overall lesser impact of the effect of inhomogeneous reionization in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest -- depending on specific X-ray prescription -- at low redshifts ($z \sim 2$) with respect to a model with no X-ray preheating. However, at high redshifts ($z \sim 4$), our results indicate a strengthening of the relics of reionization in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest because the IGM becomes more transparent compared to the scenario with no preheating. Thus, the absence of X-ray preheating in Lyman-$\alpha$ modeling can lead to a biased inference of cosmological parameters. Nevertheless, optimistically, the inclusion of X-ray preheating emerges as a promising novel avenue to probe the astrophysics of cosmic dawn.</description>

      <title>Multi-tracing the primordial Universe with future surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fluctuations generated by Inflation are nearly Gaussian in the simplest models, but may be non-Gaussian in more complex models, potentially leading to signatures in the late Universe. In particular, local type primordial non-Gaussianity induces scale-dependent bias in tracers of the matter distribution. This non-Gaussian imprint in the tracer power spectrum survives at late times on ultra-large scales where nonlinearity is negligible. In order to combat the problem of growing cosmic variance on these scales, we use a multi-tracer analysis that combines different tracers to maximise any primordial signal. Previous work has investigated the combination of a spectroscopic galaxy survey with a 21cm intensity mapping survey in single-dish mode. We extend this work by considering instead the case where the 21cm intensity mapping survey is optimised for interferometer mode. As examples, we use two multi-tracer pairs of surveys: one at high redshift ($1 \le z \le 2$) and one at very high redshift ($2 \le z \le 5$). The 21cm surveys are idealised surveys based on HIRAX and PUMA. We implement foreground-avoidance filters and use detailed models of the interferometer thermal noise. The galaxy surveys are idealised surveys based on Euclid and MegaMapper. Via a simple Fisher forecast, we illustrate the potential of the multi-tracer. Our results show a $\sim 20 - 30\%$ improvement in precision on local primordial non-Gaussianity from the multi-tracer. Furthermore, we investigate the effects on constraints of varying the parameter of non-Gaussian galaxy assembly bias and of varying the parameters of the intensity mapping foreground filters</description>

      <title>Turbocharging constraints on dark matter substructure through a synthesis of strong lensing flux ratios and extended lensed arcs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing provides a purely gravitational means to infer properties of dark matter halos and thereby constrain the particle nature of dark matter. Strong lenses sometimes appear as four lensed images of a background quasar accompanied by spatially-resolved emission from the quasar host galaxy encircling the main deflector (lensed arcs). We present methodology to simultaneously reconstruct lensed arcs and relative image magnifications (flux ratios) in the presence of full populations of dark matter subhalos and line-of-sight halos. To this end, we develop a new approach for multi-plane ray tracing that accelerates lens mass and source light reconstruction by factors of $\sim 100-1000$. Using simulated data with a cold dark matter (CDM) ground truth, we show that simultaneous reconstruction of lensed arcs and flux ratios isolates small-scale perturbations to flux ratios by dark matter substructure from uncertainties associated with the main deflector mass profile on larger angular scales. Relative to analyses that use only image positions and flux ratios to constrain the lens model, incorporating arcs strengthens likelihood ratios penalizing warm dark matter (WDM) with a characteristic suppression scale $m_{\rm{hm}} / M_{\odot}$ in the range $\left[10^7 - 10^{7.5}\right]$, $\left[10^{7.5} - 10^{8}\right]$, $\left[10^8 - 10^{8.5}\right]$, $\left[10^{8.5} - 10^{9}\right]$ by factors of $1.3$, $2.5$, $5.6$, and $13.1$, respectively, and the $95\%$ exclusion limit improves by 0.5 dex in $\log_{10} m_{\rm{hm}}$. The enhanced sensitivity to low-mass halos enabled by these methods pushes the observational frontier of substructure lensing to the threshold of galaxy formation, enabling stringent tests of any theory that alters the properties of dark matter halos.</description>

Abstract: Ultra-high energy cosmic rays are the most extreme energetic particles detected on Earth, however, their acceleration sites are still mysterious. We explore the contribution of low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts to the ultra-high energy cosmic ray flux, since they form the bulk of the nearby population. We analyse a representative sample of these bursts detected by BeppoSAX, INTEGRAL and Swift between 1998-2016, and found that in order to reconcile our theoretical flux with the observed flux, these bursts should accelerate at most $10^{-13}$ M$_\odot$ of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves can generate electromagnetic effects inside a strong electric or magnetic field within the Standard Model and general relativity. Here we propose using a quarterly split cavity and LC(inductor and capacitor)-resonance circuit to detect a high-frequency gravitational wave from 0.1 MHz to GHz. We perform a full 3D simulation of the cavity's signal for sensitivity estimate. Our sensitivity depends on the coherence time scale of the high-frequency gravitational wave sources and the volume size of the split cavity. We discuss the resonant measurement schemes for narrow-band gravitational wave sources and also a non-resonance scheme for broadband signals. For a meter-sized split cavity under a 14 Tesla magnetic field, the LC resonance enhanced sensitivity to the gravitational wave strain is expected to reach $h\sim 10^{-20}$ around $10$ MHz.</description>

Abstract: We revise the dynamics of interacting vector-like dark energy, a theoretical framework proposed to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe. By investigating the interaction between vector-like dark energy and dark matter, we analyze its effects on the cosmic expansion history and the thermodynamics of the accelerating universe. Our results demonstrate that the presence of interaction significantly influences the evolution of vector-like dark energy, leading to distinct features in its equation of state and energy density. We compare our findings with observational data and highlight the importance of considering interactions in future cosmological studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Ultra)light spin-$1$ particles -- dark photons -- can constitute all of dark matter (DM) and have beyond Standard Model couplings. This can lead to a coherent, oscillatory signature in terrestrial detectors that depends on the coupling strength. We provide a signal analysis and statistical framework for inferring the properties of such DM by taking into account (i) the stochastic and (ii) the vector nature of the underlying field, along with (iii) the effects due to the Earth's rotation. Owing to equipartition, on time scales shorter than the coherence time the DM field vector typically traces out a fixed ellipse. Taking this ellipse and the rotation of the Earth into account, we highlight a distinctive three-peak signal in Fourier space that can be used to constrain DM coupling strengths. Accounting for all three peaks, we derive latitude-independent constraints on such DM couplings, unlike those stemming from single-peak studies. We apply our framework to the search for ultralight $B - L$ DM using optomechanical sensors, demonstrating the ability to delve into previously unprobed regions of this DM candidate's parameter space.</description>
