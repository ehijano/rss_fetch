      <title>How to escape atypical regions in the symmetric binary perceptron: a journey through connected-solutions states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the binary symmetric perceptron model, and in particular its atypical solutions. While the solution-space of this problem is dominated by isolated configurations~\cite{aubin2019storage}, it is also solvable for a certain range of constraint density $\alpha$ and threshold $\kappa$. We provide in this paper a statistical measure probing sequences of solutions, where two consecutive elements shares a strong overlap. After simplifications, we test its predictions by comparing it to Monte-Carlo simulations. We obtain good agreement and show that connected states with a Markovian correlation profile can fully decorrelate from their initialization only for $\kappa&gt;\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}$ ($\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}\sim \sqrt{0.91\log(N)}$ for $\alpha=0.5$ and $N$ being the dimension of the problem). For $\kappa&lt;\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}$, we show that decorrelated sequences still exist but have a non-trivial correlations profile. To study this regime we introduce an $Ansatz$ for the correlations that we label as the nested Markov chain.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak symmetry breaking states in stochastic dephasing stabilizer circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering mixed state quantum orders is an on-going issue. Recently, it has been recognized that there are (at least) two kinds of symmetries in the mixed state; strong and weak symmetries. Under symmetry-respective decoherence, spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking (SSSB) can occur. This work provides a scheme to describe SSSB and other decoherence phenomena in the mixed state by employing the stabilizer formalism and the efficient numerical algorithm of Clifford circuits. We present two systematic numerical studies. In a two-dimensional (2D) circuit with a stochastic Ising type decoherence, an SSSB phase transition is clearly observed and its criticality is elucidated by the numerical methods. In particular, we calculate R\'{e}nyi-2 correlations and estimate critical exponents of the SSSB transition. For the second system, we introduce an idea of subsystem SSSB. As an example, we study a system with symmetry-protected-topological (SPT) order provided by both one-form and zero-form symmetries, and observe how the system evolves under decoherence. After displaying numerical results, we show that viewpoint of percolation is quite useful to understand the SSSB transition, which is applicable for a wide range of decohered states. Finally, we comment on SSSB of one-form-symmetry exemplifying toric code.</description>

      <title>Absence of Normal Heat Conduction in Strongly Disordered Interacting Quantum Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that in strongly disordered, interacting, quantum chains, the conductance of a chain of length $L$ vanishes faster than $1/L$. This means that transport is anomalous in such chains. This phenomenon was first claimed in \cite{Basko2006,gornyi2005interacting} and a pioneering treatment appeared in \cite{Imbrie2016a}</description>

      <title>Beyond Nearest-neighbour Universality of Spectral Fluctuations in Quantum Chaotic and Complex Many-body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discerning chaos in quantum systems is an important problem as the usual route of Lyapunov exponents in classical systems is not straightforward in quantum systems. A standard route is the comparison of statistics derived from model physical systems to those from random matrix theory (RMT) ensembles, of which the most popular is the nearest-neighbour-spacings distribution (NNSD), which almost always shows good agreement with chaotic quantum systems. However, even in these cases, the long-range statistics (like number variance, spectral rigidity etc.), which are also more difficult to calculate, often show disagreements with RMT. As such, a more stringent test for chaos in quantum systems, via an analysis of intermediate-range statistics is needed, which will additionally assess the extent of agreement with RMT universality. In this paper, we deduce the effective level-repulsion parameters and the corresponding Wigner-surmise-like results of the next-nearest-neighbor spacing distribution (nNNSD) for integrable systems (semi-Poissonian statistics) as well as the three classical quantum-chaotic Wigner-Dyson regimes, by stringent comparisons to numerical RMT models and benchmarking against our exact analytical results for $3\times 3$ Gaussian matrix models, along with a semi-analytical form for the nNNSD in the Orthogonal-to-Unitary symmetry crossover. To illustrate the robustness of these RMT based results, we test these predictions against the nNNSD obtained from quantum chaotic models as well as disordered lattice spin models. This reinforces the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit and the Berry-Tabor conjectures, extending the associated universality to longer range statistics. In passing, we also highlight the equivalence of nNNSD in the apparently distinct Orthogonal-to-Unitary and diluted-Symplectic-to-Unitary crossovers.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic Orbital Hall Effect: Interplay Between Diffusive and Intrinsic Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent success of identifying experimental signatures of the orbital Hall effect (OHE), the research on the microscopic mechanisms behind this unique phenomenon is still in its infancy. Here, using a gapped 2D Dirac material as a model system of the OHE, we develop a microscopic theory of orbital transport which captures extrinsic disorder effects non-perturbatively. We show that it predicts several hitherto unknown effects, including (i) a strong dependence of the OHE conductivity with the strength and symmetry of the impurity scattering potential, and (ii) a smooth crossover from intrinsic to extrinsic OHE as a function of the Fermi energy. In contrast to previous (perturbative) studies, the OHE is found to exhibit bona fide diffusive behavior in the dilute impurity limit, which we trace back to the dominance of skew scattering-type processes. Our work unveils the crucial nature of nonperturbative vertex corrections for a correct description of extrinsic orbital Hall transport and confirms common short-range impurities as key enablers of the OHE.</description>

      <title>Dynamical scaling behavior of the two-dimensional random singlet state in the random $Q$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the scaling relation of energy and length scales in the 2D random-singlet (RS) state of the random $Q$ model. To investigate the intrinsic energy scale of the spinon subsystem arising from the model, we develop a constrained subspace update algorithm within the framework of the stochastic series expansion method (SSE) to extract the singlet-triplet gap of the system. The 2D RS state exhibits scaling behavior similar to the infinite randomness fixed point (IRFP), at least within the length scales that we simulate. Furthermore, by rescaling the system size according to the strength of randomness, we observe that the data for the excitation gap and the width of the gap distribution collapse onto a single curve. This implies that the model with different strengths of randomness may correspond to the same fixed point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $N$ two-dimensional Ising models coupled in presence of quenched disorder and use scale invariant scattering theory to exactly show the presence of a line of renormalization group fixed points for any fixed value of $N$ other than 1. We show how this result relates to perturbative studies and sheds light on numerical simulations. We also observe that the limit $N\to 1$ may be of interest for the Ising spin glass, and point out potential relevance for nonuniversality in other contexts of random criticality.</description>

      <title>Risk and cross validation in ridge regression with correlated samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen substantial advances in our understanding of high-dimensional ridge regression, but existing theories assume that training examples are independent. By leveraging recent techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Protecting Quantum Information via Many-Body Dynamical Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamically localized states in quantum many-body systems are fundamentally important in understanding quantum thermalization and have applications in quantum information processing. Here we explore many-body dynamical localization (MBDL) without disorders in a non-integrable quantum XY spin chain under periodical and quadratic kicks. We obtain the localization phase diagram with the MBDL and delocalization states and show dynamical observables to extract the phase diagram. For proper kick strengths in the MBDL regime, we reveal a local dynamical decoupling effect for persistent Rabi oscillation of certain spins. Furthermore, we propose the MBDL-protected quantum information at high temperatures, and present an analysis of the dynamical decoupling to obtain the required system parameters for quantum storage. Compared to other non-thermalized states, the disorder-free MBDL states require much fewer repetitions and resources, providing a promising way to protect and store quantum information robust against thermal noises.</description>
