      <title>A Minimal Network of Brain Dynamics: Hierarchy of Approximations to Quasi-critical Neural Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an interacting branching model of neural network dynamics, incorporating key biological features such as inhibition with several types of inhibitory interactions. We establish a hierarchy of analytical mean-field approximations to the model, which characterizes nonequilibrium phase transitions between disorder and ordered phases, and perform a stability analysis. Generically, inhibitory neurons increase the stability of the model dynamics. The model is consistent with the quasi-criticality hypothesis in that it displays regions of maximal dynamical susceptibility and maximal mutual information predicated on the strength of the external stimuli. Directed percolation emerges as the universality class of the critical transition of the model, consistent with some previous experimental data and models. In the unstable phase, chaotic dynamics emerge, which may be linked to the occurrence of epileptic seizures.</description>

      <title>Observation of disorder-induced superfluidity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of states with long-range correlations in a disordered landscape is rare, as disorder typically suppresses the particle mobility required for long-range coherence. But when more than two energy levels are available per site, disorder can induce resonances that locally enhance mobility. Here we explore phases arising from the interplay between disorder, kinetic energy, and interactions on a superconducting processor with qutrit readout and control. Compressibility measurements distinguish an incompressible Mott insulator from surrounding compressible phases and reveal signatures of glassiness, reflected in non-ergodic behavior. Spatially-resolved two-point correlator measurements identify regions of the phase diagram with a non-vanishing condensate fraction. We also visualize the spectrum by measuring the dynamical structure factor. A linearly-dispersing phonon mode materializes in the superfluid, appearing even when disorder is introduced to the clean Mott insulator. Our results provide strong experimental evidence for disorder-induced superfluidity.</description>

      <title>Incorporating rank-free coupling and external field via an amplitude-only modulated spatial photonic Ising machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines have emerged as effective solvers for combinatorial optimization problems, such as NP-hard problems, machine learning, and financial modeling. Recent spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) excel in multi-node optimization and spin glass simulations, leveraging their large-scale and fully connected characteristics. However, existing laser diffraction-based SPIMs usually sacrifice time efficiency or spin count to encode high-rank spin-spin coupling and external fields, limiting their scalability for real-world applications. Here, we demonstrate an amplitude-only modulated rank-free spatial photonic Ising machine (AR-SPIM) with 200 iterations per second. By re-formulating an arbitrary Ising Hamiltonian as the sum of Hadamard products, followed by loading the corresponding matrices/vectors onto an aligned amplitude spatial light modulator and digital micro-mirrors device, we directly map a 797-spin Ising model with external fields (nearly 9-bit precision, -255 to 255) into an incoherent light field, eliminating the need for repeated and auxiliary operations. Serving as encoding accuracy metrics, the linear coefficient of determination and Pearson correlation coefficient between measured light intensities and Ising Hamiltonians exceed 0.9800, with values exceed 0.9997 globally. The AR-SPIM achieves less than 0.3% error rate for ground-state search of biased Max-cut problems with arbitrary ranks and weights, enables complex phase transition observations, and facilitates scalable spin counts for sparse Ising problems via removing zero-valued Hadamard product terms. This reconfigurable AR-SPIM can be further developed to support large-scale machine-learning training and deployed for practical applications in discrete optimization and quantum many-body simulations.</description>

      <title>The Loring--Schulz-Baldes Spectral Localizer Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral localizer, introduced by Loring in 2015 and Loring and Schulz-Baldes in 2017, is a method to compute the (infinite volume) topological invariant of a quantum Hamiltonian on $\ZZ^d$, as the signature of the (finite) localizer matrix. We present a direct and elementary spectral-theoretic proof treating the $d=1$ and $d=2$ cases on an almost equal footing. Moreover, we re-interpret the localizer as a higher-dimensional topological insulator via the bulk-edge correspondence.</description>

      <title>Electrically induced ferromagnetism in an irradiated complex oxide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In metal-insulator transition materials, a small perturbation can shift the delicate balance between competing or coexisting electronic phases, leading to dramatic changes of the material's properties. Using La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, a prototypical metal-insulator transition manganite, we show that local low-dose focused ion beam irradiation increases resistivity by several orders of magnitude, converting the ferromagnetic-metal ground state into a paramagnetic-insulator. Surprisingly, we found that applying electric stimuli to the irradiated material induces a non-thermal insulator-to-metal transition, which results in low-power, repeatable volatile resistive switching. Magnetotransport measurements revealed that this voltage-induced metallic phase in the irradiated material is ferromagnetic, exhibiting clear anisotropic magnetoresistance. This work, thus, reports the discovery of a unique material in which the electrical triggering of the electronic phase transition results in the onset of magnetism, in stark contrast to the magnetic order suppression commonly observed in other metal-insulator transition switching materials. We demonstrate that local focused ion beam irradiation provides new and exciting opportunities to engineer electronic and magnetic functionalities that can find practical applications ranging from spintronics to neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Spins: Statistical mechanics for error correction with stabilizer circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A powerful method for analyzing quantum error-correcting codes is to map them onto classical statistical mechanics models. Such mappings have thus far mostly focused on static codes, possibly subject to repeated syndrome measurements. Recent progress in quantum error correction, however, has prompted new paradigms where codes emerge from stabilizer circuits in spacetime -- a unifying perspective encompassing syndrome extraction circuits of static codes, dynamically generated codes, and logical operations. We show how to construct statistical mechanical models for stabilizer circuits subject to independent Pauli errors, by mapping logical equivalence class probabilities of errors to partition functions using the spacetime subsystem code formalism. We also introduce a modular language of spin diagrams for constructing the spin Hamiltonians, which we describe in detail focusing on independent circuit-level X-Z error channels. With the repetition and toric codes as examples, we use our approach to analytically rank logical error rates and thresholds between code implementations with standard and dynamic syndrome extraction circuits, describe the effect of transversal logical Clifford gates on logical error rates, and perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate maximum likelihood thresholds. Our framework offers a universal prescription to analyze, simulate, and compare the decoding properties of any stabilizer circuit, while revealing the innate connections between dynamical quantum systems and noise-resilient phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Information Critical Phases under Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum critical phases are extended regions of phase space characterized by a diverging correlation length. By analogy, we define an information critical phase as an extended region of a mixed state phase diagram where the Markov length, the characteristic length scale governing the decay of the conditional mutual information (CMI), diverges.
  We demonstrate that such a phase arises in decohered $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric codes by assessing both the CMI and the coherent information, the latter quantifying the robustness of the encoded logical qudits. For $N&gt;4$, we find that the system hosts an information critical phase intervening between the decodable and non-decodable phases where the coherent information saturates to a fractional value in the thermodynamic limit, indicating that a finite fraction of logical information is still preserved. We show that the density matrix in this phase can be decomposed into a convex sum of Coulombic pure states, where gapped anyons reorganize into gapless photons. We further consider the ungauged $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and interpret its mixed state phase diagram in the language of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking. We argue that in the dual model, the information critical phase arises because the spontaneously broken off-diagonal $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ symmetry gets enhanced to a U(1) symmetry, resulting in a novel superfluid phase whose gapless modes involve coherent excitations of both the system and the environment. Finally, we propose an optimal decoding protocol for the corrupted $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and evaluate its effectiveness in recovering the fractional logical information preserved in the information critical phase. Our findings identify a gapless analog for mixed-state phases that still acts as a fractional topological quantum memory, thereby extending the conventional paradigm of quantum memory phases.</description>

      <title>Hidden self-duality and exact mobility edges in quasiperiodic network models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In one-dimensional quasiperiodic systems, only a few models with exact mobility edges (MEs) have been constructed using generalized self-duality theory, Avila's global theory, or the renormalization group method. This raises an intriguing question that whether we can realize more physical models with exact solvable MEs. In this work, we uncover the hidden self-duality within a class of quasiperiodic network models constituted by periodic and quasiperiodic sites. Although the original Hamiltonians appear to lack self-duality, their effective Hamiltonians obtained by integrating out the periodic sites exhibit self-duality, which yield MEs. The well-studied mosaic model, which is the simplest case of quasiperiodic network models, was previously thought to exhibit MEs due to the absence of self-duality, but we show that they actually arise from the hidden self-duality. Using the effective Hamiltonian, we further introduce the concept of resonant states to understand the shape of MEs. Finally, we present in detail how to determine the MEs in various network models, including some non-Hermitian models, based on the hidden self-duality. These predictions can be experimentally realized using optical and acoustic waveguide arrays. Our work can greatly advance our understanding of MEs in Anderson transition.</description>

      <title>Exact mobility edges in quasiperiodic network models with slowly varying potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic models are important physical platforms to explore Anderson transitions in low dimensional systems, yet the exact mobility edges (MEs) are generally hard to be determined analytically. To date, the MEs in only a few models can be determined exactly. In this manuscript, we propose a new class of network models characterized by quasiperiodic slowly varying potentials and the absence of hidden self-duality, and exactly determine their MEs. We take the mosaic models with slowly varying potentials as examples to illustrate this result and derive its MEs from the effective Hamiltonian. In this method, we can integrate out the periodic sites to obtain an effective Hamiltonian with energy-dependent potentials $g(E)V$ and effective eigenenergy $f(E)$, which directly yields the MEs at $f(E) = \pm(2t^\kappa \pm g(E)V)$, where $\kappa \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. With this idea in hand, we then generalize our method to more quasiperiodic network models, including those with much more complicated geometries and non-Hermitian features. Finally, we propose the realization of these models using optical waveguides and show that the Anderson transition can be observed even in small physical systems (with lattice sites about $L = 50 - 100$). Our results provide some key insights into the understanding and realization of exact MEs in experiments.</description>

      <title>Divergent density of states and non-analytic Lyapunov exponent in one-dimensional slowly varying systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localization of wave functions in disordered systems can be characterized by the Lyapunov exponent, which is zero in the extended phase and nonzero in the localized phase. Previous studies have shown that this exponent is an analytic function of eigenenergy in a given phase, thus its non-analytic behavior has been commonly used to determine the boundaries between the extended and localized phases. In this work, we show that if the localization centers are inhomogeneous across the whole chain and the system possesses (at least) two different localization modes, the Lyapunov exponent can become non-analytic in the localized phase at the boundaries between the different localization modes. We establish this central result by using several one-dimensional slowly varying models, and reveal that the non-analytic feature in the Lyapunov exponent is inherently tied to the singularities in the density of states through the Thouless formula. The possible existence of delicate structures in the localized phase effectively broadens our understanding of Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Unified Description of Learning Dynamics in the Soft Committee Machine from Finite to Ultra-Wide Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the learning dynamics of the soft committee machine (SCM) with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation using a statistical-mechanics approach within the annealed approximation. The SCM consists of a student network with $N$ input units and $K$ hidden units trained to reproduce the output of a teacher network with $M$ hidden units. We introduce a reduced set of macroscopic order parameters that yields a unified description valid from the conventional regime $K \ll N$ to the ultra-wide limit $K \ge N$. The control parameter $\alpha$, proportional to the ratio of training samples to adjustable weights, serves as an effective measure of dataset size.
  For small $\gamma = M/N$, we recover a continuous phase transition at $\alpha_{c} \approx 2\pi$ from an unspecialized, permutation-symmetric state to a specialized state in which student units align with the teacher. For finite $\gamma$, the transition disappears and the generalization error decreases smoothly with dataset size, reaching a low plateau when $\gamma=1$. In the asymptotic limit $\alpha \to \infty$, the error scales as $\varepsilon_{g} \propto 1/\alpha$, independent of $\gamma$ and $K$. The results highlight the central role of network dimensions in SCM learning and provide a framework extendable to other activations and quenched analyses.</description>

Abstract: To analyze the $\pm J$ XY spin-glass in three dimensions, we verified a method aimed at obtaining a high-precision dynamical exponent $z$ from the correlation length in the nonequilibrium relaxation process. The obtained $z$ yielded consistent and highly accurate results in previous studies for relatively well-studied models -- specifically, the three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnetic Ising model and the 3D $\pm J$ Ising model. Building on these previous studies, we used this method and the dynamical scaling method to analyze the 3D $\pm J$ XY model and obtained highly precise critical temperatures and exponents. These findings support the spin chirality decoupling picture, explaining the experimental spin-glass phase transition.</description>
