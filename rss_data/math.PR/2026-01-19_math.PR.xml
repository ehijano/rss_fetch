      <title>Universality results for random matrices over finite local rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a finite local ring. We prove a quantitative universality statement for the cokernel of random matrices with i.i.d. entries valued in $R$. Rather than use the moment method, we use the Lindeberg replacement technique. This approach also yields a universality result for several invariants that are finer than the cokernel, such as the span and the determinant.</description>

      <title>Distribution of particles near the front in supercritical branching Brownian motion with compactly supported branching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time behavior of a $d-$dimensional supercritical branching Brownian motion with a compactly supported branching potential. It is known that, for $\mathbf{v}\in \mathbb{R}^d$, all the moments of the normalized number of particles in a bounded domain centered at $\mathbf{v} t$ converge, as $t \rightarrow \infty$, provided that $\|\mathbf{v}\|$ is strictly less than the asymptotic speed of the front. The limiting distribution does not depend on $\mathbf{v}$. Using sharp asymptotics for the solutions of parabolic PDEs with compact potential, we prove that the normalized number of particles in a bounded time-dependent domain located near the front converges in distribution and with all the moments. The limit, however, now depends on the asymptotic location of the domain.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory for Markov chains with transition matrix admitting a stochastic bidiagonal factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently established spectral Favard theorem for bounded banded matrices admitting a positive bidiagonal factorization is applied to a broader class of Markov chains with bounded banded transition matrices, extending beyond the classical birth-and-death setting, to those that allow a positive stochastic bidiagonal factorization. In the finite case, the Karlin-McGregor spectral representation is derived. The recurrence of the Markov chain is established, and explicit formulas for the stationary distributions are provided in terms of orthogonal polynomials. Analogous results are obtained for the countably infinite case. In this setting, the chain is not necessarily recurrent, and its behavior is characterized in terms of the associated spectral measure. Finally, ergodicity is examined through the presence of a mass at $1$ in the spectral measure, corresponding to the eigenvalue $1$ with both right and left eigenvectors.</description>

      <title>Concentration of the empirical measure in Wasserstein distance: bounds involving the covering dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give concentration inequalities in Wasserstein distance for the empirical measure of a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with values in a Polish space E. These inequalities involve the covering dimension of the support of the distribution of the variables. More precisely, we obtain a complete extension of the concentration inequalities of Fournier and Guillin [2015] in the case where E = R^d , in which the covering dimension replaces the dimension of the ambient space E.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rate of convergence of two discrete processes towards the Brownian bridge: the random walk conditioned to be zero at time 2n and the empirical process which appears in the Glivencko-Cantelli theorem. Combining a functional Stein method with a Radon-Nikodym representation of the bridge, we bound the Fortet-Mourier distance between these conditioned processes and the Brownian bridge.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian process limit for the self-normalized Ewens-Pitman process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an integer $n\geq1$, consider a random partition $\Pi_{n}$ of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ into $K_{n}$ partition sets with $K_{r,n}$ partition subsets of size $r=1,\ldots,n$, and assume $\Pi_{n}$ distributed according to the Ewens-Pitman model with parameters $\alpha\in]0,1[$ and $\theta&gt;-\alpha$. Although the large-$n$ asymptotic behaviors of $K_{n}$ and $K_{r,n}$ are well understood in terms of almost sure convergence and Gaussian fluctuations, much less is known about the asymptotic behavior of $P_{r,n}=K_{r,n}/K_n$ and of the self-normalized Ewens-Pitman process $(P_{1,n},P_{2,n},\dots)$. Motivated by the almost sure convergence of $(P_{1,n},P_{2,n},\dots)$ to the Sibuya distribution $p_{\alpha}=(p_{\alpha}(1),p_{\alpha}(2),\ldots)$, where $p_{\alpha}(r)$ is the probability mass at $r=1,2,\ldots$, we establish the $\ell^{2}$ distributional convergence \begin{displaymath} \sqrt{K_{n}}((P_{1,n},\,P_{2,n},\ldots)-p_{\alpha})\underset{n\rightarrow+\infty}{\overset{\cL}{\longrightarrow}}\mathcal{G}(\Gamma_\alpha), \end{displaymath} where $\mathcal{G}(\Gamma_\alpha)$ stands for a centered Gaussian process with covariance matrix $\Gamma_\alpha=diag(p_{\alpha}) - p_{\alpha} p_{\alpha}^T$. We apply our result to the estimation of the parameter</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of solutions to a sweeping process in the presence of stochastic perturbations, where the moving set takes uniformly prox-regular values and varies continuously with respect to the Hausdorff distance, without smoothness assumptions. We consider several geometric assumptions and establish important relationships between them.</description>

      <title>Dvoretzky covering problem for general measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Dvoretzky covering problem for random covering sets driven by general Borel probability measures. As our main result, we solve the problem of covering analytic sets by random covering sets generated by arbitrary Borel probability measures on the real line. Prior to this work, a complete solution was not known for any singular measure. Our solution is potential theoretic and involves a generalisation of a notion of capacity in the work of Kahane, who solved the problem of covering compact sets in the classical setting where the random covering process is driven by the Lebesgue measure on the unit circle. One of our key innovations is a simple but powerful application of the Jankov-von Neumann uniformisation theorem, which we believe to have interest outside of this work.
  In addition, we determine the critical exponent for the covering problem for polynomially decreasing sequences $(cn^{-t})_n$ for random covering sets driven by Borel probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$. At exactly the critical exponent, the covering property generally depends on the constant $c&gt;0$, and as an application of our main result, we determine the critical constant for random covering sets driven by natural measures on strongly separated self-conformal sets on the line. The critical constant depends on the multifractal structure of the average densities of the measure, and the result is new even for the simplest case of the Hausdorff measure on the Cantor set.</description>

      <title>L\'evy walkers inside spherical shells with absorbing boundaries: Towards settling the optimal L\'evy walk strategy for random searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The L\'evy flight foraging hypothesis states that organisms must have evolved adaptations to exploit L\'evy walk search strategies. Indeed, it is widely accepted that inverse square L\'evy walks optimize the search efficiency in foraging with unrestricted revisits (also known as non-destructive foraging). However, a mathematically rigorous demonstration of this for dimensions $D \geq 2$ is still lacking. Here we study the very closely related problem of a L\'evy walker inside annuli or spherical shells with absorbing boundaries. In the limit that corresponds to the foraging with unrestricted revisits, we show that inverse square L\'evy walks optimize the search. This constitutes the strongest formal result to date supporting the optimality of inverse square L\'evy walks search strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In random matrices with independent and continuous matrix entries, the degeneracy probability of the eigenvalues is known to be zero. In this paper, random matrices including discontinuous matrix entries are analyzed in order to observe how degeneracy is generated. Using Erd\"os-R\'enyi matching probability theory of random bipartite graphs, we asymptotically evaluate the degeneracy probability of such random matrices. As a result, due to accumulation of the eigenvalues to the origin, a positive degeneracy probability is found for eigenvalues of a sparse random matrix model.</description>

      <title>Controlled Interacting Branching Diffusion Processes: A Viscosity Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study optimal control problems for interacting branching diffusion processes, a class of measure-valued dynamics capturing both spatial motion and branching mechanisms. From the perspective of the dynamic programming principle, we establish a rigorous connection between the control problem and an infinite system of coupled Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations, obtained through a bijection between admissible particle configurations and the disjoint topological union of countable Euclidean spaces. Under natural coercivity conditions on the cost functionals, we show that these growth conditions transfer to the value function and yield a viscosity characterization in the class of functions satisfying the same bounds. We further prove a comparison principle, which allows us to fully characterize the control problem through the associated HJB equation. Finally, we show that the problem simplifies in the mean-field regime, where the model coefficients exhibit symmetry with respect to the indices of the individuals in the population. This permutation invariance allows us to restrict attention to a reduced class of symmetric admissible controls, a reduction established by combining the viscosity characterization of the value function with measurable selection arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first systematic development of Stein's method for matrix distributions. We establish the basic essential ingredients of Stein's method for matrix normal approximation: we derive a generator-based Stein identity from a matrix Ornstein--Uhlenbeck diffusion with two-sided scales, provide an explicit semigroup representation for the solution of the Stein equation, and obtain regularity estimates for the solution. The new methodology is illustrated with three statistical applications, these being smooth Wasserstein distance bounds to quantify the matrix central limit theorem, a Wasserstein distance bound for the matrix normal approximation of the centered matrix $T$ distribution, and the derivation of Stein's method-of-moments estimators for scale parameters of the matrix normal distribution.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limit of Non-exchangeable interacting diffusions with singular kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean-field limit of interacting diffusions without exchangeability, caused by weighted interactions and non-i.i.d. initial values, are investigated. The weights could be signed and unbounded. The result applies to a large class of singular kernels including the Biot-Savart law. We demonstrate a flexible type of mean-field convergence, in contrast to the typical convergence of $\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\delta_{X_i}$. More specifically, the sequence of signed empirical measure processes with arbitrary uniform $l^r$-weights, $r&gt;1$, weakly converges to a coupled PDE's, such as the dynamics describing the passive scalar advected by the 2D Navier-Stokes equation. 
  Our method is based on a tightness/compactness argument and makes use of the systems' uniform Fisher information. The main difficulty is to determine how to propagate the regularity properties of the limits of empirical measures in the absence of the DeFinetti-Hewitt-Savage theorem for the non-exchangeable case. To this end, a sequence of random measures, which merges weakly with a sequence of weighted empirical measures and has uniform Sobolev regularity, is constructed through the disintegration of the joint laws of particles.</description>

      <title>Rate of convergence of the critical point of the memory-$\tau$ self-avoiding walk in dimensions $d&gt;4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider spread-out models of the self-avoiding walk and its finite-memory version, known as the memory-$\tau$ walk, which prohibits loops whose length is at most $\tau$, in dimensions $d&gt;4$. The critical point is defined as the radius of convergence of the generating function for each model. It is known that the critical point of the memory-$\tau$ walk is non-decreasing in $\tau$ and converges to that of the self-avoiding walk as $\tau$ tends to infinity. In this paper, we study the rate at which the critical point of the memory-$\tau$ walk converges to that of the self-avoiding walk and show that the order is $\tau^{-(d-2)/2}$. The proof relies on the lace expansion, introduced by Brydges and Spencer.</description>

      <title>On the moments of the mass of shrinking balls under the Critical $2d$ Stochastic Heat Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Critical $2d$ Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF) is a measure valued stochastic process on $\mathbb{R}^2$ that defines a non-trivial solution to the two-dimensional stochastic heat equation with multiplicative space-time noise. Its one-time marginals are a.s. singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure, meaning that the mass they assign to shrinking balls decays to zero faster than their Lebesgue volume. In this work we explore the intermittency properties of the Critical 2d SHF by studying the asymptotics of the $h$-th moment of the mass that it assigns to shrinking balls of radius $\epsilon$ and we determine that its ratio to the Lebesgue volume is of order $(\log\tfrac{1}{\epsilon})^{{h\choose 2}}$ up to possible lower order corrections.</description>

      <title>Planar Novikov-Shubin invariant for adjacency matrices of structured directed dense random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Novikov-Shubin invariant associated to a graph provides information about the accumulation of eigenvalues of the corresponding adjacency matrix close to the origin. For a directed graph these eigenvalues lie in the complex plane and having a finite value for the planar Novikov-Shubin invariant indicates a polynomial behaviour of the eigenvalue density as a function of the distance to zero. We provide a complete description of these invariants for dense random digraphs with constant batch sizes, i.e. for the directed stochastic block model. The invariants depend only on which batches in the graph are connected by non-zero edge densities. We present an explicit finite step algorithm for their computation. For the proof we identify the asymptotic spectral density with the distribution of a $\mathbb{C}^K$-valued circular element in operator-valued free probability theory. We determine the spectral density in the bulk regime by solving the associated Dyson equation and infer the singular behaviour of this density close to the origin by determining the exponents associated to the power law with which the resolvent entries of the adjacency matrix that corresponds to the individual batches diverge to infinity or converge to zero.</description>

      <title>Talagrand Meets Talagrand: Upper and Lower Bounds on Expected Soft Maxima of Gaussian Processes with Finite Index Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analysis of extremal behavior of stochastic processes is a key ingredient in a wide variety of applications, including probability, statistical physics, theoretical computer science, and learning theory. In this paper, we consider centered Gaussian processes on finite index sets and investigate expected values of their smoothed, or ``soft,'' maxima. We obtain upper and lower bounds for these expected values using a combination of ideas from statistical physics (the Gibbs variational principle for the equilibrium free energy and replica-symmetric representations of Gibbs averages) and from probability theory (Sudakov minoration). These bounds are parametrized by an inverse temperature $\beta &gt; 0$ and reduce to the usual Gaussian maximal inequalities in the zero-temperature limit $\beta \to \infty$. We provide an illustration of our methods in the context of the Random Energy Model, one of the simplest models of physical systems with random disorder.</description>

      <title>Operator $\ell^\infty \to \ell^\infty$ norm of products of random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $\ell^\infty \to \ell^\infty$ operator norm of products of independent random matrices with independent and identically distributed entries. For $n$-by-$n$ matrices whose entries are centered, have unit variance, and have a finite moment of order $4\alpha$ for some $\alpha &gt; 1$, we find that the operator norm of the product of $p$ matrices behaves asymptotically like $n^{\frac {p+1}{2}}\sqrt{2/\pi}$. The case of products of possibly non-square matrices with possibly non-centered entries is also covered.</description>

      <title>Flows driven by multi-indices Rough Paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a solution theory for scalar-valued rough differential equations driven by multi-indices rough paths. To achieve this task, we will show how the flow approach using the log-ODE method introduced by Bailleul fits perfectly in this setting. In addition, we also describe the action of the translation of multi-indices rough paths at the level of rough differential equations.</description>

      <title>Complex abstract Wiener spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real abstract Wiener spaces (AWS) were originally defined by Gross using measurable norms, as a generalisation of the theory of advanced integral calculus in infinite dimensions as introduced by Cameron and Martin. In this paper we present a rigorous, complete and self-contained general framework for $\mathbb{K}$-AWS, where $\mathbb{K} \in \{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}\}$ using the language of characteristic functions instead of measurable norms. In particular, we will prove that $X$ is a centred resp. proper $H$-valued Gaussian field over $\mathbb{K}$ iff the covariance function can be written in terms of some non-negative, self-adjoint trace class operator, and that the existence and uniqueness of $X$ is equivalent to the $\mathbb{K}$-AWS. Finally we will relate the $\mathbb{C}$-AWS to the $\mathbb{R}$-AWS by way of a real structure, which is a real linear, complex anti-linear involution on a complex vector space. This allows for a commutative relation between the real and complex Gaussian fields and the real and complex abstract Wiener spaces. We will construct specific examples which fall under this framework like the complex Brownian motion, complex Feynman-Kac formula and complex fractional Gaussian fields.</description>

      <title>Identification of the residual term in multiplicative self-decomposition using Fox $H$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiplicative self-decomposable laws describe random variables that can be decomposed into a product of a scaled-down version of themselves and an independent residual term. Shanbhag et al.~(1977) have shown that the gamma distribution is multiplicative self-decomposable, in particular, the exponential distribution. As a result, they established the multiplicative self-decomposability of the absolute value of a centered normal random variable. A limitation of Shanbhag's result is that the distribution of the residual component is not explicitly identified. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by providing an explicit distribution of the residual term using a Fox $H$-function. More precisely, the residual term follows an $M$-Wright distribution for the exponential distribution, whereas for the generalized gamma distribution and the absolute value of a centered normal random variable, an $H_{1,1}^{1,0}$ distribution with different parameters.</description>

Abstract: We study monotone paths in Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs on numbered vertices. Benjamini &amp; Tzalik established a phase transition at $p = \frac{\log n}{n}$ for this model. We refine the critical value to $p = \frac{\log n - \log \log n }{n}$ and identify the critical window of order $\Theta(1/n)$.</description>

      <title>Deviation probabilities and Sharp Berry-Esseen bound for rightmost eigenvalue of large non-Hermitian chiral random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a quantitative analysis of the rightmost eigenvalue for a chiral non-Hermitian random Dirac matrix in the maximally non-Hermitian regime ($\tau=0$). Let $(\sigma_i)_{1\le i\le n}$ be the eigenvalues with positive real part. We define the normalization constants \[ s_n = \frac{4n(n+v)}{2n+v}, \qquad \gamma_n = \frac{1}{2}\log s_n - \frac{5}{4}\log(\log s_n) - \log\bigl(2^{1/4}\pi\bigr), \] and the centered and scaled variable \[ X_n = \sqrt{2s_n\log s_n}\,\bigl(\bigl(\tfrac{n}{n+v}\bigr)^{1/4}\,\max_{1\le i\le n}\Re\sigma_i \;-\; 1 \;-\; \frac{\gamma_n}{\sqrt{2s_n\log s_n}}\bigr). \] Our main result is the following sharp Berry--Esseen bound for the convergence of $X_n$ to the Gumbel distribution: \[ \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} \bigl|\mathbb{P}(X_n \le x) - e^{-e^{-x}}\bigr| = \frac{25 (\log\log s_n)^2}{16 e \,\log s_n}\,\bigl(1 + o(1)\bigr), \] which holds as $n \to \infty$ for an arbitrary parameter $v \ge 0$ (which may depend on $n$). As a byproduct of our analysis, we also obtain precise large- and moderate-deviation principles for the scaled rightmost eigenvalue $\bigl(\frac{n}{n+v}\bigr)^{1/4} \max_{1\le i\le n}\Re\sigma_i$, characterizing its rate of convergence to the value $1$.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds with relative norm: Perturbation of eigenspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are used abundantly in many areas of mathematics and data science. Many bounds (such as the above two) involve the spectral norm of the noise matrix and are sharp in worst case analysis.
  In order to refine these classical bounds, we introduce a new parameter, which we refer to as the relative norm. This parameter measures the strength of the action of the noise matrix on the relevant eigenvectors of the ground matrix. It has turned out that in a number of situations, we can use the relative norm as a replacement for the spectral norm. This has led to a number of notable improvements under certain sets of assumptions, which are frequently met in practice. For instance, our new results apply very well in the case when the noise matrix is random.
  For the purpose of our study, we introduce a new method of analysis, which combines the classical contour integral argument with new (combinatorial) ideas. This method is robust and of independent interest.
  In the current paper, we focus on the perturbation of eigenspaces (Davis-Kahan type results). Perturbation bounds for eigenspaces are essential in statistics and theoretical computer science, and thus deserve a special treatment. Furthermore, this will lay the ground for the more technical treatment of general matrix functionals, which appears in a future paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a thermodynamic limit for the grand canonical Bose gas in dimension $d\geqslant1$ (in its Feynman-Kac representation) with superstable interaction at any inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ and any chemical potential $\mu\in\mathbb{R}$. Our infinite volume model is naturally a distribution over configurations of finite loops and possibly interlacements. We prove the limiting process to solve a new class of DLR equations involving random permutations and Brownian paths.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Propagation of Chaos for 2D Viscous Vortex Model with General Circulations on the Whole Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive quantitative propagation of chaos in the sense of relative entropy for the 2D viscous vortex model with general circulations, approximating the vorticity formulation of the 2D Navier-Stokes equation on the whole Euclidean space. Our results work on the general setting that the vortices are positioned on the whole space $\R^2$ and that the circulations are allowed to be in different magnitudes and orientations, which can be adapted to general unconfined realistic fluids with vorticity that may change sign. We provide explicit convergence rates which are optimal in $N$ and optimal in $t$ among existing literature. The key technical tools, which are our major novelty, are the sharp logarithmic growth estimates and a new ODE hierarchy and iterated integral estimates.</description>

      <title>Pontryagin Maximum Principle for rough stochastic systems and pathwise stochastic control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze a novel class of rough stochastic control problems that allows for a convenient approach to solving pathwise stochastic control problems with both non-anticipative and anticipative controls. We first establish the well-posedness of a class of controlled rough SDEs with affine rough driver and establish the continuity of the solution w.r.t.~the driving rough path. This allows us to define pathwise stochastic control problems with anticipative controls. Subsequently, we apply a flow transformation argument to establish a necessary and sufficient maximum principle to identify and characterize optimal strategies for rough and hence pathwise stochastic control problems. We show that the rough and the corresponding pathwise stochastic control problems share the same value function. For the benchmark case of linear-quadratic problems with bounded controls a similar result is shown for optimal controls.</description>
