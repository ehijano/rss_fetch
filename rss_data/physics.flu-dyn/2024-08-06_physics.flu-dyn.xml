      <title>Flow Reconstruction Using Spatially Restricted Domains Based on Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to reconstruct the complete flow field from spatially restricted domain data by utilizing an Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) model. The difficulty in flow field reconstruction lies in accurately capturing and reconstructing large amounts of data under nonlinear, multi-scale, and complex flow while ensuring physical consistency and high computational efficiency. The ESRGAN model has a strong information mapping capability, capturing fluctuating features from local flow fields of varying geometries and sizes. The model effectiveness in reconstructing the whole domain flow field is validated by comparing instantaneous velocity fields, flow statistical properties, and probability density distributions. Using laminar bluff body flow from Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) as a priori case, the model successfully reconstructs the complete flow field from three non-overlapping limited regions, with flow statistical properties perfectly matching the original data. Validation of the power spectrum density (PSD) for the reconstruction results also proves that the model could conform to the temporal behavior of the real complete flow field. Additionally, tests using DNS turbulent channel flow with a friction Reynolds number ($Re_\tau = 180$) demonstrate the model ability to reconstruct turbulent fields, though the quality of results depends on the number of flow features in the local regions. Finally, the model is applied to reconstruct turbulence flow fields from Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experimental measurements, using limited data from the near-wake region to reconstruct a larger field of view. The turbulence statistics closely match the experimental data, indicating that the model can serve as a reliable data-driven method to overcome PIV field-of-view limitations while saving computational costs.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning for Effective Denoising of Flow Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we proposed an efficient approach based on a deep learning (DL) denoising autoencoder (DAE) model for denoising noisy flow fields. The DAE operates on a self-learning principle and does not require clean data as training labels. Furthermore, investigations into the denoising mechanism of the DAE revealed that its bottleneck structure with a compact latent space enhances denoising efficacy. Meanwhile, we also developed a deep multiscale DAE for denoising turbulent flow fields. Furthermore, we used conventional noise filters to denoise the flow fields and performed a comparative analysis with the results from the DL method. The effectiveness of the proposed DL models was evaluated using direct numerical simulation data of laminar flow around a square cylinder and turbulent channel flow data at various Reynolds numbers. For every case, synthetic noise was augmented in the data. A separate experiment used particle-image velocimetry data of laminar flow around a square cylinder containing real noise to test DAE denoising performance. Instantaneous contours and flow statistical results were used to verify the alignment between the denoised data and ground truth. The findings confirmed that the proposed method could effectively denoise noisy flow data, including turbulent flow scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibited excellent generalization, efficiently denoising noise with various types and intensities.</description>

      <title>Breakup of viscous liquid bridges on solid surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The breakup dynamics of viscous liquid bridges on solid surfaces is studied experimentally. It is found that the dynamics bears similarities to the breakup of free liquid bridges in the viscous regime. Nevertheless, the dynamics is significantly influenced by the wettability of the solid substrate. Therefore, it is essential to take into account the interaction between the solid and the liquid, especially at the three-phase contact line. It is shown that when the breakup velocity is low and the solid surface is hydrophobic, the dominant channel of energy dissipation is likely due to thermally activated jumping of molecules, as described by the Molecular Kinetic Theory. Nevertheless, the viscous dissipation in the bulk due to axial flow along the bridge can be of importance for long bridges. In view of this, a scaling relation for the time dependence of the minimum width of the liquid bridge is derived. For high viscosities, the scaling relation captures the time evolution of the minimum width very well. Furthermore, it is found that external geometrical constraints alter the dynamic behavior of low and high viscosity liquid bridges in a different fashion. This discrepancy is explained by considering the dominant forces in each regime. Lastly, the morphology of the satellite droplets deposited on the surface is qualitatively compared to that of free liquid bridges.</description>

      <title>Effect of Uniform and Non-uniform wall heating on Three-Dimensional Magneto-Hydrodynamics Natural Convection and Entropy Generation: A computational study using New Higher Order Super Compact Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current research work deals with the effect of uniform and non-uniform wall heating on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) natural convection within a three-dimensional (3D) cavity filled with molten lithium. A new Higher-Order Super Compact (HOSC) finite difference scheme is used to analyze the thermal behavior under both heating scenarios. After the quantitative and qualitative validations, the computed results are analyzed for a range of Hartman number ($Ha = 25, 50, 100, 150$) and Rayleigh number ($Ra = 10^3, 10^4, 10^5$) with fixed $Pr=0.065$ (molten lithium). Three distinct heating scenarios, i.e., uniform heating ($T_h = 1$), $y$-dependent non-uniform heating ($T_h = sin(\pi y$)), and a combination of $y$ and $z$-dependent non-uniform heating ($T_h = sin(\pi y)sin(\pi z)$) are investigated on the left wall ($x=0$) of the cubic cavity. It is found that variations in the $Ha$ and $Ra$, along with distinct thermal boundary conditions, exert significant effects on both the temperature distribution and flow field inside the 3D cubical cavity. Specifically, an increase in $Ra$ corresponds to enhanced heat transfer, highlighting the dominance of convection. Conversely, an increase in $Ha$ leads to a reduction in heat transfer due to the deceleration of fluid velocity. The scenario in which walls are uniformly heated exhibits the most significant total entropy generation. It is observed that with an increase in the $Ra$, the Bejan number ($Be$) decreases, which ultimately leads to an increase in total entropy generation. The implementation of the new HOSC scheme in this analysis showcases its effectiveness in capturing the complexities of 3D MHD-driven natural convection and entropy generation. This study offers significant information that might help improve the optimization and design of relevant engineering systems. Thus, our work stands out as genuinely novel and pioneering in its approach.</description>

      <title>Exact planetary waves and jet streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate exact nonlinear waves on surfaces locally approximating the rotating sphere for two-dimensional inviscid incompressible flow. Our first system corresponds to a beta-plane approximation at the equator and the second to a gamma approximation, with the latter describing flow near the poles. We find exact wave solutions in the Lagrangian reference frame that cannot be written down in closed form in the Eulerian reference frame. The wave particle trajectories, contours of potential vorticity and Lagrangian mean velocity take relatively simple forms. The waves possess a non-trivial Lagrangian mean flow that depends on the amplitude of the waves and on a particle label that characterizes values of constant potential vorticity. The mean flow arises due to potential vorticity conservation on fluid particles. Solutions over the entire space are generated by assuming that the flow far from the origin is zonal and there is a region of constant potential vorticity between this zonal flow and the waves. In the gamma approximation a class of waves are found which, based on analogous solutions on the plane, we call Ptolemaic vortex waves. The mean flow of some of these waves resemble polar jet streams. Several illustrative solutions are used as initial conditions in the fully spherical rotating Navier-Stokes equations, where integration is performed via the numerical scheme presented in Salmon and Pizzo (2023). The potential vorticity contours found from these numerical experiments vary between stable permanent progressive form and fully turbulent flows generated by wave breaking.</description>

      <title>Examination of ventilated cavities in the wake of a two-dimensional bluff body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ventilated cavities in the wake of a two-dimensional bluff body are studied experimentally via time-resolved X-ray densitometry. With a systematic variation of flow velocity and gas injection rate, expressed as Froude number ($Fr$) and ventilation coefficient ($C_{qs}$), four stable cavities with different closures are identified. A regime map governed by $Fr$ and $C_{qs}$ is constructed to estimate flow conditions associated with each cavity closure type. Each closure exhibits a different gas ejection mechanism, which in turn dictates the cavity geometry and the pressure inside the cavity. Three-dimensional cavity closure is seen to exist for the supercavities at low $Fr$. However, closure is nominally two-dimensional for supercavities at higher $Fr$. At low $C_{qs}$, cavity closure is seen to be wake-dominated, while supercavities are seen to have wave-type closure at higher $C_{qs}$, irrespective of $Fr$. With the measured gas fraction, a simple gas balance analysis is performed to quantify the gas ejection rate at the transitional cavity closure during its formation. For a range of $Fr$, the transitional cavity closure is seen to be characterised by liquid re-entrant flow, whose intensity depends on the flow inertia, dictating the gas ejection rates. Two different ventilation strategies were employed to systematically investigate the formation and maintenance gas fluxes. The interaction of wake and gas injection is suspected to dominate the cavity formation process and not the maintenance, resulting in ventilation hysteresis. Consequently, the ventilation gas flux required to maintain the supercavity is significantly less than the gas flux required to form the supercavity.</description>

      <title>Non-invasive imaging assisted CFD simulation of 4D multi-modal fluid flow using In-situ adaptor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) is used to recover the true surfaces of fluid channels and fed to simulation tool (ANSYS) to create accurate cyber environment. The simulation tool also receives CT-assisted multiphase fluid profiles (belonging to the instance just before the flow starts) as an initial condition.
  This unique methodology is made possible by using a novel in-situ compact adaptor design is used to create fluid channels that can be placed inside any industrial X-ray CT and fulfill the above objective. It is integrated with an android based App to control the flow once placed inside CT. It is portable and compact enough: (a) to be placed inside various experimental environments, and (b) modular enough to be mounted with multi-modal systems simultaneously.
  Two key parameters, (a) spatial distribution and (b) the air volume fraction, are measured using two different non-invasive imaging modalities: (a) Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) and (d) X-ray Computed Tomography (CT). Simulated outcomes are correlated with the experimental outcomes from both EIT and X-ray CT, showing an agreement of 85 to 98 percent, respectively. Time-averaged electrically conductive fluid flow profile obtained by EIT shows a match with mass mass-attenuated fluid profile obtained by X-ray CT, justifying the utility of an in-situ adaptor. CT assistance for CFD studies can be replaced by EIT assistance as former techniques: (a) scanning time may be relatively slower than the latter, (b) it does not require rotations, (c) economical, and (d) fluid channels need not be placed inside of shielded compartment thus improving practicality. The data of analysis is shared in this work.
  Multimodal non-invasive imaging provides multiphase flow information, it also differentiates conductive, and mass-attenuated multiphase profiles at common cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Study of Turbulence and Pressure Recovery in the Heat Pipe Vapor Flow Using the Spectral-Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat pipes can efficiently and passively remove heat in nuclear microreactors. Nevertheless, the flow dynamics within heat pipes present a significant challenge in designing and optimizing them for nuclear energy applications. This work aims to explore the vapor core of heat pipes through comprehensive two- and three-dimensional simulations, with a primary focus on modeling the pressure recovery observed in the condenser section. The goal is to establish improved correlations for one-dimensional heat pipe codes. The simulations are validated against experimental data from a vapor pipe documented in the literature. The turbulence model is employed in the two-dimensional simulations through the open-source spectral-element code Nek5000. This model provides insights into pressure recovery within heat pipes with low computational cost. In addition, Large Eddy Simulations (LES) are used to capture turbulent flow features in a three-dimensional vapor pipe model, utilizing the code NekRS. Using LES is crucial for comprehending the impact of laminar-to-turbulent transition on pressure recovery. A simulation framework is created to model the heat pipe's vapor core, laying the foundation for an enhanced understanding of heat pipe behavior. The ultimate goal is to improve and optimize heat pipe designs, provide data to validate lower-fidelity approaches and enhance their performance in nuclear reactors.</description>

      <title>Reemergence of Trampolining in a Leidenfrost Droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The levitating Leidenfrost (LF) state of a droplet on a heated substrate is often accompanied by fascinating behaviors such as star-shaped deformations, self-propulsion, bouncing, and trampolining. These behaviors arise due to the vapor flow instabilities at the liquid-vapor interface beneath the droplet at sizes typically comparable to the capillary length scale of the liquid. Here, we report on the spontaneous bouncing, trampolining, and hovering behavior of an unconstrained LF water droplet. We observe that the water droplet exhibits an increase in bouncing height at specific radii with intermittent reduction in the height of bounce leading to a quiescent LF state. The reemergence of the trampolining behavior from the quiescent hovering state without any external forcing is observed at sizes as low as 0.1 times the capillary length. We attribute the droplet bouncing behavior to the dynamics of vapor flow beneath the LF droplet. We propose that the trampolining behavior of the droplet at specific radii is triggered by harmonic and subharmonic resonance between the natural frequency of the vapor layer and Rayleigh frequency of the droplet. This proposed mechanism of resonance-driven trampolining of LF droplets is observed to be applicable for different liquids irrespective of the initial volume and substrate temperatures, thus indicating a universality of the behavior. We attribute the intermittent trampolining events to the change in the natural frequency of the droplet and the vapor layer due to evaporative mass loss.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh-B\'enard convective motion of stratified fluids in the Earth's troposphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Kaladze and Misra [Phys. Scr. 99 (2024) 085013] showed that the tropospheric stratified fluid flows may be unstable by the effects of the negative temperature gradient and the temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity arising from the thermal expansion. They also predicted that the modification in the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency by the density inhomogeneity can lead to Rayleigh-B\'enard convective instability in the tropospheric unbounded layers. The purpose of the present work is to revisit the Rayleigh-B\'enard convective instability in more detail by considering both unbounded and bounded tropospheric layers. We show that the conditions for instability in these two cases significantly differ. The critical values of the Raleigh numbers and the expressions for the instability growth rates of thermal waves in the two cases are obtained and analyzed. In the case of the bounded region, we also derive the necessary boundary conditions and note that the vertical wave number is quantified, and the corresponding eigenvalue problem is well-set.</description>

      <title>Traversing a thin lubricant film in finite time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the dynamics of particles overcoming the hydrodynamic barrier posed by a thin fluid film to achieve contact in finite time, a phenomenon critical in various natural and engineered processes such as enzyme docking, catalysis, and vesicular transport. Using the framework of lubrication theory, which posits that drag force scales inversely with the film thickness, we explore how particles can achieve finite-time contact despite theoretical predictions of infinite time under constant force. We conduct experiments where a spherical particle settles under gravity and magnetic attraction, the latter introducing a spatially varying force. Our findings reveal that a spatially varying force significantly alters the settling trajectory, enabling finite-time contact. The results are supported by a simple model that links hydrodynamic drag and the impact of spatially varying forces. Finally, we illustrate that forces can be inferred from kinematic observations. In the future, this may provide insights into biological and microscale systems where direct force measurements are challenging. Our study demonstrates that varying forces can be harnessed to overcome lubrication barriers, offering potential applications in designing self-assembly systems and improving surface interaction processes.</description>

      <title>Learning rheological parameters of non-Newtonian fluids from velocimetry data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve a Bayesian inverse Navier-Stokes (N-S) problem that assimilates velocimetry data in order to jointly reconstruct the flow field and learn the unknown N-S parameters. By incorporating a Carreau shear-thinning viscosity model into the N-S problem, we devise an algorithm that learns the most likely Carreau parameters of a shear-thinning fluid, and estimates their uncertainties, from velocimetry data alone. We then conduct a flow-MRI experiment to obtain velocimetry data of an axisymmetric laminar jet through an idealised medical device (FDA nozzle) for a blood analogue fluid. We show that the algorithm can successfully reconstruct the flow field by learning the most likely Carreau parameters, and that the learned parameters are in very good agreement with rheometry measurements. The algorithm accepts any algebraic effective viscosity model, as long as the model is differentiable, and it can be extended to more complicated non-Newtonian fluids (e.g. Oldroyd-B fluid) if a viscoelastic model is incorporated into the N-S problem.</description>

      <title>Superradiant droplet emission from a single hydrodynamic cavity near a reflective boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in manipulating droplet emissions from a thin vibrating fluid using submerged cavities, have introduced an innovative platform for generating hydrodynamic analogs of quantum and optical systems. This platform unlocks unique features not found in traditional pilot-wave hydrodynamics, inviting further exploration across varied physical settings to fully unravel its potential and limitations as a quantum analog. In this study, we explore how the recently reported phenomenon of hydrodynamic superradiance is affected when a single hydrodynamic cavity is taken to interact with a submerged reflective barrier. Our experimental findings reveal that the presence of a barrier near a cavity enhances its droplet emission rate, emulating the effect of a second cavity positioned at twice the distance. Moreover, the system exhibits a sinusoidal modulation of the emission rate as a function of the distance between the cavity and its mirror image, echoing the characteristic superradiance signature observed in optical systems. These findings broaden our understanding of wave-particle duality in hydrodynamic quantum analogs and suggest new pathways for replicating quantum behaviors in macroscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Learning the Latent dynamics of Fluid flows from High-Fidelity Numerical Simulations using Parsimonious Diffusion Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use parsimonious diffusion maps (PDMs) to discover the latent dynamics of high-fidelity Navier-Stokes simulations with a focus on the 2D fluidic pinball problem. By varying the Reynolds number, different flow regimes emerge, ranging from steady symmetric flows to quasi-periodic asymmetric and turbulence. We show, that the proposed non-linear manifold learning scheme, identifies in a crisp manner the expected intrinsic dimension of the underlying emerging dynamics over the parameter space. In particular, PDMs, estimate that the emergent dynamics in the oscillatory regime can be captured by just two variables, while in the chaotic regime, the dominant modes are three as anticipated by the normal form theory. On the other hand, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)/PCA, most commonly used for dimensionality reduction in fluid mechanics, does not provide such a crisp separation between the dominant modes. To validate the performance of PDMs, we also computed the reconstruction error, by constructing a decoder using Geometric Harmonics. We show that the proposed scheme outperforms the POD/PCA over the whole Reynolds number range. Thus, we believe that the proposed scheme will allow for the development of more accurate reduced order models for high-fidelity fluid dynamics simulators, thus relaxing the curse of dimensionality in numerical analysis tasks such as bifurcation analysis, optimization and control.</description>

      <title>miniBLAST: a novel experimental setup for laboratory testing of structures under blast loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel experimental setup called miniBLAST, which enables systematic and repeatable laboratory tests of structures subjected to blast loads. The explosive source is based on the discharge of high electrical loads on a thin conductor, producing repeatable blast-type shock waves of controlled intensity. Conducting blast experiments under safe laboratory conditions offers significant advantages over large-scale experiments, which are expensive, require specialized personnel, are limited in number, and face repeatability issues.
  In this work, we provide a comprehensive description of the setup's design rationale and technical characteristics. Moreover, we place particular emphasis on the installation phases, safety, and metrology. The explosive source is analyzed and the signature of blast shock waves is retrieved. Finally, we present an example of a masonry wall subjected to blast loads of varying intensity. We then report its dynamic response in three dimensions and at different time instances.
  This new experimental setup offers a cost-effective, safe, and repeatable method to study structural dynamics under blast loads, with results that can be upscaled to real structures. It also aids in evaluating numerical models and lays the groundwork for further investigations into blast effects and mitigation.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity in partial differential equations and critical phenomena: renormalization group theory for interfacial hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01793v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-similar dynamics, often described by partial differential equations (PDEs) without noise terms, have been widely observed in nature and have attracted considerable attention from researchers in various fields, including physics, fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, and chemical engineering. The concept of universality class and the renormalization group (RG) theory, emerged from critical phenomena, which also have been widely observed in nature, are pillars of modern physics, with guiding the recent development of physics. While self-similarity appearing in fluid dynamics reminds physicists of critical phenomena, deep connections between them have not been explored. Here, we focus on a variation of a daily phenomenon, a drop falling from a faucet, and demonstrate self-similar dynamics for the shape of liquid-air interface in confined space with a scaling law for a characteristic length scale, which leads to a clear correspondence between the present self-similar dynamics and critical phenomena by identifying critical exponents, which define a universality class. We not only show that the observed master curve describing the self-similar shape is a solution to the Navier-Stokes equations, but also develop a renormalization group (RG) theory for the governing PDE to show the fixed point of RG corresponds to the solution, which becomes stable with time due to a scaling crossover. Our results will impact on our understanding of critical, scaling, and singular behaviors widely observed in nature.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised multi-scale diagnostics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unsupervised and principled diagnosis of multi-scale data is a fundamental obstacle in modern scientific problems from, for instance, weather and climate prediction, neurology, epidemiology, and turbulence. Multi-scale data is characterized by a combination of processes acting along multiple dimensions simultaneously, spatiotemporal scales across orders of magnitude, non-stationarity, and/or invariances such as translation and rotation. Existing methods are not well-suited to multi-scale data, usually requiring supervised strategies such as human intervention, extensive tuning, or selection of ideal time periods. We present the multi-resolution Coherent Spatio-Temporal Scale Separation (mrCOSTS), a hierarchical and automated algorithm for the diagnosis of coherent patterns or modes in multi-scale data. mrCOSTS is a variant of Dynamic Mode Decomposition which decomposes data into bands of spatial patterns with shared time dynamics, thereby providing a robust method for analyzing multi-scale data. It requires no training but instead takes advantage of the hierarchical nature of multi-scale systems. We demonstrate mrCOSTS using complex multi-scale data sets that are canonically difficult to analyze: 1) climate patterns of sea surface temperature, 2) electrophysiological observations of neural signals of the motor cortex, and 3) horizontal wind in the mountain boundary layer. With mrCOSTS, we trivially retrieve complex dynamics that were previously difficult to resolve while additionally extracting hitherto unknown patterns of activity embedded in the dynamics, allowing for advancing the understanding of these fields of study. This method is an important advancement for addressing the multi-scale data which characterize many of the grand challenges in science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Effective Viscosity of a Suspension of Hot Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active particles with a temperature distribution, "hot particles", have a distinct effect on the fluid that surrounds them. The temperature gradients they create deem the fluid's viscosity spatially dependent, therefore violating the linearity of the problem, making a full description of velocity and pressure fields challenging. Using energy dissipation analysis and Lorentz Reciprocal Theorem, we show that it is still possible to study global properties of such hot suspensions. Namely, we calculate the effective viscosity of a dilute hot suspension, adding a correction that includes contributions from the bulk fluid and the particles themselves. As examples of this method, we derive the effective viscosity of a suspension of spherical particles with different heat distributions. We show that when the particles are non-Brownian and are all oriented in the same direction, the viscosity is no longer isotropic and depends on the direction of the shear relative to the orientation of the particles. If the particles' orientation is fixed due to an external field, the stress tensor is no longer symmetric, and the viscosity has odd components.</description>

      <title>Unification theory of instabilities of visco-diffusive swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A universal theory of instabilities in swirling flows, occurring in both natural settings and industrial applications, is formulated. The theory encompasses a wide range of open and confined flows, including spiral isothermal flows and baroclinic flows driven by radial temperature gradients and natural gravity in rotating fluids. By employing short-wavelength local analysis, the theory generalizes previous findings from numerical simulations and linear stability analyses of specific swirling flows, such as spiral Couette flow, spiral Poiseuille flow, and baroclinic Couette flow. A general criterion, extending and unifying existing criteria for instability to both centrifugal and shear-driven perturbations in swirling flows is derived, taking into account viscosity and thermal diffusion and guiding experimental and numerical investigations in the otherwise inaccessible parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Fundamental MHD scales -- II: the kinematic phase of the supersonic small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many astrophysical small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify weak magnetic fields via highly compressible, supersonic turbulence, but established SSD theories have overlooked these compressible effects. To address this, we perform visco-resistive SSD simulations across a range of sonic Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}$), hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$), and magnetic Prandtl numbers ($\mathrm{Pm}$). We develop robust methods to measure kinetic and magnetic energy dissipation scales ($\ell_\nu$ and $\ell_\eta$) and the scale of strongest magnetic fields ($\ell_\mathrm{p}$) during the kinematic phase. We demonstrate that $\ell_\nu/\ell_\eta \sim \mathrm{Pm}^{1/2}$ is a universal feature for $\mathrm{Pm} \geq 1$ SSDs, regardless of $\mathcal{M}$ or $\mathrm{Re}$. Incompressible SSDs (either $\mathcal{M} \leq 1$ or $\mathrm{Re} &lt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit} \approx 100$) concentrate magnetic energy at $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim \ell_\eta$ with inversely correlated field strength and curvature. However, for compressible SSDs ($\mathcal{M} &gt; 1$ and $\mathrm{Re} &gt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit}$), shocks concentrate magnetic energy in large structures with $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim (\ell_\mathrm{turb} / \ell_\mathrm{shock})^{1/3} \ell_\eta \gg \ell_\eta$, where $\ell_\mathrm{shock}$ is the characteristic shock width, and $\ell_\mathrm{turb}$ is the outer scale of the turbulent field. In this regime, magnetic field-line curvature becomes nearly independent of field strength. These results have implications for galaxy mergers and cosmic ray transport models in the interstellar medium.</description>
