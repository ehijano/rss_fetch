      <title>Mean curvature flow through singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first give a general introduction to the mean curvature flow, and then discuss fundamental results established over the last 10 years that yield a precise theory for the flow through singularities in $\mathbb{R}^3$. With the aim of developing a satisfying theory in higher dimensions, we then describe our recent classification of all noncollapsed singularities in $\mathbb{R}^4$. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion of open problems and conjectures.</description>

      <title>Relative algebroids and symmetries of Pfaffian fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative algebroids and Pfaffian fibrations are two frameworks recently developed to study geometric structures and PDEs with symmetries, but have structurally different foundations. In this article, we clarify the relation between the two. We show that every Pfaffian fibration canonically induces a relative algebroid, and that their prolongations and local solutions coincide. Moreover, we introduce two notions of symmetries of Pfaffian fibrations, namely internal symmetries and Pfaffian symmetries, and develop the theory for actions of Pfaffian groupoids by internal/Pfaffian symmetries. We show that such actions preserve the underlying relative algebroid in an appropriate sense. Our results apply in particular to partial differential equations with Lie pseudogroup symmetries.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Loop Spaces V: Fundamental Groups of Geometric Transformation Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use differential forms on loop spaces to prove that the fundamental group of certain geometric transformation groups is infinite. Examples include both finite and infinite dimensional Lie groups. The finite dimensional examples are the conformal group of $S^{4k+1}$ for a family of nonstandard metrics, and the group of pseudo-Hermitian transformations of a compact CR manifold. Infinite dimensional examples include the group of strict contact diffeomorphisms of a regular contact manifold, and other groups coming from symplectic and contact geometry.</description>

      <title>Turbulent holomorphic foliations on compact complex tori and transversely holomorphic Cartan geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a class of nonsingular holomorphic foliations on compact complex tori which generalizes (in higher codimension) the turbulent foliations of codimension one constructed by Ghys. For those smooth turbulent foliations we prove that all transversely holomorphic Cartan geometries are flat. We also establish a uniqueness result for the transversely holomorphic Cartan geometries.</description>

      <title>Universal vector and matrix optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a gauge-theoretic approach to the problems of optimal mass transport for vector and matrix densities. This resolves both the issues of positivity and action transitivity constraints. Bures-type metrics on the corresponding semi-direct product groups of diffeomorphisms and gauge transformations are related to Wasserstein-type metrics on vector half-densities and matrix densities via Riemannian submersions. We also describe their relation to Poisson geometry and demonstrate how the momentum map allows one to prove the Riemannian submersion properties. The obtained geodesic equations turn out to be vector versions of the Burgers equations.</description>

      <title>Metric Convergence of Sequences of Static Spacetimes with the Null Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How should one define metric space notions of convergence for sequences of spacetimes? Since a Lorentzian manifold does not define a metric space directly, the uniform convergence, Gromov-Hausdorff (GH) convergence, and Sormani-Wenger Intrinsic Flat (SWIF) convergence does not extend automatically. One approach is to define a metric space structure, which is compatible with the Lorentzian structure, so that the usual notions of convergence apply. This approach was taken by C. Sormani and C. Vega when defining the null distance. In this paper, we study sequences of static spacetimes equipped with the null distance under uniform, GH, and SWIF convergence, as well as H\"{o}lder bounds. We use the results of the Volume Above Distance Below (VADB) theorem of the author, R. Perales, and C. Sormani to prove an analog of the VADB theorem for sequences of static spacetimes with the null distance. We also give a conjecture of what the VADB theorem should be in the case of sequences of globally hyperbolic spacetimes with the null distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every compactly supported calibrated integral current with connected $C^{3,\alpha}$ boundary is the unique solution to the oriented Plateau problem for its boundary data. This is proved as a consequence of the boundary regularity theory for area-minimizing currents and classical unique continuation principles adapted to the minimal surface system.</description>

      <title>On Rapid mixing for random walks on nilmanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove rapid mixing for almost all random walks generated by $m$ translations on an arbitrary nilmanifold under mild assumptions on the size of $m$. For several classical classes of nilmanifolds, we show $m=2$ suffices. This provides a partial answer to the question raised in \cite{D02} about the prevalence of rapid mixing for random walks on homogeneous spaces.</description>

      <title>Efficient manifold evolution algorithm using adaptive B-Spline interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores an efficient Lagrangian approach for evolving point cloud data on smooth manifolds. In this preliminary study, we focus on analyzing plane curves, and our ultimate goal is to provide an alternative to the conventional radial basis function (RBF) approach for manifolds in higher dimensions. In particular, we use the B-Spline as the basis function for all local interpolations. Just like RBF and other smooth basis functions, B-Splines enable the approximation of geometric features such as normal vectors and curvature. Once properly set up, the advantage of using B-Splines is that their coefficients carry geometric meanings. This allows the coefficients to be manipulated like points, facilitates rapid updates of the interpolant, and eliminates the need for frequent re-interpolation. Consequently, the removal and insertion of point cloud data become seamless processes, particularly advantageous in regions experiencing significant fluctuations in point density. The numerical results demonstrate the convergence of geometric quantities and the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we show simulations of curvature flows whose speeds depend on the solutions of coupled reaction--diffusion systems for pattern formation.</description>

      <title>Robust Tangent Space Estimation via Laplacian Eigenvector Gradient Orthogonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem in data analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis (LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in choosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior knowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often unavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector Gradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the data to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on local neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by orthogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a differential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows that gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align closely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high gradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum. Second, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency eigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that are significantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in marked improvements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection, and local intrinsic dimension estimation.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Computation of Geodesic Distances on Reductive Homogeneous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many geometric machine learning and image analysis applications, require a left-invariant metric on the 5D homogeneous space of 3D positions and orientations SE(3)/SO(2). This is done in Equivariant Neural Networks (G-CNNs), or in PDE-Based Group Convolutional Neural Networks (PDE-G-CNNs), where the Riemannian metric enters in multilayer perceptrons, message passing, and max-pooling over Riemannian balls.
  In PDE-G-CNNs it is proposed to take the minimum left-invariant Riemannian distance over the fiber in SE(3)/SO(2), whereas in G-CNNs and in many geometric image processing methods an efficient SO(2)-conjugation invariant section is advocated.
  The conjecture rises whether that computationally much more efficient section indeed always selects distance minimizers over the fibers. We show that this conjecture does NOT hold in general, and in the logarithmic norm approximation setting used in practice we analyze the small (and sometimes vanishing) differences. We first prove that the minimal distance section is reached by minimal horizontal geodesics with constant momentum and zero acceleration along the fibers, and we generalize this result to (reductive) homogeneous spaces with legal metrics and commutative structure groups.</description>

Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact smooth manifold with corners and $N$ be a finite dimensional smooth manifold without boundary which admits local addition. We define a smooth manifold structure to general sets of continuous mapings $\mathcal{F}(M,N)$ whenever functions spaces $\mathcal{F}(U,\mathbb{R})$ on open subsets $U\subseteq [0,\infty)^n$ are given, subject to simple axioms. Construction and properties of spaces of sections and smoothness of natural mappings between spaces $\mathcal{F}(M,N)$ are discussed, like superposition operators $\mathcal{F}(M,f):\mathcal{F}(M,N_1)\to \mathcal{F}(M,N_2)$, $\eta \mapsto f\circ \eta$ for smooth maps $f:N_1\to N_2$.</description>

Abstract: A pair of transverse contact distributions on a 3-manifold will in general admit no 1-parameter families of symmetries: a flow preserving both contact distributions. Here, we will determine local normal forms for such pairs admitting symmetries. In particular, we observe that orientable Anosov flows may be globally given by the intersection of a pair of oppositely oriented contact distributions admitting, around any point, maximal local symmetries.</description>

      <title>Canonical Frames for Bracket Generating Rank 2 Distributions which are not Goursat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We complete a uniform construction of canonical absolute parallelism for bracket generating rank $2$ distributions with $5$-dimensional cube on $n$-dimensional manifold with $n\geq 5$ by showing that the condition of maximality of class that was assumed previously by Doubrov-Zelenko for such a construction holds automatically at generic points. This also gives analogous constructions in the case when the cube is not $5$-dimensional but the distribution is not Goursat through the procedure of iterative Cartan deprolongation. This together with the classical theory of Goursat distributions covers in principle the local geometry of all bracket generating rank 2 distributions in a neighborhood of generic points. As a byproduct, for any $n\geq 5$ we describe the maximally symmetric germs among bracket generating rank $2$ distributions with $5$-dimensional cube, as well as among those which reduce to such a distribution under a fixed number of Cartan deprolongations. Another consequence of our results on maximality of class is for optimal control problems with constraint given by a rank $2$ distribution with $5$-dimensional cube: it implies that for a generic point $q_0$ of $M$, there are plenty abnormal extremal trajectories of corank $1$ (which is the minimal possible corank) starting at $q_0$. The set of such points contains all points where the distribution is equiregular.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces $(X,d,\mathfrak{m})$ with group actions by isometries preserving the reference measure $\mathfrak{m}$ and whose orbit space has dimension one, i.e. cohomogeneity one actions. To this end we prove a Slice Theorem asserting that when $X$ is non-collapsed the slices are homeomorphic to metric cones over homogeneous spaces with $\mathrm{Ric} \geq 0$. As a consequence we obtain complete topological structural results (also in the collapsed case) and a regular orbit representation theorem. Conversely, we show how to construct new $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces from a cohomogeneity one group diagram, giving a complete description of $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces of cohomogeneity one. As an application of these results we obtain the classification of cohomogeneity one, non-collapsed $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces of essential dimension at most $4$.</description>

      <title>Characterization of metric spaces with a metric fundamental class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider three conditions on metric manifolds with finite volume: (1) the existence of a metric fundamental class, (2) local index bounds for Lipschitz maps, and (3) Gromov--Hausdorff approximation with volume control by bi-Lipschitz manifolds. Condition (1) is known for metric manifolds satisfying the LLC condition by work of Basso--Marti--Wenger, while (3) is known for metric surfaces by work of Ntalampekos--Romney.
  We prove that for metric manifolds with finite Nagata dimension, all three conditions are equivalent and that without assuming finite Nagata dimension, (1) implies (2) and (3) implies (1). As a corollary we obtain a generalization of the approximation result of Ntalampekos--Romney to metric manifolds of dimension $n\ge 2$, which have the LLC property and finite Nagata dimension.</description>

Abstract: We present Riemannian Gaussian Variational Flow Matching (RG-VFM), a geometric extension of Variational Flow Matching (VFM) for generative modeling on manifolds. In Euclidean space, predicting endpoints (VFM), velocities (FM), or noise (diffusion) are largely equivalent due to affine interpolations. On curved manifolds this equivalence breaks down, and we hypothesize that endpoint prediction provides a stronger learning signal by directly minimizing geodesic distances. Building on this insight, we derive a variational flow matching objective based on Riemannian Gaussian distributions, applicable to manifolds with closed-form geodesics. We formally analyze its relationship to Riemannian Flow Matching (RFM), exposing that the RFM objective lacks a curvature-dependent penalty - encoded via Jacobi fields - that is naturally present in RG-VFM. Experiments on synthetic spherical and hyperbolic benchmarks, as well as real-world tasks in material and protein generation, demonstrate that RG-VFM more effectively captures manifold structure and improves downstream performance over Euclidean and velocity-based baselines.</description>

      <title>Mixed Christoffel-Minkowski problems for bodies of revolution</title>

Abstract: The mixed Christoffel-Minkowski problem asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for a Borel measure on the Euclidean unit sphere to be the mixed area measure of some convex bodies, one of which, appearing multiple times, is free and the rest are fixed. In the case where all bodies involved are symmetric around a common axis, we provide a complete solution to this problem, without assuming any regularity. In particular, we refine Firey's classification of area measures of figures of revolution.
  In our argument, we introduce an easy way to transform mixed area measures and mixed volumes involving axially symmetric bodies, and we significantly improve Firey's estimate on the local behavior of area measures. As a secondary result, we obtain a family of Hadwiger type theorems for convex valuations that are invariant under rotations around an axis.</description>
