      <title>Coherent Risk Measure on $L^0$: NA Condition, Pricing and Dual Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NA condition is one of the pillars supporting the classical theory of financial mathematics. We revisit this condition for financial market models where a dynamic risk-measure defined on $L^0$ is fixed to characterize the family of acceptable wealths that play the role of non negative financial positions. We provide in this setting a new version of the fundamental theorem of asset pricing and we deduce a dual characterization of the super-hedging prices (called risk-hedging prices) of a European option. Moreover, we show that the set of all risk-hedging prices is closed under NA. At last, we provide a dual representation of the risk-measure on $L^0$ under some conditions.</description>

      <title>Hedging American Put Options with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to hedge American put options, utilizing the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method. The agents are first trained and tested with Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) asset paths and demonstrate superior performance over traditional strategies like the Black-Scholes (BS) Delta, particularly in the presence of transaction costs. To assess the real-world applicability of DRL hedging, a second round of experiments uses a market calibrated stochastic volatility model to train DRL agents. Specifically, 80 put options across 8 symbols are collected, stochastic volatility model coefficients are calibrated for each symbol, and a DRL agent is trained for each of the 80 options by simulating paths of the respective calibrated model. Not only do DRL agents outperform the BS Delta method when testing is conducted using the same calibrated stochastic volatility model data from training, but DRL agents achieves better results when hedging the true asset path that occurred between the option sale date and the maturity. As such, not only does this study present the first DRL agents tailored for American put option hedging, but results on both simulated and empirical market testing data also suggest the optimality of DRL agents over the BS Delta method in real-world scenarios. Finally, note that this study employs a model-agnostic Chebyshev interpolation method to provide DRL agents with option prices at each time step when a stochastic volatility model is used, thereby providing a general framework for an easy extension to more complex underlying asset processes.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model in Financial Regulatory Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the innovative use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as analytical tools for interpreting complex financial regulations. The primary objective is to design effective prompts that guide LLMs in distilling verbose and intricate regulatory texts, such as the Basel III capital requirement regulations, into a concise mathematical framework that can be subsequently translated into actionable code. This novel approach aims to streamline the implementation of regulatory mandates within the financial reporting and risk management systems of global banking institutions. A case study was conducted to assess the performance of various LLMs, demonstrating that GPT-4 outperforms other models in processing and collecting necessary information, as well as executing mathematical calculations. The case study utilized numerical simulations with asset holdings -- including fixed income, equities, currency pairs, and commodities -- to demonstrate how LLMs can effectively implement the Basel III capital adequacy requirements.</description>

      <title>On Joint Marginal Expected Shortfall and Associated Contribution Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systemic risk is the risk that a company- or industry-level risk could trigger a huge collapse of another or even the whole institution. Various systemic risk measures have been proposed in the literature to quantify the domino and (relative) spillover effects induced by systemic risks such as the well-known CoVaR, CoES, MES and CoD risk measures, and associated contribution measures. This paper proposes another new type of systemic risk measure, called the joint marginal expected shortfall (JMES), to measure whether the MES of one entity's risk-taking adds to another one or the overall risk conditioned on the event that the entity is already in some specified distress level. We further introduce two useful systemic risk contribution measures based on the difference function or relative ratio function of the JMES and the conventional ES, respectively. Some basic properties of these proposed measures are studied such as monotonicity, comonotonic additivity, non-identifiability and non-elicitability. For both risk measures and two different vectors of bivariate risks, we establish sufficient conditions imposed on copula structure, stress levels, and stochastic orders to compare these new measures. We further provide some numerical examples to illustrate our main findings. A real application in analyzing the risk contagion among several stock market indices is implemented to show the performances of our proposed measures compared with other commonly used measures including CoVaR, CoES, MES, and their associated contribution measures.</description>

      <title>Trade execution games in a Markovian environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines a trade execution game for two large traders in a generalized price impact model. We incorporate a stochastic and sequentially dependent factor that exogenously affects the market price into financial markets. Our model accounts for how strategic and environmental uncertainties affect the large traders' execution strategies. We formulate an expected utility maximization problem for two large traders as a Markov game model. Applying the backward induction method of dynamic programming, we provide an explicit closed-form execution strategy at a Markov perfect equilibrium. Our theoretical results reveal that the execution strategy generally lies in a dynamic and non-randomized class; it becomes deterministic if the Markovian environment is also deterministic. In addition, our simulation-based numerical experiments suggest that the execution strategy captures various features observed in financial markets.</description>

      <title>Backtesting Expected Shortfall: Accounting for both duration and severity with bivariate orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an original two-part, duration-severity approach for backtesting Expected Shortfall (ES). While Probability Integral Transform (PIT) based ES backtests have gained popularity, they have yet to allow for separate testing of the frequency and severity of Value-at-Risk (VaR) violations. This is a crucial aspect, as ES measures the average loss in the event of such violations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a backtesting framework that relies on the sequence of inter-violation durations and the sequence of severities in case of violations. By leveraging the theory of (bivariate) orthogonal polynomials, we derive orthogonal moment conditions satisfied by these two sequences. Our approach includes a straightforward, model-free Wald test, which encompasses various unconditional and conditional coverage backtests for both VaR and ES. This test aids in identifying any mis-specified components of the internal model used by banks to forecast ES. Moreover, it can be extended to analyze other systemic risk measures such as Marginal Expected Shortfall. Simulation experiments indicate that our test exhibits good finite sample properties for realistic sample sizes. Through application to two stock indices, we demonstrate how our methodology provides insights into the reasons for rejections in testing ES validity.</description>

      <title>Efficient Nested Simulation Experiment Design via the Likelihood Ratio Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.13087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In nested simulation literature, a common assumption is that the experimenter can choose the number of outer scenarios to sample. This paper considers the case when the experimenter is given a fixed set of outer scenarios from an external entity. We propose a nested simulation experiment design that pools inner replications from one scenario to estimate another scenario's conditional mean via the likelihood ratio method. Given the outer scenarios, we decide how many inner replications to run at each outer scenario as well as how to pool the inner replications by solving a bi-level optimization problem that minimizes the total simulation effort. We provide asymptotic analyses on the convergence rates of the performance measure estimators computed from the optimized experiment design. Under some assumptions, the optimized design achieves $\cO(\Gamma^{-1})$ mean squared error of the estimators given simulation budget $\Gamma$. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our design outperforms a state-of-the-art design that pools replications via regression.</description>
