      <title>Universally Wheeler Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of Wheeler languages is rooted in the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT), one of the most central concepts in data compression and indexing. The BWT has been generalized to finite automata, the so-called Wheeler automata, by Gagie et al. [Theor. Comput. Sci. 2017]. Wheeler languages have subsequently been defined as the class of regular languages for which there exists a Wheeler automaton accepting them. Besides their advantages in data indexing, these Wheelerlanguages also satisfy many interesting properties from a language theoretic point of view [Alanko et al., Inf. Comput. 2021]. A characteristic yet unsatisfying feature of Wheeler languages however is that their definition depends on a fixed order of the alphabet. In this paper we introduce the Universally Wheeler languages UW, i.e., the regular languages that are Wheeler with respect to all orders of a given alphabet. Our first main contribution is to relate UW to some very well known regular language classes. We first show that the Striclty Locally Testable languages are strictly included in UW. After noticing that UW is not closed under taking the complement, we prove that the class of languages for which both the language and its complement are in UW exactly coincides with those languages that are Definite or Reverse Definite. Secondly, we prove that deciding if a regular language given by a DFA is in UW can be done in quadratic time. We also show that this is optimal unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) fails.</description>

      <title>High-Level Message Sequence Charts: Satisfiability and Realizability Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Message sequence charts (MSCs) visually represent interactions in distributed systems that communicate through FIFO channels. High-level MSCs (HMSCs) extend MSCs with choice, concatenation, and iteration, allowing for the specification of complex behaviors. This paper revisits two classical problems for HMSCs: satisfiability and realizability. Satisfiability (also known as reachability or nonemptiness) asks whether there exists a path in the HMSC that gives rise to a valid behavior. Realizability concerns translating HMSCs into communicating finite-state machines to ensure correct system implementations.
  While most positive results assume bounded channels, we introduce a class of HMSCs that allows for unbounded channels while maintaining effective implementations. On the other hand, we show that the corresponding satisfiability problem is still undecidable.</description>

      <title>Restivo Salemi property for $\alpha$-power free languages with $\alpha\geq 5$ and $k\geq 3$ letters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10061v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2009, Shur published the following conjecture: Let $L$ be a power-free language and let $e(L)\subseteq L$ be the set of words of $L$ that can be extended to a bi-infinite word respecting the given power-freeness. If $u, v \in e(L)$ then $uwv \in e(L)$ for some word $w$. Let $L_{k,\alpha}$ denote an $\alpha$-power free language over an alphabet with $k$ letters, where $\alpha$ is a positive rational number and $k$ is positive integer. We prove the conjecture for the languages $L_{k,\alpha}$, where $\alpha\geq 5$ and $k\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Reachability in 3-VASS is Elementary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reachability problem in 3-dimensional vector addition systems with states (3-VASS) is known to be PSpace-hard, and to belong to Tower. We significantly narrow down the complexity gap by proving the problem to be solvable in doubly-exponential space. The result follows from a new upper bound on the length of the shortest path: if there is a path between two configurations of a 3-VASS then there is also one of at most triply-exponential length. We show it by introducing a novel technique of approximating the reachability sets of 2-VASS by small semi-linear sets.</description>
