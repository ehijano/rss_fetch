      <title>Leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks for Addressing Data Imbalance in Financial Market Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the application of generative adversarial networks in financial market supervision, especially for solving the problem of data imbalance to improve the accuracy of risk prediction. Since financial market data are often imbalanced, especially high-risk events such as market manipulation and systemic risk occur less frequently, traditional models have difficulty effectively identifying these minority events. This study proposes to generate synthetic data with similar characteristics to these minority events through GAN to balance the dataset, thereby improving the prediction performance of the model in financial supervision. Experimental results show that compared with traditional oversampling and undersampling methods, the data generated by GAN has significant advantages in dealing with imbalance problems and improving the prediction accuracy of the model. This method has broad application potential in financial regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Federal Reserve.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Technical Indicators on Machine Learning Models for Stock Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of random forest regression models enhanced with technical indicators for high-frequency stock price prediction. Using minute-level SPY data, we assessed 13 models that incorporate technical indicators such as Bollinger bands, exponential moving average, and Fibonacci retracement. While these models improved risk-adjusted performance metrics, they struggled with out-of-sample generalization, highlighting significant overfitting challenges. Feature importance analysis revealed that primary price-based features consistently outperformed technical indicators, suggesting their limited utility in high-frequency trading contexts. These findings challenge the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis, identifying short-lived inefficiencies during volatile periods but its limited persistence across market regimes. The study emphasizes the need for selective feature engineering, adaptive modeling, and a stronger focus on risk-adjusted performance metrics to navigate the complexities of high-frequency trading environments.</description>

      <title>Correct implied volatility shapes and reliable pricing in the rough Heston model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use modifications of the Adams method and very fast and accurate sinh-acceleration method of the Fourier inversion (iFT) (S.Boyarchenko and Levendorski\u{i}, IJTAF 2019, v.22) to evaluate prices of vanilla options; for options of moderate and long maturities and strikes not very far from the spot, thousands of prices can be calculated in several msec. with relative errors of the order of 0.5\% and smaller running Matlab on a Mac with moderate characteristics. We demonstrate that for the calibrated set of parameters in Euch and Rosenbaum, Math. Finance 2019, v. 29, the correct implied volatility surface is significantly flatter and fits the data very poorly, hence, the calibration results in op.cit. is an example of the {\em ghost calibration} (M.Boyarchenko and Levendorki\u{i}, Quantitative Finance 2015, v. 15): the errors of the model and numerical method almost cancel one another. We explain how calibration errors of this sort are generated by each of popular versions of numerical realizations of iFT (Carr-Madan, Lipton-Lewis and COS methods) with prefixed parameters of a numerical method, resulting in spurious volatility smiles and skews. We suggest a general {\em Conformal Bootstrap principle} which allows one to avoid ghost calibration errors. We outline schemes of application of Conformal Bootstrap principle and the method of the paper to the design of accurate and fast calibration procedures.</description>
