      <title>Forbidden configurations and definite fillings of lens spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study definite fillings of lens spaces. We classify the lens spaces $L(p,q)$ for which every smooth negative-definite filling $X$ satisfies \[ b_2(X)\ge b_2(X(p,q))-1, \] where $X(p,q)$ denotes the canonical negative-definite plumbing. The classification is given by 17 "forbidden configurations" that cannot appear as induced subgraphs of the canonical plumbing graph. More generally, we introduce a combinatorial framework that encodes the lattice embedding information coming from the dual plumbing of $X(p,q)$, and we prove that it is governed by a finite set of minimal forbidden configurations. We also discuss consequences for symplectic fillings of lens spaces and for smoothings of cyclic quotient singularities.</description>

      <title>Knot surgery $4$-manifolds $E(n)_K$ without $1$- and $3$-handles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we demonstrate that for any positive integer $n$, the knot surgery $4$-manifold $E(n)_K$ has a handle decomposition without $1$- and $3$-handles. Here, $K$ represents either a fibered two-bridge knot $C(2\epsilon_1, 2\epsilon_2,\cdots, 2\epsilon_{2g})$ ($\epsilon_i \in \{ 1, -1\}$) in Conway's notation or a Stallings knot $K_m$ ($m \in \mathbb{Z}$).</description>

      <title>Entanglement complexity of spanning pairs of lattice polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement complexity of a system consisting of two simple-closed curves (self-avoiding polygons) that span a lattice tube, referred to as a 2SAP. 2SAPs are of interest as the first known model of confined ring polymers where the linking probability goes to 1 exponentially with the size of the system. Atapour et al proved this in 2010 by showing that all but exponentially few sufficiently large 2SAPs contain a pattern that guarantees the 2SAP is non-split, provided that the requisite pattern fits in the tube. This result was recently extended to all tubes sizes that admit non-trivial links. Here we develop and apply knot theory results to answer more general questions about the entanglement complexity of 2SAPs.
  We first extend the 1992 concept of a good measure of knot complexity to a good measure, $F$, of spanning-link complexity for $k$-component links. Using tangle products, we show, for example, that the more complex the prime knot decomposition of any component of a given link type, the greater its $F$-measure. We then prove that all but exponentially few size $m$ 2SAPs have $F$ complexity that grows at least linearly in $m$ as $m\to \infty$. We establish that good measures of knot complexity yield good measures of spanning-link complexity. We also establish conditions whereby more general link invariants can yield good measures. In particular, we establish that measures based on several classical invariants are good measures by our definition, eg bridge number or the number of $p$-colourings.
  Finally, we consider how the tube dimensions affect which links are embeddable as 2SAPs as well as geometric restrictions on the entanglement complexity of the embeddings. For example, we establish that there are two-component links that occur as 2SAPs in a given tube size only when one of the components is forced into a non-minimal bridge number conformation.</description>

      <title>A classification of regular maps with Euler characteristic $-p^4$ for a prime $p\geq 5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A map is a cellular decomposition of a closed surface. In the framework of classifying all regular maps by their supporting surface, it is an open problem to find all closed surfaces that support no regular maps. Classification of regular maps on surfaces with Euler characteristic $-p, -p^2, -p^3, -2p,$ and $-3p$ has already been done by several authors in a series of papers, which also show that surfaces with these Euler characteristic support no regular maps if the corresponding prime $p$ satisfies certain conditions. In this paper, assuming that $p\geq 5$ is a prime and $i\geq 4$, we show that the order of a Sylow $p$-subgroup of a regular map with Euler characteristic $-p^i$ is bounded by $p^{i-1}$ unless $p\in \{5, 7, 13\}$, and we show the existence of a normal $p$-subgroup for these regular maps whenever a Sylow $p$-subgroup has order at least $\sqrt{p^i}$, laying a solid foundation for using an inductive method to completely characterize regular maps of Euler characteristic $-p^i$. Based on this, we classify all regular maps with Euler characteristic $-p^4$ for a prime $p\geq 5$ in terms of reduced presentations of their automorphism groups. Consequently, a closed surface with Euler characteristic $-p^4$ supports no regular maps if and only if $p\notin \{2,3,5,7,13\}$.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic structures on link complements, octahedral decompositions, and quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperbolic structures on link complements (equivalently, representations of the fundamental group into $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$) can be described algebraically by using the octahedral decomposition determined by a link diagram. The decomposition (like any ideal triangulation) gives a set of gluing equations in shape parameters whose solutions are hyperbolic structures. We show that these equations can be obtained from Kashaev-Reshetikhin's braiding on the Kac-de Concini quantum group $\mathcal{U}_\xi(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at a root of unity $\xi$. This braiding gives coordinates on the $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ representation variety of a link and our work shows how to interpret these geometrically.</description>

      <title>Seifert surfaces in the four-ball and composition of binary quadratic forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17746v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use composition of binary quadratic forms to systematically create pairs of Seifert surfaces that are non-isotopic in the four-ball. Our main topological result employs Gauss composition to classify the pairs of binary quadratic forms that arise as the Seifert forms of pairs of disjoint Seifert surfaces of genus one. The main ingredient of the proof is number-theoretic and of independent interest. It establishes a new connection between the Bhargava cube and the geometric approach to Gauss composition via planes in the space of two-by-two matrices. In particular, we obtain a geometric recipe that given any two binary quadratic forms finds a Bhargava cube that gives rise to their composition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is an introduction to Coxeter polyhedra in spherical, Euclidean, and hyperbolic geometries. It consists of essentially two parts that could be read independently. In the first we introduce non-obtuse polyhedra in the spherical, Euclidean, and hyperbolic spaces, and prove various fundamental theorems originated from Andreev, Coxeter, and Vinberg. In the second we introduce Coxeter polyhedra and use them to describe regular, semiregular, and uniform polyhedra and tessellations, mostly via the Wythoff construction.</description>

      <title>Algebraic K-theory of Geometric Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3349</link>
      <description>arXiv:1305.3349v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a homotopy theoretic technique for proving that the $K$-theoretic assembly map is an equivalence. It is an extension of the methods used to prove split injectivity of the assembly and applies to any geometrically finite group. Our result is that there are two requirements which need to hold. The first is that the assembly map for the group regarded as a metric space is an equivalence. This is a non-equivariant condition and depends only on the coarse type of the word metric on the group. The second is that the group ring satisfies an algebraic coherence condition, which currently can be verified for all known groups for which the split injectivity statement for the assembly holds. The two conditions extend very broadly. In particular, both conditions hold for groups of finite asymptotic dimension.
  To state the main theorem precisely, given a regular Noetherian ring $A$ of finite global dimension and a group $\Gamma$ with finite $K(\Gamma,1)$ and finite asymptotic dimension, we prove that the $K$-theoretic assembly map is an equivalence. Therefore, in all dimensions the $K$-theory of $A[\Gamma]$ is the group homology of $\Gamma$ with coefficients in the $K$-theory spectrum of $A$. One of the many geometric consequences of this theorem is vanishing of the Whitehead group of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Structure for Many Hierarchically Hyperbolic Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combinatorial hierarchical hyperbolicity criterion is a very useful way of constructing new hierarchically hyperbolic spaces (HHSs). We show that, conversely, HHSs satisfying natural assumptions (satisfied, for example, by mapping class groups) admit a combinatorial HHS structure. This can be useful in constructions of new HHSs, and also our construction clarifies how to apply the combinatorial HHS criterion to suspected examples. We also uncover connections between HHS notions and lattice theory notions.</description>

      <title>The canonical lamination calibrated by a cohomology class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed oriented Riemannian manifold of dimension $2 \leq d \leq 7$, and let $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$ have unit norm. We construct a lamination $\lambda_\rho$ whose leaves are exactly the minimal hypersurfaces which are calibrated by every calibration in $\rho$. The geometry of $\lambda_\rho$ is closely related to the the geometry of the unit ball of the stable norm on $H_{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$, and so we deduce several results constraining the geometry of the stable norm ball in terms of the topology of $M$. These results establish a close analogy between the stable norm on $H_{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$ and the earthquake norm on the tangent space to Teichm\"uller space.</description>

      <title>Topological consequences of null-geodesic refocusing and applications to $Z^x$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23565v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold, let $x\in M$ and $l&gt;0$. Then $M$ is called a $Z^x$ manifold if all geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ and it is called a $Y^x_l$ manifold if every unit-speed geodesic starting at $x$ returns to $x$ at time $l$. It is unknown whether there are $Z^x$ manifolds that are not $Y^x_l$ manifolds for any $l&gt;0$. By the B\'erard-Bergery theorem, any $Y^x_l$ manifold of dimension at least $2$ is compact with finite fundamental group. We prove the same result for $Z^x$ manifolds $M$ for which all unit-speed geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ in uniformly bounded time. We also prove that any $Z^x$ manifold $(M,h)$ with $h$ analytic is a $Y^x_l$ manifold for some $l&gt;0$. We start by defining a class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes (called observer-refocusing) such that any $Z^x$ manifold is the Cauchy surface of some observer-refocusing spacetime. We then prove that under suitable conditions the Cauchy surfaces of observer-refocusing spacetimes are compact with finite fundamental group and show that analytic observer-refocusing spacetimes of dimension at least $3$ are strongly refocusing. We end by stating a contact-theoretic conjecture analogous to our results in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry.</description>
