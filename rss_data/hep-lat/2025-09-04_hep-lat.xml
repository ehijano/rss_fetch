      <title>Recent progress on charmed hadron interactions from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed rapid progress in charmed hadron physics, driven by numerous experimental discoveries of exotic states such as $T^+_{cc}$ and $P_c$. These findings have highlighted the importance of understanding charmed hadron interactions. With significant advances in theory and computation, lattice QCD has become a reliable tool for studying nonperturbative dynamics of low-energy QCD. In this talk, I review recent lattice QCD studies of charmed hadron interactions, focusing on three representative systems: $D^*$-$D$, $N$-$c\bar c$, and $\Omega_{ccc}$-$\Omega_{ccc}$.</description>

      <title>From deconfinement to nuclear matter: mean-field approaches for effective Polyakov loop theories of lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical studies of the QCD phase diagram at finite baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ on the lattice are impeded by a sign problem. Effective Polyakov loop theories derived from lattice QCD via combined strong-coupling and hopping expansions are valid for heavy quarks only, but tractable with a significantly less severe sign problem. In this work, we apply three mean-field approximations to these effective theories, each incorporating local fluctuations to different degrees. We compare their predictions against Monte Carlo results for the deconfinement transition at high temperatures and for the baryon onset transition at low temperatures. In agreement with earlier effective theory simulations, we find a first-order nuclear liquid-gas transition with a critical end point for very low temperatures and moderately heavy quarks. While the location of fluctuation-dominated critical end points is expectedly inaccurate, the phase diagram of lattice QCD with heavy quarks can be determined qualitatively with entirely analytical methods.</description>

      <title>Gluon Condensate via Dirac Spectral Density: IR Phase, Scale Anomaly and IR Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quark and gluon scalar densities, $\langle \bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ and $\langle F^2 \rangle$, reflect the degree of scale-invariance violations in SU(N) gauge theories with fundamental quarks. It is known that $\langle \bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ can be usefully scale-decomposed via spectral density $\rho(\lambda)$ of Dirac modes. Here I give such formula for $\langle F^2 \rangle$, which reveals that gluon condensate is a strictly UV quantity. For the recently-found IR phase [1,2], where the infrared (IR) degrees of freedom separate out and become independent of the system's bulk, it implies that $\langle F^2 \rangle$ due to this IR part vanishes. Its glue thus doesn't contribute to scale anomaly of the entire system and is, in this sense, scale invariant consistently with the original claim. Associated formulas are used us to define IR decoupling of glue, which may serve as an alternative indicator of IR phase transition. Using the simplest form of coherent lattice QCD, we express the effective action of full QCD entirely via Dirac spectral density.</description>

      <title>Scattering and induced false vacuum decay in the two-dimensional quantum Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study scattering in the quantum Ising model in two dimensions. In the ordered phase, the spectrum contains a ladder of bound states and intertwined scattering resonances, which enable various scattering channels. By preparing wave packets on a $24 \times 24$ lattice and evolving the state with tensor networks, we explore and characterize these regimes, ranging from elastic scattering in the perturbative regime, to non-perturbative processes closer to the critical point. Then, we break the spin inversion symmetry and study the stability of the metastable false vacuum state on the collision of its excitations. We find that a highly-energetic scattering process can induce a violent decay of the false vacuum, and investigate the spread of the resulting true vacuum bubble.</description>

      <title>Geometric analysis of Ising models, Part III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The random current representation of the Ising model, along with a related path expansion, has been a source of insight on the stochastic geometric underpinning of the ferromagnetic model's phase structure and critical behavior in different dimensions. This representation is extended in this work to systems with a mild amount of frustration, such as generated by disorder operators and external field of mixed signs. Further examples of the utility of stochastic geometric representations are presented here in the context of the deconfinement transition of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge model -- particularly in three dimensions -- and in streamlined proofs of correlation inequalities with wide-ranging applications.</description>

      <title>Observation of renormalization group invariance in symmetry-restored nuclear lattice effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group (RG) invariance implies that the predictions of effective field theory are independent of the momentum cutoffs introduced during regularization. Here we report the first systematic verification of RG invariance for realistic nuclear few-body systems within nuclear lattice effective field theory. To restore broken continuum rotational and Galilean symmetries, we employ Galilean-invariance-restoration counterterms and use a soft momentum regulator. We calibrate the two- and three-body next-to-next-to leading order (N$^2$LO) chiral forces using $A\leq 3$ observables and perform precision quantum Monte Carlo calculations to compute the $^4$He binding energy. The predicted energy remains constant across cutoffs from $250$~MeV to $400$~MeV and agrees well with the experimental value, with discrepancies of order 100 keV. Our results demonstrate the capability of extracting accurate, cutoff-independent predictions within lattice-regulated \textit{ab initio} nuclear theory.</description>

      <title>On Charge Conjugation, Correlations, Elitzur's Theorem and the Mass Gap Problem in Lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills Models in $d=4$ Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a four-dimensional Euclidean Wilson lattice Yang-Mills model with gauge group $SU(N)$, and the associated lattice Euclidean quantum field theory constructed by Osterwalder-Schrader-Seiler via a Feynman-Kac formula. In this model, to each lattice bond $b$ there is assigned a bond variable $U_b\in SU(N)$. Gluon fields are parameters in the Lie algebra of $SU(N)$. We define a charge conjugation operator $\mathcal C$ in the physical Hilbert space $H$ and prove that, for $N\not=2$, $H$ admits an orthogonal decomposition into two sectors with charge conjugation $\pm1$. There is only one sector for $N=2$. In the space of correlations, a charge conjugation operator $C_E$ is defined and a similar decomposition holds. Besides, a version of Elitzur's theorem is shown; applications are given. It is proven that the expectation averages of two distinct lattice vector potential correlators is zero. Surprisingly, the expectation of two distinct field strength tensors is also zero. In the gluon field parametrization it is known that Wilson action is bounded quadratically in the gluon fields. Towards solving the mass gap problem, in the gluon field expansion of the action, we show there are no local terms, such as a mass term. However, the action associated with the exponent of the exponentiated Haar measure density has a positive local mass term which is proportional to the square of the gauge coupling $\beta=g^{-2}&gt;0$ and the $SU(N)$ quadratic Casimir operator eigenvalue. Our results also hold in dimension three. Of course, the orthogonal decomposition of the Hilbert space $H$ has consequences in the analysis of the truncated two-point plaquette field correlation and the Yang-Mills mass gap problem: for $N\not=2$ and at least for small $\beta$, a multiplicity-two one-particle glueball state (two mass gaps) is expected to be present in the energy-momentum spectrum of the Yang-Mills model.</description>

      <title>The $\pi\pi$ scattering amplitude at large $N_\text{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the scaling of meson-meson scattering amplitudes with the number of colors, $N_\text{c}$. We use lattice calculations in a theory with $N_\text{f}=4$ degenerate flavors, with $N_\text{c}=3-6$ and pion mass $M_\pi\approx 560$ MeV. We focus on three different scattering channels, two of which have the same quantum numbers as some tetraquark candidates recently found at LHCb: the $T_{cs0}^0(2900)$, $T_{c\bar{s}0}^{++}(2900)$, $T_{c\bar{s}0}^0(2900)$ and $T_{c\bar{s}1}^0(2900)$ states. Finite-volume energies are extracted using a large set of operators, containing two-particle operators with the form of two pions or two vector mesons, and local tetraquark operators. The resulting energy spectra is used to constrain the infinite-volume scattering amplitude by means of L\"uscher's quantization condition. We consider polynomial parametrizations of the phase shift, as well as one-loop chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) predictions. We find that our lattice results follow the expected $N_\text{c}$ scaling and are sensitive to subleading $N_\text{c}$ corrections. In addition, we constrain the scaling of different combinations of low-energy constants from matching to large $N_\text{c}$ ChPT. The results for the channel corresponding to a $(\pi^+ D^+_s - K^+ D^+)$ state show evidence of a virtual bound state with energy $E_\text{virtual}=1.63(10)M_\pi$ for $N_\text{c}=3$, while this pole disappears at $N_\text{c}&gt;3$. This may be connected to the exotic states found in experiment.</description>

      <title>A new approach to quark mass determination using the gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method to determine quark masses using ratios of the vacuum-expectation values (VEVs) of flowed quark bilinear operators. They can be expressed as functions of the flow time $t$ and the ${\overline {\rm MS}}$ quark mass $\overline{m}$, which can then be determined by matching with the corresponding lattice results. Motivated by this, we evaluate these VEVs perturbatively through next-to-leading order in the strong coupling. We provide the results as expansions in the limits of small and large $\overline{m}^2 t$. To this end, we develop a new expansion technique based on the Laplace transform. Additionally, we present numerical results with the exact mass dependence over a wide range of $\overline{m}^2t$. We discuss the expected perturbative precision for the mass determination based on our next-to-leading order perturbative calculations, and possible non-perturbative corrections.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Study of Positive Parity Dibaryons with Maximal Charm and Strangeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the ground-state energy spectra of dibaryons composed of single-flavor quarks, specifically systems with strangeness $\mathcal{S} = -6$ and charm $\mathcal{C} = 6$. Our lattice QCD study is based on $N_f=2+1+1$ MILC ensembles with highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) sea quarks, spanning four lattice spacings and two spatial volumes. We employ valence quark propagators realized using a relativistic overlap action, evaluate correlation matrices with carefully designed operator bases, and extract reliable ground-state energy estimates in the $S = 0$ and $S = 2$ spin channels. We explore their binding characteristics and interaction dynamics by examining the energy separation between the dibaryon states and the corresponding two-baryon thresholds. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of single-flavor dibaryon states as a function of the quark masses. In the $S=0$ channel, the $\Omega_{ccc}$-$\Omega_{ccc}$ system exhibits a clear signal of a bound state, while the $\Omega$-$\Omega$ system lies very close to the threshold, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. For $S=2$, both systems are found to be unbound.</description>

      <title>RI-(S)MOM to $\overline{\rm MS}$ conversion for $B_K$ at two-loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kaon bag parameter $ {\hat{B}}_K $ plays a critical role in constraining the parameters of the CKM matrix and in probing physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we improve the precision of $ \hat{B}_K $ to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) and provide world averages for both $3$- and $4$-flavour theories. In the course of this, as our main technical development, we carry out the two-loop matching between the RI-(S)MOM and $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ schemes. Our world averages combine all available lattice data, including conversion between the 3- and 4-flavour theories as appropriate. We obtain the result $\hat B_{K}^{(f=3)} = 0.7627(60)$, which comprises the complete set of $3$- and $4$-flavour lattice results and can be used directly in phenomenological applications. The error is dominated by lattice uncertainties and missing higher-order corrections (residual scale dependence). Our averages include a PDG rescaling factor of 1.28 reflecting a mild tension among the lattice inputs after inclusion of NNLO corrections in the scheme conversion and matching across flavour thresholds. Our averages imply an updated value $|\epsilon_K|=2.171(65)_\text{pert.}(71)_\text{non-pert.}(153)_\text{param.} \times 10^{-3}$. We briefly discuss applications of our results to $D$-meson mixing.</description>
