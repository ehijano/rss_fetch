      <title>A Type System to Ensure Non-Interference in ReScript</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting confidential data from leaking is a critical challenge in computer systems, particularly given the growing number of observers on the internet. Therefore, limiting information flow using robust security policies becomes increasingly vital. We focus on the non-interference policy, where the goal is to ensure that confidential data can not impact public data. This paper presents a type system, for a subset of the ReScript syntax, designed to enforce non-interference. We conclude with a proof of soundness for the type system, demonstrating that if an expression is type-able, it is inherently non-interferent. In addition, we provide a brief overview of a type checker that implements the previously mentioned type system.</description>

      <title>DMTG: A Human-Like Mouse Trajectory Generation Bot Based on Entropy-Controlled Diffusion Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CAPTCHAs protect against resource misuse and data theft by distinguishing human activity from automated bots. Advances in machine learning have made traditional image and text-based CAPTCHAs vulnerable to attacks, leading modern CAPTCHAs, such as GeeTest and Akamai, to incorporate behavioral analysis like mouse trajectory detection. Existing bypass techniques struggle to fully mimic human behavior, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-bot measures. To address this, we propose a diffusion model-based mouse trajectory generation framework (DMTG), which controls trajectory complexity and produces realistic human-like mouse movements. DMTG also provides white-box and black-box testing methods to assess its ability to bypass CAPTCHA systems. In experiments, DMTG reduces bot detection accuracy by 4.75%-9.73% compared to other models. Additionally, it mimics physical human behaviors, such as slow initiation and directional force differences, demonstrating improved performance in both simulation and real-world CAPTCHA scenarios.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Enterprise Security with Zero Trust Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) represents a transformative approach to modern cybersecurity, directly addressing the shortcomings of traditional perimeter-based security models. With the rise of cloud computing, remote work, and increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, perimeter defenses have proven ineffective at mitigating risks, particularly those involving insider threats and lateral movement within networks. ZTA shifts the security paradigm by assuming that no user, device, or system can be trusted by default, requiring continuous verification and the enforcement of least privilege access for all entities. This paper explores the key components of ZTA, such as identity and access management (IAM), micro-segmentation, continuous monitoring, and behavioral analytics, and evaluates their effectiveness in reducing vulnerabilities across diverse sectors, including finance, healthcare, and technology. Through case studies and industry reports, the advantages of ZTA in mitigating insider threats and minimizing attack surfaces are discussed. Additionally, the paper addresses the challenges faced during ZTA implementation, such as scalability, integration complexity, and costs, while providing best practices for overcoming these obstacles. Lastly, future research directions focusing on emerging technologies like AI, machine learning, blockchain, and their integration into ZTA are examined to enhance its capabilities further.</description>

      <title>Countering Autonomous Cyber Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the capability to write convincing and fluent natural language and generate code, Foundation Models present dual-use concerns broadly and within the cyber domain specifically. Generative AI has already begun to impact cyberspace through a broad illicit marketplace for assisting malware development and social engineering attacks through hundreds of malicious-AI-as-a-services tools. More alarming is that recent research has shown the potential for these advanced models to inform or independently execute offensive cyberspace operations. However, these previous investigations primarily focused on the threats posed by proprietary models due to the until recent lack of strong open-weight model and additionally leave the impacts of network defenses or potential countermeasures unexplored. Critically, understanding the aptitude of downloadable models to function as offensive cyber agents is vital given that they are far more difficult to govern and prevent their misuse. As such, this work evaluates several state-of-the-art FMs on their ability to compromise machines in an isolated network and investigates defensive mechanisms to defeat such AI-powered attacks. Using target machines from a commercial provider, the most recently released downloadable models are found to be on par with a leading proprietary model at conducting simple cyber attacks with common hacking tools against known vulnerabilities. To mitigate such LLM-powered threats, defensive prompt injection (DPI) payloads for disrupting the malicious cyber agent's workflow are demonstrated to be effective. From these results, the implications for AI safety and governance with respect to cybersecurity is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Assisted Privacy Preserving in Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SC) offers promising advancements in data transmission efficiency and reliability by focusing on delivering true meaning rather than solely binary bits of messages. However, privacy concerns in SC might become outstanding. Eavesdroppers equipped with advanced semantic coding models and extensive knowledge could be capable of correctly decoding and reasoning sensitive semantics from just a few stolen bits. To this end, this article explores utilizing knowledge to enhance data privacy in SC networks. Specifically, we first identify the potential attacks in SC based on the analysis of knowledge. Then, we propose a knowledge-assisted privacy preserving SC framework, which consists of a data transmission layer for precisely encoding and decoding source messages, and a knowledge management layer responsible for injecting appropriate knowledge into the transmission pair. Moreover, we elaborate on the transceiver design in the proposed SC framework to explain how knowledge should be utilized properly. Finally, some challenges of the proposed SC framework are discussed to expedite the practical implementation.</description>

      <title>FirmRCA: Towards Post-Fuzzing Analysis on ARM Embedded Firmware with Efficient Event-based Fault Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While fuzzing has demonstrated its effectiveness in exposing vulnerabilities within embedded firmware, the discovery of crashing test cases is only the first step in improving the security of these critical systems. The subsequent fault localization process, which aims to precisely identify the root causes of observed crashes, is a crucial yet time-consuming post-fuzzing work. Unfortunately, the automated root cause analysis on embedded firmware crashes remains an underexplored area, which is challenging from several perspectives: (1) the fuzzing campaign towards the embedded firmware lacks adequate debugging mechanisms, making it hard to automatically extract essential runtime information for analysis; (2) the inherent raw binary nature of embedded firmware often leads to over-tainted and noisy suspicious instructions, which provides limited guidance for analysts in manually investigating the root cause and remediating the underlying vulnerability. To address these challenges, we design and implement FirmRCA, a practical fault localization framework tailored specifically for embedded firmware. FirmRCA introduces an event-based footprint collection approach to aid and significantly expedite reverse execution. Next, to solve the complicated memory alias problem, FirmRCA proposes a history-driven method by tracking data propagation through the execution trace, enabling precise identification of deep crash origins. Finally, FirmRCA proposes a novel strategy to highlight key instructions related to the root cause, providing practical guidance in the final investigation. We evaluate FirmRCA with both synthetic and real-world targets, including 41 crashing test cases across 17 firmware images. The results show that FirmRCA can effectively (92.7% success rate) identify the root cause of crashing test cases within the top 10 instructions.</description>

      <title>PSY: Posterior Sampling Based Privacy Enhancer in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy vulnerabilities in LLMs, such as leakage from memorization, have been constantly identified, and various mitigation proposals have been proposed. LoRA is usually used in fine-tuning LLMs and a good entry point to insert privacy-enhancing modules. In this ongoing research, we introduce PSY, a Posterior Sampling based PrivacY enhancer that can be used in LoRA. We propose a simple yet effective realization of PSY using posterior sampling, which effectively prevents privacy leakage from intermediate information and, in turn, preserves the privacy of data owners. We evaluate LoRA extended with PSY against state-of-the-art membership inference and data extraction attacks. The experiments are executed on three different LLM architectures fine-tuned on three datasets with LoRA. In contrast to the commonly used differential privacy method, we find that our proposed modification consistently reduces the attack success rate. Meanwhile, our method has almost no negative impact on model fine-tuning or final performance. Most importantly, PSY reveals a promising path toward privacy enhancement with latent space extensions.</description>

      <title>Provably Robust Watermarks for Open-Source Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent explosion of high-quality language models has necessitated new methods for identifying AI-generated text. Watermarking is a leading solution and could prove to be an essential tool in the age of generative AI. Existing approaches embed watermarks at inference and crucially rely on the large language model (LLM) specification and parameters being secret, which makes them inapplicable to the open-source setting. In this work, we introduce the first watermarking scheme for open-source LLMs. Our scheme works by modifying the parameters of the model, but the watermark can be detected from just the outputs of the model. Perhaps surprisingly, we prove that our watermarks are unremovable under certain assumptions about the adversary's knowledge. To demonstrate the behavior of our construction under concrete parameter instantiations, we present experimental results with OPT-6.7B and OPT-1.3B. We demonstrate robustness to both token substitution and perturbation of the model parameters. We find that the stronger of these attacks, the model-perturbation attack, requires deteriorating the quality score to 0 out of 100 in order to bring the detection rate down to 50%.</description>

      <title>SafeBench: A Safety Evaluation Framework for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are showing strong safety concerns (e.g., generating harmful outputs for users), which motivates the development of safety evaluation benchmarks. However, we observe that existing safety benchmarks for MLLMs show limitations in query quality and evaluation reliability limiting the detection of model safety implications as MLLMs continue to evolve. In this paper, we propose \toolns, a comprehensive framework designed for conducting safety evaluations of MLLMs. Our framework consists of a comprehensive harmful query dataset and an automated evaluation protocol that aims to address the above limitations, respectively. We first design an automatic safety dataset generation pipeline, where we employ a set of LLM judges to recognize and categorize the risk scenarios that are most harmful and diverse for MLLMs; based on the taxonomy, we further ask these judges to generate high-quality harmful queries accordingly resulting in 23 risk scenarios with 2,300 multi-modal harmful query pairs. During safety evaluation, we draw inspiration from the jury system in judicial proceedings and pioneer the jury deliberation evaluation protocol that adopts collaborative LLMs to evaluate whether target models exhibit specific harmful behaviors, providing a reliable and unbiased assessment of content security risks. In addition, our benchmark can also be extended to the audio modality showing high scalability and potential. Based on our framework, we conducted large-scale experiments on 15 widely-used open-source MLLMs and 6 commercial MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini), where we revealed widespread safety issues in existing MLLMs and instantiated several insights on MLLM safety performance such as image quality and parameter size.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding the Fragility of Multilingual LLMs against Fine-Tuning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked widespread concerns about their safety. Recent work demonstrates that safety alignment of LLMs can be easily removed by fine-tuning with a few adversarially chosen instruction-following examples, i.e., fine-tuning attacks. We take a further step to understand fine-tuning attacks in multilingual LLMs. We first discover cross-lingual generalization of fine-tuning attacks: using a few adversarially chosen instruction-following examples in one language, multilingual LLMs can also be easily compromised (e.g., multilingual LLMs fail to refuse harmful prompts in other languages). Motivated by this finding, we hypothesize that safety-related information is language-agnostic and propose a new method termed Safety Information Localization (SIL) to identify the safety-related information in the model parameter space. Through SIL, we validate this hypothesis and find that only changing 20% of weight parameters in fine-tuning attacks can break safety alignment across all languages. Furthermore, we provide evidence to the alternative pathways hypothesis for why freezing safety-related parameters does not prevent fine-tuning attacks, and we demonstrate that our attack vector can still jailbreak LLMs adapted to new languages.</description>

      <title>FedBaF: Federated Learning Aggregation Biased by a Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models are now a major focus of leading technology organizations due to their ability to generalize across diverse tasks. Existing approaches for adapting foundation models to new applications often rely on Federated Learning (FL) and disclose the foundation model weights to clients when using it to initialize the global model. While these methods ensure client data privacy, they compromise model and information security. In this paper, we introduce Federated Learning Aggregation Biased by a Foundation Model (FedBaF), a novel method for dynamically integrating pre-trained foundation model weights during the FL aggregation phase. Unlike conventional methods, FedBaF preserves the confidentiality of the foundation model while still leveraging its power to train more accurate models, especially in non-IID and adversarial scenarios. Our comprehensive experiments use Pre-ResNet and foundation models like Vision Transformer to demonstrate that FedBaF not only matches, but often surpasses the test accuracy of traditional weight initialization methods by up to 11.4\% in IID and up to 15.8\% in non-IID settings. Additionally, FedBaF applied to a Transformer-based language model significantly reduced perplexity by up to 39.2\%.</description>

      <title>Harnessing PU Learning for Enhanced Cloud-based DDoS Detection: A Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning for enhanced Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) detection in cloud environments. Utilizing the $\texttt{BCCC-cPacket-Cloud-DDoS-2024}$ dataset, we implement PU learning with four machine learning algorithms: XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Na\"{i}ve Bayes. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of ensemble methods, with XGBoost and Random Forest achieving $F_{1}$ scores exceeding 98%. We quantify the efficacy of each approach using metrics including $F_{1}$ score, ROC AUC, Recall, and Precision. This study bridges the gap between PU learning and cloud-based anomaly detection, providing a foundation for addressing Context-Aware DDoS Detection in multi-cloud environments. Our findings highlight the potential of PU learning in scenarios with limited labeled data, offering valuable insights for developing more robust and adaptive cloud security mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Faster Algorithms for User-Level Private Stochastic Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study private stochastic convex optimization (SCO) under user-level differential privacy (DP) constraints. In this setting, there are $n$ users (e.g., cell phones), each possessing $m$ data items (e.g., text messages), and we need to protect the privacy of each user's entire collection of data items. Existing algorithms for user-level DP SCO are impractical in many large-scale machine learning scenarios because: (i) they make restrictive assumptions on the smoothness parameter of the loss function and require the number of users to grow polynomially with the dimension of the parameter space; or (ii) they are prohibitively slow, requiring at least $(mn)^{3/2}$ gradient computations for smooth losses and $(mn)^3$ computations for non-smooth losses. To address these limitations, we provide novel user-level DP algorithms with state-of-the-art excess risk and runtime guarantees, without stringent assumptions. First, we develop a linear-time algorithm with state-of-the-art excess risk (for a non-trivial linear-time algorithm) under a mild smoothness assumption. Our second algorithm applies to arbitrary smooth losses and achieves optimal excess risk in $\approx (mn)^{9/8}$ gradient computations. Third, for non-smooth loss functions, we obtain optimal excess risk in $n^{11/8} m^{5/4}$ gradient computations. Moreover, our algorithms do not require the number of users to grow polynomially with the dimension.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Feature-Specific Data Protection via Bayesian Coordinate Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local Differential Privacy (LDP) offers strong privacy guarantees without requiring users to trust external parties. However, LDP applies uniform protection to all data features, including less sensitive ones, which degrades performance of downstream tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Bayesian framework, Bayesian Coordinate Differential Privacy (BCDP), that enables feature-specific privacy quantification. This more nuanced approach complements LDP by adjusting privacy protection according to the sensitivity of each feature, enabling improved performance of downstream tasks without compromising privacy. We characterize the properties of BCDP and articulate its connections with standard non-Bayesian privacy frameworks. We further apply our BCDP framework to the problems of private mean estimation and ordinary least-squares regression. The BCDP-based approach obtains improved accuracy compared to a purely LDP-based approach, without compromising on privacy.</description>

      <title>RediSwap: MEV Redistribution Mechanism for CFMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are essential to decentralized finance, offering continuous liquidity and enabling intermediary-free trading on blockchains. However, participants in AMMs are vulnerable to Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) exploitation. Users face threats such as front-running, back-running, and sandwich attacks, while liquidity providers (LPs) incur the loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR).
  In this paper, we introduce RediSwap, a novel AMM designed to capture MEV at the application level and refund it fairly among users and liquidity providers. At its core, RediSwap features an MEV-redistribution mechanism that manages arbitrage opportunities within the AMM pool. We formalize the mechanism design problem and the desired game-theoretical properties. A central insight underpinning our mechanism is the interpretation of the maximal MEV value as the sum of LVR and individual user losses. We prove that our mechanism is incentive-compatible and Sybil-proof, and demonstrate that it is easy for arbitrageurs to participate.
  We empirically compared RediSwap with existing solutions by replaying historical AMM trades. Our results suggest that RediSwap can achieve better execution than UniswapX in 89% of trades and reduce LPs' loss to under 0.5% of the original LVR in most cases.</description>

      <title>Complexity Matters: Effective Dimensionality as a Measure for Adversarial Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying robustness in a single measure for the purposes of model selection, development of adversarial training methods, and anticipating trends has so far been elusive. The simplest metric to consider is the number of trainable parameters in a model but this has previously been shown to be insufficient at explaining robustness properties. A variety of other metrics, such as ones based on boundary thickness and gradient flatness have been proposed but have been shown to be inadequate proxies for robustness.
  In this work, we investigate the relationship between a model's effective dimensionality, which can be thought of as model complexity, and its robustness properties. We run experiments on commercial-scale models that are often used in real-world environments such as YOLO and ResNet. We reveal a near-linear inverse relationship between effective dimensionality and adversarial robustness, that is models with a lower dimensionality exhibit better robustness. We investigate the effect of a variety of adversarial training methods on effective dimensionality and find the same inverse linear relationship present, suggesting that effective dimensionality can serve as a useful criterion for model selection and robustness evaluation, providing a more nuanced and effective metric than parameter count or previously-tested measures.</description>

      <title>NIDS Neural Networks Using Sliding Time Window Data Processing with Trainable Activations and its Generalization Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents neural networks for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), that operate on flow data preprocessed with a time window. It requires only eleven features which do not rely on deep packet inspection and can be found in most NIDS datasets and easily obtained from conventional flow collectors. The time window aggregates information with respect to hosts facilitating the identification of flow signatures that are missed by other aggregation methods. Several network architectures are studied and the use of Kalmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)-inspired trainable activation functions that help to achieve higher accuracy with simpler network structure is proposed. The reported training accuracy exceeds 99% for the proposed method with as little as twenty neural network input features. This work also studies the generalization capability of NIDS, a crucial aspect that has not been adequately addressed in the previous studies. The generalization experiments are conducted using CICIDS2017 dataset and a custom dataset collected as part of this study. It is shown that the performance metrics decline significantly when changing datasets, and the reduction in performance metrics can be attributed to the difference in signatures of the same type flows in different datasets, which in turn can be attributed to the differences between the underlying networks. It is shown that the generalization accuracy of some neural networks can be very unstable and sensitive to random initialization parameters, and neural networks with fewer parameters and well-tuned activations are more stable and achieve higher accuracy.</description>

      <title>Robust Watermarking Using Generative Priors Against Image Editing: From Benchmarking to Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current image watermarking methods are vulnerable to advanced image editing techniques enabled by large-scale text-to-image models. These models can distort embedded watermarks during editing, posing significant challenges to copyright protection. In this work, we introduce W-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of watermarking methods against a wide range of image editing techniques, including image regeneration, global editing, local editing, and image-to-video generation. Through extensive evaluations of eleven representative watermarking methods against prevalent editing techniques, we demonstrate that most methods fail to detect watermarks after such edits. To address this limitation, we propose VINE, a watermarking method that significantly enhances robustness against various image editing techniques while maintaining high image quality. Our approach involves two key innovations: (1) we analyze the frequency characteristics of image editing and identify that blurring distortions exhibit similar frequency properties, which allows us to use them as surrogate attacks during training to bolster watermark robustness; (2) we leverage a large-scale pretrained diffusion model SDXL-Turbo, adapting it for the watermarking task to achieve more imperceptible and robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that our method achieves outstanding watermarking performance under various image editing techniques, outperforming existing methods in both image quality and robustness.

      <title>The Learning Stabilizers with Noise problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random classical codes have good error correcting properties, and yet they are notoriously hard to decode in practice. Despite many decades of extensive study, the fastest known algorithms still run in exponential time. The Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem, which can be seen as the task of decoding a random linear code in the presence of noise, has thus emerged as a prominent hardness assumption with numerous applications in both cryptography and learning theory.
  Is there a natural quantum analog of the LPN problem? In this work, we introduce the Learning Stabilizers with Noise (LSN) problem, the task of decoding a random stabilizer code in the presence of local depolarizing noise. We give both polynomial-time and exponential-time quantum algorithms for solving LSN in various depolarizing noise regimes, ranging from extremely low noise, to low constant noise rates, and even higher noise rates up to a threshold. Next, we provide concrete evidence that LSN is hard. First, we show that LSN includes LPN as a special case, which suggests that it is at least as hard as its classical counterpart. Second, we prove a worst-case to average-case reduction for variants of LSN. We then ask: what is the computational complexity of solving LSN? Because the task features quantum inputs, its complexity cannot be characterized by traditional complexity classes. Instead, we show that the LSN problem lies in a recently introduced (distributional and oracle) unitary synthesis class. Finally, we identify several applications of our LSN assumption, ranging from the construction of quantum bit commitment schemes to the computational limitations of learning from quantum data.</description>

      <title>Inverting Cryptographic Hash Functions via Cube-and-Conquer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MD4 and MD5 are fundamental cryptographic hash functions proposed in the early 1990s. MD4 consists of 48 steps and produces a 128-bit hash given a message of arbitrary finite size. MD5 is a more secure 64-step extension of MD4. Both MD4 and MD5 are vulnerable to practical collision attacks, yet it is still not realistic to invert them, i.e., to find a message given a hash. In 2007, the 39-step version of MD4 was inverted by reducing to SAT and applying a CDCL solver along with the so-called Dobbertin's constraints. As for MD5, in 2012 its 28-step version was inverted via a CDCL solver for one specified hash without adding any extra constraints. In this study, Cube-and-Conquer (a combination of CDCL and lookahead) is applied to invert step-reduced versions of MD4 and MD5. For this purpose, two algorithms are proposed. The first one generates inverse problems for MD4 by gradually modifying the Dobbertin's constraints. The second algorithm tries the cubing phase of Cube-and-Conquer with different cutoff thresholds to find the one with the minimum runtime estimate of the conquer phase. This algorithm operates in two modes: (i) estimating the hardness of a given propositional Boolean formula; (ii) incomplete SAT solving of a given satisfiable propositional Boolean formula. While the first algorithm is focused on inverting step-reduced MD4, the second one is not area-specific and is therefore applicable to a variety of classes of hard SAT instances. In this study, 40-, 41-, 42-, and 43-step MD4 are inverted for the first time via the first algorithm and the estimating mode of the second algorithm. Also, 28-step MD5 is inverted for four hashes via the incomplete SAT solving mode of the second algorithm. For three hashes out of them, it is done for the first time.</description>

      <title>Federated learning with differential privacy and an untrusted aggregator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning for training models over mobile devices is gaining popularity. Current systems for this task exhibit significant trade-offs between model accuracy, privacy guarantee, and device efficiency. For instance, Oort (OSDI 2021) provides excellent accuracy and efficiency but requires a trusted central server. On the other hand, Orchard (OSDI 2020) provides good accuracy and the rigorous guarantee of differential privacy over an untrusted server, but creates huge overhead for the devices. This paper describes Aero, a new federated learning system that significantly improves this trade-off. Aero guarantees good accuracy, differential privacy over an untrusted server, and keeps the device overhead low. The key idea of Aero is to tune system architecture and design to a specific set of popular, federated learning algorithms. This tuning requires novel optimizations and techniques, e.g., a new protocol to securely aggregate updates from devices. An evaluation of Aero demonstrates that it provides comparable accuracy to plain federated learning (without differential privacy), and it improves efficiency (CPU and network) over Orchard by up to $10^5\times$.</description>

      <title>Send Message to the Future? Blockchain-based Time Machines for Decentralized Reveal of Locked Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conditional information reveal systems automate the release of information upon meeting specific predefined conditions, such as time or location. This paper introduces a breakthrough in the understanding, design, and application of conditional information reveal systems that are highly secure and decentralized. By designing a new practical timed-release cryptography system and a secret sharing scheme with reveal-verifiability, a novel data sharing system is devised on the blockchain that "sends messages in the future" with highly accurate decryption times. Notably, the proposed secret sharing scheme applies to other applications requiring verifiability of revealed secret shares. This paper provides a complete evaluation portfolio of this pioneering paradigm, including analytical results, a validation of its robustness in the Tamarin Prover and a performance evaluation of a real-world, open-source system prototype deployed across the globe. Using real-world election data, we also demonstrate the applicability of this innovative system in e-voting, illustrating its capacity to secure and ensure fair electronic voting processes.</description>

      <title>The Road to Trust: Building Enclaves within Confidential VMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11438v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrity is critical for maintaining system security, as it ensures that only genuine software is loaded onto a machine. Although confidential virtual machines (CVMs) function within isolated environments separate from the host, it is important to recognize that users still encounter challenges in maintaining control over the integrity of the code running within the trusted execution environments (TEEs). The presence of a sophisticated operating system (OS) raises the possibility of dynamically creating and executing any code, making user applications within TEEs vulnerable to interference or tampering if the guest OS is compromised. To address this issue, this paper introduces NestedSGX, a framework which leverages virtual machine privilege level (VMPL), a recent hardware feature available on AMD SEV-SNP to enable the creation of hardware enclaves within the guest VM. Similar to Intel SGX, NestedSGX considers the guest OS untrusted for loading potentially malicious code. It ensures that only trusted and measured code executed within the enclave can be remotely attested. To seamlessly protect existing applications, NestedSGX aims for compatibility with Intel SGX by simulating SGX leaf functions. We have also ported the SGX SDK and the Occlum library OS to NestedSGX, enabling the use of existing SGX toolchains and applications in the system. Performance evaluations show that context switches in NestedSGX take about 32,000 -- 34,000 cycles, approximately $1.9\times$ -- $2.1\times$ higher than that of Intel SGX. NestedSGX incurs minimal overhead in most real-world applications, with an average overhead below 2% for computation and memory intensive workloads and below 15.68% for I/O intensive workloads.</description>

      <title>How To Save Fees in Bitcoin Smart Contracts: a Simple Optimistic Off-chain Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the execution of smart contracts on Bitcoin. There, every contract step corresponds to appending to the blockchain a new transaction that spends the output representing the old contract state, creating a new one for the updated state. This standard procedure requires the contract participants to pay transaction fees for every execution step. In this paper, we introduce a protocol that moves most of the execution of a Bitcoin contract off-chain. When all participants follow this protocol, they are able to save on transaction fees, drastically reducing them. By contrast, whenever adversaries try to disrupt the off-chain execution, any honest participant is still able to enforce the correct contract behaviour, by continuing its execution on-chain.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Federated Learning without Noise Addition: When is it Possible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) with Secure Aggregation (SA) has gained significant attention as a privacy preserving framework for training machine learning models while preventing the server from learning information about users' data from their individual encrypted model updates. Recent research has extended privacy guarantees of FL with SA by bounding the information leakage through the aggregate model over multiple training rounds thanks to leveraging the "noise" from other users' updates. However, the privacy metric used in that work (mutual information) measures the on-average privacy leakage, without providing any privacy guarantees for worse-case scenarios. To address this, in this work we study the conditions under which FL with SA can provide worst-case differential privacy guarantees. Specifically, we formally identify the necessary condition that SA can provide DP without addition noise. We then prove that when the randomness inside the aggregated model update is Gaussian with non-singular covariance matrix, SA can provide differential privacy guarantees with the level of privacy $\epsilon$ bounded by the reciprocal of the minimum eigenvalue of the covariance matrix. However, we further demonstrate that in practice, these conditions are almost unlikely to hold and hence additional noise added in model updates is still required in order for SA in FL to achieve DP. Lastly, we discuss the potential solution of leveraging inherent randomness inside aggregated model update to reduce the amount of addition noise required for DP guarantee.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Logistic Regression Training on Large Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving machine learning is one class of cryptographic methods that aim to analyze private and sensitive data while keeping privacy, such as homomorphic logistic regression training over large encrypted data. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for logistic regression training on large encrypted data using Homomorphic Encryption (HE), which is the mini-batch version of recent methods using a faster gradient variant called $\texttt{quadratic gradient}$. It is claimed that $\texttt{quadratic gradient}$ can integrate curve information (Hessian matrix) into the gradient and therefore can effectively accelerate the first-order gradient (descent) algorithms. We also implement the full-batch version of their method when the encrypted dataset is so large that it has to be encrypted in the mini-batch manner. We compare our mini-batch algorithm with our full-batch implementation method on real financial data consisting of 422,108 samples with 200 freatures. %Our experiments show that Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG) Given the inefficiency of HEs, our results are inspiring and demonstrate that the logistic regression training on large encrypted dataset is of practical feasibility, marking a significant milestone in our understanding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work contributes towards the development of an efficient and scalable open-source Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) protocol on machines with moderate computational resources. We use the ABY2.0 SMPC protocol implemented on the C++ based MOTION2NX framework for secure convolutional neural network (CNN) inference application with semi-honest security. Our list of contributions are as follows. Firstly, we enhance MOTION2NX by providing a tensorized version of several primitive functions including the Hadamard product, indicator function and argmax function. Secondly, we adapt an existing Helper node algorithm, working in tandem with the ABY2.0 protocol, for efficient convolution computation to reduce execution time and RAM usage. Thirdly, we also present a novel splitting algorithm that divides the computations at each CNN layer into multiple configurable chunks. This novel splitting algorithm, providing significant reduction in RAM usage, is of independent interest and is applicable to general SMPC protocols.</description>

Abstract: Personal data custodian services enable data owners to share their data with data consumers in a convenient manner, anytime and anywhere. However, with data hosted in these services being beyond the control of the data owners, it raises significant concerns about privacy in personal data sharing. Many schemes have been proposed to realize fine-grained access control and privacy protection in data sharing. However, they fail to protect the rights of data owners to their data under the law, since their designs focus on the management of system administrators rather than enhancing the data owners' privacy. In this paper, we introduce a novel task-driven personal data sharing system based on the data capsule paradigm realizing personal data sharing autonomy. It enables data owners in our system to fully control their data, and share it autonomously. Specifically, we present a tamper-resistant data capsule encapsulation method, where the data capsule is the minimal unit for independent and secure personal data storage and sharing. Additionally, to realize selective sharing and informed-consent based authorization, we propose a task-driven data sharing mechanism that is resistant to collusion and EDoS attacks. Furthermore, by updating parts of the data capsules, the permissions granted to data consumers can be immediately revoked. Finally, we conduct a security and performance analysis, proving that our scheme is correct, sound, and secure, as well as revealing more advantageous features in practicality, compared with the state-of-the-art schemes.</description>

      <title>Hijack-GAN: Unintended-Use of Pretrained, Black-Box GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.14107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) show increasing performance and the level of realism is becoming indistinguishable from natural images, this also comes with high demands on data and computation. We show that state-of-the-art GAN models -- such as they are being publicly released by researchers and industry -- can be used for a range of applications beyond unconditional image generation. We achieve this by an iterative scheme that also allows gaining control over the image generation process despite the highly non-linear latent spaces of the latest GAN models. We demonstrate that this opens up the possibility to re-use state-of-the-art, difficult to train, pre-trained GANs with a high level of control even if only black-box access is granted. Our work also raises concerns and awareness that the use cases of a published GAN model may well reach beyond the creators' intention, which needs to be taken into account before a full public release.

      <title>Safe machine learning model release from Trusted Research Environments: The SACRO-ML package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SACRO-ML, an integrated suite of open source Python tools to facilitate the statistical disclosure control (SDC) of machine learning (ML) models trained on confidential data prior to public release. SACRO-ML combines (i) a SafeModel package that extends commonly used ML models to provide ante-hoc SDC by assessing the vulnerability of disclosure posed by the training regime; and (ii) an Attacks package that provides post-hoc SDC by rigorously assessing the empirical disclosure risk of a model through a variety of simulated attacks after training. The SACRO-ML code and documentation are available under an MIT license at https://github.com/AI-SDC/SACRO-ML</description>

      <title>Rethinking Randomized Smoothing from the Perspective of Scalability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse domains but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Empirical defense mechanisms often fail, as new attacks constantly emerge, rendering existing defenses obsolete, shifting the focus to certification-based defenses. Randomized smoothing has emerged as a promising technique among notable advancements. This study reviews the theoretical foundations and empirical effectiveness of randomized smoothing and its derivatives in verifying machine learning classifiers from a perspective of scalability. We provide an in-depth exploration of the fundamental concepts underlying randomized smoothing, highlighting its theoretical guarantees in certifying robustness against adversarial perturbations and discuss the challenges of existing methodologies.</description>

      <title>Universal Black-Box Reward Poisoning Attack against Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of universal black-boxed reward poisoning attacks against general offline reinforcement learning with deep neural networks. We consider a black-box threat model where the attacker is entirely oblivious to the learning algorithm, and its budget is limited by constraining the amount of corruption at each data point and the total perturbation. We require the attack to be universally efficient against any efficient algorithms that might be used by the agent. We propose an attack strategy called the `policy contrast attack.' The idea is to find low- and high-performing policies covered by the dataset and make them appear to be high- and low-performing to the agent, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first universal black-box reward poisoning attack in the general offline RL setting. We provide theoretical insights on the attack design and empirically show that our attack is efficient against current state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms in different learning datasets.</description>

      <title>How Far Have We Gone in Binary Code Understanding Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary code analysis plays a pivotal role in various software security applications, such as software maintenance, malware detection, software vulnerability discovery, patch analysis, etc. However, unlike source code, understanding binary code is challenging for reverse engineers due to the absence of semantic information. Therefore, automated tools are needed to assist human players in interpreting binary code. In recent years, two groups of technologies have shown promising prospects: (1) Deep learning-based technologies have demonstrated competitive results in tasks related to binary code understanding, furthermore, (2) Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively pre-trained at the source-code level for tasks such as code understanding and generation. This makes participants wonder about the ability of LLMs in binary code understanding.
  In this work, we propose a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in real-world reverse engineering scenarios. The benchmark covers two key binary code understanding tasks, including function name recovery and binary code summarization. We gain valuable insights into their capabilities and limitations through extensive evaluations of popular LLMs using our benchmark. Our evaluations reveal that existing LLMs can understand binary code to a certain extent, thereby improving the efficiency of binary code analysis. Our results highlight the great potential of the LLMs in advancing the field of binary code understanding.</description>

      <title>A Huber Loss Minimization Approach to Mean Estimation under User-level Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Privacy protection of users' entire contribution of samples is important in distributed systems. The most effective approach is the two-stage scheme, which finds a small interval first and then gets a refined estimate by clipping samples into the interval. However, the clipping operation induces bias, which is serious if the sample distribution is heavy-tailed. Besides, users with large local sample sizes can make the sensitivity much larger, thus the method is not suitable for imbalanced users. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a Huber loss minimization approach to mean estimation under user-level differential privacy. The connecting points of Huber loss can be adaptively adjusted to deal with imbalanced users. Moreover, it avoids the clipping operation, thus significantly reducing the bias compared with the two-stage approach. We provide a theoretical analysis of our approach, which gives the noise strength needed for privacy protection, as well as the bound of mean squared error. The result shows that the new method is much less sensitive to the imbalance of user-wise sample sizes and the tail of sample distributions. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to validate our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Effects of Scale on Language Model Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models exhibit scaling laws, whereby increasing model and dataset size yields predictable decreases in negative log likelihood, unlocking a dazzling array of capabilities. This phenomenon spurs many companies to train ever larger models in pursuit of ever improved performance. Yet, these models are vulnerable to adversarial inputs such as ``jailbreaks'' and prompt injections that induce models to perform undesired behaviors, posing a growing risk as models become more capable. Prior work indicates that computer vision models become more robust with model and data scaling, raising the question: does language model robustness also improve with scale?
  We study this question empirically in the classification setting, finding that without explicit defense training, larger models tend to be modestly more robust on most tasks, though the effect is not reliable. Even with the advantage conferred by scale, undefended models remain easy to attack in absolute terms, and we thus turn our attention to explicitly training models for adversarial robustness, which we show to be a much more compute-efficient defense than scaling model size alone. In this setting, we also observe that adversarially trained larger models generalize faster and better to modified attacks not seen during training when compared with smaller models. Finally, we analyze the offense/defense balance of increasing compute, finding parity in some settings and an advantage for offense in others, suggesting that adversarial training alone is not sufficient to solve robustness, even at greater model scales.</description>

      <title>CountCrypt: Quantum Cryptography between QCMA and PP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a quantum oracle relative to which BQP = QCMA but quantum-computation-classical-communication (QCCC) key exchange, QCCC commitments, and two-round quantum key distribution exist. We also construct an oracle relative to which BQP = QMA, but quantum lightning (a stronger variant of quantum money) exists. This extends previous work by Kretschmer [Kretschmer, TQC22], which showed that there is a quantum oracle relative to which BQP = QMA but pseudorandom state generators (a quantum variant of pseudorandom generators) exist. We also show that QCCC key exchange, QCCC commitments, and two-round quantum key distribution can all be used to build one-way puzzles. One-way puzzles are a version of "quantum samplable" one-wayness and are an intermediate primitive between pseudorandom state generators and EFI pairs, the minimal quantum primitive. In particular, one-way puzzles cannot exist if BQP = PP. Our results together imply that aside from pseudorandom state generators, there is a large class of quantum cryptographic primitives which can exist even if BQP = QCMA, but are broken if BQP = PP. Furthermore, one-way puzzles are a minimal primitive for this class. We denote this class "CountCrypt".</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Cyber Network Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have created opportunities to solve complex real-world tasks. Cybersecurity is a notable application area, where defending networks against sophisticated adversaries remains a challenging task typically performed by teams of security operators. In this work, we explore novel MARL strategies for building autonomous cyber network defenses that address challenges such as large policy spaces, partial observability, and stealthy, deceptive adversarial strategies. To facilitate efficient and generalized learning, we propose a hierarchical Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) architecture that decomposes the cyber defense task into specific sub-tasks like network investigation and host recovery. Our approach involves training sub-policies for each sub-task using PPO enhanced with domain expertise. These sub-policies are then leveraged by a master defense policy that coordinates their selection to solve complex network defense tasks. Furthermore, the sub-policies can be fine-tuned and transferred with minimal cost to defend against shifts in adversarial behavior or changes in network settings. We conduct extensive experiments using CybORG Cage 4, the state-of-the-art MARL environment for cyber defense. Comparisons with multiple baselines across different adversaries show that our hierarchical learning approach achieves top performance in terms of convergence speed, episodic return, and several interpretable metrics relevant to cybersecurity, including the fraction of clean machines on the network, precision, and false positives on recoveries.</description>
