      <title>Revising the Universality Hypothesis for Room-temperature Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atoms constitute promising quantum sensors for a variety of scenarios including vacuum metrology. Key to this application is knowledge of the collision rate coefficient of the sensor atom with the particles being detected. Prior work demonstrated that, for room-temperature collisions, the total collision rate coefficient and the trap depth dependence of the sensor atom loss rate from shallow traps are both universal, independent of the interaction potential at short range. It was also shown that measurements of the energy transferred to the sensor atom by the collision can be used to estimate the total collision rate coefficient. However, discrepancies found when comparing the results of this and other methods of deducing the rate coefficient call into question its accuracy. Here the universality hypothesis is re-examined and an important correction is presented. We find that measurements of the post-collision recoil energy of sensor atoms held in shallow magnetic traps only provide information about the interaction potential at the very largest inter-atomic distances (e.g.~the value of $C_6$ for a leading order term of $C_6/r^6$). As other non-negligible terms exist at medium and long ranges, the total collision rate coefficient, even if universal, can differ from that computed solely from the value of $C_6$. By incorporating these other long-range terms, the results align with full quantum mechanical scattering calculations, resolving the discrepancies and offering immediate implications for using atoms as a self-calibrating primary pressure standard.</description>

      <title>Absorption Spectroscopy of $^{40}$Ca Atomic Beams Produced via Pulsed Laser Ablation: A Quantitative Comparison of Ca and CaTiO$_3$ Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsed laser ablation is an increasingly prevalent method for fast ion trap loading of various species, however characteristics of the ablation target source material can affect the ion-loading process. One factor which can reduce the atomic flux from a target is oxidation during atmospheric exposure when preparing or making changes to the ion trap vacuum system. Recent work has shown that perovskite ablation targets produce consistent atomic densities even after exposure to atmosphere when compared to elemental source targets. In this work, we directly compare calcium (Ca) and calcium-titanate (CaTiO$_3$) ablation targets, characterizing the neutral atomic beam flux using resonant, time-resolved absorption spectroscopy of the 423 nm $^{1}S_0 \rightarrow$ $^{1}P_1$ transition in neutral Ca. We measure the ablation plume longitudinal and transverse temperatures, number density, ion production, and spot lifetime for each target. In addition, we compare the ablated atomic beam density for both targets before and after 21 hours of exposure to atmosphere, demonstrating the relative robustness of the CaTiO$_3$ source.</description>

      <title>The influence of final state interactions in attosecond photoelectron interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fano resonances are ubiquitous phenomena appearing in many fields of physics, e.g. atomic or molecular photoionization, or electron transport in quantum dots. Recently, attosecond interferometric techniques have been used to measure the amplitude and phase of photoelectron wavepackets close to Fano resonances in argon and helium, allowing for the retrieval of the temporal dynamics of the photoionization process. In this work, we study the photoionization of argon atoms close to the $3s^13p^64p$ autoionizing state using an interferometric technique with high spectral resolution. The phase shows a monotonic $2{\pi}$ increase across the resonance or a sigmo\"idal less than ${\pi}$ variation depending on experimental conditions, e.g. the probe laser bandwidth. Using three different, state-of-the-art calculations, we show that the measured phase is influenced by the interaction between final states reached by two-photon transitions.</description>

      <title>Microwave spectroscopy assisted by electromagnetically induced transparency near natural F\"orster resonance on Rubidium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we precisely measure the transition energies between the Rydberg state n$\text{D}_{5/2}$ to the nearby Rydberg states $(\e{n}+2)\text{P}_{3/2}$, $(\e{n}-2)\text{F}_{7/2}$ for the range $41\leq \e{n}\leq46$. This was done by carrying out microwave spectroscopy via Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) in a room temperature vapor reference cell of Rubidium, which is similar to the experimental approach followed by Li et al. [Results in Physics \textbf{29}, 104728 (2021)]. This range is interesting because there is a quasi F\"orster resonance between the atomic pair $43\text{D}_{5/2}+43\text{D}_{5/2}$ and $45\text{P}_{3/2}+41\text{F}_{7/2}$. We compared the obtained results with numerically calculated transition energies based on previously tabulated quantum defect numbers by various research groups using both hot and ultra-cold atomic samples. Our data are more consistent with measurements made within ultra-cold atomic systems [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{67}, 052502 (2003), Phys. Rev. A \textbf{74}, 054502 (2006)].</description>

      <title>Ytterbium atom interferometry for dark matter searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the sensitivity of a laboratory-scale ytterbium atom interferometer to scalar, vector, and axion dark matter signals. A frequency ratio measurement between two transitions in $^{171}$Yb enables a search for variations of the fine-structure constant that could surpass existing limits by a factor of 100 in the mass range $10^{-22}$ eV to $10^{-16}$ eV. Differential accelerometry between Yb isotopes yields projected sensitivities to scalar and vector dark matter couplings that are stronger than the limits set by the MICROSCOPE equivalence principle test, and an analogous measurement in the MAGIS-100 long-baseline interferometer would be more sensitive than previous bounds by factors of 10 or more. A search for anomalous spin torque in MAGIS-100 is projected to reach similar sensitivity to atomic magnetometry experiments. We discuss strategies for mitigating the main systematic effects in each measurement. These results indicate that improved dark matter searches with Yb atom interferometry are technically feasible.</description>
