      <title>Stable multipole solitons in defocusing saturable media with an annular trapping potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the existence, stability, and propagation dynamics of multipole-mode (necklace-shaped) solitons in the two-dimensional model of an optical medium with the defocusing saturable nonlinearity and an annular potential trough. Various families of stable multipole solitons trapped in the trough, from dipole, quadrupole, and octupole ones to multi-lobe complexes, are found. The existence domain remains invariant with the increase of the potential's depth. Solitons with a large number N of lobes are stable in a wide parameter region, up to N=48 and even farther. Actually, stable multipole solitons of an arbitrarily high order N can be found, provided that the trough's radius is big enough. The power of stable multipoles is essentially larger in comparison to previously studied models. It is demonstrated analytically and numerically that the application of a phase torque initiates stable rotation of the multipole complexes. Thus, we put forward an effective scheme for the stabilization of multipole solitons with an arbitrary high number of lobes, including rotating ones, which offers new possibilities for manipulating complex light beams.</description>

      <title>Hawking-radiation-ignited autocatalytic formation of primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze an autocatalytic mechanism in which bursts of Hawking radiation from evaporating micro-primordial black holes (PBHs) trigger the collapse of near-critical plasma overdensities. In a primordial plasma seeded with such patches, this feedback self organizes into a traveling ignition front that successively forms new PBHs and then self-quenches as the Universe expands. A minimal reaction-diffusion model yields conservative criteria for ignition and freeze-out and predicts a stochastic gravitational-wave background with a sharp causal low-frequency edge set by the freeze-out correlation length and largely insensitive to Planck-scale PBH endpoint microphysics. The resulting sub-Hz-to-audio band and amplitudes satisfy cosmological energy-injection bounds, providing a clean, testable target for forthcoming gravitational-wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Towards spinning $U(1)$ gauged non-topological solitons in the model with Chern-Simons term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain localized field configurations with finite energy in a ($2+1$)-dimensional model with Maxwell and Chern-Simons gauge terms coupled to a massive complex scalar field. These non-topological solitons are characterized by the $U(1)$ frequency and a winding number. Thus, the solutions possess Noether charge and non-trivial angular momentum, which is not quantized in contrast to the topological case. We study the solitons and their integral characteristics numerically and demonstrate that they are kinematically stable. The obtained solutions allow for the thin-wall approximation in some region of frequencies. For each winding number, the Noether charge has a lower bound that coincides with an isolated point, where the non-relativistic conformal symmetry seems to be restored.</description>

      <title>Compact stationary fluxons in the Josephson junction ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stationary compact fluxon profiles are shown to be exact solutions of the inductively coupled and dc-biased Josephson junction ladder. Such states do not exist in the parallel Josephson junction array which is described by the standard discrete sine-Gordon equation. It is shown that there are compact fluxon and multi-fluxon states which either satisfy the top-bottom antisymmetry or are asymmetric. The anti-symmetric states have zero energy if their topological charge is even and the asymmetric states always have zero energy. Depending on the anisotropy constant the compact fluxons can either coexist with the non-compact states or only compact states are possible. External magnetic field prevents compact state existence.</description>

      <title>Stationary and switching synchronization regimes in an ensemble of four nonidentical phase oscillators with repulsive couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the collective dynamics (phase synchronization, instantaneous frequencies synchronization and mean frequencies synchronization) in an ensemble of four nonidentical phase oscillators with repulsive coupling. We use the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi system of ordinary differential equations as our mathematical model. Depending on the coupling strength in the presence of a small mismatch of the natural frequencies, all possible modes of frequency synchronization were found: 4:0 (global), 3:1, 2:2, 2:1:1 (cluster). It is shown that these regimes can be classified into two main types depending on the evolution of the instantaneous frequencies: stationary (4:0 and 2:2), characterized by constancy of phase ratios and instantaneous frequencies, and switching (3:1 and 2:1:1), in which metastable processes with periodic switching of synchronous states are observed: for different time intervals, different types of locking of instantaneous frequencies of oscillator pairs and different types of phase ratios were observed. For the 4:0 and 2:2 regimes, analytical expressions for the synchronization frequencies were derived. The presence of bistability has been revealed depending on the initial conditions of different synchronous regimes at the same parameters: sets of individual frequencies and value of coupling strength.</description>
