      <title>Decentralized Relaxed Smooth Optimization with Gradient Descent Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $L_0$-smoothness, which has been pivotal to advancing decentralized optimization theory, is often fairly restrictive for modern tasks like deep learning. The recent advent of relaxed $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness condition enables improved convergence rates for gradient methods. Despite centralized advances, its decentralized extension remains unexplored and challenging. In this work, we propose the first general framework for decentralized gradient descent (DGD) under $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness by introducing novel analysis techniques. For deterministic settings, our method with adaptive clipping achieves the best-known convergence rates for convex/nonconvex functions without prior knowledge of $L_0$ and $L_1$ and bounded gradient assumption. In stochastic settings, we derive complexity bounds and identify conditions for improved complexity bound in convex optimization. The empirical validation with real datasets demonstrates gradient-norm-dependent smoothness, bridging theory and practice for $(L_0,L_1)$-decentralized optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Gradient- and Newton-Based Unit Vector Extremum Seeking Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents novel methods for achieving stable and efficient convergence in multivariable extremum seeking control (ESC) using sliding mode techniques. Drawing inspiration from both classical sliding mode control and more recent developments in finite-time and fixed-time control, we propose a new framework that integrates these concepts into Gradient- and Newton-based ESC schemes based on sinusoidal perturbation signals. The key innovation lies in the use of discontinuous "relay-type" control components, replacing traditional proportional feedback to estimate the gradient of unknown quadratic nonlinear performance maps with Unit Vector Control (UVC). This represents the first attempt to address real-time, model-free optimization using sliding modes within the classical extremum seeking paradigm. In the Gradient-based approach, the convergence rate is influenced by the unknown Hessian of the objective function. In contrast, the Newton-based method overcomes this limitation by employing a dynamic estimator for the inverse of the Hessian, implemented via a Riccati equation filter. We establish finite-time convergence of the closed-loop average system to the extremum point for both methods by leveraging Lyapunov-based analysis and averaging theory tailored to systems with discontinuous right-hand sides. Numerical simulations validate the proposed method, illustrating significantly faster convergence and improved robustness compared to conventional ESC strategies, which typically guarantee only exponential stability. The results also demonstrate that the Gradient-based method exhibits slower convergence and higher transients since the gradient trajectory follows the curved and steepest-descent path, whereas the Newton-based method achieves faster convergence and improved overall performance going straightly to the extremum.</description>

      <title>Control-affine Schr\"odinger Bridge and Generalized Bohm Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control-affine Schr\"odinger bridge concerns with a stochastic optimal control problem. Its solution is a controlled evolution of joint state probability density subject to a control-affine It\^o diffusion with a given deadline connecting a given pair of initial and terminal densities. In this work, we recast the necessary conditions of optimality for the control-affine Schr\"odinger bridge problem as a two point boundary value problem for a quantum mechanical Schr\"odinger PDE with complex potential. This complex-valued potential is a generalization of the real-valued Bohm potential in quantum mechanics. Our derived potential is akin to the optical potential in nuclear physics where the real part of the potential encodes elastic scattering (transmission of wave function), and the imaginary part encodes inelastic scattering (absorption of wave function). The key takeaway is that the process noise that drives the evolution of probability densities induces an absorbing medium in the evolution of wave function. These results make new connections between control theory and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics through the lens of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Multi-timescale Stochastic Programming with Applications in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-timescale stochastic programming framework designed to address decision-making challenges in power systems, particularly those with high renewable energy penetration. The framework models interactions across different timescales using aggregated state variables to coordinate decisions. In addition to Multi-timescale uncertainty modeled via multihorizon trees, we also introduce a "synchronized state approximation," which periodically aligns states across timescales to maintain consistency and tractability. Using this approximation, we propose two instantiation methods: a scenario-based approach and a value function-based approach specialized for this setup. Our framework is very generic, and covers a wide-spectrum of applications.</description>

      <title>A Multi-scale Perimeter Control and Route Guidance System for Large-scale Road Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perimeter control and route guidance are effective ways to reduce traffic congestion and improve traffic efficiency by controlling the spatial and temporal traffic distribution on the network. This paper presents a multi-scale joint perimeter control and route guidance (MSJC) framework for controlling traffic in large-scale networks. The network is first partitioned into several subnetworks (regions) with traffic in each region governed by its macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD), which forms the macroscale network (upper level). Each subnetwork, comprised of actual road links and signalized intersections, forms the microscale network (lower level). At the upper level, a joint perimeter control and route guidance model solves the region-based inflow rate and hyper-path flows to control the accumulation of each region and thus maximize the throughput of each region. At the lower level, a perimeter control strategy integrated with a backpressure policy determines the optimal signal phases of the intersections at the regional boundary. At the same time, a route choice model for vehicles is constructed to meet hyper-path flows and ensure the intra-region homogeneity of traffic density. The case study results demonstrate that the proposed MSJC outperforms other benchmarks in regulating regional accumulation, thereby improving throughput.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-Resilient Decentralized Online Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of decentralized online resource allocation in the presence of Byzantine attacks. In this problem setting, some agents may be compromised due to external manipulations or internal failures, causing them to behave maliciously and disrupt the resource allocation process by sending incorrect messages to their neighbors. Given the non-consensual nature of the resource allocation problem, we formulate it under a primal-dual optimization framework, where the dual variables are aggregated among the agents, enabling the incorporation of robust aggregation mechanisms to mitigate Byzantine attacks. By leveraging the classical Byzantine attack model, we propose a class of Byzantine-resilient decentralized online resource allocation algorithms that judiciously integrate the adaptive robust clipping technique with the existing robust aggregation rules to filter out adversarial messages. We establish theoretical guarantees, showing that the proposed algorithms achieve tight linear dynamic regret and accumulative constraint violation bounds, where the constants depend on the properties of robust aggregation rules. Numerical experiments on decentralized online economic dispatch validate the effectiveness of our approach and support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Solving the Market Split Problem with Lattice Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The market split problem was proposed by Cornu\'ejols and Dawande in 1998 as benchmark problem for algorithms solving linear systems with binary variables. The recent (2025) Quantum Optimization Benchmark Library (QOBLIB) contains a set of feasible instances of the market split problem.
  The market split problem seems to be difficult to solve with the conventional branch-and-bound approach of integer linear programming software which reportedly can handle QOBLIB instances up to $m=7$. In contrast, a new GPU implementation of the Schroeppel-Shamir algorithm solves instances up to $m=11$.
  In this short note we report about experiments with our algorithm that reduces the market split problem to a lattice problem. The author's most recent implementation solvediophant applied to the QOBLIB market split instances can solve instances up to $m=14$ on a standard computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the monotonic tracking control problem for continuous-time single-input single-output linear systems using output-feedback linear controllers in this paper. We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for this problem to be solvable and expose its fundamental limitations: the exact feasible locations of the plant zeros, the minimum controller order possible, and the maximum decay rate achievable for the closed-loop system. The relationship between these bounds is explained by a simple geometric shape for plants with a pair of complex-conjugate zeros.</description>

      <title>A bottleneck model with shared autonomous vehicles: Scale economies and price regulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines how scale economies in the operation of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) affect the efficiency of a transportation system where SAVs coexist with normal vehicles (NVs). We develop a bottleneck model where commuters choose their departure times and mode of travel between SAVs and NVs, and analyze equilibria under three SAV-fare scenarios: marginal-cost pricing, average-cost pricing, and unregulated monopoly pricing. Marginal-cost pricing reduces commuting costs but results in financial deficits for the service provider. Average-cost pricing ensures financial sustainability but has contrasting effects depending on the timing of implementation due to the existence of multiple equilibria: when implemented too early, it discourages adoption of SAVs and increases commuting costs; when introduced after SAV adoption reaches the monopoly equilibrium level, it promotes high adoption and achieves substantial cost reductions without a deficit. We also show that expanding road capacity may increase commuting costs under average-cost pricing, demonstrating the Downs--Thomson paradox in transportation systems with SAVs. We next examine two optimal policies that improve social cost, including the operator's profit: the first-best policy that combines marginal-cost pricing with congestion tolls, and the second-best policy that relies on fare regulation alone. Our analysis shows that these policies can limit excessive adoption by discouraging overuse of SAVs. This suggests that promoting SAV adoption does not always lower social cost.</description>

      <title>Projected Gradient Descent for Constrained Decision-Dependent Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the decision-dependent optimization problem, where the data distributions react in response to decisions affecting both the objective function and linear constraints. We propose a new method termed repeated projected gradient descent (RPGD), which iteratively projects points onto evolving feasible sets throughout the optimization process. To analyze the impact of varying projection sets, we show a Lipschitz continuity property of projections onto varying sets with an explicitly given Lipschitz constant. Leveraging this property, we provide sufficient conditions for the convergence of RPGD to the constrained equilibrium point. Compared to the existing dual ascent method, RPGD ensures continuous feasibility throughout the optimization process and reduces the computational burden. We validate our results through numerical experiments on a market problem and dynamic pricing problem.</description>

      <title>Optimization-Free Fast Optimal Control: Bang-Ride Property, Monotonicity, and Applications to Fast Battery Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-input fast optimal control problems, which aim to achieve the optimal objective as fast as possible, occur in various real-world applications. In the case of fast battery charging, the associated optimal control problem becomes computationally challenging when detailed battery models are used. A recent heuristic optimization-free algorithm can significantly reduce the computational cost and provide an approximate solution, consistent with many heuristic input profiles in practice. These heuristic solutions have several special properties: They follow a bang-ride pattern that always activates a constraint and applies the maximum feasible input. This work investigates when the above properties arise in the optimal input, and ultimately, when the heuristic input profiles satisfy necessary optimality conditions. By exploiting Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP), we show that the optimal control is bang-ride under regularity conditions on constraint switching and local controllability of the system. Moreover, the special type of bang-ride behavior, i.e., applying the maximum feasible input, arises under the monotonicity of the system, objective function, and restricted sensitivity of the constraints. These results provide a theoretical justification for a class of charging heuristics and the fast optimization-free algorithm.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Decentralized Optimization of Non-Smooth Convex and Convex-Concave Problems over Time-Varying Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-smooth stochastic decentralized optimization problems over time-varying networks, where objective functions are distributed across nodes and network connections may intermittently appear or break. Specifically, we consider two settings: (i) stochastic non-smooth (strongly) convex optimization, and (ii) stochastic non-smooth (strongly) convex-(strongly) concave saddle point optimization. Convex problems of this type commonly arise in deep neural network training, while saddle point problems are central to machine learning tasks such as the training of generative adversarial networks (GANs). Prior works have primarily focused on the smooth setting, or time-invariant network scenarios. We extend the existing theory to the more general non-smooth and stochastic setting over time-varying networks and saddle point problems. Our analysis establishes upper bounds on both the number of stochastic oracle calls and communication rounds, matching lower bounds for both convex and saddle point optimization problems.</description>

      <title>First- and Zeroth-Order Learning in Asynchronous Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the discrete-time asynchronous games in which noncooperative agents seek to minimize their individual cost functions. Building on the assumption of partial asynchronism, i.e., each agent updates at least once within a fixed-length time interval, we explore the conditions to ensure convergence of such asynchronous games. The analysis begins with a simple quadratic game from which we derive tight convergence conditions through the lens of linear control theory. Then, we provide a quasidominance condition for general convex games. Our results demonstrate that this condition is stringent since when this condition is not satisfied, the asynchronous games may fail to converge. We propose both first- and zeroth-order learning algorithms for asynchronous games, depending on the type of available feedback, and analyze their last-iterate convergence rates. Numerical experiments are presented on economic market problems to verify our results.</description>

      <title>Anchored Implication &amp; Event-Indexed Fixed Points in Hilbert Spaces: Uniqueness and Quantitative Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a synthesis of orthomodular logic (projections as propositions) with operator fixed-point theory in Hilbert spaces. First, we introduce an anchored implication connective $A \Rightarrow^{\mathrm{comm}}_{P} B$, defined semantically so that it is true only when either $A$ is false or else $A$ is true and $B$ is true in a ''commuting'' context specified by a fixed nonzero projection $P$. This connective refines material implication by adding a side condition $[E_B,P]=0$ (commutation of $B$ with the anchor) and reduces to classical implication in the Boolean (commuting) case. Second, we study fixed-point convergence under event-indexed contractions. For a single nonexpansive (not necessarily linear) map $T$, we prove that the event-indexed condition is equivalent to the classical assertion that some power $T^N$ is a strict contraction; thus the ''irregular events'' phrasing does not add generality in that setting. We then present the genuinely more general case of varying operators (switching/randomized): if blocks of the evolving composition are contractive with bounded inter-event gaps and a common fixed point exists, we obtain uniqueness and an explicit envelope rate. Finally, with an anchor $P$ that commutes with $T$, the same reasoning ensures convergence on $PH$ under event-indexed contraction on that subspace. We include precise scope conditions, examples, and visual explanations.</description>

      <title>Multiple Regression Analysis of Unmeasured Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whereas confidence intervals are used to assess uncertainty due to unmeasured individuals, confounding intervals can be used to assess uncertainty due to unmeasured attributes. Previously, we have introduced a methodology for computing confounding intervals in a simple regression setting in a paper titled ``Regression Analysis of Unmeasured Confounding." Here we extend that methodology for more general application in the context of multiple regression. Our multiple regression analysis of unmeasured confounding utilizes subject matter knowledge about coefficients of determination to bound omitted variables bias, while taking into account measured covariate data. Our generalized methodology can be used to partially identify causal effects. The methodology is demonstrated with example applications, to show how coefficients of determination, being complementary to randomness, can support sensitivity analysis for causal inference from observational data. The methodology is best applied when natural sources of randomness are present and identifiable within the data generating process. Our main contribution is an algorithm that supports our methodology. The purpose of this article is to describe our algorithm in detail. In the paper we provide a link to our GitHub page for readers who would like to access and utilize our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Large Deviation Asymptotics for the Supermarket Model with Growing Choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Markovian supermarket model with growing choices, where jobs arrive at rate $n\lambda_n$ and each of $n$ parallel servers processes jobs in its queue at rate $1$. Each incoming job joins the shortest among $d_n \in \{1,\dotsc,n\}$ randomly selected queues. Under the assumption $d_n \to \infty$ and $\lambda_n \to \lambda \in (0,\infty)$ as $n\to \infty$, a large deviation principle (LDP) for the occupancy process is established in a suitable infinite-dimensional path space, and it is shown that the rate function is invariant with respect to the manner in which $d_n \to \infty$. The LDP gives information on the rate of decay of probabilities of various types of rare events associated with the system. We illustrate this by establishing explicit exponential decay rates for probabilities of large total number of jobs in the system. As a corollary, we also show that probabilities of certain rare events can indeed depend on the rate of $d_n \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Distributed optimization: designed for federated learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML) framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation, our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant statistical heterogeneity across clients.</description>

      <title>Extended Parameter Shift Rules with Minimal Derivative Variance for Parameterized Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter shift rules (PSRs) are useful methods for computing arbitrary-order derivatives of the cost function in parameterized quantum circuits. The basic idea of PSRs is to evaluate the cost function at different parameter shifts, then use specific coefficients to combine them linearly to obtain the exact derivatives. In this work, we propose an extended parameter shift rule (EPSR) which generalizes a broad range of existing PSRs and has the following two advantages. First, EPSR offers an infinite number of possible parameter shifts, allowing the selection of the optimal parameter shifts to minimize the final derivative variance and thereby obtaining the more accurate derivative estimates with limited quantum resources. Second, EPSR extends the scope of the PSRs in the sense that EPSR can handle arbitrary Hermitian operator $H$ in gate $U(x) = \exp (iHx)$ in the parameterized quantum circuits, while existing PSRs are valid only for simple Hermitian generators $H$ such as simple Pauli words. Additionally, we show that the widely used ``general PSR'', introduced by Wierichs et al. (2022), is a special case of our EPSR, and we prove that it yields globally optimal shifts for minimizing the derivative variance under the weighted-shot scheme. Finally, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of EPSR and show that the usage of the optimal parameter shifts indeed leads to more accurate derivative estimates.</description>

      <title>A Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu result for fractional thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the limit of squared $H^s$-Gagliardo seminorms on thin domains of the form $\Omega_\varepsilon=\omega\times(0,\varepsilon)$ in $\mathbb R^d$. When $\varepsilon$ is fixed, multiplying by $1-s$ such seminorms have been proved to converge as $s\to 1^-$ to a dimensional constant $c_d$ times the Dirichlet integral on $\Omega_\varepsilon$ by Bourgain, Brezis and Mironescu. In its turn such Dirichlet integrals divided by $\varepsilon$ converge as $\varepsilon\to 0$ to a dimensionally reduced Dirichlet integral on $\omega$. We prove that if we let simultaneously $\varepsilon\to 0$ and $s\to 1$ then these squared seminorms still converge to the same dimensionally reduced limit when multiplied by $(1-s) \varepsilon^{2s-3}$, independently of the relative converge speed of $s$ and $\varepsilon$. This coefficient combines the geometrical scaling $\varepsilon^{-1}$ and the fact that relevant interactions for the $H^s$-Gagliardo seminorms are those at scale $\varepsilon$. We also study the usual membrane scaling, obtained by multiplying by $(1-s)\varepsilon^{-1}$, which highlighs the {\em critical scaling} $1-s\sim|\log\varepsilon|^{-1}$, and the limit when $\varepsilon\to 0$ at fixed $s$.</description>

      <title>Constrained free energy minimization for the design of thermal states and stabilizer thermodynamic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum thermodynamic system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of conserved, non-commuting charges, and a fundamental goal is to determine the minimum energy of the system subject to constraints on the charges. Recently, [Liu et al., arXiv:2505.04514] proposed first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for solving a dual chemical potential maximization problem, and they proved that these algorithms converge to global optima by means of gradient-ascent approaches. In this paper, we benchmark these algorithms on several problems of interest in thermodynamics, including one- and two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg models with nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor interactions and with the charges set to the total $x$, $y$, and $z$ magnetizations. We also offer an alternative compelling interpretation of these algorithms as methods for designing ground and thermal states of controllable Hamiltonians, with potential applications in molecular and material design. Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems as thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian constructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges constructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned algorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including those constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect one-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code. Finally, we observe that the aforementioned hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, when applied to stabilizer thermodynamic systems, can serve as alternative methods for encoding qubits into stabilizer codes at a fixed temperature, and we provide an effective method for warm-starting these encoding algorithms whenever a single qubit is encoded into multiple physical qubits.</description>

      <title>Mean Robust Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.10820v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust optimization is a tractable and expressive technique for decision-making under uncertainty, but it can lead to overly conservative decisions when pessimistic assumptions are made on the uncertain parameters. Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization can reduce conservatism by being data-driven, but it often leads to very large problems with prohibitive solution times. We introduce mean robust optimization, a general framework that combines the best of both worlds by providing a trade-off between computational effort and conservatism. We propose uncertainty sets constructed based on clustered data rather than on observed data points directly thereby significantly reducing problem size. By varying the number of clusters, our method bridges between robust and Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization. We show finite-sample performance guarantees and explicitly control the potential additional pessimism introduced by any clustering procedure. In addition, we prove conditions for which, when the uncertainty enters linearly in the constraints, clustering does not affect the optimal solution. We illustrate the efficiency and performance preservation of our method on several numerical examples, obtaining multiple orders of magnitude speedups in solution time with little-to-no effect on the solution quality.</description>

      <title>Computer-Assisted Design of Accelerated Composite Optimization Methods: OptISTA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15704v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accelerated composite optimization method FISTA (Beck, Teboulle 2009) is suboptimal by a constant factor, and we present a new method OptISTA that improves FISTA by a constant factor of 2. The performance estimation problem (PEP) has recently been introduced as a new computer-assisted paradigm for designing optimal first-order methods. In this work, we present a double-function stepsize-optimization PEP methodology that poses the optimization over fixed-step first-order methods for composite optimization as a finite-dimensional nonconvex QCQP, which can be practically solved through spatial branch-and-bound algorithms, and use it to design the exact optimal method OptISTA for the composite optimization setup. We then establish the exact optimality of OptISTA under the large-scale assumption with a lower-bound construction that extends the semi-interpolated zero-chain construction (Drori, Taylor 2022) to the double-function setup of composite optimization. By establishing exact optimality, our work concludes the search for the fastest first-order methods, with respect to the performance measure of worst-case function value suboptimality, for the proximal, projected-gradient, and proximal-gradient setups involving a smooth convex function and a closed proper convex function.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal and Fair Policies for Online Allocation of Scarce Societal Resources from Data Collected in Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of allocating scarce societal resources of different types (e.g., permanent housing, deceased donor kidneys for transplantation, ventilators) to heterogeneous allocatees on a waitlist (e.g., people experiencing homelessness, individuals suffering from end-stage renal disease, Covid-19 patients) based on their observed covariates. We leverage administrative data collected in deployment to design an online policy that maximizes expected outcomes while satisfying budget constraints, in the long run. Our proposed policy waitlists each individual for the resource maximizing the difference between their estimated mean treatment outcome and the estimated resource dual-price or, roughly, the opportunity cost of using the resource. Resources are then allocated as they arrive, in a first-come first-serve fashion. We demonstrate that our data-driven policy almost surely asymptotically achieves the expected outcome of the optimal out-of-sample policy under mild technical assumptions. We extend our framework to incorporate various fairness constraints. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the problem of designing policies for allocating scarce housing resources to people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles based on data from the homeless management information system. In particular, we show that using our policies improves rates of exit from homelessness by 5.16% and that policies that are fair in either allocation or outcomes by race come at a very low price of fairness.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Transfer Policies for Parallel Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of load balancing in parallel queues by transferring customers between them at discrete points in time. Holding costs accrue as customers wait in the queue, while transfer decisions incur both fixed (setup) costs and variable costs that increase with the number of transfers and travel distance, and vary by transfer direction. Our work is primarily motivated by inter-facility patient transfers to address imbalanced congestion and inequity in access to care during surges in hospital demand. Analyzing an associated fluid control problem, we show that under general assumptions, including time-varying arrivals and convex holding costs, the optimal policy partitions the state-space into a well-defined $\textit{no-transfer region}$ and its complement, implying that transferring is optimal if and only if the system is sufficiently imbalanced. In the absence of fixed transfer costs, an optimal policy moves the state to the no-transfer region's boundary; in contrast, with fixed costs, the state is moved to its relative interior. Leveraging our structural results, we propose a simulation-based approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to find effective transfer policies for the stochastic system. We investigate the performance and robustness of the fluid and ADP policies in a case study calibrated using data during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Greater Toronto Area, which demonstrates that transferring patients between hospitals could result in up to 27.7% reduction in total cost with relatively few transfers.</description>

      <title>Finite-Sample Guarantees for Learning Dynamics in Zero-Sum Polymatrix Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study best-response type learning dynamics for zero-sum polymatrix games under two information settings. The two settings are distinguished by the type of information that each player has about the game and their opponents' strategy. The first setting is the full information case, in which each player knows their own and their opponents' payoff matrices and observes everyone's mixed strategies. The second setting is the minimal information case, where players do not observe their opponents' strategies and are not aware of any payoff matrices (instead they only observe their realized payoffs). For this setting, also known as the radically uncoupled case in the learning in games literature, we study a two-timescale learning dynamics that combine smoothed best-response type updates for strategy estimates with a TD-learning update to estimate a local payoff function. For these dynamics, without additional exploration, we provide polynomial-time finite-sample guarantees for convergence to an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Robust Confidence Bands for Stochastic Processes Using Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a robust optimization approach for constructing confidence bands for stochastic processes using a finite number of simulated sample paths. Our approach can be used to quantify uncertainty in realizations of stochastic processes or validate stochastic simulation models by checking whether historical paths from the actual system fall within the constructed confidence band. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our methodology is widely applicable and directly addresses optimization bias within the constraints, producing tight confidence bands with accurate coverage probabilities. It is tractable, being only slightly more complex than the state-of-the-art baseline approach, and easy to use, as it employs standard techniques. Additionally, our approach is also applicable to continuous-time processes after appropriately discretizing time. In our first case study, we show that our approach achieves the desired coverage probabilities with an order-of-magnitude fewer sample paths than the state-of-the-art baseline approach. In our second case study, we illustrate how our approach can be used to validate stochastic simulation models.</description>

      <title>Maintenance Optimization for Asset Networks with Unknown Degradation Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the key practical challenge of multi-asset maintenance optimization in settings where degradation parameters are heterogeneous and unknown, and must be inferred from degradation data. To address this, we propose scalable methods suitable for complex asset networks. Degradation is modeled as a stochastic shock process, and real-time data are continuously incorporated into estimation of shock rates and magnitudes via a Bayesian framework. This constitutes a partially observable Markov decision process formulation, from which we analytically derive monotonic policy structures. Moreover, we propose an open-loop feedback approach that enables policies trained via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in a simulation environment with access to the true parameters to remain effective when deployed with real-time Bayesian point estimates instead. Complementing this, we develop a Bayesian Markov decision process (BMDP) framework wherein the agent maintains and updates posterior distributions during deployment. This formulation captures the evolution of parameter uncertainty over time, thereby facilitating the training of scalable DRL-based policies that adapt as additional data become available.
  We validate our approach through experiments on synthetic asset networks and a real-world case involving interventional X-ray system filaments. We find that the proposed DRL methods consistently outperform traditional heuristics across various scenarios. The policies trained for the BMDP perform well even when priors must be estimated from historical data, and remain effective in networks with high asset heterogeneity. Knowledge of true degradation parameters yields only marginal cost benefits, underscoring the ability of our approach to make effective decisions under limited information on degradation processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a necessary condition for the small-time local controllability of multi-input control-affine systems on $R^d$ . This condition is formulated on the vectors of $R^d$ resulting from the evaluation at zero of the Lie brackets of the vector fields: it involves both their direction and their amplitude. The proof is an adaptation to the multi-input case of a general method introduced by Beauchard and Marbach in the single-input case. It relies on a Magnus-type representation formula: the state is approximated by a linear combination of the evaluation at zero of the Lie brackets of the vector fields, whose coefficients are functionals of the time and the controls. Finally, obstructions to small-time local controllability result from interpolation inequalities.</description>

Abstract: This note demonstrates that, for all compact convex sets, high-precision linear minimization can be performed via a single evaluation of the projection and a scalar-vector multiplication. In consequence, if $\varepsilon$-approximate linear minimization takes at least $L(\varepsilon)$ real vector-arithmetic operations and projection requires $P$ operations, then $\mathcal{O}(P)\geq \mathcal{O}(L(\varepsilon))$ is guaranteed. This concept is expounded with examples, an explicit error bound, and an exact linear minimization result for polyhedral sets.</description>

      <title>Solving Decision-Dependent Robust Problems as Bilevel Optimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both bilevel and robust optimization are established fields of mathematical optimization and operations research. However, only until recently, the similarities in their mathematical structure has neither been studied theoretically nor exploited computationally. Based on the recent results by \textcite{goerigk2025}, this paper is the first one that reformulates a given strictly robust optimization problem with a decision-dependent uncertainty set as an equivalent bilevel optimization problem and then uses solution techniques from the latter field to solve the robust problem at hand. If the uncertainty set can be dualized, the respective bilevel techniques to obtain a single-level reformulation are very similar compared with the classic dualization techniques used in robust optimization but lead to larger single-level problems to be solved. Our numerical study shows that this leads to larger computation times but may also slightly improve the dual bound. For the more challenging case of decision-dependent uncertainty sets represented by mixed-integer linear models we cannot apply standard dualization techniques. Thus, we compare the presented bilevel approach with the only available method from the literature, which is based on quantified mixed-integer linear programs. Our numerical results indicate that, for the problem class of decision-dependent robust optimization problems, the bilevel approach performs better in terms of computation times.</description>

      <title>Sparse Tensor CCA via Manifold Optimization for Multi-View Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor canonical correlation analysis (TCCA) has garnered significant attention due to its effectiveness in capturing high-order correlations in multi-view learning. However, existing TCCA methods often fail to characterize the structure of individual views and lack algorithmic convergence guarantees. In order to deal with these challenges, we propose a novel sparse TCCA model called STCCA-L, which integrates sparse regularization of canonical matrices and Laplacian regularization of multi-order graphs into the TCCA framework, thereby effectively exploiting the geometric structure of individual views. To solve this non-convex model, we develop an efficient alternating manifold proximal gradient algorithm via manifold optimization, which avoids computationally expensive full tensor decomposition and leverages a semi-smooth Newton method for subproblem resolution. Furthermore, we rigorously prove the convergence of the algorithm and analyze its complexity. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior classification performance of the proposed method. Notably, on the 3sources dataset, it achieves improvements of at least 4.50\% in accuracy and 6.77\% in F1-score over competitors. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhudafa/STCCA-L.</description>

      <title>Data-driven interdiction with asymmetric cost uncertainty: a distributionally robust optimization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of stochastic interdiction games between an upper-level decision-maker (referred to as a leader) and a lower-level decision-maker (referred to as a follower), where uncertainty lies in the follower's objective function coefficients. Specifically, the follower's profits (or costs) in our model comprise a random vector, whose probability distribution is estimated independently by the leader and the follower, based on their own data. To address the distributional uncertainty, we formulate a distributionally robust interdiction (DRI) model, where both decision-makers solve conventional distributionally robust optimization problems based on the Wasserstein metric. For this model, we prove asymptotic consistency and derive a polynomial-size mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reformulation. Furthermore, in our bilevel optimization context, the leader may face uncertainty due to its incomplete knowledge of the follower's data. In this regard, we propose two distinct approximations of the true DRI model, where the leader has incomplete or no information about the follower's data. The first approach employs a pessimistic approximation, which turns out to be computationally challenging and requires the design of a specialized Benders decomposition algorithm. The second approach leverages a robust optimization approach from the leader's perspective. To address the resulting problem, we propose a scenario-based outer approximation that admits a potentially large single-level MILP reformulation and satisfies asymptotic robustness guarantees. Finally, for a class of randomly generated instances of the packing interdiction problem, we evaluate numerically how the information asymmetry and the decision-makers' risk preferences affect the models' out-of-sample performance.</description>

      <title>Constructing Magic Squares: an integer constraint satisfaction problem and a fast heuristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic squares are a fascinating mathematical challenge that has intrigued mathematicians for centuries. Given a positive (and possibly large) integer $n$, one of the main challenges that still remains is to find, within a reliable computational time, a magic square of order $n$, that is, a square matrix of order $n$ with unique integers from $a_{\min}$ to $a_{\max}$, such that the sum of each row, column, and diagonal equals a constant $\mathcal{C}(A)$. In this work, we first present an integer constraint satisfaction problem for constructing a magic square of order $n$. Nonetheless, the solution time of this problem grows exponentially as the order increases. To overcome this limitation, we also propose a heuristic that constructs magic squares depending on whether $n$ is odd, singly even, or double even. Our numerical results show that the proposed heuristic can construct magic squares of order up to $70000$ in less than $140$ seconds, demonstrating its efficiency and scalability.</description>

      <title>Discrete and Continuous Difference of Submodular Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Submodular functions, defined on continuous or discrete domains, arise in numerous applications. We study the minimization of the difference of two submodular (DS) functions, over both domains, extending prior work restricted to set functions. We show that all functions on discrete domains and all smooth functions on continuous domains are DS. For discrete domains, we observe that DS minimization is equivalent to minimizing the difference of two convex (DC) functions, as in the set function case. We propose a novel variant of the DC Algorithm (DCA) and apply it to the resulting DC Program, obtaining comparable theoretical guarantees as in the set function case. The algorithm can be applied to continuous domains via discretization. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines in integer compressive sensing and integer least squares.</description>

      <title>Computing an optimal single machine schedule with sequence dependent setup times using shortest path computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a single-machine scheduling problem with sequence dependent setup times, motivated by applications in manufacturing and service industries - in particular, the calendering stage in rubber flooring production. In this phase, setup times are primarily driven by temperature and color transitions between consecutive jobs, with significant impact on throughput and energy efficiency. We present a novel solution framework that transforms the scheduling problem into a path-finding problem on a specially constructed layered graph. By encoding sequence-dependent effects directly into the graph's structure, we enable the use of classical shortest-path algorithms to compute optimal job sequences. The resulting method is polynomial-time solvable for the two-color case and reveals key structural properties of optimal schedules. Our approach thus provides both a theoretically grounded and practically applicable optimization technique.</description>

      <title>Voltage Support Procurement in Transmission Grids: Incentive Design via Online Bilevel Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources into transmission grid operations presents a complex challenge, particularly in the context of reactive power procurement for voltage support. This paper addresses this challenge by formulating the voltage regulation problem as a Stackelberg game, where the Transmission System Operator (TSO) designs incentives to guide the reactive power responses of Distribution System Operators (DSOs). We utilize a gradient-based iterative algorithm that updates the incentives to ensure that DSOs adjust their reactive power injections to maintain voltage stability. We incorporate principles from online feedback optimization to enable real-time implementation, utilizing voltage measurements in both TSO's and DSOs' policies. This approach not only enhances the robustness against model uncertainties and changing operating conditions but also facilitates the co-design of incentives and automation. Numerical experiments on a 5-bus transmission grid demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving voltage regulation while accommodating the strategic interactions of self-interested DSOs.</description>

      <title>An efficient branch-and-cut approach for the sequential competitive facility location problem under partially binary rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the sequential competitive facility location problem (SCFLP) under partially binary rule where two companies sequentially open a limited number of facilities to maximize their market shares, requiring customers to patronize, for each company, the facility with the highest utility. The SCFLP is a bilevel mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and can be rewritten as a single-level MINLP problem, where each nonlinear constraint corresponds to a hypograph of a multiple ratio function characterizing the leader's market share for a fixed follower's location choice. By establishing the submodularity of the multiple ratio functions, we characterize the mixed 0-1 set induced by each hypograph using submodular inequalities and extend a state-of-the-art branch-and-cut (B&amp;C) algorithm to the considered SCFLP. To address the challenge of poor linear programming (LP) relaxation of the underlying formulation, we develop two new mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations for the SCFLP as well as efficient B&amp;C algorithms based on them. The first MILP formulation is based on a class of improved submodular inequalities, which include the classic submodular inequalities as special cases, and together with the trivial inequalities characterize the convex hull of the mixed 0-1 set. The second one is an extended formulation of the first one that provides the same LP relaxation bound. We also develop efficient algorithms for the separations of the exponential families of the inequalities in the MILP formulations. Extensive computational experiments show that the proposed B&amp;C algorithms significantly outperform an adapted state-of-the-art B&amp;C algorithm and a sophisticated heuristic algorithm in the literature. Moreover, the proposed B&amp;C algorithms can find optimal solutions for SCFLP instances with up to 1000 customers and facilities within a two-hour time limit.</description>

      <title>Tame Riemannian Stochastic Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00709v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of stochastic approximation applied to a tame nondifferentiable function subject to constraints defined by a Riemannian manifold. The objective landscape of tame functions, arising in o-minimal topology extended to a geometric category when generalized to manifolds, exhibits some structure that enables theoretical guarantees of expected function decrease and asymptotic convergence for generic stochastic sub-gradient descent. Recent work has shown that this class of functions faithfully model the loss landscape of deep neural network training objectives, and the autograd operation used in deep learning packages implements a variant of subgradient descent with the correct properties for convergence. Riemannian optimization uses geometric properties of a constraint set to perform a minimization procedure while enforcing adherence to the the optimization variable lying on a Riemannian manifold. This paper presents the first study of tame optimization on Riemannian manifolds, highlighting the rich geometric structure of the problem and confirming the appropriateness of the canonical "SGD" for such a problem with the analysis and numerical reports of a simple Retracted SGD algorithm.</description>

      <title>Markovian randomized equilibria for general Markovian Dynkin games in discrete time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a general formulation of the classical two-player Dynkin game in a discrete time Markovian setting. We identify an appropriate class of mixed strategies -- \textit{Markovian randomized stopping times} -- in which players stop at any given state with a state-dependent probability. One main result is an explicit characterization of Wald-Bellman-type for Nash equilibria based on this notion of randomization. In particular, we derive a novel characterization of randomized equilibria in zero-sum Dynkin games, which we use to (i) establish the existence and explicit construction of Markovian randomized equilibria, (ii) provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the non-existence of pure strategy equilibria, and (iii) construct an example that admits a unique randomized equilibrium but no pure one. We also provide existence and characterization results in the symmetric version of our game. Finally, we establish existence of a characterizable equilibrium in Markovian randomized stopping times for the general game formulation under the assumption that the state space is countable.</description>

      <title>Improving the robustness of neural ODEs with minimal weight perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to enhance the stability of a neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) by reducing the maximum error growth subsequent to a perturbation of the initial value. Since the stability depends on the logarithmic norm of the Jacobian matrix associated with the neural ODE, we control the logarithmic norm by perturbing the weight matrices of the neural ODE by a smallest possible perturbation (in Frobenius norm). We do so by engaging an eigenvalue optimisation problem, for which we propose a nested two-level algorithm. For a given perturbation size of the weight matrix, the inner level computes optimal perturbations of that size, while - at the outer level - we tune the perturbation amplitude until we reach the desired uniform stability bound. We embed the proposed algorithm in the training of the neural ODE to improve its robustness to perturbations of the initial value, as adversarial attacks. Numerical experiments on classical image datasets show that an image classifier including a neural ODE in its architecture trained according to our strategy is more stable than the same classifier trained in the classical way, and therefore, it is more robust and less vulnerable to adversarial attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of jointly estimating the noise covariance matrix alongside states (parameters such as poses and points) from measurements corrupted by Gaussian noise and, if available, prior information. In such settings, the noise covariance matrix determines the weights assigned to individual measurements in the least squares problem. We show that the joint problem exhibits a convex structure and provide a full characterization of the optimal noise covariance estimate (with analytical solutions) within joint maximum a posteriori and likelihood frameworks and several variants. Leveraging this theoretical result, we propose two novel algorithms that jointly estimate the primary parameters and the noise covariance matrix. Our BCD algorithm can be easily integrated into existing nonlinear least squares solvers, with negligible per-iteration computational overhead. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across diverse scenarios and offer practical insights into their application in robotics and computer vision estimation problems with a particular focus on SLAM.</description>

      <title>Online Covariance Estimation in Nonsmooth Stochastic Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider applying stochastic approximation (SA) methods to solve nonsmooth variational inclusion problems. Existing studies have shown that the averaged iterates of SA methods exhibit asymptotic normality, with an optimal limiting covariance matrix in the local minimax sense of H\'ajek and Le Cam. However, no methods have been proposed to estimate this covariance matrix in a nonsmooth and potentially non-monotone (nonconvex) setting. In this paper, we study an online batch-means covariance matrix estimator introduced in Zhu et al.(2023). The estimator groups the SA iterates appropriately and computes the sample covariance among batches as an estimate of the limiting covariance. Its construction does not require prior knowledge of the total sample size, and updates can be performed recursively as new data arrives. We establish that, as long as the batch size sequence is properly specified (depending on the stepsize sequence), the estimator achieves a convergence rate of order $O(\sqrt{d}n^{-1/8+\varepsilon})$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, where $d$ and $n$ denote the problem dimensionality and the number of iterations (or samples) used. Although the problem is nonsmooth and potentially non-monotone (nonconvex), our convergence rate matches the best-known rate for covariance estimation methods using only first-order information in smooth and strongly-convex settings. The consistency of this covariance estimator enables asymptotically valid statistical inference, including constructing confidence intervals and performing hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>On Composable and Parametric Uncertainty in Systems Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the design of complex systems requires navigating interdependent decisions, heterogeneous components, and multiple objectives. Our monotone theory of co-design offers a compositional framework for addressing this challenge, modeling systems as Design Problems (DPs), representing trade-offs between functionalities and resources within partially ordered sets. While current approaches model uncertainty using intervals, capturing worst- and best-case bounds, they fail to express probabilistic notions such as risk and confidence. These limitations hinder the applicability of co-design in domains where uncertainty plays a critical role. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for composable uncertainty in co-design, capturing intervals, distributions, and parametrized models. This extension enables reasoning about risk-performance trade-offs and supports advanced queries such as experiment design, learning, and multi-stage decision making. We demonstrate the expressiveness and utility of the framework via a numerical case study on the uncertainty-aware co-design of task-driven Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).</description>

      <title>Adaptive Two-sided Assortment Optimization: Revenue Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study adaptive two-sided assortment optimization for revenue maximization in choice-based matching platforms. The platform has two sides of agents, an initiating side, and a responding side. The decision-maker sequentially selects agents from the initiating side, shows each an assortment of agents from the responding side, and observes their choices. After processing all initiating agents, the responding agents are shown assortments and make their selections. A match occurs when two agents mutually select each other, generating pair-dependent revenue. Choices follow Multinomial Logit (MNL) models. This setting generalizes prior work focused on maximizing the number of matches under submodular demand assumptions, which do not hold in our revenue-maximization context. Our main contribution is the design of polynomial-time approximation algorithms with constant-factor guarantees. In particular, for general pairwise revenues, we develop a randomized algorithm that achieves a $(\frac{1}{2} - \epsilon)$-approximation in expectation for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$. The algorithm is static and provides guarantees under various agent arrival settings, including fixed order, simultaneous processing, and adaptive selection. When revenues are uniform across all pairs involving any given responding-side agent, the guarantee improves to $(1 - \frac{1}{e} - \epsilon)$. In structural settings where responding-side agents share a common revenue-based ranking, we design a simpler adaptive deterministic algorithm achieving a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation. Our approach leverages novel linear programming relaxations, correlation gap arguments, and structural properties of the revenue functions.</description>
