      <title>Hinge electronic structure of strained half-Heuslers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Half-Heusler compounds are a class of materials with great potential for the study of distinct electronic states. In this work, we investigate, from first-principles, the possibility of hinge modes in closely related topological phases that are tunable by moderate uni-axial strain. We consider two compounds: LiSbZn and LiBiZn. While LiSbZn has a topologically trivial band structure, the larger spin-orbit coupling of Bi causes a band inversion in LiBiZn. We predict the existence of topologically trivial hinge states in both cases. The hinge modes are affected by both the crystal termination, and the bulk topological phase transitions, albeit indirectly: when present, topological surface modes hybridize with the hinge states and obscure their visibility. Thus, we find that the most visible hinge modes occur when no band inversions are present in the material. Our work highlights the interplay and competition between surface and hinge modes in half-Heuslers, and may help guide the experimental search for robust boundary signatures in these materials</description>

      <title>Particle-Hole Asymmetry and Pinball Liquid in a Triangular-Lattice Extended Hubbard Model within Mean-Field Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, triangular lattice models have received a lot of attention since they can describe a number of strongly-correlated materials that exhibit superconductivity and various magnetic and charge orders. In this research we present an extensive analysis of the charge-ordering phenomenon of the triangular-lattice extended Hubbard model with repulsive onsite and nearest-neighbor interaction, arbitrary charge concentration, and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ supercell (3-sublattice assumption). The model is solved in the ground state with the mean-field approximation which allowed to identify $8$ charge-ordered phases and a large variety of phase transitions. An exotic pinball-liquid phase was found and described. Moreover, strong particle-hole asymmetry of the phase diagram is found to play an important role for triangular lattices. The analysis of band structures, unavailable for more advanced methods that take into account correlation effects, provided a great insight in the nature of triangular-lattice phases and phase transitions. The complexity of the mean-field phase diagram showed the importance and usefulness of the results for the further research with correlation effects included. Together with atomic-limit approximation it can serve them as both a starting point, and a tool to interpret results.</description>

      <title>Trotterization is substantially efficient for low-energy states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trotterization is one of the central approaches for simulating quantum many-body dynamics on quantum computers or tensor networks. In addition to its simple implementation, recent studies have revealed that its error and cost can be reduced if the initial state is closed in the low-energy subspace. However, the improvement by the low-energy property rapidly vanishes as the Trotter order grows in the previous studies, and thus, it is mysterious whether there exists genuine advantage of low-energy initial states. In this Letter, we resolve this problem by proving the optimal error bound and cost of Trotterization for low-energy initial states. For generic local Hamiltonians composed of positive-semidefinite terms, we show that the Trotter error is at most linear in the initial state energy $\Delta$ and polylogarithmic in the system size $N$. As a result, the computational cost becomes substantially small for low-energy states with $\Delta \in o(Ng)$ compared to the one for arbitrary initial states, where $g$ denotes the energy per site and $Ng$ means the whole-system energy. Our error bound and cost of Trotterization achieve the theoretically-best scaling in the initial state energy $\Delta$. In addition, they can be partially extended to weakly-correlated initial states having low-energy expectation values, which are not necessarily closed in the low-energy subspace. Our results will pave the way for fast and accurate simulation of low-energy states, which are one central targets in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamics of Dissipative Polarizable Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical polarizable approaches have become the gold standard for simulating complex systems and processes in the condensed phase. These methods describe intrinsically dissipative polarizable media, requiring a formal definition within the framework of open quantum systems. We present a Hamiltonian formulation for the quantum dynamics of polarizable sources based on a generalized theory of the damped harmonic oscillator, using pseudo-boson theory to characterize their coherent state dynamics. We then apply our theory to the study of the optical response of two plasmonic systems. Furthermore, by exploiting the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics and the integrability of quadratic Hamiltonians, we derive a self-consistent relation for the emitted electric field of the polarizable medium under the semiclassical approximation, based on exact formulas for medium polarization. Finally, we derive the master equation describing the open dynamics of a quantum system interacting with the quantum polarizable medium, along with analytical expressions for correlation functions calculated over arbitrary Gaussian states.</description>
