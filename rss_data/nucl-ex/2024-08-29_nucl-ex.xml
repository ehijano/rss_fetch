      <title>Flavor Dependence of Charged Pion Fragmentation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have measured the flavor dependence of multiplicities for pi^+ and pi^- production in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) on proton and deuteron targets to explore a possible charge symmetry violation in fragmentation functions. The experiment used an electron beam with energies of 10.2 and 10.6 GeV at Jefferson Lab and the Hall-C spectrometers. The electron kinematics spanned the range 0.3&lt;x&lt;0.6, 2&lt;Q^2&lt;5.5 GeV^2, and 4&lt;W^2&lt;11 GeV^2. The pion fractional momentum range was 0.3&lt; z &lt;0.7, and the transverse momentum range was 0&lt;p_T&lt;0.25 GeV/c. Assuming factorization at low p_T and allowing for isospin breaking, we find that the results can be described by two ``favored" and two ``un-favored" effective low $p_T$ fragmentation functions that are flavor-dependent. However, they converge to a common flavor-independent value at the lowest x or highest W of this experiment.</description>

      <title>A Decade of Collectivity in Small Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signatures of collectivity, including azimuthally anisotropic and radial flow as well as characteristic hadrochemical dependencies, have been observed since long in (ultra)relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. They underpin the interpretation of these collision systems in terms of QGP formation and close-to-perfect fluidity. Remarkably, however, essentially all these signatures of collectivity have been identified within the last decade in collision systems as small as pp and p-Pb, where collective phenomena had been assumed to be absent traditionally. Precursor phenomena may have been found even in ep and $e^+e^-$ collisions. This article provides a complete review of all data on small system collectivity. It reviews model simulations of these data where available. However, in the absence of a phenomenologically fully satisfactory description of collectivity across all system sizes, we focus in particular on the theoretical basis of all dynamical frameworks of collectivity invoked in heavy ion collisions, and their expected scaling with system size. Our discussion clarifies to what extent all dynamical explanations are challenged by the available data.</description>

      <title>Electron Scattering at the Intensity Frontier with SoLID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solenoidal Large Intensity Device (SoLID) is a large acceptance spectrometer capable of operating at the luminosity frontier. It is proposed to fully exploit the scientific potential of the continuous electron beam accelerator facility (CEBAF) 12 GeV energy upgrade at Jefferson Lab. Its conceptual design is mature, having passed multiple reviews and been validated by a successful pre-R\&amp;D phase. The envisioned scientific program consists of three avenues of research, namely the 3D momentum imaging of the structure of the nucleon, the origin of the proton mass through the gluonic gravitational form factors (GFFs), and the search of physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. These avenues are complemented by a growing supplemental list of run group experiments that address a variety of important topics.</description>

      <title>Event-activity-dependent beauty-baryon enhancement in simulations with color junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results from ALICE and CMS show a low-transverse-momentum enhancement of charm baryon-to-meson production ratios over model predictions based on e$^+$e$^-$ collisions. Several mechanisms are proposed to understand this phenomenon. New measurements by the LHCb and ALICE experiments show a similar enhancement in the beauty sector. We explore this enhancement in terms of event activity using the color-reconnection beyond leading order approximation model. We propose sensitive probes relying on the event shape that will allow for the differentiation between the proposed beauty-production scenarios using freshly collected LHC Run-3 data, and we also compare these to predictions for charm. Our results will contribute to a deeper theoretical understanding of the heavy-flavor baryon enhancement and its relation to baryon enhancement in general.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing the sources of dielectron anisotropic flow at low beam energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present calculations of dielectron anisotropic flow in heavy-ion collisions at HADES beam energies from a hadronic transport approach. The ongoing experimental analysis employs the traditional reaction plane method to evaluate the flow coefficients $v_n$ and claims to see isotropic radiation from the thermal quark-gluon plasma. We show in this work, that in the region above the pion mass, the dilepton flow measurement might suffer from cancellation effects that mask the complicated underlying dynamics. Contributions from different baryonic and mesonic resonances show collective behaviour with different signs and lead to an overall vanishing elliptic flow. To differentiate the different contributions, we propose to employ the scalar product method, which exploits the previously measured hadronic flow to create different reference planes. As a proof of concept, we calculate the $v_2$ of dielectrons for Ag+Ag collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.55$ $\mathrm{GeV}$ with both methods and investigate the contribution of each source, concluding that the scalar product method provides the proton and pion tagged flow coefficients as two distinct measurements, disentangling the various dilepton sources.</description>

      <title>The X17 boson and the d(p,e+ e-)3He and d(n,e+ e-)3H processes: a theoretical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work deals with the e+ e- pair production in the d(p,e+e-)3He and d(n,e+ e-)3H processes, in order to evidentiate possible effects due to the exchange of a hypothetical low-mass boson, the so-called X17. These processes are studied for energies of the incident beams in the range 18-30 MeV, in order to have a sufficient energy to produce such a boson, whose mass is estimated to be around 17 MeV. We first analyze them as a purely electromagnetic processes, in the context of a state-of-the-art approach to nuclear strong-interaction dynamics and nuclear electromagnetic currents, derived from chiral effective field theory chiEFT. Next, we examine how the exchange of a hypothetical low-mass boson would impact the cross sections for such processes. We consider several possibilities, that this boson is either a scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, or axial particle. The main aim of the study is to exploit the specular structure of the 3He and 3H nuclei to investigate the isospin dependency of the X17-nucleon interaction, as the alleged "proto-phobicity".</description>

      <title>Search for baryon junctions in photonuclear processes and isobar collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05685v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the early development of Quantum Chromodynamics, it was proposed that baryon number could be carried by a non-perturbative Y-shaped topology of gluon fields, called the gluon junction, rather than by the valence quarks as in the QCD standard model. A puzzling feature of ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions is the apparent substantial baryon excess in the midrapidity region that could not be adequately accounted for in most conventional models of quark and diquark transport. The transport of baryonic gluon junctions is predicted to lead to a characteristic exponential distribution of net-baryon density with rapidity and could resolve the puzzle. In this context we point out that the rapidity density of net-baryons near midrapidity indeed follows an exponential distribution with a slope of $-0.61\pm0.03$ as a function of beam rapidity in the existing global data from A+A collisions at AGS, SPS and RHIC energies. To further test if quarks or gluon junctions carry the baryon quantum number, we propose to study the absolute magnitude of the baryon vs. charge stopping in isobar collisions at RHIC. We also argue that semi-inclusive photon-induced processes ($\gamma+p$/A) at RHIC kinematics provide an opportunity to search for the signatures of the baryon junction and to shed light onto the mechanisms of observed baryon excess in the mid-rapidity region in ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. Such measurements can be further validated in A+A collisions at the LHC and $e+p$/A collisions at the EIC.</description>

      <title>Machine learning study to identify collective flow in small and large colliding systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective flow has been found to be similar between small colliding systems ($p$ $+$ $p$ and $p$ $+$ A collisions) and large colliding systems (peripheral A $+$ A collisions) at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. In order to study the differences of collective flow between small and large colliding systems, we employ a point cloud network to identify $p$ $+$ Pb collisions and peripheral Pb $+$ Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV generated from a multiphase transport model (AMPT). After removing the discrepancies in the pseudorapidity distribution and the $p_{\rm T}$ spectra, we capture the discrepancy in collective flow. Although the verification accuracy of our PCN is limited due to similar event-by-event distributions of elliptic and triangular flow, we demonstrate that collective flow between $p$ $+$ Pb collisions and peripheral Pb $+$ Pb collisions becomes more distinct with increasing final hadron multiplicity and parton scattering cross section. This study not only highlights the potential of PCN techniques in advancing the understanding of collective flow in varying colliding systems, but more importantly lays the groundwork for the future PCN-related research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiparticle cumulants method can be used to reveal long-range collectivity in small and large colliding systems. The four-particle symmetric cumulant $sc_{2,4} \left \{ 4 \right \}$, three-particle asymmetric cumulant $ac_{2} \left \{ 3 \right \}$, and the normalized cumulants $nsc_{2,4} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ and $nac_{2} \left \{ 3 \right \}$ from the transverse momentum conservation and flow are calculated. The interplay between the two effects is also investigated. Our results are in a good agreement with the recent ATLAS measurements of multiparticle azimuthal correlations with the subevent cumulant method, which provides insight into the origin of collective flow in small systems.</description>

      <title>Backward DVCS on the pion in Sullivan processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to do a systematic feasibility study of measuring in backward region deeply virtual Compton scattering on the pion in Sullivan processes in the framework of collinear QCD factorization where pion to photon transition distribution amplitudes (TDAs) describe the photon content of the $\pi$ meson. Our approach employs TDAs based on the overlap of light front wave functions, using a previously developed pion light-front wave function and deriving a consistent model for the light front wave functions of the photon. This work is expected to lead us to an estimate of the cross-sections that could be measured in the future U.S. and China's electron-ion colliders. It will also provide a comparison with the forward Sullivan DVCS case, which gives access to pion GPDs and for which a strong signal is expected.</description>

      <title>Probing collectivity in heavy-ion collisions with fluctuations of the $p_T$ spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event-by-event fluctuations in the initial stages of ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions depend little on rapidity. The hydrodynamic expansion which occurs in later stages then gives rise to correlations among outgoing particles which depend weakly on their relative rapidity. Azimuthal correlations, through which anisotropic flow ($v_n(p_T)$) is defined, have been the most studied. Here we study a new observable introduced in 2020 by Schenke, Shen and Teaney and dubbed $v_0(p_T)$, which quantifies the relative change in the $p_T$ spectrum induced by a fluctuation. We describe how it can be measured. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we make quantitative predictions for $v_0(p_T)$ of charged and identified hadrons. We then discuss how $v_0(p_T)$ relates to two phenomena which have been measured: The increase of the mean transverse momentum in ultracentral collisions, and the event-by-event fluctuations of the transverse momentum per particle $[ p_T]$. We show that $v_0(p_T)$ determines the dependence of these quantities on the $p_T$ cuts implemented in the analysis. We quantitatively explain the rise of $\sigma_{p_T}$ observed by ATLAS as the upper $p_T$-cut is increased from $2$ to $5$~GeV/$c$.</description>

      <title>Vertex correction to nuclear matrix elements of double-$\beta$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The predicted neutrinoless double-$\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay is the crucial phenomenon to prove the existence of the Majorana neutrino, which gives a foundation to leptogenesis to explain the matter prevalence of the universe. The nuclear matrix element (NME) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay is an important theoretical quantity to determine the effective neutrino mass and help the detector design for the next generation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay search. Reliable calculation of this NME is a long-standing problem because of the diversity of the predicted values of the NME. The main reason for this difficulty is that the effective strength of the Gamow-Teller transition operator $g_A$ for this decay is unknown. I will show the lowest-order vertex corrections for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ and the $2\nu\beta\beta$ NME of $^{136}$Xe in the framework of the hybrid application of the quantum field theory to the leptons and the Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbation to the nucleus. The unperturbed nuclear states are obtained by the quasiparticle random-phase approximation. These corrections reduce the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME by 30%. The effective $g_A$ referring to this reduced NME is also obtained, and it is shown for the first time that the effective $g_A$ for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME is not quite different from that for the $2\nu\beta\beta$ NME; the difference is only 10%. This indicates the possibility that the phenomenological effective $g_A$ to reproduce the experimental half-life of the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay can be approximately used for the calculation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME.</description>
