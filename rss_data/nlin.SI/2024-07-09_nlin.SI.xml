      <title>A modified Korteweg-de Vries equation soliton gas under the nonzero background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a soliton gas of the focusing modified Korteweg-de Vries generated from the $N$-soliton solutions under the nonzero background. The spectral soliton density is chosen on the pure imaginary axis, excluding the branch cut $\Sigma_{c}=\left[-i, i\right]$. In the limit $N\to\infty$, we establish the Riemann-Hilbert problem of the soliton gas. Using the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest-descent method, this soliton gas under the nonzero background will decay to a constant background as $x\to+\infty$, while its asymptotics as $x\to-\infty$ can be expressed with a Riemann-Theta function, attached to a Riemann surface with genus-two. We also analyze the large $t$ asymptotics over the entire spatial domain, which is divided into three distinct asymptotic regions depending on the ratio $\xi=\frac{x}{t}$. Using the similar method, we provide the leading-order asymptotic behaviors for these three regions and exhibit the dynamics of large $t$ asymptotics.</description>

      <title>On a new 3D generalized Hunter-Saxton equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of integrability is studied for a 3D generalized Hunter-Saxton equation introduced recently by O.I. Morozov. A transformation is found which brings the equation into a constant-characteristic form and simultaneously trivializes the equation's Lax representation. The transformed equation is shown to fail the Painleve test for integrability.</description>

      <title>Small $x$ asymptotics for special function solutions of Painlev\'e III equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the small $x$ asymptotics of the special function solutions of Painlev\'e-III equation. We use the representation of solution in terms of Hankel determinants of Bessel functions, which seems to be new. Hankel determinants can be rewritten as multiple contour integrals using Andr\`eief identity. Finally small $x$ asymptotics is obtained using elementary asymptotic methods.</description>

      <title>Computation of $\wp$-functions on plane algebraic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical tools for computation of $\wp$-functions, also known as Kleinian or multiply periodic, are proposed. In this connection, computation of periods of the both first and second kind is reconsidered. An analytical approach to constructing the Reimann surface of a plane algebraic curves of low gonalities is used. The approach is based on explicit radical solutions to quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations, which serve for hyperelliptic, trigonal, and tetragonal curves, respectively. The proposed analytical construction of the Riemann surface gives a full control over computation of the Abel image of any point on a curve. Therefore, computation of $\wp$-functions on given divisors can be done directly. An alternative computation with the help of the Jacobi inversion problem is used for verification. Hyperelliptic and trigonal curves are considered in detail, and illustrated by examples.</description>

      <title>Particle and wave dynamics of nonlocal solitons in external potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nonlocal bright solitons subject to external spatially nonuniform potentials. If the potential is slowly varying on the soliton scale, we derive analytical soliton solutions behaving like Newtonian particles. If the potential has the form of an attractive delta-like point defect, we identify different dynamical regimes, defined by the relative strength of the nonlocality and the point defect. In these regimes, the soliton can be trapped at the defect's location, via a nonlinear resonance with a defect mode -- which is found analytically -- reflected by or transmitted through the defect, featuring a wave behavior. Our analytical predictions are corroborated by results of direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Jacobi last multiplier and two-dimensional superintegrable oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the role of the Jacobi last multiplier in the context of two-dimensional oscillators. We first consider two-dimensional unit-mass oscillators admitting a separable Hamiltonian description, i.e., $H = H_1 + H_2$, where $H_1$ and $H_2$ are the Hamiltonians of two one-dimensional unit-mass oscillators; it is shown that there exists a third functionally-independent first integral $\Theta$, thereby ensuring superintegrablility. Various examples are explicitly worked out. We then consider position-dependent-mass oscillators and the Bateman pair, where the latter consists of a pair of dissipative linear oscillators. Quite remarkably, the Bateman pair is found to be superintegrable, despite admitting a Hamiltonian which cannot be separated into those of two isolated (non-interacting) one-dimensional oscillators.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian multiform structure of discrete and semi-discrete KP systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A variational structure for the potential AKP system is established using the novel formalism of a Lagrangian multiforms. The structure comprises not only the fully discrete equation on the 3D lattice, but also its semi-discrete variants including several differential-difference equations asssociated with, and compatible with, the partial difference equation. To this end, an overview is given of the various (discrete and semi-discrete) variants of the KP system, and their associated Lax representations, including a novel `generating PDE' for the KP hierarchy. The exterior derivative of the Lagrangian 3-form for the lattice potential KP equation is shown to exhibit a double-zero structure, which implies the corresponding generalised Euler-Lagrange equations. Alongside the 3-form structures, we develop a variational formulation of the corresponding Lax systems via the square eigenfunction representation arising from the relevant direct linearization scheme.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear evolution of disturbances in higher time-derivative theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of localized initial value profiles when propagated in integrable versions of higher time-derivative theories. In contrast to the standard cases in nonlinear integrable systems, where these profiles evolve into a specific number of N-soliton solutions as dictated by the conservation laws, in the higher time derivative theories the theoretical prediction is that the initial profiles can settle into either two-soliton solutions or into any number of N-soliton solutions. In the latter case this implies that the solutions exhibit oscillations that spread in time but remain finite. We confirm these analytical predictions by explicitly solving the associated Cauchy problem numerically with multiple initial profiles for various higher time-derivative versions of integrable modified Korteweg-de Vries equations. In the case with the theoretical possibility of a decay into two-soliton solutions, the emergence of underlying singularities may prevent the profiles from fully developing or may be accompanied by oscillatory, chargeless standing waves at the origin.</description>

      <title>A reappraisal of Lagrangians with non-quadratic velocity dependence and branched Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time and again, non-conventional forms of Lagrangians with non-quadratic velocity dependence have found attention in the literature. For one thing, such Lagrangians have deep connections with several aspects of nonlinear dynamics including specifically the types of the Li\'{e}nard class; for another, very often the problem of their quantization opens up multiple branches of the corresponding Hamiltonians, ending up with the presence of singularities in the associated eigenfunctions. In this article, we furnish a brief review of the classical theory of such Lagrangians and the associated branched Hamiltonians, starting with the example of Li\'{e}nard-type systems. We then take up other cases where the Lagrangians depend upon the velocity with powers greater than two while still having a tractable mathematical structure, while also describing the associated branched Hamiltonians for such systems. For various examples, we emphasize upon the emergence of the notion of momentum-dependent mass in the theory of branched Hamiltonians.</description>
