      <title>Decoupling Geometry from Optimization in 2D Irregular Cutting and Packing Problems: an Open-Source Collision Detection Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing irregular cutting and packing (C&amp;P) optimization problems poses two distinct challenges: the geometric challenge of determining whether or not an item can be placed feasibly at a certain position, and the optimization challenge of finding a good solution according to some objective function. Until now, those tackling such problems have had to address both challenges simultaneously, requiring two distinct sets of expertise and a lot of research &amp; development effort. One way to lower this barrier is to decouple the two challenges. In this paper we introduce a powerful collision detection engine (CDE) for 2D irregular C&amp;P problems which assumes full responsibility for the geometric challenge. The CDE (i) allows users to focus with full confidence on their optimization challenge by abstracting geometry away and (ii) enables independent advances to propagate to all optimization algorithms built atop it. We present a set of core principles and design philosophies to model a general and adaptable CDE focused on maximizing performance, accuracy and robustness. These principles are accompanied by a concrete open-source implementation called $\texttt{jagua-rs}$. This paper together with its implementation serves as a catalyst for future advances in irregular C&amp;P problems by providing a solid foundation which can either be used as it currently exists or be further improved upon.</description>

      <title>Extremely Scalable Distributed Computation of Contour Trees via Pre-Simplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contour trees offer an abstract representation of the level set topology in scalar fields and are widely used in topological data analysis and visualization. However, applying contour trees to large-scale scientific datasets remains challenging due to scalability limitations. Recent developments in distributed hierarchical contour trees have addressed these challenges by enabling scalable computation across distributed systems. Building on these structures, advanced analytical tasks -- such as volumetric branch decomposition and contour extraction -- have been introduced to facilitate large-scale scientific analysis. Despite these advancements, such analytical tasks substantially increase memory usage, which hampers scalability. In this paper, we propose a pre-simplification strategy to significantly reduce the memory overhead associated with analytical tasks on distributed hierarchical contour trees. We demonstrate enhanced scalability through strong scaling experiments, constructing the largest known contour tree -- comprising over half a trillion nodes with complex topology -- in under 15 minutes on a dataset containing 550 billion elements.</description>

      <title>Symplectification of Circular Arcs and Arc Splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, circular arcs are considered both individually and as elements of a piecewise circular curve. The endpoint parameterization proves to be quite advantageous here. The perspective of symplectic geometry provides new vectorial relationships for the circular arc. Curves are considered whose neighboring circular elements each have a common end point or, in addition, a common tangent. These arc splines prove to be a one-parameter curve family, whereby this parameter can be optimized with regard to various criteria.</description>

      <title>A Fast Unsupervised Scheme for Polygonal Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a fast and unsupervised scheme for the polygonal approximation of a closed digital curve. It is demonstrated that the approximation scheme is faster than state-of-the-art approximation and is competitive with Rosin's measure and aesthetic aspects. The scheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex insertion, iterative merging, and vertex adjustment. The initial segmentation is used to detect sharp turns, that is, vertices that seemingly have high curvature. It is likely that some of the important vertices with low curvature might have been missed in the first phase; therefore, iterative vertex insertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes slowly but steadily. The initial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices, and thus merging is used to eliminate redundant vertices. Finally, vertex adjustment was used to enhance the aesthetic appearance of the approximation. The quality of the approximations was measured using the Rosin's method. The robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to geometric transformation was observed.</description>
