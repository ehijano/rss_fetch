      <title>"Industrial-Scale" Black Hole Selection without a Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forthcoming GRAVITY+ instrument promises to usher in an era of "industrial-scale" mass measurements of isolated black holes (BHs), with the potential to assemble a sample of many tens of BHs via interferometric microlensing over several years. A key challenge will be selecting interferometric follow-up targets from an order-of-magnitude larger pool of ongoing microlensing events when using traditional selection based on event timescale alone. Gould (2023) proposed a criterion optimized for BH selection using space-based microlens parallax measurements enabled by a satellite. We adapt it to work with microlens parallax constraints obtainable from ground-based data only. Using Galactic simulations, we show that our selection criterion is highly efficient, expecting to detect about a dozen BHs per year with GRAVITY+ from following up ~35 selected events.</description>

      <title>The Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will greatly improve upon sensitivities in the field of very-high-energy gamma-ray astrophysics. The CTAO northern site (CTAO-North, La Palma, Spain) currently hosts LST-1 with the remaining three large-sized telescopes (LSTs) expected in mid-2026 and one medium-sized telescope (MST) expected in mid-2027. The CTAO southern site (CTAO-South, Paranal, Chile) expects the delivery of five small-sized telescopes (SSTs) and two MSTs in early 2026 with on-site construction beginning in mid-2026. The dual-mirrored Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (SCT) is a candidate MST for CTAO-South and is capable of observations in the energy range of 100 GeV to 10 TeV, the core of CTAO's 20 GeV to 300 TeV energy range. Inaugurated in January 2019, the prototype SCT (pSCT) located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in southern Arizona observed gamma-ray emission from the Crab Nebula at a significance of 8.6 sigma in 2020. The pSCT utilizes a novel dual-mirror optics design and a densely packed focal plane of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). An upgrade of the pSCT camera is underway to fully instrument the camera with 11,328 pixels and an 8-degree diameter FoV. In addition, upgraded electronics will lower the front-end electronics noise, allowing for a lower trigger threshold and improved event reconstruction and background rejection. This work will present the status of the upgrade of the pSCT and discuss the future of the SCT.</description>

      <title>Stereovision Image Processing for Planetary Navigation Maps with Semi-Global Matching and Superpixel Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mars exploration requires precise and reliable terrain models to ensure safe rover navigation across its unpredictable and often hazardous landscapes. Stereoscopic vision serves a critical role in the rover's perception, allowing scene reconstruction by generating precise depth maps through stereo matching. State-of-the-art Martian planetary exploration uses traditional local block-matching, aggregates cost over square windows, and refines disparities via smoothness constraints. However, this method often struggles with low-texture images, occlusion, and repetitive patterns because it considers only limited neighbouring pixels and lacks a wider understanding of scene context. This paper uses Semi-Global Matching (SGM) with superpixel-based refinement to mitigate the inherent block artefacts and recover lost details. The approach balances the efficiency and accuracy of SGM and adds context-aware segmentation to support more coherent depth inference. The proposed method has been evaluated in three datasets with successful results: In a Mars analogue, the terrain maps obtained show improved structural consistency, particularly in sloped or occlusion-prone regions. Large gaps behind rocks, which are common in raw disparity outputs, are reduced, and surface details like small rocks and edges are captured more accurately. Another two datasets, evaluated to test the method's general robustness and adaptability, show more precise disparity maps and more consistent terrain models, better suited for the demands of autonomous navigation on Mars, and competitive accuracy across both non-occluded and full-image error metrics. This paper outlines the entire terrain modelling process, from finding corresponding features to generating the final 2D navigation maps, offering a complete pipeline suitable for integration in future planetary exploration missions.</description>

      <title>Advancing Resource Extraction Systems in Martian Volcanic Terrain: Rover Design, Power Consumption and Hazard Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a schematic plan for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) in Martian volcanic terrains. The work investigated the complexity of volcanic terrains and Martian environmental hazards and suggested comprehensive engineering strategies to overcome the odds and establish a successful mining program in Martian volcanic regions. Slope stabilization methods - such as terracing and anchored drilling rigs - with terrain-adaptive rovers capable of autonomous operations on steep unstable slopes has been suggested as feasible solutions to navigate the complex geological terrains of Martian volcanoes. The mid range rover design with a mass of approximately 2.1 t, proposed here for mining operations, incorporates a six-wheel rocker-bogie suspension, anchoring-enabled drilling arm, dust-mitigation solar arrays, and advanced sensing systems for hazard detection and navigation. A comparative analysis regarding choice of roads and rails for building transport infrastructure has also been performed. We have also looked into the energy requirement of the rover to work under extreme environmental conditions of Mars and suggested a combination of solar and nuclear power to account for the huge energy requirements of sustained operations on Mars. The results demonstrate that mission success in these environments depends on integrating mechanical resilience, environmental adaptability, and operational autonomy, enabling sustainable access to resources in one of Mars' most geologically challenging settings.</description>

      <title>The Optical and Mechanical Design of POEMMA Balloon with Radio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: POEMMA Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a NASA super-pressure balloon mission building toward the proposed Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) dual satellite mission. In its planned 2027 launch, PBR will study Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays, Neutrinos, and High-Altitude Horizontal Airshowers from 33 km above the Earth. By operating at balloon altitudes, PBR will provide a novel vantage point to study air-shower physics while offering competitive instantaneous exposure to neutrinos from transient astrophysical phenomena. The payload's optical instrument is a 0.95 m$^2$ aperture hybrid Schmidt telescope with a 3.81 m$^2$ segmented mirror focusing light onto a Fluorescence Camera and a bi-focalized Cherenkov Camera. The payload will also feature a Radio Instrument consisting of two sinuous antennas based on the Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO) low-frequency instrument. A combined gamma ray/x-ray detector and IR cloud camera round out the instrumentation package, meaning PBR will be the first multi-hybrid balloon-borne multi-messenger observatory flown. This extensive instrumentation must be combined into a radio quiet payload that satisfies the scientific needs and can operate in near vacuum at extreme temperatures, all while meeting NASA safety requirements and weighing no more than 3000 lbs (1361 kg). Accomplishing these tasks together will mark a significant step toward establishing technological readiness for the POEMMA satellite mission. We present an overview of PBR's mechanical and optical systems, additionally detailing our strategies to mitigate electromagnetic interference for the radio instrument and prepare for the harsh near-space environment.</description>

      <title>A Deep SETI Search for Technosignatures in the TRAPPIST-1 System with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) is the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is one of its five key science objectives. We conducted a targeted narrowband search toward the TRAPPIST-1 system using FAST. The observations consisted of five independent L-band pointings, each with a 20-minute integration, for a total on-source time of 1.67h. The frequency coverage spanned 1.05--1.45GHz with a spectral resolution of ~7.5Hz. We searched for narrowband drifting signals with Doppler drift rates within +_4Hz/s and a signal-to-noise ratio threshold of S/N&gt;10 in two orthogonal linear polarizations separately.Based on the system parameters adopted in this work, we estimate a minimum detectable equivalent isotropic radiated power of 2.04x10^10W, placing one of the most stringent constraints to date on persistent or high-duty-cycle narrowband transmitters in this system. No credible technosignature candidates were identified within the searched parameter space. Nevertheless,TRAPPIST-1 remains a compelling target for future SETI efforts. We plan to extend our search to other signal types, such as periodic or transient transmitters, and to carry out broader surveys of nearby exoplanetary systems with FAST.</description>

      <title>A long period transient search method for the Murchison Widefield Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an automated search method for radio transients on the minute timescale focused on the emerging long period transients (LPTs) in image-plane radio data. The method is tuned for use with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and tested on archival observations from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-Sky MWA Extended Survey (GLEAM-X) in the 70--300 MHz range. The images are formed from model-subtracted visibilities, before applying three filters to the time series of each pixel in an image, with each filter designed to be sensitive to a different transient behaviour. Due to the nature of radio interferometry and the refraction of the fluctuating ionosphere, the vast majority of candidates at this stage are artefacts which we identify and remove using a set of flagging measures. Of the 336 final candidates, 7 were genuine transients; 1 new LPT, 1 new pulsar, and 5 known pulsars. The performance of the method is analysed by injecting modelled transient pulses into a subset of the observations and applying the method to the result.</description>

      <title>Cloud Detection using Night Sky Background Light at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rejection of cloud-contaminated data is a complex and important process at the Pierre Auger Observatory, one which combines information from several sources, including IR cameras, lidars, and satellite imaging. With the deteriorating quality of the IR cameras and challenges in using other sources, we propose a new method. We use continuous detector monitoring measurements to build a large database of night sky background fluxes for each pixel across 27 telescopes. Using this database, we generate the expected background flux and define cloud rejection thresholds. Through a straightforward analysis we construct boolean cloud-contamination masks. We demonstrate some results of the analysis, including comparisons with cloud detected using infra-red observations.</description>

      <title>Optimal robust detection statistics for pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) seek to detect a nano-Hz stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) by searching for the characteristic Hellings and Downs angular pattern of timing residual correlations. So far, the evidence remains below the conventional $5$-$\sigma$ threshold, as assessed using the literature-standard ``optimal cross-correlation detection statistic''. While this quadratic combination of cross-correlated data maximizes the {\em deflection} (signal-to-noise ratio), it does not maximize the detection probability at fixed false-alarm probability (FAP), and therefore is not Neyman-Pearson (NP) optimal for the assumed noise and signal models. The NP-optimal detection statistic is a different quadratic form, but is not used because it also incorporates autocorrelations, making it more susceptible to uncertainties in the modeling of pulsar timing noise. Here, we derive the best compromise: a quadratic detection statistic which is as close as possible to the NP-optimal detection statistic (minimizing the variance of its difference with the NP statistic) subject to the constraint that it only uses cross-correlations, so that it is less affected by pulsar noise modeling errors. We study the performance of this new $\NPMV$ statistic for a simulated PTA whose noise and (putative) signal match those of the NANOGrav 15-year data release: GWB amplitude $A_{\rm gw}=2.1\times 10^{-15}$ and spectral index $\gamma=13/3$. Compared to the literature-standard ``optimal" cross-correlation detection statistic, the $\NPMV$ statistic increases the detection probability by $47\%$ when operating at a $5$-$\sigma$ FAP of $\alpha = 2.9 \times 10^{-7}$.</description>

      <title>Identification of Likely Methane Absorption Features in the Optical Spectra of Titan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical spectra of Titan reveal a rich set of absorption features, most of which are likely associated with methane (CH$_4$). Methane is a key molecule in planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres, yet a comprehensive high-resolution linelist at optical wavelengths remains incomplete. This study identified and characterized potential CH$_4$ absorption features in high-resolution optical spectra of Titan, providing essential data for linelist development and improving CH$_4$ detection and characterization. We analyzed Titan spectra from the ESPRESSO spectrograph (R $\approx$ 190,000), identifying intrinsic features and measuring their relative strengths. A conservative detection approach was employed, slightly overestimating solar and telluric contributions to distinguish them from Titan's intrinsic features. To assess the impact of spectral resolution, we compared the ESPRESSO data with Titan UVES data (R $\approx$ 110,000). We identified 6,195 absorption features in the ESPRESSO spectra potentially associated with CH$_4$, of which 5,436 are newly reported. ESPRESSO detected twice as many features as UVES in overlapping regions, highlighting the advantage of higher-resolution data. Most detected lines remained unresolved, so our reported features are primarily blended absorption structures. We estimated the detection limit for feature identification to correspond to a CH$_4$ absorption coefficient of approximately 0.02 km-am$^{-1}$. Comparison of our results with a previous analysis of Titan UVES spectra and with experimental CH$_4$ data at a similar temperature showed good agreement, while some discrepancies were observed when compared with data acquired at a different temperature. We provide a comprehensive list of Titan absorption features with key reliability metrics, along with Titan's intrinsic spectra, to support future studies.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable AI Framework to Disentangle Self-Interacting and Cold Dark Matter in Galaxy Clusters: The CKAN Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have shown their ability to differentiate between self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) and cold dark matter (CDM) on galaxy cluster scales. However, their large parameter counts and ''black-box'' nature make it difficult to assess whether their decisions adhere to physical principles. To address this issue, we have built a Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CKAN) that reduces parameter count and enhances interpretability, and propose a novel analytical framework to understand the network's decision-making process. With this framework, we leverage our network to qualitatively assess the offset between the dark matter distribution center and the galaxy cluster center, as well as the size of heating regions in different models. These findings are consistent with current theoretical predictions and show the reliability and interpretability of our network. By combining network interpretability with unseen test results, we also estimate that for SIDM in galaxy clusters, the minimum cross-section $(\sigma/m)_{\mathrm{th}}$ required to reliably identify its collisional nature falls between $0.1\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$ and $0.3\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$. Moreover, CKAN maintains robust performance under simulated JWST and Euclid noise, highlighting its promise for application to forthcoming observational surveys.</description>

      <title>Error Signals for Overcoming the Laser Power Limits of Gravitational-Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major barrier to improving the quantum-limited sensitivity of gravitational-wave observatories are the thermal distortions of the test masses which arise at megawatt laser power. Recent advances in a new form of higher-order wavefront correction, in which corrective heating profiles are applied to the test mass surfaces near their edges, have the potential to enable a tenfold reduction of the quantum noise floor of future detectors. However, realizing high levels of quantum noise reduction in practice hinges on identifying measurable error signals to finely control each wavefront actuator, in order to suppress wavefront errors to few-nanometer precision across the full mirror apertures. No direct source of such an error signal exists in LIGO today. We demonstrate that thermally imaging the surface of each test mass can provide these critical error signals. We show that the surface temperature profiles obtained from thermal imaging can be uniquely mapped to a finite element model of the mirror whose complete thermal state is identified, enabling full-aperture wavefront reconstruction and direct error signals for real-time precision wavefront control. This new sensing capability can enable up to a 34% strain sensitivity improvement in LIGO A+ at 95% confidence, increasing the sky-averaged detection range for binary neutron star mergers by 11 Mpc, and will be integral to a next-generation 40-km gravitational-wave observatory in the U.S., Cosmic Explorer.</description>

      <title>PowerBin: Fast Adaptive Data Binning with Centroidal Power Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive binning is a crucial step in the analysis of large astronomical datasets, such as those from integral-field spectroscopy, to ensure a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for reliable model fitting. However, the widely used Voronoi-binning method and its variants suffer from two key limitations: they scale poorly with data size, often as O(N^2), creating a computational bottleneck for modern surveys, and they can produce undesirable non-convex or disconnected bins. I introduce PowerBin, a new algorithm that overcomes these issues. I frame the binning problem within the theory of optimal transport, for which the solution is a Centroidal Power Diagram (CPD), guaranteeing convex bins. Instead of formal CPD solvers, which are unstable with real data, I develop a fast and robust heuristic based on a physical analogy of packed soap bubbles. This method reliably enforces capacity constraints even for non-additive measures like S/N with correlated noise. I also present a new bin-accretion algorithm with O(N log N) complexity, removing the previous bottleneck. The combined PowerBin algorithm scales as O(N log N), making it about two orders of magnitude faster than previous methods on million-pixel datasets. I demonstrate its performance on a range of simulated and real data, showing it produces high-quality, convex tessellations with excellent S/N uniformity. The public Python implementation provides a fast, robust, and scalable tool for the analysis of modern astronomical data.</description>

      <title>Flight of Dynamic Targeting on the CogniSAT-6 Spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic targeting (DT) is a spacecraft autonomy concept in which sensor data is acquired and rapidly analyzed and used to drive subsequent observation. We describe the low Earth orbit application of this approach in which lookahead imagery is analyzed to detect clouds, thermal anomalies, or land use cases to drive higher quality near nadir imaging. Use cases for such a capability include: cloud avoidance, storm hunting, search for planetary boundary layer events, plume study, and beyond. The DT concept requires a lookahead sensor or agility to use a primary sensor in such a mode, edge computing to analyze images rapidly onboard, and a primary followup sensor. Additionally, an inter-satellite or low latency communications link can be leveraged for cross platform tasking. We describe implementation in progress to fly DT in early 2025 on the CogniSAT-6 (Ubotica/Open Cosmos) spacecraft that launched in March 2024 on the SpaceX Transporter-10 launch.</description>

      <title>The Open mulTiwavelength Transient Event Repository (OTTER): Infrastructure Release and Tidal Disruption Event Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiwavelength analyses of astrophysical transients are essential for understanding the physics of these events. To make such analyses more efficient and effective, we present the Open mulTiwavelength Transient Event Repository (OTTER), a publicly available catalog of published transient event metadata and photometry. Unlike previous efforts, our data schema is optimized for the storage of multiwavelength photometric datasets spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Open source software, including an application programming interface (API) and web application, are available for viewing, accessing, and analyzing the dataset. For the initial release of OTTER, we present the largest ever photometric archive of tidal disruption events (TDEs), including $\gtrsim 80,000$ observations of 232 TDEs spanning from radio to X-ray wavelengths. We demonstrate the power of this infrastructure through four example analyses of the TDE population. We plan to maintain this dataset as more TDEs are discovered in the future and encourage other users to contribute by uploading newly published data via our web application. The infrastructure was built with the goal of archiving additional transient data (supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, fast blue optical transients, fast radio bursts, etc.) in the future. The web application is available at https://otter.idies.jhu.edu and the API documentation is available at https://astro-otter.readthedocs.io.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST DREAMS: NIRSpec/PRISM Transmission Spectroscopy of the Habitable Zone Planet TRAPPIST-1 e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TRAPPIST-1 e is one of the very few rocky exoplanets that is both amenable to atmospheric characterization and that resides in the habitable zone of its star -- located at a distance from its star such that it might, with the right atmosphere, sustain liquid water on its surface. Here, we present a set of 4 JWST/NIRSpec PRISM transmission spectra of TRAPPIST-1 e obtained from mid to late 2023. Our transmission spectra exhibit similar levels of stellar contamination as observed in prior works for other planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system (Lim et al, 2023; Radica et al., 2024), but over a wider wavelength range, showcasing the challenge of characterizing the TRAPPIST-1 planets even at relatively long wavelengths (3-5 um). While we show that current stellar modeling frameworks are unable to explain the stellar contamination features in our spectra, we demonstrate that we can marginalize over those features instead using Gaussian Processes, which enables us to perform novel exoplanet atmospheric inferences with our transmission spectra. In particular, we are able to rule out cloudy, primary H$_2$-dominated ($\gtrsim$ 80$\%$ by volume) atmospheres at better than a 3$\sigma$ level. Constraints on possible secondary atmospheres on TRAPPIST-1 e are presented in a companion paper (Glidden et al., 2025). Our work showcases how JWST is breaking ground into the precisions needed to constrain the atmospheric composition of habitable-zone rocky exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Site Evaluation and Cost Estimation for Cosmic Explorer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic Explorer (CE) is a proposed next generation gravitational-wave observatory that would be sited in the United States. As of 2025, CE is in its design phase, with plans to begin operations in the 2030s together with the Einstein Telescope in Europe. CE's reference design consists of two widely separated L-shaped detectors, one with 20km arms and one with 40km arms, each based on technology proven by the National Science Foundation's highly successful Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). There are unique challenges associated with identifying locations suitable for hosting Cosmic Explorer in the conterminous United States, not least of which is the order of magnitude upscaling of the observatory with respect to the 4km LIGO observatories. Cosmic Explorer's approach to site evaluation integrates physical, social and cultural criteria. Here we present improvements to the Cosmic Explorer Location Search (CELS) code used to identify and assess locations where CE would have low construction costs incurred by the geology, geography and topography of the land. We also report on efforts to integrate astrophysical requirements established by the Cosmic Explorer Science Traceability Matrix into the site evaluation process. National-level results are presented and combined with results from a related National Suitability Analysis to provide a list of locations that are preliminarily promising for a 40km CE.</description>

      <title>Updated comparison of the UHECR energy spectra measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger and Telescope Array joint Working Group on the UHECR energy spectrum was established in 2012 to analyze energy scale uncertainties in both experiments and to in vestigate their systematic differences, particularly in the spectral shape of the flux measurements. Previous studies have indeed shown that, within systematic uncertainties, the energy s pectra measured by the two observatories are consistent below~$10\,\mathrm{EeV}$. However, at higher energies, a significant difference remains. In this work, we re-examine this discrepan cy in greater detail and explore its possible origins. We consider systematic and statistical uncertainties, including the conversion from directly measured observables to energy and the calculation of exposures. We present an updated energy scale comparison between the two experiments and updated flux measurements in the common declination band.</description>

      <title>Segmentation and Tracking of Eruptive Solar Phenomena with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar eruptive events are complex phenomena, which most often include coronal mass ejections (CME), CME-driven compressive and shock waves, flares, and filament eruptions. CMEs are large eruptions of magnetized plasma from the Sun's outer atmosphere or corona, that propagate outward into the interplanetary space. Over the last several decades a large amount of remote solar eruption observational data has become available from ground-based and space-borne instruments. This has recently required the development of software approaches for automated characterisation of eruptive features. Most solar feature detection and tracking algorithms currently in use have restricted applicability and complicated processing chains, while complexity in engineering machine learning (ML) training sets limit the use of data-driven approaches for tracking or solar eruptive related phenomena. Recently, we introduced Wavetrack - a general algorithmic method for smart characterization and tracking of solar eruptive features. The method, based on a-trous wavelet decomposition, intensity rankings and a set of filtering techniques, allows to simplify and automate image processing and feature tracking. Previously, we applied the method successfully to several types of remote solar observations. Here we present the natural evolution of this approach. We discuss various aspects of applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques towards segmentation of high-dynamic range heliophysics observations. We trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image segmentation models using feature masks obtained from the Wavetrack code. We present results from pre-trained models for segmentation of solar eruptive features and demonstrate their performance on a set of CME events based on SDO/AIA instrument data.</description>

      <title>Dissociative recombination of NeH+ with low-energy electrons: Multichannel quantum defect theory including non-adiabatic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical investigation of the dissociative recombination (DR) of NeH+ with low-energy electrons in the regime where the process occurs without direct potential energy curve crossings is presented. The calculations are performed using multichannel quantum defect theory, incorporating non-adiabatic couplings between electronic states. Unlike the previous treatment of the DR of HeH+, where only first-order radial couplings A(R) were considered, our formulation also incorporates the second-order terms B(R), together with a radial density of states \b{eta}{\nu} (R) to describe the transition into the ionization continuum. This development uses a large number of potential energy curves and non-adiabatic couplings of NeH characterized by us previously, enabling a consistent modeling of the DR process. The resulting cross sections show good agreement with the available experimental data and fill a gap in theoretical data below 4.5 eV, where no detailed quantum calculations are currently available.</description>

      <title>Equality of ADM mass and generalized Komar energy in asymptotically-flat dynamical spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find a relation between the ADM mass and a generalized Komar energy in asymptotically-flat spacetime. We do not need to assume the existence of either a Killing or even asymptotically-Killing vector field. Instead, our generalized Komar energy is constructed from the normal evolution vector (the lapse function times the future-directed unit normal to the spacelike hypersurfaces on which the ADM mass is measured). We find equality between the ADM mass and this generalized Komar energy even for dynamical asymptotically-flat spacetimes provided the 3-dimensional Einstein tensor drops off quickly enough at spatial infinity, in particular, whenever ${}^{(3)}G_{ij}=o(r^{-3})$. No additional assumptions are required for equality. As this generalized energy is fully covariant, it may provide a powerful tool for analyzing energy content in dynamical spacetimes containing compact objects.</description>

      <title>An updated catalog of HIRES/Keck radial velocity measurements. Including Ca II H&amp;K measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first HIRES/Keck precision radial velocity (RV) catalog was released in 2017; it was followed by a second release in 2019, which incorporated corrections for small but significant systematic errors. The manifestation of stellar activity accompanied by systematic errors could affect the detection of exoplanets via the RV method. We expanded the HIRES catalog to March 2023 using publicly available spectra. Furthermore, we included the chromospheric emission line Ca II H&amp;K indicator ($R_{\mathrm{HK}}^\prime$), which is among the most prominent tracers of stellar activity. The precision RVs were obtained using an iodine gas absorption cell and corrected for minor systematic errors. $R_{\mathrm{HK}}^\prime$ measurements were derived by rectifying the observed spectra with PHOENIX synthetic spectra models in six narrow bands surrounding the H and K lines, then subtracting the photospheric contribution. We present an updated HIRES/Keck precision RV catalog featuring 78,920 RV measurements for 1,702 stars. High-quality $R_{\mathrm{HK}}^\prime$ measurements are provided for ~ 40% of the HIRES catalog. The updated catalog can help distinguish stellar activity effects from planetary signals in RV time series, thereby corroborating previously detected planetary candidates and aiding in the detection of new ones.</description>

Abstract: The recent discovery of a third interstellar object (ISO) 3I/ATLAS, following 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, has raised questions about the nature and origin of these enigmatic objects. With the Vera C. Rubin Observatory expected to discover dozens of new ISOs over the next decade, it is timely to use a classification scheme for their nature in the context of the recently proposed Loeb scale. Here, we provide a formalism for ranking ISOs quantitatively on the Loeb Scale in analogy to Sagan's formalism for mapping the Kardashev scale based on the energy output of technological civilizations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Constraints on a Population of Massive Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate dynamical constraints on the population of large interstellar objects (ISOs) by combining encounter rate analysis, Eddington inversion, and Liouville mapping. Encounter rate scaling demonstrates that detections of kilometer-scale ISOs require flux enhancements beyond natural Maxwellian expectations. Using Eddington inversion, we show how steep density profiles imply phase-space biases consistent with strong gravitational focusing and we then develop a Liouville mapping formalism that propagates the interstellar velocity distribution inward under conservation of energy and angular momentum, revealing that low-angular momentum anisotropies can reproduce the observed size dependent detection rates. These results provide a self consistent dynamical framework for interpreting the observed population of ISOs and for assessing whether the required anisotropies arise from natural or artificial origins. The main results are framed in the context of the parameters for 3I/ATLAS, but the implications are general and go on to sharpen the distinction between natural dynamical mechanisms and potential artificial origins for ISOs.</description>

      <title>Learning to detect continuous gravitational waves: an open data-analysis competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report results of a public data-analysis challenge, hosted on the open data-science platform Kaggle, to detect simulated continuous gravitational-wave signals. These are weak signals from rapidly spinning neutron stars that remain undetected despite extensive searches. The competition dataset consisted of a population of CW signals using both simulated and real LIGO detector data matching the conditions of actual CW searches. The competition attracted more than 1,000 participants to develop realistic CW search algorithms. We describe the top 10 approaches and discuss their applicability as a pre-processing step compared to standard CW-search approaches. For the competition's dataset, we find that top approaches can reduce the computing cost by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude at a 2% dismissal probability. Additionally, the competition drove the development of new GPU-accelerated detection pipelines and extended CW-inspired statistics to other domains. We release the associated dataset, which constitutes the first open standardized benchmark for CW detection, to enable reproducible method comparisons and to encourage further developments toward the first detection of these elusive signals.</description>

      <title>Dense photometry validation of super-fast-rotating asteroid candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-fast rotators (SFRs; P &lt; 2.2 hr) are of great importance in asteroid studies; yet, many reported detections suffer from aliasing caused by an insufficient observation cadence. We present dense CCD photometry for 15 SFRs candidates (14 after excluding 11219 Benbohn, whose published period already exceeds the spin barrier) observed from 2023 Aug 11 to 2024 Aug 11 with the 1.5 m Sierra Nevada and 1.4 m AS Vidojevica telescopes. Our dataset comprises approximately 2,400 calibrated data points, with per-measurement formal errors of 0.02-0.04 mag and total on-target coverage of 2-13 hr per object. We have reliably determined periods for 9 targets. In terms of spin rate, we have confirmed four SFRs with periods of 1.06-1.84 hr and peak-to-peak amplitudes of 0.054-0.685 mag. Three candidates remain ambiguous, while the rest are reclassified, showing the best solutions with periods greater than 2.5 hr. By extrapolating from our confirmation rate (4/14) to the 3.9 percent occurrence rate found in the Light Curve Database (LCDB) yields a central SFR fraction of 1.1 percent, with a one-sigma lower bound of 0.6 percent among kilometre-scale asteroids.</description>

      <title>Gas mixing through a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport and mixing of gas species are of particular interest in planetary environments, where interactions among multiple species can occur within confined or porous media. In this work, we present a novel Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) approach for modeling the mixing of binary gas species. The model treats each gas as a separate fluid governed by its own set of Euler equations, coupled through collisional momentum and energy exchange terms derived from a kinetic relaxation model based on the Boltzmann equation. The numerical scheme employs a first-order operator splitting approach combined with a two-step Euler integrator. In this setup, the hydrodynamic evolution is first computed using standard SPH techniques to handle pressure forces. This is followed by a separate correction step that accounts for interspecies collisional exchanges. Such a decoupled treatment enables the use of a larger timestep dictated by hydrodynamics rather than the typically much smaller collisional timescale, enhancing computational efficiency. The model achieves good accuracy in reproducing the equilibration of density and temperature in a range of molecular mass ratios. Its modular structure supports natural extensions to polyatomic mixtures and enables the inclusion of additional physics, such as gas-solid interactions with dust and ice. These features make the method particularly well-suited for applications involving confined, multi-component gas systems, such as those expected during the ESA ExoMars mission.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Burst Polarimetry with the POLAR and POLAR-2 missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma-Ray Bursts are among the most powerful and violent events in the Universe. Despite over half a century of observations of these transient sources, many open questions remain about their nature and the physical emission mechanisms at play. Polarization measurements of the GRB prompt gamma-ray emission have long been theorized to be able to answer most of these questions. Early polarization measurements did not allow to draw clear conclusions because of limited significance.
  With the aim of better characterizing the polarization of these prompt emissions, a compact Gamma-Ray polarimeter called POLAR has been sent to space as part of the Tiangong-2 Chinese space lab for 6 months of operations starting September 2016. The instrument detected 55 GRBs as well as several pulsars. Time-integrated polarization analysis of the 14 brightest detected GRBs has shown that the prompt emission is lowly polarized or fully unpolarized. However, time-resolved analysis depicted strong hints of an evolving polarization angle within single pulses, washing out the polarization degree in time-integrated analyses. Energy-resolved polarization analysis has shown no constraining results due to limited statistics. Hence, a more sensitive $\gamma$-ray polarimeter is required to perform detailed energy and time-resolved polarization analysis of the prompt gamma-ray emission of GRBs.
  Based on the success of the POLAR mission, a larger-scale instrument, approved for launch to the China Space Station (CSS) in 2027, is currently being developed by a Swiss, Chinese, Polish, and German collaboration. Thanks to its large sensitivity in the 20-800~keV range, POLAR-2 will produce polarization measurements of at least 50 GRBs per year with a precision equal to or higher than the best results published by POLAR, allowing for good quality time and energy resolved analysis.</description>

      <title>Magnetic, thermal and rotational evolution of isolated neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong magnetic fields of neutron stars are closely linked to their observed thermal, spectral, and timing properties, such as the distribution of spin periods and their derivatives. To understand the evolution of astrophysical observables over time, it is essential to develop robust theoretical frameworks and numerical models that solve the coupled thermal and magnetic field evolution equations, incorporating detailed microphysical inputs like thermal and electrical conductivities and neutrino emission rates. These efforts are key to uncovering how the strength and geometry of magnetic fields change with age, ultimately shedding light on the diverse phenomenology of neutron stars. In this review, we outline the fundamental theory underlying magneto-thermal evolution models, with an emphasis on numerical methods and a comprehensive set of benchmark tests intended to guide current and future code development. We revisit established results from axisymmetric simulations, highlight recent progress in fully three-dimensional models, and offer a perspective on the anticipated developments in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Fractal Aggregate Aerosols in the Virga Cloud Code I: Model Description and Application to a Benchmark Cloudy Exoplanet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce new functionality to treat fractal aggregate aerosol particles within the Virga cloud modeling framework. Previously, the open source cloud modeling code Virga (Batalha et al. 2025), the Python version of EddySed (Ackerman &amp; Marley, 2001), assumed spherical particles to compute particle mass and size distributions throughout the atmosphere. The initial release of Virga also assumed spherical particles to compute Mie scattering properties, which include the single scattering albedo, asymmetry parameter, and optical depth as a function of particle radius and composition. However, extensive evidence from Solar system aerosols, astrophysical disks and dust, and Earth climate studies suggests that non-spherical aggregate particles are common compared to idealized compact spherical particles. Following recent advances in microphysical and opacity modeling, we implement a simple parametrization for dynamical and optical (modified mean field theory) effects of fractal aggregate particles into Virga. We then use this new functionality to perform a case study using basic planetary parameters similar to the well-characterized, aerosol-laden mini-Neptune GJ 1214 b, using KCl clouds made of aggregate particles. We choose KCl to most directly explore comparisons to previous studies. We demonstrate 1) how our method compares to previous fractal aggregate particle treatments and 2) how our new fractal treatment affects theoretical spectra of cloudy atmospheres. Overall, our model is faster and more flexible for a wider range of parameter space than previous studies. We explore the limitations of our modeling set-up and offer guidance for future investigations using our framework.</description>

      <title>Direct Detection of Known Exoplanets in Reflected Light: Predicting Sky Position with Literature Orbit Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of ground- and space-based observatories will enable direct imaging and characterization of cold, mature planets through thermal emission and, for the first time, reflected light detection. Known RV and astrometrically detected planets provide a known population for detection and characterization observations. However, many of the most promising targets lack orbital parameters of sufficient precision to confidently predict their location on relative to the star for a direct imaging campaign. We have developed \texttt{projecc}, an open source Python package designed to generate sky-plane planet location posteriors from literature orbit solutions. This tool aims to facilitate community preparation for direct imaging observations of known planets. In this work we describe \texttt{projecc} and use it to examine two case study systems relevant to reflected light imaging with ELTs: GJ~876~b, which we find has a well-constrained prediction, and Proxima Centauri b, whose location remains highly uncertain.%, as well as one potential target for \textsl{Roman} CGI, HD~219134~h, which we estimate has a 40\% probability of being in a detectable sky location at any given time. We provide a web app for exploring reflected light planet targets and their orbit solutions, including predictions from literature for 17 additional planets, located at https://reflected-light-planets.streamlit.app/. We also discuss future upgrades to \texttt{projecc}.</description>

      <title>Unlocking 21cm Cosmology with SBI: A Beginner friendly NRE for Inference of Astrophysical Parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen is a promising probe of the early Universe, yet extracting astrophysical parameters from its power spectrum remains a major challenge. We present a beginner-friendly PyTorch pipeline for Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (MNRE), a Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) method that bypasses explicit likelihoods. Using 21cmFAST simulations, we show that MNRE can recover key astrophysical parameters such as the ionizing efficiency $\zeta$ and X-ray luminosity $L_X$ directly from power spectra. Our implementation prioritizes transparency and accessibility, offering a practical entry point for new researchers in 21-cm cosmology.</description>

      <title>Edges In Coadded Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how discontinuities in the point spread function (PSF) and image noise affect weak gravitational lensing shear measurements. Our focus is on discontinuities that arise in coadded images, particularly when edges from input images cross the coadd region. Using Metacalibration and Metadetection for shear calibration and a simple weighted mean coaddition, we find no significant biases for typical galaxy populations, typical edge hit rates (a few percent), or coadds with tens to hundreds of input images. Biases exceeding requirements for large lensing surveys occur only in extreme conditions: (a) coadds with just two input images, (b) an image edge crosses the object in about 25% of coadds, (c) PSF size variations greater than 25%, and (d) relatively small galaxies. Even in these extreme cases, accurate shear recovery is achievable by identifying and removing problematic measurements. We use a simple statistic which quantifies the relative variation in PSF size across each object.</description>

      <title>Black hole accretion, star formation, and chemical evolution with PRIMA/FIRESS spectroscopy: toward the cosmic noon and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) will deliver the first comprehensive view of the obscured side of star formation and black hole accretion that dominates galaxy growth at cosmic noon. Around 90% of UV/optical photons from young stars and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are absorbed by dust and reradiated in the mid- to far-infrared, where key diagnostic lines trace accretion, star formation, and the physical and chemical conditions of galaxies. PRIMA will conduct blind spectroscopic surveys out to $z \sim 3-4$, enabling an unbiased determination of the co-evolution of star formation and black hole growth with cosmic time.
  We simulate a 200 arcmin$^2$ blind spectroscopic survey with FIRESS to measure star formation and black hole accretion rates for hundreds of galaxies at cosmic noon. Follow-up observations will provide relative N/O abundances and N/O-independent metallicities from multiple mid-IR lines. In its high-resolution mode, FIRESS will probe feedback processes through P-Cygni profiles, blueshifted OH absorption, and emission-line wings from highly ionised gas.
  Beyond cosmic noon, PRIMA will pioneer rest-frame mid-IR spectroscopy of galaxies during reionisation. Bright high-ionisation lines will constrain the primary ionising continuum of luminous Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters and low-metallicity AGN, revealing the conditions that shaped the first galaxies and black holes. By bridging the gap between optical and radio facilities, PRIMA will deliver an unobscured, end-to-end view of the processes driving galaxy evolution from the earliest epochs to the peak of activity.</description>

Abstract: Scheduled for launch in 2030, the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarization (eXTP) telescope is a Chinese space-based mission aimed at studying extreme conditions and phenomena in astrophysics. eXTP will feature three main payloads: Spectroscopy Focusing Arrays (SFAs), Polarimetry Focusing Arrays (PFAs), and a Wide-field Camera (W2C). This white paper outlines observatory science, incorporating key scientific advances and instrumental changes since the publication of the previous white paper [1]. We will discuss perspectives of eXTP on the research domains of flare stars, supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, cataclysmic variables, X-ray binaries, ultraluminous X-ray sources, AGN, and pulsar-based positioning and timekeeping.</description>

      <title>The ATLAS Virtual Research Assistant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Virtual Research Assistant (VRA) of the ATLAS sky survey which performs preliminary eyeballing on our clean transient data stream. The VRA uses Histogram Based Gradient Boosted Decision Tree Classifiers trained on real data to score incoming alerts on two axes: "Real" and "Galactic". The alerts are then ranked using a geometric distance such that the most "Real" and "Extra-galactic" receive high scores; the scores are updated when new light curve data is obtained on subsequent visits. To assess the quality of the training we use the Recall at rank K, which is more informative to our science goal than general metrics such as accuracy or F1-Scores. We also establish benchmarks for our metric based on the pre-VRA eyeballing strategy, to ensure our models provide notable improvements before being added to the ATLAS pipeline. Finally, policies are defined on the ranked list to select the most promising alerts for humans to eyeball and to automatically remove the bogus alerts. In production the VRA method has resulted in a reduction in eyeballing workload by 85% with a loss of follow-up opportunity &lt;0.08%. It also allows us to automatically trigger follow-up observations with the Lesedi telescope, paving the way to automated methods that will be required in the era of LSST. inally, this is a demonstration that feature-based methods remain extremely relevant in our field, being trainable on only a few thousand samples and highly interpretable; they also offer a direct way to inject expertise into models through feature engineering</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal Eye is a space-based all-sky monitor optimized for the autonomous detection and localization of transients in the 10 keV to 30 MeV energy range, a region where extensive observations and monitoring of various astrophysical phenomena are required. By focusing on the operating environment and its impact on the observation process, we optimized the detector design and assessed its scientific potential. We explored the use of novel techniques to achieve the science goals of the experiment. We assumed the orbit of a potential future mission at approximately 550 km altitude near the equatorial region with a 20{\deg} inclination. In such an orbit, the main background contributions for this kind of detector are from different particles and radiation of cosmic origin and secondaries produced by their interaction in the Earth's atmospheric and geomagnetic environment. We studied the response of the detector in this background environment, using the Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit. We also calculated other detector performance parameters to estimate its scientific capabilities. The detector effective area and efficiency are calculated for low energy gamma-ray sources and used to estimate its sensitivity to short-duration transient sources. The calculation shows a better effective area and sensitivity by several factors compared to existing instruments of similar type. A method is also developed and discussed to estimate the online transient-localization performance of the detector, suggesting a better localization precision by about an order of magnitude than those typically reported by existing gamma-ray monitors. We present here the simulation study and results of an innovative detector design concept that can make a significant contribution in the multi-messenger era. Moreover, this study can be useful as a technical reference for similar future experiments.</description>

      <title>Seeing and Meteorological Analysis at the North-1 and North-2 Points of Muztagh-Ata Site on the Pamir Plateau</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To support the selection of large optical/infrared telescope sites in western China, long-term monitoring of atmospheric conditions and astronomical seeing has been conducted at the Muztagh-Ata site on the Pamir Plateau since 2017. With the monitoring focus gradually shifting northward, three stations were established: the South Point, North-1 point, and North-2 point. The North-1 point,selected as the site for the Muztagh-Ata 1.93 m Synergy Telescope (MOST), has recorded seeing and meteorological parameters since late 2018. In 2023,the North-2 point was established approximately 1.5 km northeast of North-1 point as a candidate location for a future large-aperture telescope. A 10m DIMM tower and a PC-4A environmental monitoring system were installed to evaluate site quality. This study presents a comparative analysis of data from the North-1 and North-2 points during 2018-2024.The median seeing is 0.89 arcsecs at North-1 and 0.78 arcsecs at North-2. Both points show clear seasonal and diurnal variations,with winter nights offering optimal observing conditions.On average, about 64% of the nighttime duration per year is suitable for astronomical observations. Nighttime temperature variation is low :2.03 at North-1 and 2.10 at North-2 .Median wind speeds are 5-6 m/s, with dominant directions between 210 and 300, contributing to stable airflow. Moderate wind suppresses turbulence, while strong shear and rapid fluctuations degrade image quality. These findings confirm that both the North-1 and North-2 points offer high-quality atmospheric conditions and serve as promising sites for future ground-based optical/infrared telescopes in western China.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropy numerical solution (CMBAns) I: An introduction to $C_l$ calculation</title>

Abstract: Cosmological Boltzmann codes are often used by researchers for calculating the CMB angular power spectra from different theoretical models, for cosmological parameter estimation, etc. Therefore, the accuracy of a Boltzmann code is of utmost importance. Different Markov Chain Monte Carlo based parameter estimation algorithms typically require $10^3 - 10^4$ iterations of Boltzmann code. This makes the time complexity of such codes another critical factor. In the last two decades, several Boltzmann packages, such as CMBFAST, CAMB, CMBEasy, CLASS etc., have been developed. In this paper, we present a new cosmological Boltzmann code, CMBAns, that can be used for accurate calculation of the CMB power spectrum and BipoSH coefficients. At present, CMBAns is developed for a flat background matrix. It is mostly written in the C language. However, we borrowed the concept of class from C++. This gives researchers the flexibility to develop their own independent package based on CMBAns, without an in-depth understanding of the source code. We also develop multiple stand-alone facilities which can be directly compiled and run on a given parameter set. In this paper, we discuss all the mathematical formulation, approximation schemes, integration methods etc., that are used in CMBAns. The package will be made available through github for public use in the near future.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Eddington and Malmquist Biases in Latent-Inclination Inference of the Tully-Fisher Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tully-Fisher relation is a vital distance indicator, but its precise inference is challenged by selection bias, statistical bias, and uncertain inclination corrections. This study presents a Bayesian framework that simultaneously addresses these issues. To eliminate the need for individual inclination corrections, inclination is treated as a latent variable with a known probability distribution. To correct for the distance-dependent Malmquist bias arising from sample selection, the model incorporates Gaussian scatter in the dependent variable, the distribution of the independent variable, and the observational selection function into the data likelihood. To mitigate the statistical bias -- termed the ``general Eddington bias'' -- caused by Gaussian scatter and the non-uniform distribution of the independent variable, two methods are introduced: (1) analytical bias corrections applied to the dependent variable before likelihood computation, and (2) a dual-scatter model that accounts for Gaussian scatter in the independent variable within the likelihood function. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated using simulated datasets. By rigorously addressing selection and statistical biases in a latent-variable regression analysis, this work provides a robust approach for unbiased distance estimates from standardizable candles, which is critical for improving the accuracy of Hubble constant determinations.</description>

      <title>Observing the Sun with the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST): Forecasting Full-disk Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionised the field of solar millimetre astronomy with its high angular resolution and cadence. However, with a limited field of view (FOV), targeted observations of highly dynamic phenomena such of flares are challenging. A large aperture single-dish telescope with a large FOV, such as the future Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), would prove useful in observing such phenomena, as one could scan the full solar disk on shorter timescales. We aimed to explore what FOVs, detector counts, and scan strategies are suitable for AtLAST to push the required full-disk scan times below 1 minute, enabling regular observations of dynamic solar phenomena. Utilising the maria code, we were able to simulate solar observations with AtLAST, and thoroughly explored how instrumental properties and scanning strategies affect the full-disk observations in the planned frequency bands. We find the double-circle scan pattern, currently employed at ALMA for full-disk mapping to also be an acceptable way of scanning the Sun with AtLAST. Using small to intermediately sized instruments (1000 - 50,000 detector elements), the estimated observational cadence would be less than 1 minute across AtLAST's frequency range with a reasonable pixel spacing. Using instruments with larger FOVs ($\gtrapprox 0.25^\circ$, equivalent to $\gtrapprox$ 1 R$_\odot$), we find a simple circular scan to be more efficient, achieving cadences on second time scales, but requiring more detector elements ($\gtrapprox$ 100,000). We find that a large FOV single-dish telescope such as AtLAST could provide the solar millimetre community with hitherto unachievable observations, namely full-disk observations at high cadence and adequate resolution. With cadences potentially down to seconds, such an instrument would be ideal in the study of quickly evolving solar phenomena.</description>

      <title>The enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission - eXTP for launch in 2030</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present the current status of the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission, which has been fully approved for launch in 2030. eXTP is a space science mission designed to study fundamental physics under extreme conditions of matter density, gravity, and magnetism. The mission aims at determining the equation of state of matter at supra-nuclear density, measuring the effects of quantum electro-dynamics, and understanding the dynamics of matter in strong-field gravity. In addition to investigating fundamental physics, the eXTP mission is poised to become a leading observatory for time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy in the 2030's, as well as providing observations of unprecedented quality on a variety of galactic and extragalactic objects. After briefly introducing the history and a summary of the scientific objectives of the eXTP mission, this paper presents a comprehensive overview of: 1) the cutting-edge technology, technical specifications, and anticipated performance of the mission's scientific instruments; 2) the full mission profile, encompassing spacecraft design, operational capabilities, and ground segment infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Sampler-free gravitational wave inference using matrix multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter estimation (PE) for compact binary coalescence (CBC) events observed by gravitational wave (GW) laser interferometers is a core task in GW astrophysics. We present a method to compute the posterior distribution efficiently without relying on stochastic samplers. First, we show how to select sets of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that efficiently cover the relevant phase space. We then show how to compute the likelihood for all combinations of these parameters using dot products. We describe how to assess and tune the integration accuracy, making the outcome predictable and adaptable to different applications. The low computational cost allows full PE in minutes on a single CPU, with the potential for further acceleration using multiple CPUs or GPUs. We implement this method in the $\texttt{dot-PE}$ package, enabling sensitive searches using the full evidence integral for precessing CBCs and supporting large waveform banks ($\sim10^5$--$10^6$ waveforms), regardless of waveform generation cost.</description>

      <title>One latent to fit them all: a unified representation of baryonic feedback on matter distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and parsimonious quantification of baryonic feedback on matter distribution is of crucial importance for understanding both cosmology and galaxy formation from observational data. This is, however, challenging given the large discrepancy among different models of galaxy formation simulations, and their distinct subgrid physics parameterizations. Using 5,072 simulations from 4 different models covering broad ranges in their parameter spaces, we find a unified 2D latent representation. Compared to the simulations and other phenomenological models, our representation is independent of both time and cosmology, much lower-dimensional, and disentangled in its impacts on the matter power spectra. The common latent space facilitates the comparison of parameter spaces of different models and is readily interpretable by correlation with each. The two latent dimensions provide a complementary representation of baryonic effects, linking black hole and supernova feedback to distinct and interpretable impacts on the matter power spectrum. Our approach enables developing robust and economical analytic models for optimal gain of physical information from data, and is generalizable to other fields with significant modeling uncertainty.</description>
