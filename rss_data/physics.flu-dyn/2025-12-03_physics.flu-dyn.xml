      <title>Numerical Solution to the Riemann Problem for a Liquid-Gas Two-phase Isentropic Flow Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently introduced two-phase flow model by Chun Shen is studied in this work. The model is derived to describe the dynamics of immersed water bubbles in liquid water as carrier. Several assumptions are made to obtain a reduced form of the mathematical model. The established model consists of nonlinear coupled PDEs in which the unknowns are the densities of the liquid and gas phases and the velocity of the liquid phase; these depend on space and time. For numerical purposes a one-dimensional space--time coordinate system $(x,t)$ is considered. Using the Python programming framework, several Riemann-type initial value problems for the two-phase flow model are solved numerically. A comparison of three finite-difference schemes is presented in order to examine their performance: the Lax--Friedrichs scheme, the Lax--Wendroff scheme, and the FORCE scheme. The FORCE scheme is total-variation diminishing (TVD) and monotone and does not create oscillations. As expected, the numerical solution of the Riemann problems consists of combinations of smooth profiles, shock waves, and rarefaction waves.</description>

      <title>Scalable, Cloud-Based Simulations of Blood Flow and Targeted Drug Delivery in Retinal Capillaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the capabilities of cloud computing for large-scale,tightly-coupled simulations of biological fluids in complex geometries, traditionally performed in supercomputing centers. We demonstrate scalable and efficient simulations in the public cloud. We perform meso-scale simulations of blood flow in image-reconstructed capillaries, and examine targeted drug delivery by artificial bacterial flagella (ABFs). The simulations deploy dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) with two software frameworks, Mirheo (developed by our team) and LAMMPS. Mirheo exhibits remarkable weak scalability for up to 512 GPUs. Similarly, LAMMPS demonstrated excellent weak scalability for pure solvent as well as for blood suspensions and ABFs in reconstructed retinal capillaries. In particular, LAMMPS maintained weak scaling above 90% on the cloud for up to 2,000 cores. Our findings demonstrate that cloud computing can support tightly coupled, large-scale scientific simulations with competitive performance.</description>

      <title>Instability triggered by mixed convection in a thin fluid layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the convective stability of a thin, infinite fluid layer with a rectangular cross-section, subject to imposed heat fluxes at the top and bottom and fixed temperature along the vertical sides. The instability threshold depends on the Prandtl number as well as the normalized flux difference ($f$) and decreases with the aspect ratio ($\epsilon$), following a $\epsilon f^{-1}$ power law. Using 3D initial value and 2D eigenvalue calculations, we identify a dominant 3D mode characterized by two transverse standing waves attached to the domain edges. We characterize the dominant mode's frequency and transverse wave number as functions of the Rayleigh number and aspect ratio. An analytical asymptotic solution for the base state in the bulk is obtained, valid over most of the domain and increasingly accurate for lower aspect ratios. A local stability analysis, based on the analytical base state, reveals oscillatory transverse instabilities consistent with the global instability characteristics. The source term for this most unstable mode appears to be interactions between vertical shear and horizontal temperature gradients.</description>

      <title>Singular jets during droplet impact on superhydrophobic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypothesis: The impact of droplets is prevalent in numerous applications, and jetting during droplet impact is a critical process controlling the dispersal and transport of liquid. New jetting dynamics are expected in different conditions of droplet impact on super-hydrophobic surfaces, such as new jetting phenomena, mechanisms, and regimes. Experiments: In this experimental study of droplet impact on super-hydrophobic surfaces, the Weber number and the Ohnesorge number are varied in a wide range, and the impact process is analyzed theoretically. Findings: We identify a new type of singular jets, i.e., singular jets induced by horizontal inertia (HI singular jets), besides the previously studied singular jets induced by capillary deformation (CD singular jets). For CD singular jets, the formation of the cavity is due to the propagation of capillary waves on the droplet surface; while for HI singular jets, the cavity formation is due to the large horizontal inertia of the toroidal edge during the retraction of the droplet after the maximum spreading. Key steps of the impact process are analyzed quantitatively, including the spreading of the droplet, the formation and the collapse of the spire, the formation and retraction of the cavity, and finally the formation of singular jets. A regime map for the formation of singular jets is obtained, and scaling relationships for the transition conditions between different regimes are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Mass transfer and water management in proton exchange membrane fuel cells with a composite foam-rib flow field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass transfer capability of reactants and hydrothermal management is important for the performance and durability of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. In the conventional rib flow field, the oxygen transport is affected by the accumulation of under-rib liquid water which causes excessive concentration loss and limits cell performance. To improve the cell performance, a composite foam-rib flow field structure is proposed by combining the metal foam flow field and the conventional rib flow field. The proposed design is simulated by using a three-dimensional homogeneous non-isothermal numerical model. The results show that the composite foam-rib flow field, by improving the oxygen transfer and water removal capabilities under the ribs, can improve the oxygen concentration and current density without increasing the pumping power, thus improving the cell performance under different conditions. The key parameters of the composite foam-rib flow field are optimized. With the optimal metal foam filling ratio of 0.75 and porosity of 0.85, the peak power density and the limiting current density for the composite foam-rib flow field are higher than the conventional rib flow field by 5.20% and 22.68%.</description>

      <title>Two-phase flow in porous metal foam flow fields of PEM fuel cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Porous metal foam (PMF) flow field is a potential option for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) due to its excellent capabilities in gas distribution and water drainage. However, the gas-liquid two-phase flow in the PMF flow field on the pore scale is still unclear. In this study, we investigate the gas-liquid two-phase flow in the PMF flow field. Film, plug, and ligament flows are found in the hydrophilic PMF flow field, while slug and droplet flows are found in the hydrophobic PMF flow field. The results suggest that optimizing the pore size, increasing the metal foam surface hydrophobicity, and optimizing the operating condition are helpful for the water management of the PMF flow field. The frequency analysis of the pressure drop also shows that the dominant frequency can be used as an indicator to analyze the transition between different flow patterns.</description>

      <title>Regime Maps for Sloshing in Horizontal Cylindrical Tanks Under Vertical Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical sloshing in partially filled fuel tanks can significantly impact vehicle stability and structural integrity, particularly under harmonic accelerations near twice the sloshing natural frequency. In this regime, parametric resonance may arise, with nonlinear free-surface dynamics driving large-amplitude waves, interface break-up, and severe sloshing-induced mixing. In this work, we identify and characterize the distinct sloshing regimes associated with the lowest-frequency parametric instability, specifically when the external forcing frequency approaches twice the lowest natural frequency. Experiments were conducted in a transparent cylindrical tank with diameter D = 134.5 mm and length L = 336.3 mm. This work presents a data-driven approach for regime identification and classification that relies solely on high-speed video recordings and circumvents the need for interface tracking. The method combines prototype-based data labeling with dimensionality reduction via multiscale proper orthogonal decomposition (mPOD) and automatic kernel-based classification. The results are summarized in a dimensionless regime map across three fill ratios, where stable waves, longitudinal and transverse mode shapes, and mode-competition regimes are distinguished. The developed map provides a predictive tool for assessing sloshing-induced loads, supporting structural and operational optimization of fuel systems.</description>

      <title>Ridged geometries induce axial flow vortices in Couette systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A yield stress fluid has a critical stress above which the material starts to flow. Typically, the yield stress behaviour is captured in the Herschel-Bulkley (HB) model, which assumes a constant yield stress as material parameter. It is not clear whether the simultaneous superposition of a flow in an orthogonal direction to the main flow, that displays HB behaviour, affects the yield stress and will make the yield stress either flow rate- or field-dependent. Therefore, it is important to understand how the presence of flow in two orthogonal directions affects the yielding behaviour of the fluid in general. In this work, we showed that wall patterning can be used to generate flow in two orthogonal directions simultaneously. We find that these orthogonal flows measurably affected each other. We induced spatially varying secondary flows by shearing a standard Newtonian fluid and two common yield stress fluids in a rheometer using a concentric cylinder geometry with angled ridges. We measured the normal force as a function of rotation rates for different angled ridges from conventional rheological measurements. We also imaged the flow fields by employing rheo-MRI, to directly measure the penetration depth of the fluids into the rough boundary of the ridged geometry. Finally, we relate the penetration depth to the axial flow for different geometries, at different imposed rotation rates and the fluid type, to show that two flow directions in the yield stress fluids are indeed significantly related to each other.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium modeling of lyotropic liquid crystals: from binary simulations to multi-component theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a thermodynamically consistent theoretical framework for lyotropic liquid crystals (LCs) based on the GENERIC (General Equation for the Non-Equilibrium Reversible-Irreversible Coupling) formalism. This formalism ensures conservation of energy and production of entropy, while coupling concentration, momentum balance, and liquid crystalline order. Starting from a binary nematic-isotropic mixture, we derive a theory for these key variables, which is then extended to multi-component systems.
  The binary equations are solved numerically using a Julia-based solver that relies on an upwind finite-difference scheme, enabling stable and efficient simulations capable of handling multiple time scales while satisfying fundamental mathematical constraints. The results of simulations are consistent with experimental observations of topological core defects in chromonic LCs, as well as flow-driven droplet shape transitions under Couette and Poiseuille flows.
  This work provides a platform for simulations of multi-component lyotropic LCs that can be extended to systems with multiple interfaces, active materials, and materials subject to external fields.</description>

      <title>On the analytical behavior of the $k$--$\omega$ turbulence model in buoyant-driven thermal convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The representation of buoyancy-driven turbulence in Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes models remains unresolved, with no widely accepted standard formulation. A key difficulty is the lack of analytical guidance for incorporating buoyant effects, particularly under unstable stratification. This study derives an analytical solution of the standard $k$--$\omega$ model for Rayleigh--B\'enard convection in an infinite layer, where turbulent kinetic energy is generated solely by buoyancy. The solution provides explicit scaling relations among the Rayleigh ($\Ra$), Prandtl ($\Pran$), and Nusselt ($\Nu$) numbers that capture the simulation trends: $\Nu \sim \Ra^{1/3}\Pran^{1/3}$ for $\Pran \ll 1$ and $\Nu \sim \Ra^{1/3}\Pran^{-0.415}$ for $\Pran \gg 1$. This framework quantifies the discrepancies in the conventional buoyancy treatment and clarifies their origin. Informed by this analysis, the buoyancy-related modelling terms are reformulated to recover the measured $\Nu$--$\Ra$--$\Pran$ trends. Only two dimensionless algebraic functions are introduced, which vanish in the absence of buoyancy, ensuring full compatibility with the standard closure. The corrected model is validated across a range of buoyancy-driven flows, including two-dimensional Rayleigh--B\'enard convection, internally heated convection in two configurations, unstably stratified Couette flow, and vertically heated natural convection with varying aspect ratios. Across all cases, it provides highly accurate predictions.</description>

      <title>Impact of magnetic field gradients on the development of the MRI: Applications to binary neutron star mergers and proto-planetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is widely believed to play a central role in generating large-scale, poloidal magnetic fields during binary neutron star mergers. However, the few simulations that begin with a weak seed magnetic field and capture its growth until saturation predominantly show the effects of small-scale turbulence and winding, but lack convincing evidence of MRI activity. In this work, we investigate how the MRI is affected by the complex magnetic field topologies characteristic of the post-merger phase, aiming to assess the actual feasibility of MRI in such environments. We first derive the MRI instability criterion, as well as expressions for the characteristic wavelength and growth timescale of the fastest-growing modes, under conditions that include significant magnetic field gradients. Our analysis reveals that strong radial magnetic field gradients can impact significantly on the MRI, slowing its growth or suppressing it entirely if large enough. We then apply this extended framework to both idealized analytical disk models and data from a numerical relativity simulation of a long-lived neutron star merger remnant. We find that conditions favourable to MRI growth on astrophysically relevant timescales may occur only in limited regions of the post-merger disk, and only at late times $t\gtrsim 100$ ms after the merger. These results suggest that the MRI plays a limited role in amplifying poloidal magnetic fields in post-merger environments during the first $\mathcal{O}(100)$ms.</description>

      <title>GLOBE: Accurate and Generalizable PDE Surrogates using Domain-Inspired Architectures and Equivariances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce GLOBE, a new neural surrogate for homogeneous PDEs that draws inductive bias from boundary-element methods and equivariant ML. GLOBE represents solutions as superpositions of learnable Green's-function-like kernels evaluated from boundary faces to targets, composed across multiscale branches and communication hyperlayers. The architecture is translation-, rotation-, and parity-equivariant; discretization-invariant in the fine-mesh limit; and units-invariant via rigorous nondimensionalization. An explicit far-field decay envelope stabilizes extrapolation, boundary-to-boundary hyperlayer communication mediates long-range coupling, and the all-to-all boundary-to-target evaluation yields a global receptive field that respects PDE information flow, even for elliptic PDEs.
  On AirFRANS (steady incompressible RANS over NACA airfoils), GLOBE achieves substantial accuracy improvements. On the "Full" split, it reduces mean-squared error by roughly 200x on all fields relative to the dataset's reference baselines, and roughly 50x relative to the next-best-performing model. In the "Scarce" split, it achieves over 100x lower error on velocity and pressure fields and over 600x lower error on surface pressure than Transolver. Qualitative results show sharp near-wall gradients, coherent wakes, and limited errors under modest extrapolation in Reynolds number and angle of attack.
  In addition to this accuracy, the model is quite compact (117k parameters), and fields can be evaluated at arbitrary points during inference. We also demonstrate the ability to train and predict with non-watertight meshes, which has strong practical implications.
  These results show that rigorous physics- and domain-inspired inductive biases can achieve large gains in accuracy, generalizability, and practicality for ML-based PDE surrogates for industrial computer-aided engineering (CAE).</description>

      <title>Onsager Condensation in Chiral Active Matter: Universality of Topological Gas Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a thermodynamic phase transition in chiral active matter. Low-frequency disorder triggers global synchronisation and energy dissipation, while high disorder activates a topological heat pump, generating an inverse energy cascade. This drives the system towards an Onsager dipole, which can be arrested into a metastable vortex glass if dispersion is insufficient to overcome the defect lattice. We propose topological gas dynamics as a universality class governed by the interplay of active disorder and topological sorting, unifying active swarms and classical inviscid fluids.</description>
