      <title>Matrix Fej\'er-Riesz type theorem for a union of an interval and a point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matrix Fej\'er-Riesz theorem characterizes positive semidefinite matrix polynomials on the real line. In the previous work of the second-named author this was extended to the characterization on arbitrary closed semialgebraic sets $K$ in $\mathbb{R}$ by using matrix quadratic modules from real algebraic geometry. In the compact case there is a denominator-free characterization, while in the non-compact case denominators are needed except when $K$ is the whole line, an unbounded interval, a union of two unbounded intervals, and it was conjectured also when $K$ is a union of an unbounded interval and a point or a union of two unbounded intervals and a point. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture by solving the truncated matrix-valued moment problem (TMMP) on a union of a bounded interval and a point. The presented technique for solving the corresponding TMMP can potentially be used to determine degree bounds in the positivity certificates for matrix polynomials on compact sets $K$.</description>

      <title>Relation between semigroup growth and resolvent decay for immediately differentiable semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study rates of growth of $\|AT(t)\|$ as $t \downarrow 0$ for an immediately differentiable $C_0$-semigroup $(T(t))_{t \geq 0}$ with generator $A$. We assume that the resolvent of the semigroup generator decays on the imaginary axis at rates described by functions of positive increase, which enable estimates on scales finer than polynomial ones. First, in the Banach space setting, we present lower and upper bounds for the semigroup growth. Next, we improve the upper estimate for Hilbert space semigroups. Finally, for semigroups of normal operators on Hilbert spaces and multiplication $C_0$-semigroups on $L^p$-spaces, we establish an estimate that exactly captures the asymptotic behavior of $\|AT(t)\|$ as $t \downarrow 0$.</description>

      <title>On some Fr\'echet spaces associated to the functions satisfying Mulholland inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we explore a new growth condition on Young functions, which we call Mulholland condition, pertaining to the mathematician H.P Mulholland, who studied these functions for the first time, albeit in a different context. We construct a non-trivial Young function $\Omega$ which satisfies Mulholland condition and $\Delta_2$-condition. We then associate exotic $F$-norms to the vector space $X_1\oplus X_2$, where $X_1$ and $X_2$ are Banach spaces, using the function $\Omega$. This $F$-spaces contains the Banach space $X_1$ and $X_2$ as a maximal Banach subspace. Further, the Banach envelope $(X_1\oplus X_2,||.||_{\Omega_o})$ of this $F$-space corresponds to the Young function $\Omega_o$ who characteristic function is an asymptotic line to the characteristic function of the Young function $\Omega$. Thus these $F$-spaces serves as "interpolation space" for Banach spaces $X_1$ and $(X_1\oplus X_2, ||.||_{\Omega_o})$ in some sense. These $F$-space are well behaved in regards to Hahn-Banach extension property, which is lacking in classical $F$-spaces like $L^p$ and $H^p$ for $0&lt;p&lt;1$. Towards the end, some direct sums for Orlicz spaces are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a conjugation on a Hilbert space $\cH$. A densely defined linear operator $A$ on $\cH$ is called $C$-symmetric if $CAC\subseteq A^*$ and $C$-self-adjoint if $CAC=A^*$. Our main results describe all $C$-self-adjoint extensions of $A$ on $\cH$. Further, we prove a $C$-self-adjointness criterion based on quasi-analytic vectors and we characterize $C$-self-adjoint operators in terms of their polar decompositions.</description>

      <title>Discrete Spectrum and Spectral Rigidity of a Second-Order Geometric Deformation Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spectral properties of a self-adjoint second-order differential operator $\hat{C}$, defined on the Hilbert space $L^2([-v_c, v_c])$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We derive the discrete spectrum $\{C_n\}$, prove the completeness of the associated eigenfunctions, and establish orthogonality and normalization relations. The analysis follows the classical Sturm--Liouville framework and confirms that the deformation modes $C_n$ form a spectral basis on the compact interval. We further establish a spectral rigidity result: uniform spectral coefficients imply a constant profile $C(v) = \pi$, which does not belong to the Sobolev domain of the operator. These results provide a rigorous foundation for further investigations in spectral geometry and functional analysis.</description>

      <title>The Klein-Gordon equation on asymptotically Minkowski spacetimes: the Feynman propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Feynman propagators for the massive Klein--Gordon equation with asymptotically static perturbations. Building on our previous work on the causal propagators, we employ a framework based on propagation of singularities estimates in Vasy's 3sc-calculus. We combine these estimates to prove global spacetime mapping properties for the Feynman propagator, and to show that it satisfies a microlocal Hadamard condition.
  We show that the Feynman propagator can be realized as the inverse of a mapping between appropriate $L^2$-based Sobolev spaces with additional regularity near the asymptotic sources of the Hamiltonian flow, realized as a family of radial points on a compactified spacetime.</description>

      <title>Schauder-type estimates and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schauder estimates are among the oldest and most useful tools in the modern theory of elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs). Their influence may be felt in practically all applications of the theory of elliptic boundary-value problems, that is, in fields such as nonlinear diffusion, potential theory, field theory or differential geometry and its applications. Schauder estimates give H\"older regularity estimates for solutions of elliptic problems with H\"older continuous data; they may be thought of as wide-ranging generalizations of estimates of derivatives of an analytic function in the interior of its domain of analyticity and play a role comparable to that of Cauchy's theory in function theory. They may be viewed as converses to the mean-value theorem: a bound on the solution gives a bound on its derivatives. Schauder theory has strongly contributed to the modern idea that solving a PDE is equivalent to obtaining an a priori bound that is, trying to estimate a solution before any solution has been constructed. The chapter presents the complete proofs of the most commonly used theorems used in actual applications of the estimates.</description>

      <title>Martingales and Path-Dependent PDEs via Evolutionary Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a semigroup-theoretic framework for the analytic characterisation of martingales with path-dependent terminal conditions. Our main result establishes that a measurable adapted process of the form \[ V(t) - \int_0^t\Psi(s)\, ds \] is a martingale with respect to an expectation operator $\mathbb{E}$ if and only if a time-shifted version of $V$ is a mild solution of a final value problem involving a path-dependent differential operator that is intrinsically connected to $\mathbb{E}$. We prove existence and uniqueness of strong and mild solutions for such final value problems with measurable terminal conditions using the concept of evolutionary semigroups. To characterise the compensator $\Psi$, we introduce the notion of $\mathbb{E}$-derivative of $V$, which in special cases coincides with Dupire's time derivative. We also compare our findings to path-dependent partial differential equations in terms of Dupire derivatives such as the path-dependent heat equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new proof of the completeness of the space $\mathcal{O}_C$ by applying a criterion of compact regularity for the isomorphic sequence space $\lim_{k\rightarrow} (s\hat \otimes (\ell^\infty)_{-k})$. Along the way we show that the strong dual of any quasinormable Fr\'echet space is a compactly regular $\mathcal{LB}$-space. Finally, we prove that $\lim_{k\rightarrow}(E_k\hat \otimes_\iota F) = (\lim_{k\rightarrow} E_k) \hat \otimes_\iota F$ if the inductive limit $\lim_{k \rightarrow}(E_k \hat \otimes_\iota F)$ is compactly regular.</description>

      <title>On norm-attaining positive operators between Banach lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14625v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the norm-attainment of positive operators between Banach lattices. By considering an absolute version of James boundaries, we prove that: If $E$ is a reflexive Banach lattice whose order is given by a basis and $F$ is a Dedekind complete Banach lattice, then every positive operator from $E$ to $F$ is compact if and only if every positive operator from $E$ to $F$ attains its norm. An analogue result considering that $E$ is reflexive and the order in $F$ is continuous and given by a basis was proven. We applied our result to study a positive version of the weak maximizing property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the Schur-Agler class in infinite variables to consist of functions whose restrictions to finite dimensional polydisks belong to the Schur-Agler class. We show that a natural generalization of an Agler decomposition holds and the functions possess transfer function realizations that allow us to extend the functions to the unit ball of $\ell^\infty$. We also give a Pick interpolation type theorem which displays a subtle difference with finitely many variables. Finally, we make a brief connection to Dirichlet series derived from the Schur-Agler class in infinite variables via the Bohr correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the recent generalization of the Hardy--Stein identity to extend the previous Littlewood--Paley estimates to general pure-jump Dirichlet forms. The results generalize those for symmetric pure-jump L\'evy processes in Euclidean spaces. We also relax the assumptions for the Dirichlet form necessary for the estimates used in previous works. To overcome the difficulty that It\^o's formula is not applicable, we employ the theory of Revuz correspondence and additive functionals. Meanwhile, we present a few counterexamples demonstrating that some inequalities do not hold in the generality considered in this paper. In particular, we correct errors that appear in previous works.</description>

      <title>Positive definiteness and Fell bundles over discrete groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a natural concept of positive definiteness for bundle maps between Fell bundles over (possibly different) discrete groups and describe several examples. Such maps induce completely positive maps between the associated full cross-sectional $C^*$-algebras in a functorial way. Under the assumption that the kernel of the homomorphism connecting the groups under consideration is amenable, they also induce completely positive maps between the associated reduced cross-sectional $C^*$-algebras. As an application, we define an approximation property for a Fell bundle over a discrete group which generalizes Exel's approximation property and still implies the weak containment property. Both approximation properties coincide when the unit fibre is nuclear.</description>
