      <title>Why did the dark matter hypothesis supersede modified gravity in the 1980s?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1960s and 1970s a series of observations and theoretical developments highlighted the presence of several anomalies which could, in principle, be explained by postulating one of the following two working hypotheses: (i) the existence of dark matter, or (ii) the modification of standard gravitational dynamics in low accelerations. In the years that followed, the dark matter hypothesis as an explanation for dark matter phenomenology attracted far more attention compared to the hypothesis of modified gravity, and the latter is largely regarded today as a non-viable alternative. The present article takes an integrated history and philosophy of science approach in order to identify the reasons why the scientific community mainly pursued the dark matter hypothesis in the years that followed, as opposed to modified gravity. A plausible answer is given in terms of three epistemic criteria for the pursuitworthiness of a hypothesis: (a) its problem-solving potential, (b) its compatibility with established theories and the feasibility of incorporation, and (c) its independent testability. A further comparison between the problem of dark matter and the problem of dark energy is also presented, explaining why in the latter case the situation is different, and modified gravity is still considered a viable possibility.</description>

      <title>The EPR Paradox of Quantum Mechanics in the Light of Four Unpublished Letters between A. Einstein and the Mathematician J. L. B. Cooper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents correspondence between Albert Einstein and the mathematical analyst J. L. B. Cooper on the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox of quantum theory published in 1935. Two letters written by Cooper, and the replies from Einstein, all written between October and December 1949, are retyped from the original ones. Furthermore, Einstein's second letter, which he wrote in German, is translated into English. The lack of agreement, arising from very different points of view, is analysed, taking into account the complex underlying mathematical and physical factors that arise naturally in connection with the EPR paradox.</description>

      <title>Without microphysical causation, just anything cannot begin to exist just anywhere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the Causal Principle, anything that begins to exist has a cause. In turn, various authors -- including Thomas Hobbes, Jonathan Edwards, and Arthur Prior -- have defended the thesis that, had the Causal Principle been false, there would be no good explanation for why entities do not begin at arbitrary times, in arbitrary spatial locations, in arbitrary number, or of arbitrary kind. I call this the Hobbes-Edwards-Prior Principle (HEPP). However, according to a view popular among both philosophers of physics and naturalistic metaphysicians -- Neo-Russellianism -- causation is absent from fundamental physics. I argue that objections based on the HEPP should have no dialectical force for Neo-Russellians. While Neo-Russellians maintain that there is no causation in fundamental physics, they also have good reason to reject the HEPP.</description>

      <title>La \'Ultima Frontera de La Filosof\'ia: Hacia una S\'intesis de La \'Etica del Futuro a Largo Plazo, el Riesgo Existencial y la Ontolog\'ia Posthumana</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humanity's unprecedented technological capacity and concurrent existential risks reveal a critical lacuna in the philosophical tradition: the absence of a systematic framework for the long-term future. This article argues that formulating such a framework is the central ethical imperative of our era. To defend this thesis, it synthesizes the normative ethics of Hans Jonas and Derek Parfit with the analytical framework of Nick Bostrom's work on existential risk and longtermism. The analysis further addresses the ontological challenge posed by posthumanism to the human 'subject' and explores the functional role of a secular cosmic purpose in motivating long-term action. The paper's main contribution is the articulation of a synthetic research agenda for a prospective philosophy, one that integrates axiology, risk management, and ontology to guide humanity through its perilous technological adolescence.</description>

      <title>What are we talking about when we discuss the Born-Oppenheimer approximation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nick Huggett, James Ladyman, and Karim Thebault (HLT) have presented a comprehensive article examining the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA). Their central objective is to challenge our position on the matter-namely, that the BOA incorporates a classical assumption incompatible with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. In contrast, HLT contend that the BOA involves no such classical assumption and, as a result, supports the view that chemistry can be reduced to physics. The purpose of this paper is to offer a critical analysis of the HLT article and to clarify why we consider their arguments unpersuasive.</description>
