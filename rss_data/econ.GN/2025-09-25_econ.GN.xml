      <title>Recidivism and Peer Influence with LLM Text Embeddings in Low Security Correctional Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find AI embeddings obtained using a pre-trained transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) of 80,000-120,000 written affirmations and correction exchanges among residents in low-security correctional facilities to be highly predictive of recidivism. The prediction accuracy is 30\% higher with embedding vectors than with only pre-entry covariates. However, since the text embedding vectors are high-dimensional, we perform Zero-Shot classification of these texts to a low-dimensional vector of user-defined classes to aid interpretation while retaining the predictive power. To shed light on the social dynamics inside the correctional facilities, we estimate peer effects in these LLM-generated numerical representations of language with a multivariate peer effect model, adjusting for network endogeneity. We develop new methodology and theory for peer effect estimation that accommodate sparse networks, multivariate latent variables, and correlated multivariate outcomes. With these new methods, we find significant peer effects in language usage for interaction and feedback.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the Interpreter: Can We Model post-ECB Conferences Volatility with LLM Agents?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel method to simulate financial market reactions to European Central Bank (ECB) press conferences using Large Language Models (LLMs). We create a behavioral, agent-based simulation of 30 synthetic traders, each with distinct risk preferences, cognitive biases, and interpretive styles. These agents interpret ECB communication and forecast Euro interest rate swap levels at 3-month, 2-year, and 10-year maturities, with cross-sectional variation serving as a measure of market uncertainty. Using a comprehensive dataset of 283 ECB press conferences (1998-2025), we evaluate three prompting strategies: naive zero-shot, few-shot (enriched with historical context), and an advanced iterative 'LLM-as-a-Judge' framework. We find that even the naive approach achieves substantial correlations (roughly 0.5) between synthetic disagreement and actual post-announcement OIS volatility, particularly for medium- and long-term maturities. The 'LLM-as-a-Judge' framework further enhances performance upon initial application, reaching correlations of almost 0.6 and identifying key drivers of volatility. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based agents can effectively capture the heterogeneous interpretive processes through which monetary policy signals propagate to financial markets, moving beyond traditional reduced-form event studies. This provides central banks with a practical tool to ex-ante evaluate communication strategies and anticipate market reactions, while offering researchers a micro-founded framework for understanding expectation formation in response to central bank communication.</description>

      <title>There must be an error here! Experimental evidence on coding errors' biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative research relies heavily on coding, and coding errors are relatively common even in published research. In this paper, we examine whether individuals are more or less likely to check their code depending on the results they obtain. We test this hypothesis in a randomized experiment embedded in the recruitment process for research positions at a large international economic organization. In a coding task designed to assess candidates' programming abilities, we randomize whether participants obtain an expected or unexpected result if they commit a simple coding error. We find that individuals are almost 20% more likely to detect coding errors when they lead to unexpected results. This asymmetry in error detection depending on the results they generate suggests that coding errors may lead to biased findings in scientific research.</description>

      <title>Demand and consumer surplus in the payday-loan market: Evidence from British Columbia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines how interest rate caps affect the demand for payday loans, using aggregate data from British Columbia (2012--2019) during which the province's maximum fee was reduced from \$23 to \$17 and then to \$15 per \$100 borrowed. Estimating a linear demand function via OLS, we find that lowering interest rate caps significantly increases loan demand. We estimate that the \$8 decrease, from \$23 to \$15 per \$100, raised annual consumer surplus by roughly \$28.6 million (2012 CAD). A further reduction to \$14, starting in January 2025, would add another \$3.9 million per year. These results suggest that stricter interest rate caps can yield substantial consumer welfare gains.</description>
