      <title>Colour-electric and colour-magnetic confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basic properties of the confinement mechanism in QCD -- the temperature dependence of the spatial and temporal string tensions ($\sigma_s(T)$ and $\sigma_E(T)$) -- are studied in the framework of the Field Correlator Method (FCM). It is shown that both functions are connected respectively to the spatial and temporal parts of the vacuum gluon energy $\epsilon_s$ and $\epsilon_E$ which define their equal values at $T=0$. However at $T&gt;0$ the spatial part is growing with $T$ while the temporal part is destroyed by the hadronic pressure at $T=T_c$ (the deconfinement). Both properties are derived within the same method and are in a good agreement with the corresponding lattice data.</description>

      <title>Testing the lepton content of the proton at HERA and EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although protons are baryons with an overall vanishing lepton number, they possess a non-trivial leptonic content arising from quantum fluctuations which can be described by lepton parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton. These PDFs have been recently computed and can be used to define lepton-induced processes at high-energy colliders. In this article, we propose a novel way to test the computation of lepton PDFs of the proton by analyzing both non-resonant di-lepton and resonant Z gauge boson production processes induced by leptons within the proton at proton-electron colliders like HERA and EIC. Despite the fact that lepton PDFs of the proton are known to be small, this work demonstrates that both processes imply a measurable yield of events at HERA and EIC, which could be used to test these PDFs.</description>

      <title>Heavy-quark diffusion in 2+1D and Glasma-like plasmas: evidence of a transport peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine how plasma excitations affect the heavy-quark diffusion coefficient in 2+1 dimensional and Glasma-like plasmas, akin to the pre-equilibrium matter describing relativistic heavy-ion collisions at early times. We find that the transport coefficient $2\kappa$ transverse to and $\kappa_z$ along the beam direction display a qualitatively different evolution. We attribute this to the underlying excitation spectra of these systems, thus providing evidence for the existence of non-perturbative properties in the spectrum. This is accomplished by first reconstructing the diffusion coefficients using gauge-fixed correlation functions, which accurately reproduces the time evolution of $2\kappa$ and $\kappa_z$. We then modify these excitation spectra to study the impact of their non-perturbative features on the transport coefficients. In particular, we find evidence for a novel transport peak in the low-frequency spectrum that is crucial for heavy-quark diffusion. We also demonstrate that gluonic excitations are broad while scalar excitations associated with $\kappa_z$ are narrow and strongly enhanced at low momenta. Our findings indicate that the large values and dynamical properties of transport coefficients in the Glasma could originate from genuinely non-perturbative features in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>The Standard Model CP Violation is Enough</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is the Standard Model Charge-Parity (CP) violation ever enough to generate the observed baryon asymmetry? Yes! We introduce a mechanism of baryogenesis (and dark matter production) that can generate the entire observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe using $\textit{only}$ the CP violation within Standard Model systems -- a f\^ete which no other mechanism currently proposed can achieve. Baryogenesis proceeds through a Mesogenesis scenario but with well motivated additional dark sector dynamics: a $\textit{morphon}$ field generates present day mass contributions for the particle mediating the decay responsible for baryogenesis. The effect is an enhancement of baryon production whilst evading present day collider constraints. The CP violation comes entirely from Standard Model contributions to neutral meson systems. Meanwhile, the dark dynamics generate gravitational waves that may be searched for with current and upcoming Pulsar Timing Arrays, as we demonstrate with an example. This mechanism, $\textit{Mesogenesis with a Morphing Mediator}$, motivates probing a new parameter space as well as improving the sensitivity of existing Mesogenesis searches at hadron and electron colliders.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally Misaligned Ultralight Dark Matter and Implications for Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the possibility that dark matter (DM) may be an ultralight scalar that was misaligned via non-minimal coupling to gravity, in the early Universe. For a certain regime of scalar masses, gravitational effects in neutron stars could place interesting bounds on the viable parameter space of the model, even in the absence of non-gravitational interactions between DM and ordinary matter.</description>

      <title>Analytic amplitudes for a pair of Higgs bosons in association with three partons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pair production of Higgs bosons at the LHC can give information about the triple Higgs boson coupling. We perform an analytic one-loop calculation of the amplitudes for a pair of Higgs bosons in association with three partons, retaining the exact dependence on the quark mass circulating in the loop. These amplitudes constitute the real radiation corrections in the calculation of Higgs boson pair production at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling. The results of an analytic generalised-unitarity computation are simplified via analytic reconstruction in spinor variables. Compact ans\"atze for kinematic pole residues are iteratively fitted via $p$-adic evaluations near said poles and subtracted until no pole remains. A new ansatz construction is introduced to minimally parametrise coefficients of amplitudes with multiple massive external legs. The simplified expressions are faster to evaluate than automatic codes and can lead to more stable results near singular regions.</description>

      <title>The photon parton distribution function: updates and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photon parton distribution function (PDF) of the proton is crucial for precise comparisons of LHC cross sections with theoretical predictions. However, it was previously affected by very large uncertainties of around ${\cal O}(100\%)$ or dependent upon phenomenologically inspired models. In the paper~\cite{Manohar:2016nzj}, we demonstrated how the photon PDF could be determined using the proton structure functions $F_2$ and $F_L$ measured in electron--proton scattering experiments. We provided an explicit formula for the PDF, which can be systematically improved order by order in perturbation theory. We obtained a photon PDF with errors $\lesssim 2$\% for $10^{-4} &lt; x &lt; 0.1$. Here, we recall the underlying idea and method used to obtain this result, as well as the progress made since then.</description>

      <title>Improved precision on 2-3 oscillation parameters using the synergy between DUNE and T2HK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-precision measurement of $\Delta m^2_{31}$ and $\theta_{23}$ is inevitable to estimate the Earth's matter effect in long-baseline experiments which in turn plays an important role in addressing the issue of neutrino mass ordering and to measure the value of CP phase in $3\nu$ framework. After reviewing the results from the past and present experiments, and discussing the near-future sensitivities from the IceCube Upgrade and KM3NeT/ORCA, we study the expected improvements in the precision of 2-3 oscillation parameters that the next-generation long-baseline experiments, DUNE and T2HK, can bring either in isolation or combination. We highlight the relevance of the possible complementarities between these two experiments in obtaining the improved sensitivities in determining the deviation from maximal mixing of $\theta_{23}$, excluding the wrong-octant solution of $\theta_{23}$, and obtaining high precision on 2-3 oscillation parameters, as compared to their individual performances. We observe that for the current best-fit values of the oscillation parameters and assuming normal mass ordering (NMO), DUNE + T2HK can establish the non-maximal $\theta_{23}$ and exclude the wrong octant solution of $\theta_{23}$ at around 7$\sigma$ C.L. with their nominal exposures. We find that DUNE + T2HK can improve the current relative 1$\sigma$ precision on $\sin^{2}\theta_{23}~(\Delta m^{2}_{31})$ by a factor of 7 (5) assuming NMO. Also, we notice that with less than half of their nominal exposures, the combination of DUNE and T2HK can achieve the sensitivities that are expected from these individual experiments using their full exposures. We also portray how the synergy between DUNE and T2HK can provide better constraints on ($\sin^2\theta_{23}$ - $\delta_{\mathrm{CP}}$) plane as compared to their individual reach.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Analysis of Singly Heavy Pentaquarks in the Symmetric 15-Plet Representation Using Phenomenological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the ground state pentaquark structures with a single heavy quark ($qqqq\Bar{Q}$) using various phenomenological models. The recent observations of singly heavy tetraquark structures at LHCb serve as a significant motivation for this investigation. We studied the symmetric 15-plet configuration of SU(3) flavor representation with the spin-parity assignment of $5/2^-$, representing the symmetric spin state for the pentaquark systems. We employed an extended Gursey-Radicati mass formula and an effective mass scheme to compute the mass spectra of pentaquark states. Additionally, the methodology of the screened charge scheme is introduced to calculate the magnetic moment assignments, specifically for configurations involving both charm and bottom quarks. We also proposed the potential production modes originating from the weak decay of heavy baryons. We identified the strong decay channels where pentaquark transitions into a light baryon and a heavy meson. Our analysis of mass spectra, magnetic moments, and possible strong decay channels helps us to explore the inner structure of pentaquarks and their underlying quark dynamics. This work not only augments the theoretical frameworks used to describe such systems but is also helpful for future experimental pursuits at facilities like LHCb, fostering further experimental validations and discoveries in heavy quark spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Production of single isolated photons in the Parton Reggeization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the article, we study the processes of single isolated photon production at the LHC energies in the framework of the Parton Reggeization Approach taking into account LO and NLO* contributions, the last one includes only tree-level corrections. Reggeized amplitudes are constructed according to the effective field theory formalism for multi-Regge kinematics processes suggested by L.N. Lipatov. To avoid the double counting between tree-level corrections and unintegrated parton distribution functions, a subtraction scheme is introduced. The results of calculations are compared with experimental data.</description>

      <title>A study of systematic uncertainties within the MSHT PDF Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental errors are now incredibly precise, and are often dominated by the systematic uncertainties. Therefore the errors obtained in the Parton Distribution Functions that are extracted from this data will also be dominated by these experimental systematic errors, as well as the systematic errors embedded in the theoretical calculations. However, as is well known, there are often significant uncertainties in these systematic errors, and so to determine precisely the errors in the Parton Distribution Functions, we need to be thoughtful about the uncertainties in the errors themselves. In this paper, we discuss an approach where these "errors on errors" can be incorporated into a $\chi^2$ calculation, and investigate how such a model behaves and what it tells us about the resulting errors. Also we look at two data sets, ATLAS W,Z Data [arXiv:1612.03016] and the ATLAS 7 TeV Inclusive Jet Distribution Data [arXiv:1410.8857] and investigate the information that this model implies about these two data sets.</description>

      <title>Search for the $\Sigma(1380)1/2^-$ state in $\Lambda^+_c \to \gamma \pi^+ \Lambda$ decay by triangle singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the resonance production in $\Lambda^+_c \to \gamma \pi^+ \Lambda$ decay through the triangle singularity (TS) mechanism, within an effective Lagrangian approach. We find that the appropriate loop decay process could develop a triangle singularity in the invariant mass $M_{\pi\Lambda}$ around $1.35$ GeV, with the shape depending on the quantum numbers of $\Sigma^*$ states that couple to the final $\pi\Lambda$ system. Especially, the $\Sigma(1380)1/2^-$ state newly predicted in the pentaquark model, if exists, significantly enhances the TS contribution and sharpens the TS peak due to the $S$-wave $\Sigma^*\pi\Sigma$ vertex in the loop. Therefore, the existence of the $\Sigma(1380)1/2^-$ state can be examined by measuring the TS signal in $\Lambda^+_c \to \gamma \pi^+ \Lambda$. Considering also possible tree-level diagrams, we additionally obtain the branching ratio ${\rm Br}(\Lambda^+_c \to \gamma \pi^+ \Lambda)\simeq 1.5\times 10^{-5}$. We suggest the investigation of this reaction by future BESIII, LHCb, and Belle experiments.</description>

      <title>Exploring observable effects of scalar operators beyond SMEFT in the angular distribution of $B\to K^{*0} \tau^+ \tau^- $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ invariance of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) imposes relations among different low-energy effective field theory Wilson coefficients (WCs), any deviations from which would signal the presence of physics beyond SMEFT. In this work, we investigate two such relations ($C_S = -C_P$, $C_S^\prime = C_P^\prime$) among the scalar and the pseudoscalar new-physics WCs that can contribute to $b\to s \,\tau \tau $ processes. We show that, even when new physics violating these relations would not be measurable in the branching ratios of $B_s \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ and $B\to K^{(*)}\,\tau^+ \tau^-$ at HL-LHC and FCC-ee, it can still manifest itself in the angular distribution of $B\to K^{*0}\,\tau^+ \tau^-$. We identify the combinations of angular observables in this decay channel that are sensitive to scenarios beyond SMEFT. We find that the two observables $S_6^c$ and $A_7$, and their combination, have the potential to identify physics beyond SMEFT.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the resonance X(4630) at non-zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the spectroscopic parameters of resonance $X(4630)$ observed in the process $B^{+}\rightarrow J/\Psi \phi K^{+}$ by at the LHCb experiments at CERN by means of thermal QCD sum rule method at non-zero temperature. The exotic vector $X(4630)$ is assigned as the diquark-antidiquark state $[cs][\overline{cs}]$ with spin-parity $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$. Employing the two-point QCD sum rule approach up to the sixth order of the operator dimension by including non-perturbative contribution, we calculate the mass and decay constant of $X(4630)$ at $T\neq0$. The numerical analyses demonstrate that the values of the mass and decay constant of $X(4630)$ near the deconfinement temperature decrease up to $9.8\%$ and $60\%$ of their vacuum values. At $T\rightarrow0$, the obtained results for the mass $m_{X(4630)}=(4649\pm40)$ MeV and decay constant $\lambda_{X(4630)}=(10.07\pm0.8)\times10^{-3} $ MeV are in excellent agreement with the results reported by LHCb experiments and other theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Exact two-loop amplitudes for Higgs plus jet production with a cubic Higgs self-coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the corrections to the two-loop amplitudes for $gg \to h$, $gg \to hg$, $qg \to hq$, and $q \bar q \to hg$ due to a modified cubic Higgs self-coupling. The exact dependence on the Higgs and top-quark masses across the entire $2 \to 2$ phase space is determined by numerically solving a system of differential equations for the relevant master integrals. The calculated amplitudes are crucial for evaluating the impact of the considered corrections on exclusive $pp \to hj$ production at the hadronic event level. As an application, we calculate the non-universal, kinematic-dependent cubic Higgs self-coupling corrections to the Higgs-boson transverse momentum distribution in gluon-gluon fusion Higgs production for arbitrary values of the transverse momentum.</description>

      <title>On the impact of the mixed $Z/ \gamma$ PDF at muon colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the role of the $Z/\gamma$-interference parton distribution function (PDF) in high-energy muon colliders. We review how this PDF emerges when electroweak interactions are applied to the collinear splitting process and show that the leading-order approximation is significantly suppressed due to an accidental cancellation. However, this suppression does not appear in the leading-logarithm resummed numerical result, where the $Z/\gamma$ PDF is instead comparable to those of other electroweak gauge bosons. By extending the analytical approximation to next-to-leading order, we show the mechanism by which the suppression is lifted and provide a more accurate approximation to the numerical result. Furthermore, we explore the impact of the $Z/\gamma$ PDF in several processes at future muon colliders. High-energy Compton scattering is identified as a promising process for observing experimentally this peculiar electroweak effect with high precision. We also quantify the impact of the $Z/\gamma$ PDF on Higgs physics and, as a new physics example, in resonant single-production of axion-like particles (ALP).</description>

      <title>Non-unitary limits on different textures for low-scale seesaw models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New heavy neutral leptons lead to non-unitary effects in models for neutrino masses. Such effects could represent a sign of new physics beyond the Standard Model, leading to observable deviations in neutrino oscillation experiments, lepton flavor violation, and other precision measurements. This work explores the parameter space of the linear and inverse low-scale seesaw models based on flavor symmetries consistent with neutrino oscillation experiments. In particular, we investigated the violation of unitarity when the lepton flavor violation is absent and when only one lepton flavor-violating channel is present.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Inflaton Potential: Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves in Slow Roll and Ultra Slow Roll Single Field Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new single field inflationary scenarios that produce the critical abundance of primordial black holes as dark matter reconstructing the inflaton potential from an input power spectrum. The method is exact in the slow roll approximation but remains effective even when the slow roll conditions are temporarily violated such as in ultra slow roll models. With this method we construct new ultra slow roll scenarios and also models that reproduce the DM abundance within the slow roll regime. As a second application we consider a scalar power spectrum that generates a secondary gravitational wave background compatible with the one recently observed in Pulsar Timing Arrays experiments. These scenarios could be tested by future observations of $\mu-$distortions of the CMB.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Function of a Deuteron-like Dibaryon System from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a lattice QCD calculation of the parton distribution function (PDF) of a deuteron-like dibaryon system using large-momentum effective theory. The calculation is done on three Wilson Clover ensembles with a fixed lattice spacing a=0.105 fm and two pion masses. The lattice matrix elements are computed at proton momenta up to 2.46 GeV with the signal of high momentum modes being improved by applying the momentum smearing technique. The state-of-the-art renormalization, matching and extrapolation are then applied to obtain the final result of the light-cone PDF. A comparison between the result of the dibaryon system and the sum of the proton and neutron PDFs is also given.</description>

      <title>Quarkyonic equation of state with a momentum dependent interaction and neutron star structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure and basic properties of dense nuclear matter still remain one of the open problems of Physics. In particular, the composition of the matter that composes neutron stars is under theoretical and experimental investigation. Among the theories that have been proposed, apart from the classical one where the composition is dominated by hadrons, the existence or coexistence of free quark matter is a dominant guess. An approach towards this solution is the phenomenological view according to which the existence of quarkyonic matter plays a dominant role in the construction of the equation of state (EOS). According to it the structure of the EOS is based on the existence of the quarkyonic particle which is a hybrid state of a particle that combines properties of hadronic and quark matter with a corresponding representation in momentum space. In this paper we propose a phenomenological model for quarkyonic matter, borrowed from corresponding applications in hadronic models, where the interaction in the quarkyonic matter depends not only on the position but also on the momentum of the quarkyonic particles. This consideration, as we demonstrate, can have a remarkable consequence on the shape of the EOS and thus on the properties of neutron stars, offering a sufficiently flexible model. Comparison with recent observational data can place constraints on the parameterization of the particular model and help improve its reliability.</description>

      <title>S-Matrix Bootstrap and Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the S-matrix bootstrap analysis of theories with non-invertible symmetries in (1+1) dimensions. Our previous work showed that crossing symmetry of S-matrices in such theories is modified, with modification characterized by the fusion category data. By imposing unitarity, symmetry and the modified crossing, we constrain the space of consistent S-matrices, identifying integrable theories with non-invertible symmetries at the cusps of allowed regions. We also extend the modified crossing rules to cases where vacua transform in non-regular representations of fusion category, utilizing a connection to a dual category $\mathscr C^{*}_{\mathscr{M}}$ and Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT). This highlights the utility of SymTFT in the analysis of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Renormalization and running in the 2D $CP(1)$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the scattering amplitude in the two dimensional $CP(1)$ model in a regularization scheme independent way. When using cutoff regularization, a new Feynman rule from the path integral measure is required if one is to preserve the symmetry. The physical running of the coupling with renormalization scale arises from a UV finite Feynman integral in all schemes. We reproduce the usual result with asymptotic freedom, but the pathway to obtaining the beta function can be different in different schemes. We also comment on the way that this model evades the classic argument by Landau against asymptotic freedom in non-gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study diffractive vector meson production at small-$x$ in the collision of electrons and polarized deuterons $e+d^{\uparrow}$. We consider the polarization dependence of the nuclear wave function of the deuteron, which results in an azimuthal angular dependence of the produced vector meson when the deuteron is transversely polarized. The Fourier coefficients extracted from the azimuthal angular dependence of the vector meson differential cross-section exhibit notable differences between longitudinally and transversely polarized deuterons. The angular dependence of the extracted effective deuteron radius provides direct insight into the structure of the polarized deuteron wave function. Furthermore, we observe slightly increased gluon saturation effects when the deuteron is longitudinally polarized compared to the transversely polarized case. The small-$x$ observables studied in this work will be accessible at the future Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Vertex correction to nuclear matrix elements of double-$\beta$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The predicted neutrinoless double-$\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay is the crucial phenomenon to prove the existence of the Majorana neutrino, which gives a foundation to leptogenesis to explain the matter prevalence of the universe. The nuclear matrix element (NME) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay is an important theoretical quantity to determine the effective neutrino mass and help the detector design for the next generation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay search. Reliable calculation of this NME is a long-standing problem because of the diversity of the predicted values of the NME. The main reason for this difficulty is that the effective strength of the Gamow-Teller transition operator $g_A$ for this decay is unknown. I will show the lowest-order vertex corrections for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ and the $2\nu\beta\beta$ NME of $^{136}$Xe in the framework of the hybrid application of the quantum field theory to the leptons and the Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbation to the nucleus. The unperturbed nuclear states are obtained by the quasiparticle random-phase approximation. These corrections reduce the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME by 30%. The effective $g_A$ referring to this reduced NME is also obtained, and it is shown for the first time that the effective $g_A$ for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME is not quite different from that for the $2\nu\beta\beta$ NME; the difference is only 10%. This indicates the possibility that the phenomenological effective $g_A$ to reproduce the experimental half-life of the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay can be approximately used for the calculation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME.</description>

      <title>Complementary $CP$ violation induced by $T$-odd and $T$-even correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a novel approach to concurrently measure the complementary $CP$ violation observables induced by $T$-odd correlations and their corresponding $T$-even counterparts, where $T$ represents time reversal. Our analysis demonstrates that $T$-odd and -even correlations, when satisfying specific conditions, result in cosine and sine strong phase dependencies of the corresponding $CP$ violation, respectively. Additionally, we identify pairs of these $CP$ violation observables in hadron decays depend on precisely the same strong phases within the helicity amplitude scheme. This complementarity effectively reduces the strong phase reliance in the study of $CP$ violation, while also mitigating the risk of suppressed $CP$ violation due to exceptionally small strong phases. Furthermore, our proposal holds potential for uncovering $CP$ violation in baryon decays that have not yet been observed in experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exotic spin-$0$ states with unusual couplings with the gauge and matter fields of the Standard Model are worth exploring at the CERN LHC. Though our approach is largely model independent, we take inspiration from flavor models based on some discrete symmetries which predict a set of a scalar and a pseudoscalar having purely off-diagonal Yukawa interactions with quarks and leptons. In a previous paper, some of us explored how to decipher such exotic scalar and pseudoscalar states whose off-diagonal Yukawa couplings involve light quarks. In this work we follow a complementary path and focus on the Yukawa couplings that necessarily involve a top quark. If one such spin-$0$ state is lighter than the top quark, then the rare decay of the latter, on account of the high yield of the $t\bar t$ events, could provide a potential hunting ground of those exotic states particularly during the high luminosity phase of the LHC run. We carry out an exhaustive collider analysis of some promising signatures of those exotic states using sophisticated Machine Learning techniques and obtain considerable signal significance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search of the new physics~(NP) beyond the Standard Model is one of the most important topics in current high energy physics. With the increasing luminosities at the colliders, the search for NP signals requires the analysis of more and more data, and the efficiency in data processing becomes particularly important. As a machine learning algorithm, support vector machine~(SVM) is expected to to be useful in the search of NP. Meanwhile, the quantum computing has the potential to offer huge advantages when dealing with large amounts of data, which suggests that quantum SVM~(QSVM) is a potential tool in future phenomenological studies of the NP. How to use SVM and QSVM to optimize event selection strategies to search for NP signals are studied in this paper. Taking the tri-photon process at a muon collider as an example, it can be shown that the event selection strategies optimized by the SVM and QSVM are effective in the search of the dimension-8 operators contributing to the anomalous quartic gauge couplings.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves are a unique probe of the early Universe, as the Universe is transparent to gravitational radiation right back to the end of inflation. In this article, we summarise detection prospects and the wide scope of primordial events that could lead to a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background. Any such background would shed light on what lies beyond the Standard Model, sometimes at remarkably high scales. We overview the range of strategies for detecting a stochastic gravitational wave background before delving deep into three major primordial events that can source such a background. Finally, we summarize the landscape of other sources of primordial backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Light vector bosons and the weak mixing angle in the light of future germanium-based reactor CE$\nu$NS experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the sensitivity of future germanium-based reactor neutrino experiments to the weak mixing angle $\sin^{2}\theta_{W}$, and to the presence of new light vector bosons is investigated. By taking into account key experimental features with their uncertainties and the application of a data-driven and state-of-the-art reactor antineutrino spectrum, the impact of detection threshold and experimental exposure is assessed in detail for an experiment relying on germanium semiconductor detectors. With the established analysis framework, the precision on the Weinberg angle, and capability of probing the parameter space of a universally coupled mediator model, as well as a U(1)$_{\rm B-L}$-symmetric model are quantified. Our investigation finds the next-generation of germanium-based reactor neutrino experiments in good shape to determine the Weinberg angle $\sin^{2}\theta_{W}$ with $&lt;10$ % precision using the low-energetic neutrino channel of CE$\nu$NS. In addition, the current limits on new light vector bosons determined by reactor experiments can be lowered by about an order of magnitude via the combination of both CE$\nu$NS and E$\nu$eS. Consequently, our findings provide strong phenomenological support for future experimental endeavours close to a reactor site.</description>

Abstract: We study the energy deposition and thermalisation of high-momentum on-shell partons (minijets) travelling through a non-equilibrium Quark-Gluon Plasma using QCD kinetic theory. For thermal backgrounds, we show that the parton energy first flows to the soft sector by collinear cascade and then isotropises via elastic scatterings. In contrast, the momentum deposition from a minijet reaches the equilibrium distribution directly. For expanding non-equilibrium QGP, we study the time for a minijet perturbation to lose memory of its initial conditions, namely, the hydrodynamisation time. We show that the minijet evolution scales well with the relaxation time ${\tau}_R \propto {\eta}/s/T ({\tau} )$, where $T ({\tau} )$ is the effective temperature and ${\eta}/s$ is the viscosity over entropy ratio.</description>

      <title>Meson mass and width: Deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is fascinating to predict the mass and width of the ordinary and exotic mesons solely based on their quark content and quantum numbers. Such prediction goes beyond conventional methodologies traditionally employed in hadron physics for calculating or estimating these quantities. The relation between the quantum numbers and the properties of the mesons, such as the mass and width, is complicated in the world of particle physics. However, the deep neural network (DNN) as a subfield of machine learning techniques provides a solution to this problem. By analyzing large datasets, deep learning algorithms can automatically identify complex patterns among the particles' quantum numbers, and their mass and width, that would otherwise require complex calculations. In this study, we present two approaches using the DNNs to estimate the mass of some ordinary and exotic mesons. Also for the first time, the DNNs are trained to predict the width of ordinary and exotic mesons, whose widths have not been experimentally known. Our predictions obtained through the DNNs, will be useful for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Dihadron helicity correlation in photon-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The helicity correlation of two back-to-back hadrons is a powerful tool that makes it possible to probe the longitudinal spin transfer, $G_{1L}$, in unpolarized hadronic collisions. In this work, we investigate the helicity correlation of back-to-back dihadrons produced in photon-nucleus collisions with both space-like and quasireal photons and explore its potential in understanding the flavor dependence of spin-dependent fragmentation functions. We present helicity amplitudes of partonic scatterings with both virtual and real photons and make numerical predictions for the dihadron helicity correlations at the future Electron Ion Collider experiment and the current RHIC/LHC ultra-peripheral collision experiment. Future experimental measurements can also illuminate the fragmentation function of circularly polarized gluons.</description>

      <title>Dimuons from neutrino-nucleus collisions in the semi-inclusive DIS approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculation of dimuon production in neutrino-nucleus collisions. This process is typically calculated by assuming it to be proportional to inclusive charm production, which requires an effective acceptance correction to take the experimental cuts on the decay-muon kinematics into account. Here, we instead compute the dimuon production cross section directly as a convolution of semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering to produce charmed hadrons, and a decay function fitted to $e^+e^-$ data to produce a muon from the charmed hadrons. The presented approach is in a good agreement with available experimental data and will serve as a starting point for higher-order QCD calculations without an external acceptance correction. The uncertainties arising from the decay function and scale dependence are sizeably smaller than those from the nuclear parton distribution functions. We also calculate the effective acceptances within our approach and compare them to those usually used in global fits of parton distribution functions, finding differences of the order of $10\,\%$, depending on the kinematics, perturbative order, and applied parton distributions.</description>

      <title>The Phase Space Distance Between Collider Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How can one fully harness the power of physics encoded in relativistic $N$-body phase space? Topologically, phase space is isomorphic to the product space of a simplex and a hypersphere and can be equipped with explicit coordinates and a Riemannian metric. This natural structure that scaffolds the space on which all collider physics events live opens up new directions for machine learning applications and implementation. Here we present a detailed construction of the phase space manifold and its differential line element, identifying particle ordering prescriptions that ensure that the metric satisfies necessary properties. We apply the phase space metric to several binary classification tasks, including discrimination of high-multiplicity resonance decays or boosted hadronic decays of electroweak bosons from QCD processes, and demonstrate powerful performance on simulated data. Our work demonstrates the many benefits of promoting phase space from merely a background on which calculations take place to being geometrically entwined with a theory's dynamics.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the hidden-charm-hidden-strange tetraquark mass spectrum via the QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we construct the diquark-antidiquark type four-quark currents to investigate the mass spectrum of the ground state hidden-charm-hidden-strange tetraquark states with the quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $1^{+-}$, $1^{++}$ and $2^{++}$ via the traditional QCD sum rules in a comprehensive way. We update old calculations, perform new calculations and analysis in a rigorous way, and take account of the net light-flavor $SU(3)$ breaking effects in a consistent way. And we make more reasonable identifications for the $X(3960)$, $X(4140)$, $X(4274)$, $X(4500)$, $X(4685)$ and $X(4700)$ and supersede some old identifications. Furthermore, we consider our previous theoretical predictions, and make reasonable/suitable identifications of the new LHCb states $h_c(4000)$ and $\chi_{c1}(4010)$.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational field of a clump of ultralight axion like particles (ALPs) in its core with a rotating binary system of dwarf stars is computed. It is established that the induced quadrupole mass moment of the clump is controlled parametrically by the $M_a/M$ mass ratio of the axion clump and the the binary core.</description>

      <title>Study of the effects of external imaginary electric field and chiral chemical potential on quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of quark matter with both external electric field and chiral chemical potential is theoretically and experimentally interesting to consider. In this paper, the case of simultaneous presence of imaginary electric field and chiral chemical potential is investigated using the lattice QCD approach with $N_f=1+1$ dynamical staggered fermions. We find that overall both the imaginary electric field and the chiral chemical potential can exacerbate chiral symmetry breaking, which is consistent with theoretical predictions. However we also find a non-monotonic behavior of chiral condensation at specific electric field strengths and chiral chemical potentials. In addition to this, we find that the behavior of Polyakov loop in the complex plane is not significantly affected by chiral chemical potential in the region of the parameters consider in this paper.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Primordial Black Hole Evaporation with Large Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectra of gravitational waves from black hole evaporation generically peak at frequencies of order the Hawking temperature, making this signal ultra-high frequency for primordial black holes evaporating in the early universe. This motivates us to consider small black holes in theories with large extra dimensions, for which the peak frequency can be lowered substantially, since the true bulk Planck scale $M_*$ can be much smaller than the effective $M_{\rm Pl}$. We study the emission of brane-localized gravitons during the Hawking evaporation of ultra-light primordial black holes in the context of theories with large extra dimensions, with the ultimate goal of computing the contribution to the stochastic gravitational wave background. To accurately model black hole evolution, we compute greybody factors for particles of spin-0, 1/2, 1, and 2 emitted on the brane and in the bulk, presuming the majority of emission proceeds during the Schwarzschild phase. We then compute the power spectrum and present day spectral density parameter for brane-localized gravitons contributing to a gravitational wave signal. We find that for an optimal choice of parameters, the peak frequency plateaus in the sub-MHz regime, within range of planned high-frequency gravitational wave detectors, making this scenario a target for detection once their sensitivity exceeds $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ bounds.</description>

      <title>Interpretating Pulsar Timing Array data of Gravitational Waves with Ekpyrosis-Bouncing Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments have reported strong evidence of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). If interpreted as primordial Gravitational Waves (pGWs), the signal favors a strongly blue-tilted spectrum. On the other hand, the Ekpyrosis-bouncing cosmology with a strongly blue-tilted GW spectrum, i.e., $n_T \simeq 2$, offers a potential explanation for the observed SGWB signal. In this paper, we construct a concrete Ekpyrosis-bouncing model, and show its capacity to intepret the PTA result without pathologies. Both tensor and scalar perturbations are analysed with constraints from the current observations.</description>
