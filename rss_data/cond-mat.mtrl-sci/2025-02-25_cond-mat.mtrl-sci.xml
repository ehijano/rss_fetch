      <title>Tunable magnon band topology and magnon orbital Nernst effect in noncollinear antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the intrinsic magnon orbital Nernst effect (ONE) in noncollinear antiferromagnets with Kagom\'e spin systems. Our analysis reveals that an externally applied magnetic field induces topological phase transitions in the magnonic system, characterized by the closing and reopening of the band gap between distinct magnon bands. These transitions enable tunable control of the magnon orbital Nernst effect with applied magnetic field, with a pronounced enhancement in magnon orbital Nernst conductivity near the phase transition points. This tunability presents a promising direction for experimental detection of the magnon ONE.</description>

      <title>The surface binding and energy issues in rational design of the separation membrane of Li||S batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) represent one of the most promising next-generation energy storage technologies, offering exceptionally high energy densities. However, their widespread adoption remains hindered by challenges such as sluggish conversion reactions and the dissolution of lithium polysulfides, which lead to poor cycling stability and reduced performance. While significant efforts have been made to address these limitations, the energy storage capabilities of LSBs in practical devices remain far from achieving their full potential. This report delves into recent advancements in the rational design of separation membranes for LSBs, focusing on addressing fundamental issues related to surface binding and surface energy interactions within materials science. By examining the functionalization and optimization of separation membranes, we aim to highlight strategies that can guide the development of more robust and efficient LSBs, bringing them closer to practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Valley resolved dynamics of phonon bottleneck in semiconductor molybdenum ditelluride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor molybdenum ditelluride (2H-MoTe2) possess multiple valleys in the band structure, enriching its physical properties and potentials in applications. The understanding of its multivalley nature of fundamental processes involving population and relaxation of carriers and phonons is still evolving; particularly, the possible phonon bottleneck has not yet been addressed. Here, we investigate the carrier intra- and intervalley scattering and the phonon dynamics in different valleys in photoexcited few-layer 2H-MoTe2, by using the time resolved measurements of optical absorption and electron diffraction, together with the density functional theory calculation and molecular dynamics simulation. The pathways and timescales of carrier relaxation, accompanied with the emissions of optical phonons at the Brillouin zone center and acoustic phonons at the zone border are revealed. We present a couple of approaches to estimate the population of different phonon modes based on the results of optical and electron diffraction measurements, hence quantitatively identify the occurrences of phonon bottleneck located in different valleys. Our findings make possible to construct a comprehensive picture of the complex interactions between carriers and phonons in 2H-MoTe2 with the valley degree of freedom resolved.</description>

      <title>Multistate Control of Nonlinear Photocurrents in Optoferroelectrics via phase manipulation of light field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast optical control of ferroelectricity based on short and intense light can be utilized to achieve accurate manipulations of ferroelectric materials, which may pave a basis for future breakthrough in nonvolatile memories. Here, we demonstrate that phase manipulation of electric field in the strong field sub-cycle regime induces a nonlinear injection current, efficiently coupling with the topology of band structure and enabling dynamic reversal of both current and polarization. Our time-dependent first-principles calculations reveal that tuning the phase of linearly or circularly polarized light through time-varying chirp, or constant carrier envelop phases within sub-laser-cycle dynamics effectively breaks the time-reversal symmetry, allowing the control over current and electronic polarization reversal over multi-ferroelectric states. Our time- and momentum-resolved transverse current analysis reveal the significance of Berry curvature higher order poles in the apparent association between the odd (even) orders of Berry curvature multipoles to odd (even) pseudo-harmonics in driving polarization dynamics reversal. We suggest that these phase manipulations of short pulse waveform may lead to unprecedented accurate control of nonlinear photocurrents and polarization states, which facilitate the development of precise ultrafast opto-ferroelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Stabilized biskyrmion states in annealed CoFeB bilayer with different interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the stability of skyrmions and biskyrmions in perpendicular magnetic tunneling junctions with a thick CoFeB/Ta/CoFeB free layer. The samples showed a magnetoresistance of ~ 41% when annealed at 230 {\deg}C. Magnetic force microscopy revealed the existence of skyrmions and biskyrmions at room temperature in the as-deposited state and under an external magnetic field. Annealing at 330 {\deg}C enhanced interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and crystallinity, enabling the spontaneous coexistence of these topological structures. Micromagnetic simulations using MuMax3 explored the interplay between DMI strength, sign, and skyrmion chirality. Skyrmions exhibited repulsive interactions, while biskyrmions displayed attractive interactions due to the difference in helicities. The study highlights the influence of multilayer structure and varying Ta layer thicknesses on the DMI charility, which modulates the formation of complex spin textures. These results provide an understanding of skyrmion and biskyrmion dynamics and their potential for spintronic applications, including racetrack memory and data storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Multi-component altermagnet: A general approach to generating multi-component structures with two-dimensional altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, as an unconventional antiferromagnetism, exhibits collinear-compensated magnetic order in real space and spin-splitting band structure in reciprocal space. In this work, we propose a general approach to generating multi-component structures with two-dimensional altermagnetism, based on symmetry analysis. Specifically, by analyzing the space group of the crystal structures and their subgroups, we systematically categorize equivalent atomic positions and arrange them into orbits based on symmetry operations. Chemical elements are then allowed to occupy all atomic positions on these orbits, generating candidate structures with specific symmetries. We present a general technique for generating collinear-compensated magnetic order, characterized by the symmetrical interconnection between opposite-spin sublattices, and employ first-principles calculations to determine magnetic ground states of multi-component materials. This approach integrates symmetry analysis with the screening of altermagnetic configurations to evaluate the likelihood of candidates possessing altermagnetism. To verify the methodology, we provide examples of previously unreported 2D altermagnets, such as Cr2Si2S3Se3, Fe2P2S3Se3, and V2O2BrI3, and evaluate their dynamical stability by calculating the phonon spectrum. The results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in generating stable multi-component structures with two-dimensional altermagnetism. Our research has significantly enriched the candidate materials for 2D altermagnet and provided a reference for experimental synthesis.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Combinatorial Electrocatalyst Discovery with Bayesian Optimization: A Case Study in the Quaternary System Ni-Pd-Pt-Ru for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-performance electrocatalysts is crucial for advancing sustainable energy technologies. Compositionally complex solid solutions comprising multiple metals offer promising catalytic properties, yet their exploration is challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of possible compositions. In this work, we combine combinatorial sputtering of thin-film materials libraries and their high-throughput characterization with Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore the quaternary composition space Ni-Pd-Pt-Ru for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. Using this method, the global activity optimum of pure Ru was identified after covering less than 20% of the complete composition space with six materials libraries. Six additional libraries were fabricated to validate the activity trend. The resulting dataset is used to formulate general guidelines for the efficient composition space exploration using combinatorial synthesis paired with Bayesian optimization.</description>

      <title>Polarization of photoluminescence by optically driven orbital reconstruction in magnetically ordered CrCl3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that photoluminescence from CrCl3 bulk crystal exhibits a preferential polarization direction when films are magnetically ordered or strained. We verify the magnetization as responsible for the polarization by measuring the signal as a function of the temperature in Voigt configuration while applying the in-plane magnetic field. We show that phonon coupling contributing to vibronic transitions depolarizes the signal compared with zero phonon lines. We explain the data using DFT calculations, which reveal a magnetization-selective occupation of the low energy d-orbital triplet state of Cr3+ upon photon absorption. In addition, the calculations find that the excitation of one electron results in the excited state acquiring out-of-plane components of spin and very large orbital magnetic moments, in addition to a lattice deformation.</description>

      <title>Realization of discretized response in rare-earth vanadates accessed by AC susceptibility and magnetocaloric methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report presents a new technique to probe the quantitative dynamical response of the magnetic field induced heating/cooling process in rare-earth vanadium materials. The approach combines AC susceptibility and AC caloric measurements to reveal the intrinsic timescale associated with the magnetic relaxation process of rare-earth ions at low temperatures. Utilizing the well-known crystal field effect in YbVO4, we prove and demonstrate a discretized thermal analysis through a common spin-lattice relaxation phenomenon. The demonstration experiment presented in this study provides a general approach to quantitatively address multiple measured quantities in one unified discretized thermal circuit analysis. It can be extended to study other magnetic, dielectric, and elastic materials exhibiting a complex response to an external driving field in the presence of intrinsic interactions and fluctuations, particularly when an energy dissipation process is within an accessible frequency regime.</description>

      <title>Observation of spin splitting in the surface electronic structure of antiferromagnet NdBi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin splitting in electronic band structures via antiferromagnetic orders is a new route to control spin-polarized carriers that is available for spintronics applications. Here, we investigated the spin degree of freedom in the electronic band structures of the antiferromagnet NdBi using laser-based spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (laser-SARPES). Our laser-SARPES experiments revealed that the two surface bands that appear in the antiferromagnetic state are spin-polarized in opposite directions as a counterpart of the spin splitting. Moreover, we observed that the spin polarization is antisymmetric to the electron momentum, indicating that spin degeneracy is lifted due the breaking of inversion symmetry at the surface. These results are well reproduced by our density functional theory calculations with the single-q magnetic structure, implying that the spin-split surface state is determined by the breaking of inversion symmetry in concert with the antiferromagnetic order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature and field dependences of the frequencies of uniform modes of the skyrmion lattice in a 2D ferromagnetic film with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, as well as their damping, are computed within the model of classical spins. We show that the magnetization of the film exhibits Rabi-like oscillations when subjected to the microwave field at resonance with the low-frequency mode. Melting of the skyrmion lattice by resonant microwaves is investigated in terms of the time dependence of the orientational and translational order parameters. A distinct single-stage melting transition has been observed.</description>

      <title>Full-film dry transfer of MBE-grown van der Waals materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has been used to create high-quality, large-scale two-dimensional van der Waals (2D vdW) materials. However, due to the strong adhesion between the substrate and deposited materials, the peel-off and dry transfer of MBE-grown vdW films onto other substrates has been challenging. This limits the study and use of MBE films for heterogeneous integration including stacked and twisted heterostructures. In this work, we develop a polymer-assisted dry transfer method and successfully perform full-film transfer of various MBE-grown 2D vdW materials including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), topological insulators (TI) and 2D magnets. In particular, we transfer air-sensitive 2D magnets, characterize their magnetic properties, and compare them with as-grown materials. The results show that the transfer technique does not degrade the magnetic properties, with the Curie temperature and hysteresis loops exhibiting similar behaviors after the transfer. Our results enable further development of heterogeneous integration of 2D vdW materials based on MBE growth.</description>

      <title>Topological descriptors for the electron density of inorganic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Descriptors play an important role in data-driven approaches for materials design. While most descriptors of inorganic crystalline materials emphasize structure and composition, they often neglect the electron density - a complex yet fundamental quantity that governs material properties. In this work, we introduce Betti curves as topological descriptors that compress the electron density into compact representations. Derived from persistent homology, Betti curves capture bonding characteristics by encoding components, cycles, and voids across varied electron density thresholds. Machine learning models trained on Betti curves outperform those trained on raw electron densities by an average of 33 percentage points in classifying structure prototypes, predicting thermodynamic stability, and distinguishing metals from non-metals. Shannon entropy calculations reveal that Betti curves retain comparable information content to electron density while requiring two orders of magnitude less data. By combining expressive power with compact representation, Betti curves highlight the potential of topological data analysis to advance the modeling and design of inorganic materials.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Spin-Orbit-Coupled Magnetoelectricity in Type-II Multiferroic NiI$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-II multiferroics, where spin order induces ferroelectricity, exhibit strong magnetoelectric coupling. However, for the typical 2D type-II multiferroic NiI$_2$, the underlying magnetoelectric mechanism remains unclear. Here, applying generalized spin-current model, together with first-principles calculations and a tight-binding approach, we build a comprehensive magnetoelectric model for spin-induced polarization. Such model reveals that the spin-orbit coupling extends its influence to the third-nearest neighbors, whose contribution to polarization rivals that of the first-nearest neighbors. By analyzing the orbital-resolved contributions to polarization, our tight-binding model reveals that the long-range magnetoelectric coupling is enabled by the strong $e_g$-$p$ hopping of NiI$_2$. Monte Carlo simulations further predict a Bloch-type magnetic skyrmion lattice at moderate magnetic fields, accompanied by polar vortex arrays. These findings can guide the discovery and design of strongly magnetoelectric multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric non-linear Hall effect in an antiferromagnetic topological insulator thin-film EuSn2As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometric structure of electrons introduces fundamental insights into understanding quantum effects in materials. One notable manifestation is the non-linear Hall effect (NLHE), which has drawn considerable interest for its potential to overcome the intrinsic limitations of semiconductor diodes at low input power and high frequency. In this study, we investigate NLHE stemming from the real part of the quantum geometric tensor, specifically the quantum metric, in an antiferromagnetic topological material, EuSn2As2, using density functional theory. Our calculations predict a remarkable NLHE arising from a symmetry-protected, single Type-II surface Dirac cone in the even-numbered-layer two-dimensional slab thin-film, yielding a non-linear Hall conductivity exceeding 20 mA/V2-an order of magnitude larger than previously reported. This single Dirac band dispersion represents the simplest model for generating NLHE, positioning the EuSn2As2 thin-film as a hydrogen atom for NLHE systems. Additionally, we observe NLHE from band-edge states near the Fermi level. Our findings also reveal that 30% phosphorus (P) doping can double the non-linear Hall conductivity. With its substantial and tunable NLHE, EuSn2As2 thin-films present promising applications in antiferromagnetic spintronics and rectification devices.</description>

      <title>Ultrashort 30-fs laser photoablation for high-precision and damage-free diamond machining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 30-fs, 800 nm, 1 kHz femtosecond was used to photoablate diamond across radiant energy doses of 1 - 500 kJ/cm^2, with fluences of 10 - 50 J/cm^2 and, pulse counts from 100 to 10,000. The objective was to maximise material removal while minimising surface roughness (Ra) by operating above the photoablation threshold. Results demonstrate that 30-fs laser photoablation achieves Ra &lt;0.1 \mum, meeting both high- and ultra-high-precision machining standards, while maintaining surface integrity and preventing heat-affected zone (HAZ) damage. At 1 kJ/cm^2 (10 J/cm^2 fluence, 100 pulses), an Ra of 0.09 \mum was achieved, satisfying ultra-high precision criteria (Ra &lt;0.1 \mum). Additionally, doses below 10 kJ/cm^2 consistently met high-precision machining requirements (Ra &lt;0.2 \mum). Photoablation efficiency peaked below 50 kJ/cm^2, after which material removal diminished, indicating non-linear process limitations. The sp3-diamond phase remained intact, as confirmed by the unchanged T2g Raman mode at 1332 cm^-1, with no detectable Raman G or D modes, confirming the absence of sp2-related graphitization, structural disorder, of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centre annealing. These findings establish 30 fs laser processing as a high-precision, damage-free approach for diamond machining, with promising applications in NV centre-containing quantum materials and advanced tooling.</description>

      <title>Field-Modulated Crystal Transport in Altermagnetic Topological materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM), a recently proposed third type of collinear magnetic phase, has garnered significant attention due to its extraordinary features, including nonrelativistic alternating spin-splitting, spin-degenerate nodal topology, and anisotropic crystal transport. Here, we explore the role of inherent altermagnetic topology in crystal transport phenomena (such as crystal Hall, Nernst, and thermal Hall effects) in several room-temperature altermagnets, including tetragonal \textit{X}V$_2$\textit{Y}$_2$O (\textit{X} = K, Rb, Cs; \textit{Y} = S, Se, Te), RuO$_2$, MnF$_2$, as well as hexagonal CrSb and MnTe. Notably, in \textit{X}V$_2$\textit{Y}$_2$O, the first experimentally realized layered altermagnets, crystal transport is governed by altermagnetic pseudonodal surfaces, emphasizing the purely topological contributions to crystal transport. Furthermore, crystal transport exhibits strong anisotropy relative to the N{\'e}el vector. Interestingly, we demonstrate that spin-canting, a unique method for selectively controlling the altermagnetic topology and crystal transport, can substantially enhance the magnitude of these phenomena while preserving the alternating spin characteristics in both real and momentum space. Our findings provide an effective strategy for manipulating crystal transport in altermagnets, offering valuable insights for their potential applications in spintronics and spin caloritronics.</description>

      <title>X-ray Thomson scattering studies on spin-singlet stabilization of highly compressed H-like Be ions heated to two million degrees Kelvin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments at the US National Ignition Facility (NIF) [D\"{o}ppner et al., Nature {\bf 618}, 270-275 (2023)] have created highly compressed hot hydrogen-like Be plasmas. Published analyses of the the NIF experiment have used finite-$T$ multi-atom density-functional theory (DFT) with Molecular dynamics (MD), and Path-Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations. These methods are very expensive to implement and often lack physical transparency. Here we (i) relate their results to simpler first-principles average-atom results, (ii) establish the feasibility of rapid data analysis, with good accuracy and gain in physical transparency, and (iii) show that the NIF experiment reveals high-$T$ spin-singlet pairing of hydrogen-like Be ions with near neighbours. Our analysis predicts such stabilization over a wide range of compressed densities for temperatures close to two million Kelvin. Calculations of structure factors $S(k)$ for electrons or ions, the Raleigh weight and other quantities of interest to X-ray Thomson scattering are presented. We find that the NIF data at the scattering wavevector $k_{sc}$ of 7.89 \AA$^{-1}$ are more consistent with a density of $20\pm2$ g/cm$^3$, mean ionization $\bar{Z}=$3.25, at a temperature of $\simeq$ 1,800,000 K than the 34 g/cm$^3, \bar{Z}=3.4$ proposed by the NIF team. The relevance of ion-electron coupled-modes in studying small $k_{sc}$ data is indicated.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature field-tunable radiofrequency rectification in epitaxial SrIrO3 films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although significant advancements have been made in wireless technologies and portable devices, it remains a challenge for high-frequency and nanowatt-level radiofrequency rectification. In this work, we report a pronounced radiofrequency rectification up to 37 GHz in nominally centrosymmetric SrIrO3 epitaxial films, with the minimum detectable power as low as ~300 nanowatts. Strikingly, the SrIrO3 rectifier is highly field-tunable and exhibits a strong in-plane field anisotropy, thus showing a unique advantage in broad-band radiofrequency rectification. The rectification effect can persist up to at least 360 K and shows a sensitive temperature dependence including a sign inversion. By a systematic study of the nonlinear transport properties of SrIrO3, it is further revealed that the radiofrequency rectification originates from the nonlinear Hall effect with the dominant contribution from field-induced Berry curvature dipole. Our work demonstrates the superior performance of the field-tunable SrIrO3 rectifiers, unleashing the great application potential of centrosymmetric materials in harvesting and detecting ambient electromagnetic energy.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Magnetic Transitions in Sr3Ru2O7 films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In scientific research, both positive and negative results play crucial role in advancing the field. Negative results provide valuable insights that can guide future experiments and prevent repeated failures. Here we present our growth attempts of Sr3Ru2O7 thin films using the hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. X-ray diffraction suggests nominally phase-pure films. A combination of magnetoresistance and magnetization measurements exhibits an onset of ferromagnetism at 170 K and 100 K, along with a metamagnetic-like transition at 40 K. These results could initially be interpreted as intrinsic behavior of strain-engineered Sr3Ru2O7 films. However, detailed microstructural analysis reveals intergrowths of Sr2RuO4, Sr4Ru3O10, and SrRuO3 phases, dispersed throughout the film. Our findings suggest that the Sr3Ru2O7 films are likely paramagnetic, with the observed ferromagnetism arising from the Sr4Ru3O10 and SrRuO3 phases. Our results highlight the need for detailed microstructural analysis when interpreting new material properties influenced by strain and microstructure.</description>

      <title>Localized Radiofrequency Heating for Enhanced Thermoelectric Energy Generation Using Natural Galena Ore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency of thermoelectric devices can be significantly enhanced by maintaining a stable temperature gradient, which can be achieved through localized heating. Radio waves serve as an ideal heat source for this purpose. In this study, we demonstrate the enhancement of thermoelectric performance in earth-abundant natural ore Galena (PbS) through localized radio frequency (RF) heating. RF heating experiments conducted at frequencies between \SI{35}{MHz} and \SI{45}{MHz} induced substantial localized heating in PbS, generating a temperature gradient of \SI{32}{K}. This resulted in a Seebeck voltage of \SI{-5.8}{mV/K}, approximately 13 times greater than the conventional Seebeck coefficient of PbS (\SI{440}{\micro V/K}). Additionally, a power factor of \SI{151}{mWm^{-1}K^{-2}} and an overall RF to thermoelectric conversion efficiency of 15\% were achieved. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate the experimental findings, providing insights into the mechanism of thermal transport and RF-induced heating in PbS. These results highlight the potential of localized RF heating as an effective strategy for enhancing thermoelectric performance, with promising implications for ambient thermoelectric energy harvesting applications.</description>

      <title>Carrier Emission and Capture Competition mediated A(n)BC Recombination Model in Semiconductors with Multi-Level Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ABC model has been widely used to describe the carrier recombination rate, in which the rate of non-radiative recombination assisted by deep-level defects is assumed to depend linearly on excess carrier density $\Delta n$, leading to a constant recombination coefficient A. However, for multi-level defects that are prevalent in semiconductors, we demonstrate here that the rate should depend nonlinearly on $\Delta n$. When $\Delta n$ varies, the carrier capture and emission of defects can change the defect density distribution in different charge states, which can further change the carrier capture and emission rates of the defects and thus make the recombination rate depend non-linearly on $\Delta n$, leading to an $A(n)$ function. However, in many recent calculation studies on carrier recombination rate of multi-level defects, only carrier capture was considered while carrier emission from defect levels was neglected, causing incorrect charge-state distribution and misleading linear dependence of the rate on $\Delta n$. For $\text{V}_{\text{Ga}}$-$\text{O}_{\text{N}}$ in GaN and $\text{Pb}_\text{I}$ in CsPbI$_3$, our calculations showed that neglecting the carrier emission can cause the recombination rate underestimation by more than 8 orders of magnitude when $\Delta n$ is $10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$. Our findings suggest that the recent studies on carrier recombination assisted by multi-level defects should be revisited with carrier emission considered, and the widely-used $ABC$ model should be reformed into the $A(n)BC$ model.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Performance Evaluation of Cs2CuBiCl6 Double Perovskite Solar Cell for Lead-Free Photovoltaic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the previous decade, there has been a significant advancement in the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), characterized by a notable increase in efficiency from 3.8% to 25%. Nonetheless, PSCs face many problems when we commercialize them because of their toxicity and stability. Consequently, lead-PSCs need an alternative solar cell with high performance and low processing cost; lead-free inorganic perovskites have been explored. Recent research showcased Cs2CuBiCl6, a lead-free inorganic double perovskite material with remarkable photoelectric characteristics and exceptional environmental robustness. To investigate the potential of Cs2CuBiCl6 material, the solar cell structure FTO/ETL/Cs2CuBiCl6/HTL/Au was used and analyzed through a solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS-1D). CeO2 is used as the Electron transport layer (ETL), and CuI is the Hole transport layer (HTL). Furthermore, the research examined the optimization of different parameters of the absorber layer (AL), such as thickness, defect density, electron affinity, band gap, and operational temperature. In the end, it has been noticed that by setting the temperature at 300 K and an electron affinity of 4.3 eV of the absorber layer, the PSCs achieve the highest efficiency of 24.51 %, FF of 43.01 %, Voc of 1.73V, and Jsc of 32.82mA/cm2. This is the highest Cs2CuBiCl6 double PSCs efficiency we've reached yet. In theoretical studies, 17.03% of PCE was achieved using Cs2CuBiCl6 as an active layer. The analysis underscores the significant potential of Cs2CuBiCl6 as an absorbing layer in developing highly efficient lead-free all-inorganic PSCs.</description>

      <title>Unconventional topological Weyl-dipole phonon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pair of Weyl points (WPs) with opposite Chern numbers ${\cal{C}}$ can exhibit an additional higher-order $Z_2$ topological charge, giving rise to the formation of a $Z_2$ Weyl dipole. Owing to the nontrivial topological charge, $Z_2$ Weyl dipoles should also appear in pairs, and the WPs within each $Z_2$ Weyl dipole can not be annihilated when meeting together. As a novel topological state, the topological Weyl-dipole phase (TWDP) has garnered significant attention, yet its realization in crystalline materials remains a challenge. Here, through first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the existence of the Weyl-dipole phase in the phonon spectra of the $P6_3$ type Y(OH)$_3$. Particularly, the Weyl dipole in this system is protected by a quantized quadrupole moment, and it distinguished from conventional Weyl dipole, as it comprises an unconventional charge-3 WP with ${\cal{C}}=-3$ and three conventional charge-1 WPs with ${\cal{C}}=1$. Consequently, the Weyl-dipole phase in Y(OH)$_3$ features unique two-dimensional (2D) sextuple-helicoid Fermi-arc states on the top and bottom surfaces, protected by the Chern number, as well as one-dimensional (1D) hinge states that connect the two Weyl dipoles along the side hinges, guaranteed by the quantized quadrupole moment. Our findings not only introduce a novel higher-order topological phase, but also promote Y(OH)$_3$ as a promising platform for exploring multi-dimensional boundaries and the interaction between first-order and second-order topologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects in charge control of semiconductor surfaces as elucidated by ab initio calculations a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in the investigations of the charge role in semiconductor surfaces is reviewed. This is based on ab intio investigations. That include elucidation of Coulomb interaction of the separated subsystems, such as slab copies or far distant adsorbate and the slab, the bonding in the bulk and on the surface, standard and resonant. The quantum nature of the bonding leads to emergence of the external surface dipole, which was well recognized prior to these investigations. The role of the external dipole layer in the thermalization of the adsorbate is proposed and formulated. The internal dipole charge well known to exist at the surface were supplemented by new finding including the simulation of these dipole fields within slab model, pinning the Fermi level at the surface and the role of bulk and surface charge. of the bonding states. This could also occur at the activated complex point where the energy of these states could be increased into the vicinity of Fermi level or even higher so that this affects the energy barrier for diffusion. Therefore the explicit incorporation of quantum effects in the charge role in the semiconductor surfaces changes their properties considerably as described in this review.</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Conditional Inverse Design with Crystal Generation and Foundation Atomic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming materials science, enabling both theoretical advancements and accelerated materials discovery. Recent progress in crystal generation models, which design crystal structures for targeted properties, and foundation atomic models (FAMs), which capture interatomic interactions across the periodic table, has significantly improved inverse materials design. However, an efficient integration of these two approaches remains an open challenge. Here, we present an active learning framework that combines crystal generation models and foundation atomic models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of inverse design. As a case study, we employ Con-CDVAE to generate candidate crystal structures and MACE-MP-0 FAM as one of the high-throughput screeners for bulk modulus evaluation. Through iterative active learning, we demonstrate that Con-CDVAE progressively improves its accuracy in generating crystals with target properties, highlighting the effectiveness of a property-driven fine-tuning process. Our framework is general to accommodate different crystal generation and foundation atomic models, and establishes a scalable approach for AI-driven materials discovery. By bridging generative modeling with atomic-scale simulations, this work paves the way for more accurate and efficient inverse materials design.</description>

      <title>Interstitials as a key ingredient for P segregation to grain boundaries in polycrystalline $\alpha$-Fe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The segregation of solutes to grain boundaries can significantly influence material behavior. Most previous computational studies have concentrated on substitutional solute segregation, neglecting interstitial segregation due to its increased complexity. The site preference, interstitial or substitutional, for P segregation in $\alpha$-Fe still remains under debate. In this work, we investigate the full GB-segregation spectrum for both substitutional and interstitial GB sites in a polycrystalline atomistic structure of ferrite with the aid of classical interatomic potentials combined with machine learning techniques. The method is qualitatively tested for H and Ni, where the segregation behavior in $\alpha$-Fe is well understood. Our findings for P show that segregation to both types of GB sites is possible, with a preference for the substitutional sites based on the mean segregation energy. However, due to the much larger number of interstitial sites, interstitial segregation significantly contributes to the GB enrichment with P. This underscores the importance of considering interstitial P segregation in addition to the substitutional one. Furthermore, we also argue that equally important for quantitative predictions (that agree with experimental data) is to get a representative spectrum of the segregation energies.</description>

      <title>Sliding ferroelectric control of unconventional magnetism in stacked bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of unconventional magnetism, which displays an antiferromagnetic configuration with ferromagnetism-like properties, has drawn intense attention for advancing antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, through symmetry analysis, we propose a general stacking rule, characterized by a connection operator linking two stacked bilayers, for controlling unconventional magnetism via sliding ferroelectricity. Such rule enables the simultaneous switching of both electric polarization and nonrelativistic spin splitting or anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets, a class of collinear unconventional magnets. By comprehensively surveying the 80 layer groups, we identify all the stacking orders that allow for such two types of simultaneous switching. Combined with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the sliding ferroelectric control of spin polarization and anomalous Hall effect in the altermagnetic AgF2 bilayer. Our work provides a symmetry strategy for achieving ferroelectric control of unconventional magnetism in bilayer systems and opens avenues for exploring new types of magnetoelectric coupling.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of synaptic behavior in amorphous HfO2-based ferroelectric-like FETs generated by voltage-driven ion migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous effort in making artificial neural networks more alike to human brain calls for the hardware elements to implement biological synapse-like functionalities. The recent experimental demonstration of ferroelectric-like FETs promises low-power operation as compared to the conventional ferroelectric switching devices. This work presents an in-house numerical tool, which self-consistently solves the electrostatics and time-dependent electronic and ionic transport. The tool is exploited to analyze the effect that various physical parameters such as mobility and ion concentration could have on the design of the ferroelectric-like FETs. Their suitability in emulating different functions of the biological synapses is also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Defects in the \b{eta}-Ga2O3(-201)/HfO2 MOS system and the effect of thermal treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the properties of the \b{eta}-Ga2O3(-201)/HfO2/Cr/Au MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) system after annealing (450oC) in different ambient conditions (forming gas, N2 and O2). Defect properties have been analyzed using an approach combining experimental impedance measurements with physics-based simulations of the capacitance-voltage (C-V) and conductance-voltage (G-V) characteristics of \b{eta}-Ga2O3/HfO2 MOS capacitors. This approach enabled us to detect two defect bands in HfO2 characterized by thermal ionization energies of ~1.1eV (acceptor-like) and ~2eV (donor-like) attributed to a polaronic self-trapping state and an oxygen vacancy in HfO2, respectively. This study demonstrates how thermal treatments affect the energy distributions and densities of the observed defects. The adopted methodology also enabled the extraction of the spatial distribution of defects across the HfO2 thickness and Cr/HfO2 interface. The high concentration of oxygen vacancies close to the Cr/HfO2 interface extracted from experimental and simulated electrical data is confirmed by in-situ XPS analysis which shows how Cr is scavenging oxygen from the HfO2 and creating the donor band confined near the Cr/HfO2 interface. This donor band density is observed to be reduced after annealing as per simulation and unchanged for different annealing conditions. We speculate this may be due to the formation of dense films and polyforms of HfO2 under different ambient as revealed by high-resolution TEM images.</description>

      <title>Electronic and structural properties of atomically thin metallenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although metallic elements favor three-dimensional (3D) geometries due to their isotropic, metallic bonding, experiments have reported metals also with two-dimensional (2D) allotropes, the so-called metallenes. And while bulk metals' electronic and structural properties are well known, the corresponding knowledge for atomically thin metallenes remains scattered. Therefore, in this work, we use density-functional theory to investigate the electronic and structural properties of 45 elemental metals with honeycomb, square, and hexagonal lattices, along with their buckled counterparts, resulting in a comprehensive catalog of 270 metallenes with their properties. We systematically present their structural, energetic, and electronic structure properties and discuss similarities and differences compared to their 3D counterparts. As a result, simple and noble metals exhibit similar characteristics and lack buckled hexagonal lattice. Apart from scattered exceptions, the trends in several properties, such as bond lengths, cohesion energies, and projected densities of states, are governed by coordination numbers and exhibit systematic patterns. This systematic reporting provides a necessary reference for the selection and categorization of metallenes for further experimental efforts to develop them for catalytic, sensing, plasmonic, and nanoelectronics applications.</description>

      <title>Training and re-training liquid crystal elastomer metamaterials for pluripotent functionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training has emerged as a promising materials design technique in which function can be acheived through repeated physical modification of an existing material rather than by direct chemical functionalization, cutting or reprocessing. This work investigates both the ability to train for function and then to erase that function on-demand in macroscopic metamaterials made from liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs). We first show that the Poisson's ratio of these disordered arrays can be tuned via directed aging to induce an auxetic response. We then show that the arrays can be reset and re-trained for another local mechanical function, allostery, thus demonstrating pluripotent functionality.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of Charge Transport in Mixed-Valence 2D Layered Hybrid Bronze Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional layered bronze (HB) materials are a new class of mixed-valence hybrid organic-inorganic metal oxides that demonstrate great potential as advanced functional materials for next-generation electronics. Recently, new hybrid vanadium bronze materials, (EV)V8O20 and (MV)V8O20, EV = ethyl viologen and MV = methyl viologen, have been introduced, with EV having ~3 orders of magnitude higher electrical conductivity than the MV system. Given their identical inorganic V-O layers and similar reduction potentials, the observed large difference in electrical conductivities is puzzling. Here, through accurate first-principles calculations coupled with MACE machine learning molecular dynamics (MD) simulations validated by accurate ab initio MD simulations, we provide mechanistic molecular-level insights into dominant charge transport and electrical conductivity pathways in these materials. Our detailed structural and electronic properties data identifies factors contributing to this significant difference in electrical conductivities of these materials. Our findings in this work offer clues and provide valuable insights into improving the electrical conductivity of hybrid bronze and similar materials in order to guide the design of next-generation materials with enhanced properties for future electronic and thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent global sensitivity analysis of the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Doyle-Fuller-Newman model is arguably the most ubiquitous electrochemical model in lithium-ion battery research. Since it is a highly nonlinear model, its input-output relations are still poorly understood. Researchers therefore often employ sensitivity analyses to elucidate relative parametric importance for certain use cases. However, some methods are ill-suited for the complexity of the model and appropriate methods often face the downside of only being applicable to scalar quantities of interest. We implement a novel framework for global sensitivity analysis of time-dependent model outputs and apply it to a drive cycle simulation. We conduct a full and a subgroup sensitivity analysis to resolve lowly sensitive parameters and explore the model error when unimportant parameters are set to arbitrary values. Our findings suggest that the method identifies insensitive parameters whose variations cause only small deviations in the voltage response of the model. By providing the methodology, we hope research questions related to parametric sensitivity for time-dependent quantities of interest, such as voltage responses, can be addressed more easily and adequately in simulative battery research and beyond.</description>

      <title>From High-Entropy Alloys to Alloys with High Entropy: A New Paradigm in Materials Science and Engineering for Advancing Sustainable Metallurgy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) has marked a paradigm shift in alloy design, moving away from traditional methods that prioritize a dominant base metal enhanced by minor elements. HEAs instead incorporate multiple alloying elements with no single dominant component, broadening the scope of alloy design. This shift has led to the creation of diverse alloys with high entropy (AHEs) families, including high-entropy steels, superalloys, and intermetallics, each highlighting the need to consider additional factors such as stacking fault energy (SFE), lattice misfit, and anti-phase boundary energy (APBE) due to their significant influence on microstructure and performance. Leveraging multiple elements in alloying opens up promising possibilities for developing new alloys from multi-component scrap and electronic waste, reducing reliance on critical metals and emphasizing the need for advanced data generation techniques. With the vast possibilities offered by these multi-component feedstocks, modelling and Artificial Intelligence based tools are essential to efficiently explore and optimize new alloys, supporting sustainable progress in metallurgy. These advancements call for a reimagined alloy design framework, emphasizing robust data acquisition, alternative design parameters, and advanced computational tools over traditional composition-focused methodologies.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Interaction of BeS Monolayer and Lung Disease Biomarkers: Potential Material for Biosensing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considerable attention has been directed towards the prognosis of lung diseases primarily due to their high prevalence. Despite advancements in detection technologies, current methods such as computed tomography, chest radiographs, bold proteomic patterns, nuclear magnetic resonance, and positron emission tomography still face limitations in detecting diseases related to the lungs. Consequently, there is a need for swift, non-invasive and economically feasible detection methods. Our study explores the interaction between BeS monolayer and breathe biomarkers related to lung disease utilizing the density functional theory (DFT) method. Through comprehensive DFT analysis, including electronic properties analysis, charge transfer evaluations, work function, optical properties assessment and recovery times, the feasibility and efficiency of BeS as a VOC (volatile organic compound) detection are investigated. Findings reveal significant changes in bandgap upon VOC adsorption, with notable alteration in work function for selective compounds. Optical property analyses demonstrate the potential for selective detection of biomarkers within specific wavelength ranges. Moreover, the study evaluates the impact of electric fields and strain on VOC-2D BeS interaction. Furthermore, the desorption of these VOCs from the BeS surface can be achieved through a heating process or under the illumination of UV light. This feature enables the reusability of the 2D material for biosensing applications. These findings highlight the potential of the BeS monolayer as a promising material for the sensitive and selective detection of breath biomarkers related to lung disease.</description>

      <title>Metal-organic chemical vapor deposition of MgSiN$_{2}$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthorhombic-structured II-IV nitrides provide a promising opportunity to expand the material platform while maintaining compatibility with the wurtzite crystal structure of the traditional III-nitride material system. Among them, MgSiN$_{2}$ stands out due to its close compatibility with GaN and AlN and its theoretically predicted ultrawide direct band gap of 6.28 eV. In this work, the growth of MgSiN$_{2}$ thin films on GaN-on-sapphire and c-plane sapphire substrates was investigated using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). MOCVD growth conditions were correlated with film quality and crystallinity for samples grown on GaN-on-sapphire substrates. The effects of Mg:Si precursor molar flow rate ratios and growth pressure at two different temperatures, 745$^{\circ}$C and 850$^{\circ}$C, were studied comprehensively. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging confirmed the formation of high-quality, single-crystal MgSiN$_{2}$ films. Optical band gap extraction from transmittance measurements yielded direct band gap values ranging from 6.13 eV to 6.27 eV for samples grown under various conditions, confirming the realization of an ultrawide-band gap, III-nitride-compatible, II-IV-nitride material.</description>

      <title>Electronic and Structural Properties of Lanthanide-Doped MoS$_2$: Impact of Ionic Size and Orbital Configuration Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPEs) are crucial for quantum technologies such as quantum simulation, secure quantum communication, and precision measurements. Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are promising SPE candidates due to their atomically thin nature and efficient photon extraction. However, their emission wavelengths limit compatibility with existing telecommunication technologies. Lanthanide doping in TMDCs, such as \defect{MoS}{2}, offers a potential solution by introducing sharp, $f$-orbital derived emissions in the infrared range. Yet, the feasibility of introducing these dopants remains uncertain due to their large ionic radii of the lanthanides. We employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the structural and electronic properties of lanthanide-doped \defect{MoS}{2} monolayers (Ln=Ce, Er). By evaluating formation energies with up to three adjacent S vacancies, we assess how these vacancies mitigate lattice strain caused by the size mismatch of Ce and Er with Mo. Our results show that while \defect{Ln}{Mo} destabilizes the pristine lattice, S vacancies enhance thermodynamic stability. Charge state analysis indicates that defect states introduced by \defect{Ln}{Mo} localize near the valence band and remain stable across a wide Fermi energy range. Electronic structure analysis shows that Ce$^{4+}$ and Er$^{3+}$ maintain their oxidation states upon electron doping due to additional acceptor states from host-induced dangling bonds. These states arise from an orbital filling mismatch between dopants and Mo. Consequently, \defect{Ce}{Mo} is unlikely to exhibit infrared emissions due to its empty $f$-shell, whereas \defect{Er}{Mo} is expected to emit in the infrared. These findings demonstrate the potential of lanthanide-doped TMDCs as tunable SPEs and provide design strategies for optimizing their optical and electronic properties.</description>

      <title>An Explainable AI Model for Binary LJ Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluids serve as an important theoretical framework for understanding molecular interactions. Binary LJ fluids, where two distinct species of particles interact based on the LJ potential, exhibit rich phase behavior and provide valuable insights of complex fluid mixtures. Here we report the construction and utility of an artificial intelligence (AI) model for binary LJ fluids, focusing on their effectiveness in predicting radial distribution functions (RDFs) across a range of conditions. The RDFs of a binary mixture with varying compositions and temperatures are collected from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to establish and validate the AI model. In this AI pipeline, RDFs are discretized in order to reduce the output dimension of the model. This, in turn, improves the efficacy, and reduce the complexity of an AI RDF model. The model is shown to predict RDFs for many unknown mixtures very accurately, especially outside the training temperature range. Our analysis suggests that the particle size ratio has a higher order impact on the microstructure of a binary mixture. We also highlight the areas where the fidelity of the AI model is low when encountering new regimes with different underlying physics.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Computational Screening and Interpretable Machine Learning of Metal-organic Frameworks for Iodine Capture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The removal of leaked radioactive iodine isotopes in humid environments holds significant importance in nuclear waste management and nuclear accident mitigation. In this study, high-throughput computational screening and machine learning were combined to reveal the iodine capture performance of 1816 metal-organic framework (MOF) materials under humid air conditions. Firstly, the relationship between the structural characteristics of MOFs and their adsorption properties was explored, with the aim of identifying the optimal structural parameters for iodine capture. Subsequently, two machine learning regression algorithms - Random Forest and CatBoost, were employed to predict the iodine adsorption capabilities of MOFs. In addition to 6 structural features, 25 molecular features and 8 chemical features were incorporated to enhance the prediction accuracy of the machine learning algorithms. Feature importance was assessed to determine the relative influence of various features on iodine adsorption performance, in which the Henry's coefficient and heat of adsorption to iodine were found the two most crucial chemical factors. Furthermore, four types of molecular fingerprints were introduced for providing comprehensive and detailed structural information of MOF materials. The top 20 most significant MACCS molecular fingerprints were picked out, revealing that the presence of six-membered ring structures and nitrogen atoms in the MOFs were the key structural factors that enhanced iodine adsorption, followed by the existence of oxygen atoms. This work combined high-throughput computation, machine learning, and molecular fingerprints to comprehensively elucidate the multifaceted factors influencing the iodine adsorption performance of MOFs, offering profound insightful guidelines for screening and structural design of advanced MOF materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of simple, scalable, and cost-effective methods to prepare Van der Waals materials for thermoelectric applications is a timely research field, whose potential and possibilities are still largely unexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ink-jet printing and drop-casting deposition of 2H-phase SnSe2 and WSe2 nanoflake assemblies, obtained by liquid phase exfoliation, and their characterization in terms of electronic and thermoelectric properties. The choice of optimal annealing temperature and time is crucial for preserving phase purity and stoichiometry and for removing dry residues of ink solvents at inter-flake boundaries, while maximizing the sintering of nanoflakes. An additional pressing is beneficial to improve nanoflake orientation and packing, thus enhancing electric conductivity. In nanoflake assemblies deposited by drop casting and pressed at 1 GPa, we obtained thermoelectric power factors at room temperature up to 2.2x10^-4 mW m^-1 K^-2 for SnSe2 and up to 3.0x10^-4 mW m^-1 K^-2 for WSe2.</description>

Abstract: We propose a realization of the one-dimensional Kitaev topological superconductor in classical mechanical metamaterials. By designing appropriate braiding protocols, we demonstrate that the system's mid-gap vibrational modes, termed classical Majorana zero modes (MZMs), accurately reproduce the braiding statistics predicted by quantum theory. Encoding four MZMs as a classical analog of a qubit, we implement all single-qubit Clifford gates through braiding, enabling the simulation of topological quantum computation in a classical system. Furthermore, we establish the system's topological protection by demonstrating its robustness against mechanical defects. This work provides a novel framework for exploring topological quantum computation using classical metamaterials and offers a pathway to realizing stable vibrational systems protected by topology.</description>

      <title>$d$-Wave Polarization-Spin Locking in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the emergence of an uncharted phenomenon, termed $d$-wave polarization-spin locking (PSL), in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets. This phenomenon arises from nontrivial Berry connections, resulting in perpendicular electronic polarizations in the spin-up and spin-down channels. Symmetry-protected $d$-wave PSL occurs exclusively in $d$-wave altermagnets with tetragonal layer groups. To identify 2D altermagnets capable of exhibiting this phenomenon, we propose a symmetry-eigenvalue-based criterion, and a rapid method by observing the spin-momentum locking. Using first-principles calculations, monolayer Cr$_2$X$_2$O (X = Se, Te) characterizes promising candidates for $d$-wave PSL, driven by the unusual charge order in these monolayers. This unique polarization-spin interplay leads to spin-up and spin-down electrons accumulating at orthogonal edges, enabling potential applications as spin filters or splitters in spintronics. Furthermore, $d$-wave PSL introduces an unexpected spin-driven ferroelectricity in conventional antiferromagnets. Such magnetoelectric coupling positions $d$-wave PSL as an ideal platform for fast antiferromagnetic memory devices. Our findings not only expand the landscape of altermagnets, complementing conventional collinear ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, but also highlight tantalizing functionalities in altermagnetic materials, potentially revolutionizing information technology.</description>

      <title>Effect of Particle Shape on Stratification in Drying Films of Binary Colloidal Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of particle shape in evaporation-induced auto-stratification in dispersed colloidal suspensions is explored with molecular dynamics simulations of mixtures of solid spheres, aspherical particles, and hollow spheres. A unified framework is proposed for the stratification phenomena in systems that feature size or shape dispersity on the basis of two processes: diffusion and diffusiophoresis. In general, diffusion favors the accumulation of particles that diffuse more slowly at the evaporation front. However, particles with larger surface areas have larger diffusiophoretic mobilities and are more likely to be driven away from the evaporation front by the concentration gradients of other particles with smaller surface areas. In the case of a bidisperse colloidal suspension containing small and large solid spheres studied in most of the work reported in the literature, the competition between the two leads to the so-called "small-on-top" stratification when the suspension is rapidly dried, as diffusiophoresis dominates near the interface. Here we employ a computational model of composite particles that mimics the Rouse model of polymers, where the diffusion coefficient of a particle is inversely proportional to its mass. For a mixture of solid spheres and aspherical particles or hollow spheres with similar masses, the diffusion contrast is reduced and the solid spheres are always enriched at the evaporation front, as they have the smallest surface area for a given mass and therefore the lowest diffusiophoretic mobility. The unified framework is further corroborated with a case study of a mixture of solid and hollow spheres having the same outer radius and thus the same surface area. In this case, the diffusiophoretic contrast is suppressed and the solid spheres, which have a larger mass and thus a smaller diffusion coefficient, are found to accumulate at the evaporation front.</description>

      <title>Convergence of body-orders in linear atomic cluster expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of a linear atomic cluster expansion (ACE) potential with respect to its basis functions, in terms of the effective two-body interactions of elemental Carbon systems. We build ACE potentials with descriptor sets truncated at body-orders $K=2,3,4$ trained on pure dimers, or on large datasets of different diversities but without any dimers. Potentials trained on a more diverse dataset fare better in validation and result in a nontrivial dimer curve, but still very far from the theoretical two-body interaction calculated by DFT. Moreover, dimer curves between descriptor sets clipped at different $K$ do not seem to converge to a universal function for a given dataset. We conclude that machine learning potentials employing atomic cluster expansions optimize losses at low $K$ but fail to generalize and converge properties described by two-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Advancing C-C Coupling of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction for C2+ Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production of multicarbon (C2+) products through electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is crucial to addressing global environmental challenges and advancing sustainable energy solutions. However, efficiently producing these high-value chemicals via C-C coupling reactions is a significant challenge. This requires catalysts with optimized surface configurations and electronic properties capable of breaking the scaling relations among various intermediates. In this report, we introduce the fundamentals of electrocatalytic CO2RR and the mechanism of C-C coupling. We examine the effects of catalytic surface interactions with key intermediates and reaction pathways, and discuss emerging strategies for enhancing C-C coupling reactions toward C2+ products. Despite varieties of these strategies, we summarize direct clues for the proper design of the catalyst for the electrocatalytic CO2RR towards C2+ products, aiming to provide valuable insights to broad readers in the field.</description>

      <title>Co-evolution-based Metal-binding Residue Prediction with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In computational structural biology, predicting metal-binding sites and their corresponding metal types is challenging due to the complexity of protein structures and interactions. Conventional sequence- and structure-based prediction approaches cannot capture the complex evolutionary relationships driving these interactions to facilitate understanding, while recent co-evolution-based approaches do not fully consider the entire structure of the co-evolved residue network. In this paper, we introduce MBGNN (Metal-Binding Graph Neural Network) that utilizes the entire co-evolved residue network and effectively captures the complex dependencies within protein structures via graph neural networks to enhance the prediction of co-evolved metal-binding residues and their associated metal types. Experimental results on a public dataset show that MBGNN outperforms existing co-evolution-based metal-binding prediction methods, and it is also competitive against recent sequence-based methods, showing the potential of integrating co-evolutionary insights with advanced machine learning to deepen our understanding of protein-metal interactions. The MBGNN code is publicly available at https://github.com/SRastegari/MBGNN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the appearance of an inversion-asymmetric antiferromagnetism due to an itinerant mechanism in nonsymmorphic systems with magnetic ions at Wyckoff position of multiplicity 2. The key symmetries which underpin the existence of such phases are established, and we derive a Landau free energy from a general microscopic electronic Hamiltonian. Our analysis reveals that the stable antiferromagnetic order is largely determined by the symmetries of Wyckoff position, the nature of the nesting between electronic bands, and the presence of anisotropy or nesting in high-symmetry planes of the Brillouin zone. We illustrate our conclusions with specific microscopic models.</description>

      <title>Curved crack paths are predicted by elastic-charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting crack trajectories in brittle solids remains an open challenge in fracture mechanics due to the non-local nature of crack propagation and the way cracks modify their surrounding medium. Here, we develop a framework for analytically predicting crack trajectories, similar to predicting the motion of charged particles in external fields within Newtonian mechanics. We demonstrate that a crack can be described as a distribution of elastic charges, and within the framework of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), its interaction with the background stress can be approximated by a singular geometric charge at the crack tip. The cracks motion is then predicted as the propagation of this singular charge within the unperturbed stress field. We apply our approach to study crack trajectories near defects and validate it through experiments on flat elastomer sheets containing an edge dislocation. The experimental results show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, including the convergence of curved crack trajectories toward a single focal point. We discuss future extension of our theory to the motion of multiple interacting cracks. Our findings highlight the potential of the elastic-charges approach to significantly advance classical fracture mechanics by enabling analytical solutions to problems traditionally requiring numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Polydisperse Achiral Near-Rigid Nematogens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding chirality transfer from the molecular to the macroscopic scale poses a significant challenge in soft and biological condensed matter physics. Many nanorods of biological origin not only have chiral molecular features but also exhibit a spread in contour length leading to considerable size dispersity. On top of this, random backbone fluctuations are ubiquitous for non-rigid particles but their role in chirality transfer remains difficult to disentangle from that of their native chirality imparted by their effective shape or surface architecture. We report spontaneous entropy-driven chiral symmetry breaking from molecular simulations of cholesteric liquid-crystals formed from achiral bead-spring rods with a continuous spread in contour length and marginal chain bending. The symmetry-breaking is caused by long-lived chiral conformations of long rods undergoing chiral synchronization leading to a homochiral twisted nematic. A simple theory demonstrates that even without chiral synchronization, the presence of shape-persistent configurational fluctuations along with length-dispersity can be harnessed to generate non-zero chirality at moderate polydispersity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to measure magnetic fields on the nanometre scale at cryogenic temperatures is key to understand magnetism on the quantum level and to develop materials for new storage devices or quantum computers. Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres in diamond have proven to be a robust means to harness quantum sensing for such applications. We have developed an instrument to measure the magnetic stray field of a sample with nanometre resolution from 2 K to 300 K and that accepts samples without additional preparation, especially the need to prepare a microwave line on the sample. The instrument features a software-interface for controlling and synchronising all included optical, mechanical and electronic devices and which analyses the acquired information in real time.
  We present the key features and measurement results achieved with atomic force microscopy (AFM) tips hosting an NV centre and a fully remote controllable microscope platform. The magnetometer is commercially available, and a first demonstrator has been installed in a research facility. We show micro Tesla per square root Hertz sensitivity, low noise AFM tip control and optically detected resonance scans in a closed-cycle cryostat.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Callan-Rubakov effect describes monopole-catalyzed proton decay. While this effect is fundamental for quantum field theories, its experimental observation has remained far from reality. Here, we reveal a similar, but experimentally reachable, defect-catalysis of the quantum anomaly in topological materials. In particular, surface Dirac fermions on topological insulators develop a distinct localized state at the position of dislocations or $\pi$-fluxes, which mediates spin-flip time-reversal breaking scattering or absorption of electrons. Despite the Hermiticity of topological insulators, a non-Hermitian topological number guarantees the robust existence of the localized state. Our finding implies that non-magnetic defects may behave like magnetic impurities on surfaces of topological insulators. Using the K-theory classification, we generalize this condensed-matter version of the Callan-Rubakov effect to other classes of topological materials.</description>

      <title>Phase coherence of charge-$6e$ superconductors via a frustrated Kagome XY antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental evidence for the charge-$6e$ condensed phase in kagome superconductors has generated significant interest. We investigate the unconventional superconductivity in the kagome superconductor $\mathrm{CsV_3Sb_5}$, focusing on the emergence of charge-$6e$ superconductivity (SC) at temperatures higher than the conventional charge-$2e$ SC state. By modeling the phase coherence of the SC order parameter using a frustrated antiferromagnetic XY model on an emergent kagome lattice, we show that the condensation of fractional vortices with $1/3$ vorticity stabilizes phase coherence in $\exp(i3\theta)$, giving rise to the charge-$6e$ SC state. Using a tensor network approach tailored for frustrated spin systems, we identify a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition at $T_c/J \simeq 0.075$, where the unbinding of $1/3$ fractional vortex-antivortex pairs transforms the system from the charge-$6e$ SC phase to the normal phase. Below $T_c$, the $1/3$ fractional vortex correlations exhibit power-law decay, while the integer vortex correlations decay exponentially, reflecting the dominance of charge-$6e$ SC in the absence of charge-$2e$ SC. Our results provide a theoretical understanding of the charge-$6e$ SC in two-dimensional kagome superconductors, emphasizing the interplay between fractional vortices, frustration, and topology in stabilizing this exotic SC phase.</description>

Abstract: We report a numerical study of graphene heterostructures comprised of three individual layers twisted by either the magic angle of $\sim$1.1$^\circ$, or $\sim$$30^\circ$, corresponding to the graphene quasicrystal. The heterostack is modeled using realistic structural and tight-binding models, while transport properties are calculated in both clean and disordered systems containing up to $\sim$8 million atoms. The weak interaction between different layers allows us to scrutinize the electronic mixing of flat bands and quasicrystalline states, which are altered differently in the low- and high-energy regimes and provide a new type of hybrid physics to be explored.</description>

      <title>A highly sensitive, self-adhesive, biocompatible DLP 3D printed organohydrogel for flexible sensors and wearable devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for personalized health monitoring, wearable sensors have gained attention in medical diagnostics and physiological tracking. Hydrogels, known for their mechanical properties and similarity to biological tissues, are ideal for flexible sensing. However, conventional hydrogels face challenges in stability, biocompatibility, adhesion, and long-term comfort, especially in dynamic conditions.This study presents a highly sensitive, self-adhesive, and biocompatible organohydrogel fabricated via DLP 3D printing. By integrating an entanglement-dominated crosslinking mechanism with chemical and physical crosslinking, the hydrogel achieves high elasticity, mechanical strength, and durability. Methacrylic anhydride-grafted \k{appa}-carrageenan serves as the primary network, with optimized grafting rates enhancing tensile properties and strain modulation. The copolymer network of MA-kappa-CA and ACMO benefits from steric hindrance effects, improving swelling integrity and long-term stability.Experimental results confirm sustained adhesion and structural integrity under prolonged skin exposure, making it suitable for extended wear. The hydrogel exhibits excellent tensile resilience, flexibility, and strain-sensing capabilities. In vitro studies validate its biocompatibility, supporting its biomedical potential. Furthermore, its integration into wearable smart devices demonstrates promise for cervical spine monitoring and sports rehabilitation.

Abstract: For practical superconducting quantum processors, orders of magnitude improvement in coherence is required, motivating efforts to optimize hardware design and explore new materials. Among the latter, the coherence of superconducting transmon qubits has been shown to improve by forming the qubit capacitor pads from $\alpha$-tantalum, avoiding the meta-stable $\beta$-phase that forms when depositing tantalum at room temperature, and has been previously identified to be a source of microwave losses. In this work, we show lumped element resonators containing $\beta$-phase tantalum in the form of inclusions near the metal-substrate interface with internal quality factors ($Q_\text{i}$) up to $(5.0 \pm 2.5) \times 10^6$ in the single photon regime. They outperform resonators with no sign of the $\beta$-phase in x-ray diffraction and thermal quasi-particle loss. Our results indicate that small concentrations of $\beta$-phase can be beneficial, enhancing critical magnetic fields and potentially, for improving coherence in tantalum based superconducting circuits.</description>

Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) refer to alloys composed of five or more elements in equal or near-equal amounts or in an atomic concentration range of 5 to 35 atomic percent (at%). Different elemental ratios will affect the microstructures of HEAs and provide them with unique properties. Based on past research, HEAs have exhibited superior performance, relative to most conventional alloys, with respect to many properties, such as strength, toughness, corrosion resistance, magnetic behavior, etc. Among them, fatigue behavior has been a topic of focus, due to its importance in industrial applications. In this article, we summarized the research progress in the HEA-fatigue behavior in the past ten years, including experimental results and theoretical studies in subdivisions, such as high-cycle fatigue, low-cycle fatigue, fatigue-crack growth, fatigue mechanisms, etc. The influence of the processing and test methods on HEAs is described. The accuracy of several commonly used prediction models is also outlined. Finally, unresolved issues and suggestions on the direction of future research efforts are presented.</description>

      <title>Meta-Generalized-Gradient Approximation made Magnetic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15201v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGAs) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. Among the MGGAs, the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed Approximation (SCAN) greatly improves upon GGAs from the lower rung. But the over magnetized solutions of SCAN make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. Here, we provide a solution that satisfies the most pressing {\em desiderata} for density functional approximations for ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and non-collinear states. The approach is available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of band edge optical transitions of 2D monolayer materials: A high-throughput computational study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed high-throughput density functional theory calculations of optical matrix elements between band edges across a diverse set of non-magnetic two-dimensional monolayers with direct band gaps. Materials were ranked as potential optical emitters, leading to the identification of transition-metal nitrogen halides (ZrNCl, TiNBr, TiNCl) and bismuth chalcohalides (BiTeCl) with optical coupling comparable to or exceeding MoS$_2$. Despite strong in-plane dipole transitions, most two-dimensional materials underperform bulk semiconductors due to the absence of out-of-plane components. To elucidate interband transitions, we introduced the orbital overlap tensor and established a correlation between anomalous Born effective charges and optical coupling, linking charge redistribution to transition strength. We also identified chalcogen-mediated $d$-$d$ transition as a key mechanism enabling optical responses in transition-metal dichalcogenides. We derived an analytical radiative recombination model incorporating multi-valley effects and found that excitonic corrections are essential for accurate lifetime predictions. Some direct-gap materials exhibit dark excitons as their lowest-energy states, classifying them as quasi-direct band gap semiconductors, which is critical for tuning excitonic recombination dynamics.</description>

      <title>Modeling glasses from first-principles using random structure sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an approach to approximating static properties of glasses without experimental inputs rooted in the first-principles random structure sampling. In our approach, the glassy system is represented by a collection (composite) of periodic, small-cell (few 10s of atoms) local minima on the potential energy surface. These are obtained by generating a set of periodic structures with random lattice parameters and random atomic positions, which are then relaxed to their closest local minima on the potential energy surface using the first-principles methods. Using vitreous SiO2 as an example, we illustrate and discuss how well various atomic and electronic structure properties calculated as averages over the set of such local minima reproduce experimental data. The practical benefit of our approach, which can be rigorously thought of as representing an infinitely quickly quenched liquid, is in that it transfers the computational burden to linearly scaling and easy to converge averages of properties computed on small-cell structures, rather than simulation cells with 100s if not 1000s of atoms while retaining a good overall predictive accuracy. Because of this it enables the future use of high-cost/high-accuracy electronic structure methods thereby bringing modeling of glasses and amorphous phases closer to the state of modeling of crystalline solids.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Bayesian Optimisation of Spinodoid Cellular Structures for Crush Energy Absorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the pursuit of designing safer and more efficient energy-absorbing structures, engineers must tackle the challenge of improving crush performance while balancing multiple conflicting objectives, such as maximising energy absorption and minimising peak impact forces. Accurately simulating real-world conditions necessitates the use of complex material models to replicate the non-linear behaviour of materials under impact, which comes at a significant computational cost. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a multi-objective Bayesian optimisation framework specifically developed to optimise spinodoid structures for crush energy absorption. Spinodoid structures, characterised by their scalable, non-periodic topologies and efficient stress distribution, offer a promising direction for advanced structural design. However, optimising design parameters to enhance crush performance is far from straightforward, particularly under realistic conditions. Conventional optimisation methods, although effective, often require a large number of costly simulations to identify suitable solutions, making the process both time-consuming and resource intensive. In this context, multi-objective Bayesian optimisation provides a clear advantage by intelligently navigating the design space, learning from each evaluation to reduce the number of simulations required, and efficiently addressing the complexities of non-linear material behaviour. By integrating finite element analysis with Bayesian optimisation, the framework developed in this study tackles the dual challenge of improving energy absorption and reducing peak force, particularly in scenarios where plastic deformation plays a critical role. The use of scalarisation and hypervolume-based techniques enables the identification of Pareto-optimal solutions, balancing these conflicting objectives.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial PbGeSe thin films and their photoluminescence in the mid-wave infrared</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PbSe is a narrow bandgap IV-VI compound semiconductor with application in mid-wave infrared optoelectronics, thermoelectrics, and quantum devices. Alkaline earth or rare earth elements such as Sr and Eu can substitute Pb to widen the bandgap of PbSe in heterostructure devices, but they come with challenges such as deteriorating optical and electronic properties, even in dilute concentrations due to their dissimilar atomic nature. We substitute Pb instead with column-IV Ge and assess the potential of rocksalt phase PbGeSe as a wider bandgap semiconductor in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on GaAs substrates. Low sticking of GeSe adatoms requires synthesis temperatures below 260 {\deg}C to incorporate Ge, but this yields poor structural and compositional uniformity as determined by X-ray diffraction. Consequently, as-grown films in the range Pb0.94Ge0.06Se to Pb0.83Ge0.17Se (6-17% Ge) show much less bandgap widening in photoluminescence than prior work on bulk crystals using absorption. We observe that post-growth rapid thermal annealing at temperatures of 375-450 {\deg}C improves the crystal quality and recovers bandgap widening. Rapid interdiffusion of Ge during annealing, however, remains a challenge in harnessing such PbGeSe materials for compositionally sharp heterostructures. Annealed 17%-Ge films emit light at 3-3.1 um with minimal shift in wavelength versus temperature. These samples are wider in bandgap than PbSe films by 55 meV at room temperature and the widening increases to 160 meV at 80 K, thanks to sharply different dependence of bandgap on temperature in PbSe and PbGeSe.</description>

Abstract: Deep learning-based generative models have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex data distributions and generating high-fidelity samples, offering a transformative approach to efficiently explore the configuration space of crystalline materials. In this work, we present CrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model specifically developed for the generation of crystalline materials. CrystalFlow constructs Continuous Normalizing Flows to model lattice parameters, atomic coordinates, and/or atom types, which are trained using Conditional Flow Matching techniques. Through an appropriate choice of data representation and the integration of a graph-based equivariant neural network, the model effectively captures the fundamental symmetries of crystalline materials, which ensures data-efficient learning and enables high-quality sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that CrystalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard generation benchmarks, and exhibits versatile conditional generation capabilities including producing structures optimized for specific external pressures or desired material properties. These features highlight the model's potential to address realistic crystal structure prediction challenges, offering a robust and efficient framework for advancing data-driven research in condensed matter physics and material science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shift current photovoltaic effect is conventionally understood as the real-space displacement of a wave packet induced by photoexcitation. However, this interpretation becomes insufficient in flat-band systems, where quasiparticles are too massive to accelerate in real space under the optical electric field. Here, we developed a physically consistent method to decompose the shift current into real-space and momentum-space components. A surprising pure momentum-space shift current is found theoretically in flat-band Mott insulator Nb$_3$X$_8$ (X = Cl, Br, I) monolayers. This work underscores that significant shift current responses can emerge even in systems with minimal interband polarization differences, highlighting the potential for exploring novel bulk photovoltaic effects in flat-band Mott insulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One effective way to prevent toxicity and improve the stability of materials for photovoltaic applications is to exclude lead and organic molecules from perovskite materials. Specifically, the CsSn1-xGexI3 appears to be a promising contender; nonetheless, it requires optimization, particularly bandgap tuning by doping concentration modifications. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) was employed to comprehensively analyze the electronic properties of CsSn1-xGexI3 that influenced light-matter interactions tuning of the perovskite materials by varying composition in B site atoms. We use the solar cell capacitance (SCAPS-1D) simulator to compute device performance; however, it computes the absorption spectrum using a simplified mathematical function that approximates the actual spectrum. To achieve a quantum-mechanical level of accuracy DFT extracted parameters like absorption spectra and bandgap were fed into SCAPS-1D. We find that increasing the Ge concentration leads to a higher bandgap and improved absorption profile, thereby enhancing solar energy conversion efficiency. Thermal and field distribution analyses were also done for the optimized device through a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework. By optimizing the absorber layer with a 75% Ge concentration, we achieve a remarkable PCE of 23.80%. Our findings guide future research in designing high-performance non-leaded halide PSCs, paving the way for low-cost, stable, and highly efficient solar cells through atomic doping-tuned perovskite absorber layers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferroelectric HfO$_2$ has garnered significant attention for its promising application in high density nonvolatile data storage and nanoscale transistors. However, the uncertain origin of polarization in HfO$_2$ limits our ability to fully understand and control its ferroelectricity. The ongoing debate centers on whether HfO$_2$ is a proper or improper ferroelectric, as it exhibits characteristics of both types. In this study, we utilize symmetry-guided first-principles quantum mechanical (DFT) calculations to accurately map the energy landscape and identify the coherent switching pathway of HfO$_2$ by voltage. Our findings reveal two key insights. First, ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ is driven by a triggered mechanism through coupling between the stable polar mode and hybrid non-polar modes. Second, unusually high polarization arises from the hybrid modes, which consists solely of non-polar modes. The results fundamentally transforms the perspective on polarization in HfO$_2$ and resolve conflicting characteristics observed, offering valuable guidance for superior technological applications.</description>

      <title>Topology-induced symmetry breaking demonstrated in antiferromagnetic magnons on a M\"obius strip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07846v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of topology-induced symmetry breaking, where certain local symmetry preserved by the Hamiltonian is explicitly broken in the eigenmodes of excitation due to topologically nontrivial boundary conditions. We demonstrate this phenomenon by studying magnonic excitations on a M\"obius strip comprising of two antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains. Even with a simple Hamiltonian respecting local rotational symmetry and all local curvature effects ignored, magnons exhibit linear polarization of the N\'eel vector devoid of chirality, forming two non-degenerate branches that cannot be smoothly connected to or be decomposed by the circularly-polarized magnons. Correspondingly, one branch undergoes a spectral shift and only admits standing waves of half-integer wavelength, whereas the other only affords standing waves of integer wavelength. The suppression of chirality in the order parameter dynamics, hence the pattern of standing waves, can be generalized to other elementary excitations on non-orientable surfaces. Under the M\"obius boundary condition, we further identify an exotic phase hosting spontaneous antiferromagnetic order whilst all exchange couplings are ferromagnetic. Our findings showcase the profound influence of real-space topology on the physical nature of not just the ground state but also the quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Higher Landau-Level Analogs and Signatures of Non-Abelian States in Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental discovery of fractional Chern insulators at zero magnetic field in moir\'e superlattices has sparked intense interests in bringing Landau level physics to flat Chern bands. In twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers (tMoTe$_2$), recent theoretical and experimental studies have found three consecutive flat Chern bands at twist angle $\sim 2^\circ$. In this work, we investigate whether higher Landau level physics can be found in these consecutive Chern bands. At twist angles $2.00^\circ$ and $1.89^\circ$, we identify four consecutive $C = 1$ bands for the $K$ valley in tMoTe$_2$. By constructing Wannier functions directly from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a six-orbital model is developed to describe the consecutive Chern bands, with the orbitals forming a honeycomb lattice. Exact diagonalization on top of Hartree-Fock calculations are carried out with the Wannier functions. Especially, when the second moir\'e miniband is half-filled, signatures of non-Abelian states are found. Our Wannier-based approach in modelling moir\'e superlattices is faithful to DFT wave functions and can serve as benchmarks for continuum models. The possibility of realizing non-Abelian anyons at zero magnetic field also opens up a new pathway for fault-tolerant quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetization from interface reflections in a conductor with charge current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11979v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that a high-quality flat interface or boundary can serve as a long-range skew scatterer for charged quasiparticles in a metal. When an electric current flows parallel to the interface, the balance between clockwise and counterclockwise reflections is disrupted, leading to a net orbital magnetization. This magnetization is maximized at the interface and varies linearly in the direction perpendicular to it. We suggest that this effect can be detected using spatially resolved Kerr effect measurements at distances up to the electron phase coherence length from the interface. Unlike the orbital Hall and orbital Edelstein effects, the proposed phenomenon does not require inversion symmetry breaking in the bulk of the sample and is unrelated to Hall effect physics.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism in Heavy Fermion Systems: Mean-Field study on Kondo Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a novel collinear magnet, i.e. the altermagnet (AM), with spin-splitting energy band and zero net magnetization have attracted great interest due to its potential spintronic applications. Here, we demonstrate AM-like phases in a microscopic Kondo lattice (KL) model with an alternating next-nearest-neighbor-hopping (NNNH). Such alternating NNNH take nonmagnetic atoms, neglected in usual antiferromagnetism study, into account when encountering real-life candidate AM materials. With the framework of fermionic parton mean-field theory, we find three different ground-states for the half-filling KL: 1) a $d$-wave AM state; 2) a coexistent phase with both $d$-wave AM and intrinsic Kondo screening effect; 3) a Kondo insulator. The AM-like states are characterized by their spin-splitting quasiparticle bands, Fermi surface, spin-resolved distribution function and conductivity. It is suggested that the magnetic quantum oscillation, scanning tunneling microscopy and charge transport measurement can detect those AM-like phases. We hope the present work may be useful for exploring AM-like phases in $f$-electron compounds such as CeNiAsO and Ce$_{4}$X$_{3}$(X=As,Sb,Bi).</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology for Structural Characterization in Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14390v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework based on persistent homology (PH) to characterize both local and global structures in disordered systems. It can simultaneously generate local and global descriptors using the same algorithm and data structure, and has shown to be highly effective and interpretable in predicting particle rearrangements and classifying global phases. We also demonstrated that using a single variable enables a linear SVM to achieve nearly perfect three-phase classification. Inspired by this discovery, we define a non-parametric metric, the Separation Index (SI), which not only achieves this classification without sacrificing significant performance but also establishes a connection between particle environments and the global phase structure. Our methods provide an effective framework for understanding and analyzing the properties of disordered materials, with broad potential applications in materials science and even wider studies of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Comparison of NiFeCr and NiFe in ferromagnetic Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic materials are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. Some memory applications rely on the ability to reverse the magnetization direction of a "soft" magnetic layer within the junction using a small local magnetic field generated on the chip. It is crucial, therefore, to find a suitable soft magnetic material with a low switching field and low switching energy. A popular magnetic material for such applications is Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$, also known as Permalloy, however Permalloy has a rather large magnetization, leading to large magnetic switching energies. In this work we explore Cr-doped Permalloy, specifically Ni$_{73}$Fe$_{18}$Cr$_{9}$, which has a saturation magnetization just under two-thirds that of Permalloy. Josephson junctions containing this NiFeCr alloy undergo a 0-$\pi$ transition at a NiFeCr thickness of 2.3 nm, and the critical supercurrent decays in the alloy over a short characteristic length of 0.36 nm. Switching fields of a few millitesla are promising, but the short decay length and overall small values of the critical current in the Josephson junctions may preclude the use of NiFeCr in current cryogenic memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Apparent nonreciprocal transport in FeSe bulk crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We performed low-frequency ac first- and second-harmonic resistance measurements and dc $I-V$ measurements on bulk FeSe crystals in a temperature range between 1.8 and 150 K and in magnetic field up to 14 T. We observed considerable second-harmonic resistance, indicative of nonreciprocal charge transport, in some samples. By examining correlation between contact resistances and second-harmonic signals, we concluded that the second-harmonic resistance was not due to the genuine nonreciprocal transport effect but was caused by joule heating at a current contact through the thermoelectric effect. Our conclusion is consistent with a recent preprint (Nagata \textit{et al.}, arXiv:2409.01715), in which the authors reported a zero-field superconducting diode effect in devices fabricated with FeSe flakes and attributed it to the thermoelectric effect.</description>
