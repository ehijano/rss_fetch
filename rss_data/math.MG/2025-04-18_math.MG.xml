      <title>Intersections of random chords of a circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Where are the intersection points of diagonals of a regular $n$-gon located? What is the distribution of the intersection point of two random chords of a circle? We investigate these and related new questions in geometric probability, extend a largely forgotten result of Karamata, and elucidate its connection to the Bertrand paradox.</description>

      <title>Minkowski chirality: a measure of reflectional asymmetry of convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an optimal containment approach, we quantify the asymmetry of convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with respect to reflections across affine subspaces of a given dimension. We prove general inequalities relating these ''Minkowski chirality'' measures to Banach--Mazur distances and to each other, and prove their continuity with respect to the Hausdorff distance. In the planar case, we determine the reflection axes at which the Minkowski chirality of triangles and parallelograms is attained, and show that $\sqrt{2}$ is a tight upper bound on the chirality in both cases.</description>

      <title>Boxing inequalities in Banach spaces and Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the following result: For each closed $n$-dimensional manifold $M$ in a (finite or infinite-dimensional) Banach space $B$, and each positive real $m\leq n$ there exists a pseudomanifold $W^{n+1}\subset B$ such that $\partial W^{n+1}=M^n$ and ${\rm HC}_m(W^{n+1})\leq c(m){\rm HC}_m(M^n)$. Here ${\rm HC}_m(X)$ denotes the $m$-dimensional Hausdorff content, i.e the infimum of $\Sigma_i r_i^m$, where the infimum is taken over all coverings of $X$ by a finite collection of open metric balls, and $r_i$ denote the radii of these balls.
  In the classical case, when $B=\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, this result implies that if $\Omega\subset R^{n+1}$ is a bounded domain, then for all $m\in (0,n]$ ${\rm HC}_m(\Omega)\leq c(m){\rm HC}_m(\partial \Omega)$. This inequality seems to be new despite being well-known and widely used in the case, when $m=n$ (Gustin's boxing inequality, [G]).
  The result is a corollary of the following more general theorem that strengthens a theorem in [LLNR]: For each compact subset $X$ in a Banach space $B$ and positive real number $m$ such that ${\rm HC}_m(X)\not= 0$ there exists a finite $(\lceil m\rceil-1)$-dimensional simplicial complex $K\subset B$, a continuous map $\phi:X\longrightarrow K$, and a homotopy $H:X\times [0,1]\longrightarrow B$ between the inclusion of $X$ and $\phi$ (regarded as a map into $B$) such that: (1) For each $x\in X$ $\Vert x-\phi(x)\Vert_B\leq c_1(m){\rm HC}_m^{\frac{1}{m}}(X)$; (2) ${\rm HC}_m(H(X\times [0,1]))\leq c_2(m){\rm HC}_m(X)$. A similar theorem can also be proven in the case when $B$ is a metric space with a linear contractibility function and applies to all compact sets $X$ with a controllably small ${\rm HC}_m$ in Riemannian manifolds $M^n$ with the sectional curvature bounded below, the volume bounded below by a positive number, and the diameter bounded above.</description>

      <title>Small separators, upper bounds for $l^\infty$-widths, and systolic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dependence on the dimension in the inequalities that relate the Euclidean volume of a closed submanifold $M^n\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ with its $l^\infty$-width $W^{l^\infty}_{n-1}(M^n)$ defined as the infimum over all continuous maps $\phi:M^n\longrightarrow K^{n-1}\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ of $sup_{x\in M^n}\Vert \phi(x)-x\Vert_{l^\infty}$. We prove that $W^{l^\infty}_{n-1}(M^n)\leq const\ \sqrt{n}\ vol(M^n)^{\frac{1}{n}}$, and if the codimension $N-n$ is equal to $1$, then $W^{l^\infty}_{n-1}(M^n)\leq \sqrt{3}\ vol(M^n)^{\frac{1}{n}}$.
  As a corollary, we prove that if $M^n\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is {\it essential}, then there exists a non-contractible closed curve on $M^n$ contained in a cube in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with side length $const\ \sqrt{n}\ vol^{\frac{1}{n}}(M^n)$ with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. If the codimension is $1$, then the side length of the cube is $4\ vol^{\frac{1}{n}}(M^n)$.
  To prove these results we introduce a new approach to systolic geometry that can be described as a non-linear version of the classical Federer-Fleming argument, where we push out from a specially constructed non-linear $(N-n)$-dimensional complex in $\mathbb{R}^N$ that does not intersect $M^n$. To construct these complexes we first prove a version of kinematic formula where one averages over isometries of $l^N_\infty$ (Theorem 3.5), and introduce high-codimension analogs of optimal foams recently discovered in [KORW] and [AK].</description>

      <title>Computing the Tropical Abel--Jacobi Transform and Tropical Distances for Metric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metric graphs are important models for capturing the structure of complex data across various domains. While much effort has been devoted to extracting geometric and topological features from graph data, computational aspects of metric graphs as abstract tropical curves remains unexplored. In this paper, we present the first computational and machine learning-driven study of metric graphs from the perspective of tropical algebraic geometry. Specifically, we study the tropical Abel--Jacobi transform, a vectorization of points on a metric graph via the tropical Abel--Jacobi map into its associated flat torus, the tropical Jacobian. We develop algorithms to compute this transform and investigate how the resulting embeddings depend on different combinatorial models of the same metric graph.
  Once embedded, we compute pairwise distances between points in the tropical Jacobian under two natural metrics: the tropical polarization distance and the Foster--Zhang distance. Computing these distances are generally NP-hard as they turn out to be linked to classical lattice problems in computational complexity, however, we identify a class of metric graphs where fast and explicit computations are feasible. For the general case, we propose practical algorithms for both exact and approximate distance matrix computations using lattice basis reduction and mixed-integer programming solvers. Our work lays the groundwork for future applications of tropical geometry and the tropical Abel--Jacobi transform in machine learning and data analysis.</description>
