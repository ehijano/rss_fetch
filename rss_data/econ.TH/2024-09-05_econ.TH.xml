      <title>Group knowledge and individual introspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study distributed knowledge, which is what privately informed agents come to know by communicating freely with one another and sharing everything they know. Agents are not necessarily fully rational and differ in the ability to form higher-order knowledge. We model the inference making process that leads to distributed knowledge, and we do that by introducing revision operators and revision types. Since reasoning abilities can be heterogeneous, inference making turns out to be order dependent. We show that there are two qualitatively different cases of how distributed knowledge is attained. In the first, distributed knowledge is determined by any group member who can replicate all the inferences that anyone else in the group makes. This result is in line with the extant literature. In the second case, no member can replicate all the inferences that are made within the group. As a result, distributed knowledge is determined by any two group members who can jointly replicate what anyone else infers. This case can be interpreted as a form of wisdom of crowd effect and shows that, contrary to what is generally believed, distributed knowledge cannot always be reduced to the reasoning abilities of a single group member.</description>

      <title>Optimal Auction Design with Flexible Royalty Payments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the design of an auction for an income-generating asset such as an intellectual property license. Each bidder has a signal about his future income from acquiring the asset. After the asset is allocated, the winner's income is realized privately. The principal can audit the winner, at a cost, and then charge a payment contingent on the winner's realized income. We solve for a dynamic mechanism that maximizes revenue, net auditing costs. The winning bidder is charged linear royalties up to a cap. A higher bidder pays more in cash and faces a lower royalty cap.</description>

      <title>Undominated monopoly regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study undominated mechanisms with transfers for regulating a monopolist who privately observes the marginal cost of production. We show that in any undominated mechanism, there is a quantity floor, which depends only on the primitives, and the regulator's operation decision is stochastic only if the monopolist produces at the quantity floor. We provide a near-complete characterization of the set of undominated mechanisms and use it to (a) provide a foundation for deterministic mechanisms, (b) show that the efficient mechanism is dominated, and (c) derive a max-min optimal regulatory mechanism.</description>
