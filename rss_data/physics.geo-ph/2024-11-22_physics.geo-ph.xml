      <title>Persistent but weak magnetic field at Moon's midlife revealed by Chang'e-5 basalt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of the lunar magnetic field can reveal the Moon's interior structure, thermal history, and surface environment. The mid-to-late stage evolution of the lunar magnetic field is poorly constrained, and thus the existence of a long-lived lunar dynamo remains controversial. The Chang'e-5 mission returned the heretofore youngest mare basalts from Oceanus Procellarum uniquely positioned at mid-latitude. We recovered weak paleointensities of 2-4 uT from the Chang'e-5 basalt clasts at 2 billion years ago, attestting to the longevity of a lunar dynamo until at least the Moon's midlife. This paleomagnetic result implies the existence of thermal convection in the lunar deep interior at the lunar mid-stage which may have supplied mantle heat flux for the young volcanism.</description>

      <title>Enhanced receiver function imaging of crustal structures using symmetric autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Receiver-function (RF) is a crustal imaging technique that entails deconvolving the radial or transverse component with the vertical component seismogram. Analysis of the variations of RFs along backazimuth and slowness is the key in determining the geometry and anisotropic properties of the crustal layers. Nonetheless, pseudorandom nuisance effects, influenced by the unknown earthquake source signature and seismic noise, are produced by the deconvolution process and obstruct precise comparisons of RFs across different backazimuths. Various methods such as weighted stacking, sparsity-induced transform and supervised denoising neural-network have been developed to reduce the nuisance effects. However, the common assumption of the nuisance effects as random Gaussian proves inadequate. Supervised denoising neural-network struggles to generalize effectively in intricate tectonic environments like subduction zones. In this study, we take an unsupervised approach where a network-based representation of a group of RFs with similar raypaths, enables disentanglement of the coherent crustal effects from the RF-specific nuisance effects. The representation learning task is performed using symmetric autoencoders (SymAE). SymAE effectively generates virtual RFs that capture coherent crustal effects and mitigate nuisance effects. Applied to synthetic RFs with real data-derived nuisances, our method exceeds bin-wise and phase-weighted stacking in quality and accuracy. Using real Cascadia Subduction Zone data, it enhances RFs and aids in interpreting a dual-layer subducting slab. We also provided sanity checks to verify the accuracy of the network-derived virtual RFs. One major advantage of our method is its ability to utilize all available earthquakes, irrespective of their signal quality, thereby enhancing reproducibility and enabling automation in RF analysis.</description>

      <title>Fluid flow channeling and mass transport with discontinuous porosity distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow of fluids within porous rocks is an important process with numerous applications in Earth sciences. Modeling the compaction-driven fluid flow requires the solution of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations that account for the fluid flow and the solid deformation within the porous medium. Despite the nonlinear relation of porosity and permeability that is commonly encountered, natural data show evidence of channelized fluid flow in rocks that have an overall layered structure. Layers of different rock types routinely have discontinuous hydraulic and mechanical properties. We present numerical results obtained by a novel space-time method which can handle discontinuous initial porosity (and permeability) distributions. The space-time method enables a straightforward coupling to models of mass transport for trace elements. Our results show the influence of different kinds of layering in the development of fluid-rich channels and mass transport.</description>

      <title>Integrating Physics of the Problem into Data-Driven Methods to Enhance Elastic Full-Waveform Inversion with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a nonlinear iterative seismic imaging technique that, by reducing the misfit between recorded and predicted seismic waveforms, can produce detailed estimates of subsurface geophysical properties. Nevertheless, the strong nonlinearity of FWI can trap the optimization in local minima. This issue arises due to factors such as improper initial values, the absence of low frequencies in the measurements, noise, and other related considerations. To address this challenge and with the advent of advanced machine-learning techniques, data-driven methods, such as deep learning, have attracted significantly increasing attention in the geophysical community. Furthermore, the elastic wave equation should be included in FWI to represent elastic effects accurately. The intersection of data-driven techniques and elastic scattering theories presents opportunities and challenges. In this paper, by using the knowledge of elastic scattering (physics of the problem) and integrating it with machine learning techniques, we propose methods for the solution of time-harmonic FWI to enhance accuracy compared to pure data-driven and physics-based approaches. Moreover, to address uncertainty quantification, by modifying the structure of the Variational Autoencoder, we introduce a probabilistic deep learning method based on the physics of the problem that enables us to explore the uncertainties of the solution. According to the limited availability of datasets in this field and to assess the performance and accuracy of the proposed methods, we create a comprehensive dataset close to reality and conduct a comparative analysis of the presented approaches to it.</description>

      <title>Inverse non-linear problem of the long wave run-up on coast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the process of catastrophic tsunami-type waves on the coast makes it possible to determine the destructive force of waves on the coast. In hydrodynamics, the one-dimensional theory of the run-up of non-linear waves on a flat slope has gained great popularity, within which rigorous analytical results have been obtained in the class of non-breaking waves. In general, the result depends on the characteristics of the wave approaching (or generated on) the slope, which is usually not known in the measurements. Here we describe a rigorous method for recovering the initial displacement in a source localised in an inclined power-shaped channel from the characteristics of a moving shoreline. The method uses the generalised Carrier-Greenspan transformation, which allows one-dimensional non-linear shallow-water equations to be reduced to linear ones. The solution is found in terms of Erd\'elyi-Kober integral operator. Numerical verification of our results is presented for the cases of a parabolic bay and an infinite plane beach.</description>
