      <title>ART-Rx: A Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Controlled Adaptive Real-Time Threshold Receiver for Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) in microfluidic channels faces significant challenges in signal detection due to the stochastic nature of molecule propagation and dynamic, noisy environments. Conventional detection methods often struggle under varying channel conditions, leading to high bit error rates (BER) and reduced communication efficiency. This paper introduces ART-Rx, a novel Adaptive Real-Time Threshold Receiver for MC that addresses these challenges. Implemented within a conceptual system-on-chip (SoC), ART-Rx employs a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to dynamically adjust the detection threshold based on observed errors in real time. Comprehensive simulations using MATLAB and Smoldyn compare ART-Rx's performance against a statistically optimal detection threshold across various scenarios, including different levels of interference, concentration shift keying (CSK) levels, flow velocities, transmitter-receiver distances, diffusion coefficients, and binding rates. The results demonstrate that ART-Rx significantly outperforms conventional methods, maintaining consistently low BER and bit error probabilities (BEP) even in high-noise conditions and extreme channel environments. The system exhibits exceptional robustness to interference and shows the potential to enable higher data rates in CSK modulation. Furthermore, because ART-Rx is effectively adaptable to varying environmental conditions in microfluidic channels, it offers a computationally efficient and straightforward approach to enhance signal detection in nanoscale communication systems. This approach presents a promising control theory-based solution to improve the reliability of data transmission in practical MC systems, with potential applications in healthcare, brain-machine interfaces (BMI), and the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT).</description>

      <title>Optimal State Preparation for Logical Arrays on Zoned Neutral Atom Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises to solve problems previously deemed infeasible. However, high error rates necessitate quantum error correction for practical applications. Seminal experiments with zoned neutral atom architectures have shown remarkable potential for fault-tolerant quantum computing. To fully harness their potential, efficient software solutions are vital. A key aspect of quantum error correction is the initialization of physical qubits representing a logical qubit in a highly entangled state. This process, known as state preparation, is the foundation of most quantum error correction codes and, hence, a crucial step towards fault-tolerant quantum computing. Generating a schedule of target-specific instructions to perform the state preparation is highly complex. First software tools exist but are not suitable for the zoned neutral atom architectures. This work addresses this gap by leveraging the computational power of SMT solvers and generating minimal schedules for the state preparation of logical arrays. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that actively utilizing zones to shield idling qubits consistently results in higher fidelities than solutions disregarding these zones. The complete code is publicly available in open-source as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qmap/tree/main/src/na/nasp.</description>

      <title>SpecPCM: A Low-power PCM-based In-Memory Computing Accelerator for Full-stack Mass Spectrometry Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) is essential for proteomics and metabolomics but faces impending challenges in efficiently processing the vast volumes of data. This paper introduces SpecPCM, an in-memory computing (IMC) accelerator designed to achieve substantial improvements in energy and delay efficiency for both MS spectral clustering and database (DB) search. SpecPCM employs analog processing with low-voltage swing and utilizes recently introduced phase change memory (PCM) devices based on superlattice materials, optimized for low-voltage and low-power programming. Our approach integrates contributions across multiple levels: application, algorithm, circuit, device, and instruction sets. We leverage a robust hyperdimensional computing (HD) algorithm with a novel dimension-packing method and develop specialized hardware for the end-to-end MS pipeline to overcome the non-ideal behavior of PCM devices. We further optimize multi-level PCM devices for different tasks by using different materials. We also perform a comprehensive design exploration to improve energy and delay efficiency while maintaining accuracy, exploring various combinations of hardware and software parameters controlled by the instruction set architecture (ISA). SpecPCM, with up to three bits per cell, achieves speedups of up to 82x and 143x for MS clustering and DB search tasks, respectively, along with a four-orders-of-magnitude improvement in energy efficiency compared with state-of-the-art CPU/GPU tools.</description>

      <title>O-RAN and 6G: The Future of Wireless Innovation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of 6G technology represents a significant advancement in wireless communications, providing unprecedented speed, extremely low latency, and pioneering applications. In light of this development, an important question arises: Can the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN), with its emphasis on openness, flexibility, RAN slicing, RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), and cost-effectiveness, fulfill the complex requirements of 6G? This paper delves into the potential synergy between O-RAN and 6G, illustrating how O-RAN can facilitate customization, reduce expenses, and stimulate innovation in next-generation networks. We also tackle the challenges associated with 6G, such as the need for exceptional performance, integration with non-terrestrial networks, and heightened security. By examining the interaction between O-RAN and 6G, we underscore their joint role in shaping the future of wireless communication. Lastly, we demonstrate the potential of O-RAN through a unique, learning-based spectrum-sharing solution that aligns with the objectives of 6G for efficient spectrum usage.</description>

      <title>MicroCrackAttentionNeXt: Advancing Microcrack Detection in Wave Field Analysis Using Deep Neural Networks through Feature Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro Crack detection using deep neural networks (DNNs) through an automated pipeline using wave fields interacting with the damaged areas is highly sought after. These high-dimensional spatio-temporal crack data are limited, and these datasets have large dimensions in the temporal domain. The dataset presents a substantial class imbalance, with crack pixels constituting an average of only 5% of the total pixels per sample. This extreme class imbalance poses a challenge for deep learning models with the different micro-scale cracks, as the network can be biased toward predicting the majority class, generally leading to poor detection accuracy. This study builds upon the previous benchmark SpAsE-Net, an asymmetric encoder-decoder network for micro-crack detection. The impact of various activation and loss functions were examined through feature space visualization using the manifold discovery and analysis (MDA) algorithm. The optimized architecture and training methodology achieved an accuracy of 86.85%.</description>

      <title>Quantum-assisted Stacking Sequence Retrieval and Laminated Composite Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We, the QAIMS lab lab at the Aerospace Faculty of TU Delft, participated as finalists in the Airbus/BMW Quantum Computing Challenge 2024. Stacking sequence retrieval, a complex combinatorial task within a bi-level optimization framework, is crucial for designing laminated composites that meet aerospace requirements for weight, strength, and stiffness. This document presents the scientifically relevant sections of our submission, which builds on our prior research on applying quantum computation to this challenging design problem. For the competition, we expanded our previous work in several significant ways. First, we incorporated a full set of manufacturing constraints into our algorithmic framework, including those previously established theoretically but not yet demonstrated, thereby aligning our approach more closely with real-world manufacturing demands. We implemented the F-VQE algorithm, which enhances the probability shaping of optimal solutions, improving on simpler variational quantum algorithms. Our approach also demonstrates flexibility by accommodating diverse objectives as well as finer ply-angle increments alongside the previously demonstrated conventional ply angles. Scalability was tested using the DMRG algorithm, which, despite limitations in entanglement representation, enabled simulations with up to 200 plies. Results were directly compared to conventional stacking sequence retrieval algorithms with DMRG showing high competitiveness. Given DMRG's limited entanglement capabilities, it serves as a conservative baseline, suggesting potential for even greater performance on fully realized quantum systems. This document serves to make our competition results publicly available as we prepare a formal publication on these findings and their implications for aerospace materials design optimization.</description>

      <title>The Spatial Complexity of Optical Computing and How to Reduce It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Similar to algorithms, which consume time and memory to run, hardware requires resources to function. For devices processing physical waves, implementing operations needs sufficient "space," as dictated by wave physics. How much space is needed to perform a certain function is a fundamental question in optics, with recent research addressing it for given mathematical operations, but not for more general computing tasks, e.g., classification. Inspired by computational complexity theory, we study the "spatial complexity" of optical computing systems in terms of scaling laws - specifically, how their physical dimensions must scale as the dimension of the mathematical operation increases - and propose a new paradigm for designing optical computing systems: space-efficient neuromorphic optics, based on structural sparsity constraints and neural pruning methods motivated by wave physics (notably, the concept of "overlapping nonlocality"). On two mainstream platforms, free-space optics and on-chip integrated photonics, our methods demonstrate substantial size reductions (to 1%-10% the size of conventional designs) with minimal compromise on performance. Our theoretical and computational results reveal a trend of diminishing returns on accuracy as structure dimensions increase, providing a new perspective for interpreting and approaching the ultimate limits of optical computing - a balanced trade-off between device size and accuracy.</description>
