      <title>The EM Algorithm in Information Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this thesis is to convey the basic concepts of information geometry and its applications to non-specialists and those in applied fields, assuming only a first-year undergraduate background in calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory / statistics. We first begin with an introduction to the EM algorithm, providing a typical use case in Python, before moving to an overview of basic Riemannian geometry. We then introduce the core concepts of information geometry and the $em$ algorithm, with an explicit calculation of both the $e$ and $m$ projection, before closing with a discussion of an important application of this research to the field of deep learning, providing a novel implementation in Python.</description>

      <title>A Topology Scavenger Hunt to Introduce Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology at the undergraduate level is often a theoretical mathematics course, introducing concepts from point-set topology or possibly algebraic topology. However, the last two decades have seen an explosion of growth in applied topology and topological data analysis, which are topics that can be presented in an accessible way to undergraduate students and can encourage exciting projects. For the past several years, the Topology course at Macalester College has included content from point-set and algebraic topology, as well as applied topology, culminating in a project chosen by the students. In the course, students work through a topology scavenger hunt as an activity to introduce the ideas and software behind some of the primary tools in topological data analysis, namely, persistent homology and mapper. This scavenger hunt includes a variety of point clouds of varying dimensions, such as an annulus in 2D, a bouquet of loops in 3D, a sphere in 4D, and a torus in 400D. The students' goal is to analyze each point cloud with a variety of software to infer the topological structure. After completing this activity, students are able to extend the ideas learned in the scavenger hunt to an open-ended capstone project. Examples of past projects include: using persistence to explore the relationship between country development and geography, to analyze congressional voting patterns, and to classify genres of a large corpus of texts by combining with tools from natural language processing and machine learning.</description>

      <title>It is not "B\'ezout's identity"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two non-zero integers $a$ and $b$ there exist integers $m$ and $n$ for which $am-bn =(a,b)$. An increasing number of mathematicians have been calling this `B\'ezout's identity', some encouraged by finding "identit\'e de B\'ezout" in Bourbaki's \emph{'El\'ements de math\'ematique}. Moreover the observation that if $\gcd(a,b)=1$ then this is an `if and only if' condition, is sometimes called the "Bachet-B\'ezout theorem".
  However this is all in Euclid's work from around 300 B.C., when his writings are interpreted in context. So why does he not get credit? Some authors learned the name "B\'ezout's identity" and have perhaps not consulted Euclid, so copied the misattribution. Others, like some Nicolas Bourbaki collaborators, have perhaps browsed Euclid's results, but in a form written for the modern mathematician, and missed out on what he really did (though certainly others, such as Weil, did not). In this article we will carefully explain what Euclid's arguments are and what his approach was. We will also share Kowalski's guess as to the reasons behind Bourbaki's misnomer.
  To appreciate Euclid, you need to read his work in context: Lengths are the central object of study to the geometer Euclid, though he brilliantly developed the theory of the numbers that measured those lengths. Today's mathematicians read his number theory results as being about abstract numbers not measurements. However the correct interpretation changes how these results are perceived; Euclid's proofs make clear Euclid's intentions.
  These misperceptions reflect recent discussions about difficulties faced by indigenous people when learning mathematics. We discuss how some indigenous groups may learn numbers in certain practical contexts, not as abstract entities, and struggle when curricula assume that we all share abstract numbers as a basic, primary fully-absorbed working tool.</description>

      <title>A Discussion of Arnold's Limit Problem and its Geometric Argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upon re-examining Arnold's established lemma for explaining his famous limit problem, we have determined that while the lemma itself is correct, there is a defect in the original geometric proof. In this paper, we prove the correctness of the lemma using methods of power series, and construct a counterexample to illustrate the defect in Arnold's geometric proof.</description>

      <title>Cycles in graphs and in hypergraphs (in Russian)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this expository paper we present some ideas of algebraic topology in a language accessible to non-specialists in the area. A $1$-cycle in a graph is a set $C$ of edges such that every vertex is contained in an even number of edges from $C$. It is easy to check that the sum (modulo $2$) of $1$-cycles is a $1$-cycle. We start from the following problems: to find
  $\bullet$ the number of all $1$-cycles in a given graph;
  $\bullet$ a small number of $1$-cycles in a given graph such that any $1$-cycle is the sum of some of them.
  We consider generalizations (of these problems) to graphs with symmetry, to $2$-cycles in $2$-dimensional hypergraphs, and to certain configuration spaces of graphs (namely, to the square and the deleted square).</description>

      <title>Using mathematics to study how people influence each other's opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People sometimes change their opinions when they discuss things with other people. Researchers study mathematical models of opinions to explore how people influence each other through their social interactions. In today's digital world, these models can help us learn how to promote accurate information and reduce unwanted influence. In this article, we discuss a simple mathematical model that looks at opinion changes from social interactions. We briefly describe what opinion models can tell us and how researchers try to make them more realistic.</description>

      <title>Score-based Diffusion Models via Stochastic Differential Equations -- a Technical Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is an expository article on the score-based diffusion models, with a particular focus on the formulation via stochastic differential equations (SDE). After a gentle introduction, we discuss the two pillars in the diffusion modeling -- sampling and score matching, which encompass the SDE/ODE sampling, score matching efficiency, the consistency models, and reinforcement learning. Short proofs are given to illustrate the main idea of the stated results. The article is primarily a technical introduction to the field, and practitioners may also find some analysis useful in designing new models or algorithms.</description>
