      <title>Theoretical Discovery, Experiment, and Controversy in the Aharonov-Bohm Effect: An Oral History Interview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This oral history interview provides Yakir Aharonov's perspective on the theoretical discovery of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in 1959, during his PhD studies in Bristol with David Bohm, the reception of the effect, the efforts to test it empirically (up to Tonomura's experiment), and some of the debates regarding the existence of the effect and its interpretation. The interview also discusses related later developments until the 1980s, including modular momentum and Berry's phase. It includes recollections from meetings with Werner Heisenberg, Richard Feynman, and Chen-Ning Yang, also mentioning John Bell, Robert Chambers, Werner Ehrenberg, Sir Charles Frank, Wendell Furry, Gunnar K\"all\'en, Maurice Pryce, Nathan Rosen, John Wheeler, and Eugene Wigner.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Unifying Aspects of Generalized Calculus"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Czachor's recent proposal introduces a form of non-Newtonian calculus built by pulling back arithmetic operations through arbitrary bijections between continua. Although the idea is mathematically inventive, it runs into serious conceptual trouble when examined from a physical standpoint. Claims of universal applicability quickly unravel under scrutiny -- especially when considering pathological bijections like the Cantor function, which break the framework's core assumptions. When applied to domains such as relativity, entropy, or cosmology, the results often collapse into tautological restatements lacking real predictive power. This commentary explores these issues in depth, highlighting where and why the formalism falls short of providing a physically coherent theory.</description>

      <title>A disputable assumption behind the empirical equivalence between pilot-wave theory and standard quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory asserts that a complete characterization of an $N$-particle system is given by its wave function together with the (at-all-times-defined) positions of the particles, with the wave function always satisfying the Schr\"odinger equation and the positions evolving according to the deterministic "guiding equation". A complete agreement with the predictive apparatus of standard quantum mechanics, including the uncertainty principle and the probabilistic Born rule, is then said to emerge from these equations, without having to confer any special status to measurements or observers. Two key elements behind the proof of this complete agreement are absolute uncertainty and the POVM theorem. The former involves an alleged "naturally emerging, irreducible limitation on the possibility of obtaining knowledge within pilot-wave theory" and the latter establishes that the outcome distributions of all measurements are described by POVMs. Here, we argue that the derivations of absolute uncertainty and the POVM theorem depend upon the questionable assumption that "information is always configurationally grounded". We explain in detail why the offered rationale behind such an assumption is deficient and explore the consequences of having to let go of it.</description>

      <title>The Algebra of the Pseudo-Observables I: Why Quantum Mechanics is the ultimate description of Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05633</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.05633v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the first of several parts introducing a new powerful algebra: the algebra of the pseudo-observables. This is a C*-algebra whose set is formed by formal expressions involving observables. The algebra is constructed by applying the Occam's razor principle, in order to obtain the minimal description of physical reality. Proceeding in such a manner, every aspect of quantum mechanics acquires a clear physical interpretation or a logical explanation, providing, for instance, in a natural way the reason for the structure of complex algebra and the matrix structure of the formulation of Werner Heisenberg of quantum mechanics. Last but not least, the very general hypotheses assumed, allow one to state that quantum mechanics is the unique minimal description of physical reality.</description>

      <title>What is emergence, after all?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable, physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By disentangling emergence from vague overuse, we emphasize its role as a rigorous tool for understanding complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</description>
