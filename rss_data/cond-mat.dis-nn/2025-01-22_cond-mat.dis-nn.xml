      <title>Amorphous silicon structures generated using a moment tensor potential and the activation relaxation technique nouveau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparing realistic atom-scale models of amorphous silicon (a-Si) is a decades-old condensed matter physics challenge. Herein, we combine the Activation Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn) to a Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) to generate seven a-Si models containing between 216 and 4096 atoms. A thorough analysis of their short-range and medium-range structural properties is performed, alongside assessments of excess energy and mechanical properties. The seven ARTn-MTP models are compared with available experimental data and other high quality a-Si models present in the literature. The seven ARTn-MTP a-Si models are in excellent agreement with available experimental data. Notably, several of our models, including the 216-atom, 512-atom, and 1000-atom a-Si models, exhibit low coordination defects without any traces of crystalline grains. Historically overlooked in previous research, our study underlines the need to assess the validity of the continuous random-network hypothesis for the description of perfect amorphous model by characterizing local crystalline environment and to explore the crystallisation process of a-Si through modelling.</description>

      <title>The origin of anomalous non-linear microwave absorption in Josephson junction qubits: mysterious nature of two level systems or their dynamic interaction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum two-level systems (TLSs) commonly found at low temperature in amorphous and disordered materials are responsible for decoherence in superconducting Josephson junction qubits particularly because they absorb energy of coherent qubit oscillations in the microwave frequency range. In planar Josephson resonators with oxide interfaces this absorption is characterized by an anomalously weak loss tangent dependence on the field in the non-linear regime that conflicts with the theoretical expectations and the observations in amorphous dielectrics. It was recently suggested that this anomalous absorption is due to TLS dynamic interactions. Here we show that such interactions cannot lead to the observed loss-tangent field dependence and suggest the alternative explanation assuming that TLS dipole moments $p$ are distributed according to the specific power law $P(p) \propto 1/p^{3-\eta}$ ($0\leq \eta &lt;1$). This assumption, indeed, results in the observed loss tangent behavior. The hypothesis of a power law distribution is supported both by the recent measurements of individual TLS dipole moments and the theoretical model of TLS formation due to the long-range dipole-dipole interaction, thus connecting the anomalous absorption with the possible solution of the long-standing problem of the nature of TLSs.</description>

      <title>Role of Random Interaction Connection in the Order Transition of Active Matter Based on the Vicsek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomness plays a key role in the order transition of active matter but has not yet been explicitly considered in pairwise interaction connection. In this letter, we introduce the perception rate P into the Vicsek model as the probability of the interaction connections and model the connections as superposition states. We show that with increasing P, the polar order number undergoes an order transition and then saturation. The order transition is a first-order phase transition with band formation, and the effect of P is different from density. The change of the order number is linked with the interaction structure. The order transition, order saturation, and phase separation correspond to different critical changes in the local interaction number. The global interaction structure is further analyzed as a network. The decrease of P is comparable to random edge removal, under which the network experiences modal transitions near the critical points of the order number, and the network exhibits surprising robustness. Our results suggest that random interaction can be a new important factor in active matter models, with potential applications in robotic swarms and social activities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Stokes flow around a slowly moving sphere in a fluid with odd viscosity, focusing on a system of electrons in a Weyl semimetal with a single axis of asymmetry arising from broken time-reversal symmetry. We analyze the flow around the sphere, compute the Hall force acting perpendicular to its direction of motion, and study the implications for the Hall resistivity of Weyl semimetals in the hydrodynamic regime.</description>

      <title>The stochastic porous medium equation in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the porous medium equation (PME) in one space dimension in presence of additive non-conservative white noise, and interpreted as a stochastic growth equation for the height field of an interface. We predict the values of the two growth exponents $\alpha$ and $\beta$ using the functional RG. Extensive numerical simulations show agreement with the predicted values for these exponents, however they also show anomalous scaling with an additional "local" exponent $\alpha_{\rm loc}$, as well as multiscaling originating from broad distributions of local height differences. The stationary measure of the stochastic PME is found to be well described by a random walk model, related to a Bessel process. This model allows for several predictions about the multiscaling properties.</description>

      <title>Revealing the role played by $\alpha$- and $\beta$-relaxation in hydrostatically compressed metallic glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any property of metallic glasses is controlled by the microscopic ongoing relaxation processes. While the response of these processes to temperature is well documented, little is known on their pressure dependence, owning to non-trivial experimental challenges. By combining fast differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction and high-pressure technologies, we identify the origin of a recently discovered pressure-induced rejuvenation in metallic glasses from the different pressure response of the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-relaxation in a series of hydrostatically compressed Vit4 glasses. While the localized $\beta$-relaxation promotes rejuvenation and is associated to a constant looser atomic packing independent of the applied pressure, the collective $\alpha$-relaxation triggers density driven ordering processes promoting the stability. The latter parameter however cannot be solely described by the degree of equilibration reached during the compression, which instead determines the crossover between the two regimes allowing to rescale the corresponding activation energies of the two processes on a master curve.</description>

      <title>Class Imbalance in Anomaly Detection: Learning from an Exactly Solvable Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class imbalance (CI) is a longstanding problem in machine learning, slowing down training and reducing performances. Although empirical remedies exist, it is often unclear which ones work best and when, due to the lack of an overarching theory. We address a common case of imbalance, that of anomaly (or outlier) detection. We provide a theoretical framework to analyze, interpret and address CI. It is based on an exact solution of the teacher-student perceptron model, through replica theory. Within this framework, one can distinguish several sources of CI: either intrinsic, train or test imbalance. Our analysis reveals that the optimal train imbalance is generally different from 50%, with a non trivial dependence on the intrinsic imbalance, the abundance of data and on the noise in the learning. Moreover, there is a crossover between a small noise training regime where results are independent of the noise level to a high noise regime where performances quickly degrade with noise. Our results challenge some of the conventional wisdom on CI and offer practical guidelines to address it.</description>

      <title>Using Space-Filling Curves and Fractals to Reveal Spatial and Temporal Patterns in Neuroimaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method, Fractal Space-Curve Analysis (FSCA), which combines Space-Filling Curve (SFC) mapping for dimensionality reduction with fractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). The method is suitable for multidimensional geometrically embedded data, especially for neuroimaging data which is highly correlated temporally and spatially. We conduct extensive feasibility studies on diverse, artificially generated data with known fractal characteristics: the fractional Brownian motion, Cantor sets, and Gaussian processes. We compare the suitability of dimensionality reduction via Hilbert SFC and a data-driven alternative. FSCA is then successfully applied to real-world magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) scans.
  The method utilizing Hilbert curves is optimized for computational efficiency, proven robust against boundary effects typical in experimental data analysis, and resistant to data sub-sampling. It is able to correctly quantify and discern correlations in both stationary and dynamic two-dimensional images. In MRI Alzheimer's dataset, patients reveal a progression of the disease associated with a systematic decrease of the Hurst exponent. In fMRI recording of breath-holding task, the change in the exponent allows distinguishing different experimental phases.
  This study introduces a robust method for fractal characterization of spatial and temporal correlations in many types of multidimensional neuroimaging data. Very few assumptions allow it to be generalized to more dimensions than typical for neuroimaging and utilized in other scientific fields. The method can be particularly useful in analyzing fMRI experiments to compute markers of pathological conditions resulting from neurodegeneration. We also showcase its potential for providing insights into brain dynamics in task-related experiments.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous phase transition of feature detection in lateral predictive coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain adopts the strategy of lateral predictive coding (LPC) to construct optimal internal representations for salient features in input sensory signals to reduce the energetic cost of information transmission. Here we consider the task of distinguishing a non-Gaussian signal by LPC from $(N-1)$ Gaussian background signals of the same magnitude, which is intractable by principal component decomposition. We study the emergence of feature detection function from the perspective of statistical mechanics, and formulate a thermodynamic free energy to implement the tradeoff between energetic cost $E$ and information robustness. We define $E$ as the mean $L_1$-norm of the internal state vectors, and quantify the level of information robustness by an entropy measure $S$. We demonstrate that energy--information tradeoff may induce a discontinuous phase transition of the optimal matrix, from a very weak one with $S \approx 0$ to a functional LPC system with moderate synaptic weights in which a single unit responds selectively to the input non-Gaussian feature with high signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Critical Dynamics in Supercooled Liquid Crystals: Insights into the Glass Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a modeling approach aimed at elucidating the pivotal role of symmetry in phase transitions, focusing specifically on the isotropic-nematic (I-N) transition characteristic of liquid crystal systems. By leveraging insights from the Ising model and incorporating considerations of topological defects, the transition to the glassy state in rod-like molecular systems in the supercooled state is examined. Through a critical-like analysis of the system's dynamical properties, universality classes directly linked to symmetry are discerned. This paper delves into the role of symmetry in the glass transition, as manifested in the generalized critical relation of configurational entropy $S_C(T)=S_0(1-T_K/T)^n$, where the critical exponent $n$ is intricately tied to the system's symmetry. The determined values of the pseudocritical exponent $n$ exhibit universality across the studied systems and demonstrate excellent agreement with thermodynamic data. Furthermore, the congruence between the dynamic representation, as indicated by the primary relaxation time, and the thermodynamic representation, exemplified by the specific heat capacity, underscores the robustness of the findings. The identification of critical-like behavior and the observation of symmetry breaking during the transition to the glass state suggest its intrinsic thermodynamic nature. This work provides a unified framework for understanding the glass transition, bridging dynamic and thermodynamic perspectives through the lens of symmetry.</description>

      <title>Evolving disorder and chaos enhances the wave speed of elastic waves</title>

Abstract: Static or frozen disorder, characterised by spatial heterogeneities, influences diverse complex systems, encompassing many-body systems, equilibrium and nonequilibrium states of matter, intricate network topologies, biological systems, and wave-matter interactions. While static disorder has been thoroughly examined, delving into evolving disorder brings increased intricacy to the issue. An example of this complexity is the observation of stochastic acceleration of electromagnetic waves in evolving media, where noisy fluctuations in the propagation medium transfer effective momentum to the wave. Here, we investigate elastic wave propagation in a one-dimensional heterogeneous medium with diagonal disorder. We examine two types of complex elastic materials: one with static disorder, where mass density randomly varies in space, and the other with evolving disorder, featuring random variations in both space and time. Our results indicate that evolving disorder enhances the propagation speed of Gaussian pulses compared to static disorder. Additionally, we demonstrate that the enhanced speed effect also occurs when the medium evolves chaotically rather than randomly over time. The latter establishes that evolving randomness is not a unique prerequisite for observing the enhanced transport of wavefronts, introducing the concept of chaotic speed enhancement of waves in complex media.</description>

      <title>Quasispins of vacancy defects and their interactions in disordered antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vacancy defects in disordered magnetic materials are known to act as effective spins, ``quasispins'', in response to an external magnetic field. In the dilute limit, the contributions of such ``quasispins'' to the magnetic susceptibility $\chi_\text{vac}(T)\propto N_\text{vac}/T$ are singular in the limit of low temperatures $T$ and match those of free spins. With increasing the density of vacancies, their interactions may become essential. Motivated by frustrated and quasi-one-dimensional magnetic materials, we study analytically quasispins and their interactions in a generic system that has short-range antiferromagnetic order and lacks long-range order. We predict that if the vacancy defect does not disrupt the short-range antiferromagnetic order around it, the quasispin value matches the value of spins of the magnetic atoms in the material, and the correlators of the quasispins of different vacancies match the spin-spin correlators in the vacancy-free material. We confirm our conclusions by exact calculations for Ising chains with nearest-neighbour and next-to-nearest-neighbour interactions. We also compute the first virial correction to the susceptibility of a magnetic material due to the interactions of vacancy quasispins.</description>

      <title>Neural network based deep learning analysis of semiconductor quantum dot qubits for automated control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning offers a largely unexplored avenue for improving noisy disordered devices in physics using automated algorithms. Through simulations that include disorder in physical devices, particularly quantum devices, there is potential to learn about disordered landscapes and subsequently tune devices based on those insights. In this work, we introduce a novel methodology that employs machine learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to discern the disorder landscape in the parameters of the disordered extended Hubbard model underlying the semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit architectures. This technique takes advantage of experimentally obtainable charge stability diagrams from neighboring quantum dot pairs, enabling the CNN to accurately identify disorder in each parameter of the extended Hubbard model. Remarkably, our CNN can process site-specific disorder in Hubbard parameters, including variations in hopping constants, on-site potentials (gate voltages), and both intra-site and inter-site Coulomb terms. This advancement facilitates the prediction of spatially dependent disorder across all parameters simultaneously with high accuracy ($R^2&gt;0.994$) and fewer parameter constraints, marking a significant improvement over previous methods that were focused only on analyzing on-site potentials at low coupling. Furthermore, our approach allows for the tuning of five or more quantum dots at a time, effectively addressing the often-overlooked issue of crosstalk. Not only does our method streamline the tuning process, potentially enabling fully automated adjustments, but it also introduces a "no trust" verification method to rigorously validate the neural network's predictions. Ultimately, this work aims to lay the groundwork for generalizing our method to tackle a broad spectrum of physical problems.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models are machine learning models that use diffusion processes to learn the probability distribution of high-dimensional data. In recent years, they have become extremely successful in generating multimedia content. However, it is still unknown if such models can be used to generate high-quality datasets of physical models. In this work, we use a Landau-Ginzburg-like diffusion model to infer the distribution of a $2D$ bond-diluted Ising model. Our approach is simple and effective, and we show that the generated samples reproduce correctly the statistical and critical properties of the physical model.</description>

      <title>Periodically and aperiodically Thue-Morse driven long-range systems: from dynamical localization to slow dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the electric-field driven power-law random banded matrix(PLRBM) model where a variation in the power-law exponent $\alpha$ yields a delocalization-to-localization phase transition. We examine the periodically driven PLRBM model with the help of the Floquet operator. The level spacing ratio and the generalized participation ratio of the Floquet Hamiltonian reveal a drive-induced fractal phase accompanied by diffusive transport on the delocalized side of the undriven PLRBM model. On the localized side, the time-periodic model remains localized - the average spacing ratio corresponds to Poisson statistics and logarithmic transport is observed in the dynamics. Extending our analysis to the aperiodic Thue-Morse (TM) driven system, we find that the aperiodically driven clean long-range hopping model (clean counterpart of the PLRBM model) exhibits the phenomenon of \textit{exact dynamical localization} (EDL) on tuning the drive-parameters at special points. The disordered time-aperiodic system shows diffusive transport followed by relaxation to the infinite-temperature state on the delocalized side, and a prethermal plateau with subdiffusion on the localized side. Additionally, we compare this with a quasi-periodically driven AAH model that also undergoes a localization-delocalization transition. Unlike the disordered long-range model, it features a prolonged prethermal plateau followed by subdiffusion to the infinite temperature state, even on the delocalized side.</description>

      <title>Exploring Unique Characteristics in Stark Many-Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stark Many-Body Localization (MBL) is a phenomenon observed in quantum systems in the absence of disorder, where the presence of a linear potential, known as the Stark field, causes the localization. Our study aims to provide novel insight into the properties of Stark MBL and to discover unique entanglement characteristics specific to this phenomenon. The phase diagram analysis reveals different behavior with varying interaction strengths. Furthermore, we highlight the influence of domain wall structures on the breakdown of the entanglement entropy of the system. Moreover, the investigation of Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlator (OTOC) behavior demonstrates distinct responses to interactions based on domain wall configurations. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of Stark MBL and offer valuable insights into the entanglement properties of systems subjected to Stark potentials.</description>

      <title>Shattering in Pure Spherical Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04659v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a shattered phase within the replica-symmetric phase of the pure spherical $p$-spin models for $p$ sufficiently large.
  In this phase, we construct a decomposition of the sphere into well-separated small clusters, each of which has exponentially small Gibbs mass, yet which together carry all but an exponentially small fraction of the Gibbs mass.
  We achieve this via quantitative estimates on the derivative of the Franz--Parisi potential, which measures the Gibbs mass profile around a typical sample. Corollaries on dynamics are derived, in particular we show the two-times correlation function of stationary Langevin dynamics must have an exponentially long plateau. We further show that shattering implies disorder chaos for the Gibbs measure in the optimal transport sense; this is known to imply failure of sampling algorithms which are stable under perturbation in the same metric.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Effects of Disorder on Current Fluctuations in the Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore how the disorder impacts the current fluctuations in the symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP) within a heterogeneous environment. First, we analyze the SSEP with a defect site under the periodic boundary conditions. We derive the exact expression for the second moment of the current and observe deviations from that of the homogeneous system. Notably, the second moment of the current shows asymmetric density dependence around a density of 1/2 and surpassing that of the homogeneous system in the low-density region. Furthermore, based on the finding from the SSEP with a defect site, we present an approximate derivation of the second moment of the current in the SSEP on a quenched random energy landscape using a partial-mean-field approach. The second moment of the current is heavily influenced by the energy landscape, revealing unique effects arising from the interplay between the heterogeneous environment and the many-body system. Our findings provide valuable insights that can be applied to control current fluctuations in systems involving the interactions of many particles, such as biological transport.</description>

      <title>Network reconstruction may not mean dynamics prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With an increasing amount of observations on the dynamics of many complex systems, it is required to reveal the underlying mechanisms behind these complex dynamics, which is fundamentally important in many scientific fields such as climate, financial, ecological, and neural systems. The underlying mechanisms are commonly encoded into network structures, e.g., capturing how constituents interact with each other to produce emergent behavior. Here, we address whether a good network reconstruction suggests a good dynamics prediction. The answer is quite dependent on the nature of the supplied (observed) dynamics sequences measured on the complex system. When the dynamics are not chaotic, network reconstruction implies dynamics prediction. In contrast, even if a network can be well reconstructed from the chaotic time series (chaos means that many unstable dynamics states coexist), the prediction of the future dynamics can become impossible as at some future point the prediction error will be amplified. This is explained by using dynamical mean-field theory on a toy model of random recurrent neural networks.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic (Axion) Statistical Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensembles that respect symmetries on average exhibit richer topological states than those in pure states with exact symmetries, leading to the concept of average symmetry-protected topological states (ASPTs). The free-fermion counterpart of ASPT is the so-called statistical topological insulator (STI) in disordered ensembles. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of intrinsic STI - which has no band insulator correspondence - characterized by the half-quantized magneto-electric polarization $P_3\!=\!\theta/(2\pi)$. A $C_{4}T$ symmetry reverses the sign of $\theta$ angle, hence seems to protect a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of $\theta\!=\!0,\pi$. However, we prove that, if $(C_{4}T)^4 \!=\! 1$, the topological state with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ cannot be realized in band insulators where $C_{4}T$ is exact. Surprisingly, using a real space construction (topological crystal), we find that an STI with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ can arise in Anderson insulators with disorders respecting $C_{4}T$ on average. To illustrate this state, we construct a lattice model and examine its phase diagram using the transfer matrix method up to the largest numerically accessible system size. An STI phase is identified through delocalized surface states and a half-quantized magneto-electric polarization in the bulk. As expected, an unavoidable gapless phase separates the STI from both clean insulators and trivial Anderson insulators, revealing the intrinsic nature of the STI. Moreover, we argue that the intrinsic STI is robust against electron-electron interactions, i.e., interactions cannot open an adiabatic path connecting the STI to a gapped clean system. Thus, our work provides the first intrinsic crystalline ASPT and its lattice realization. We also generalize the discussion to other crystalline symmetries.</description>
