      <title>On the structure and theory of McCarthy algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an equational basis for McCarthy algebras, the variety generated by the three-element algebra defining the logic of McCarthy (the non commutative version of Kleene three-valued logics), solving a problem left open by Konikowska [17]. Differently from Konikowska, we tackle the problem in a more general algebraic setting by introducing McCarthy algebras as a subvariety of unital bands (idempotent monoids) equipped with an involutive (unary) operation $'$ satisfying $x''\approx x$; herein referred to as i-ubands. Prominent (commutative) subvarieties of i-ubands include Boolean algebras, ortholattices, Kleene algebras, and involutive bisemilattices, hence i-ubands provides an algebraic common ground for several non-classical logics. Beside our main result, we also get a semilattice decomposition theorem for McCarthy algebras and a characterization of the (lowest levels of the) lattice of subvarieties of i-ubands, shedding new light on the connection with Kleene logics.</description>

      <title>On the spectrum of limit models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of limit models assuming the existence of a nicely behaved independence notion. Under reasonable assumptions, we show that all `long' limit models are isomorphic, and all `short' limit models are non-isomorphic.
  $\textbf{Theorem.}$ Let $\mathbf{K}$ be a $\aleph_0$-tame abstract elementary class stable in $\lambda \geq \operatorname{LS}(\mathbf{K})$ with amalgamation, joint embedding and no maximal models. Suppose there is an independence relation on the models of size $\lambda$ that satisfies uniqueness, extension, universal continuity, $(\geq \kappa)$-local character in a minimal regular $\kappa \leq \lambda$, and non-forking amalgamation.
  Suppose $\delta_1, \delta_2 &lt; \lambda^+$ with $\operatorname{cf}(\delta_1) &lt; \operatorname{cf}(\delta_2)$. Then for any $N_1, N_2, M \in \mathbf{K}_\lambda$ where $N_l$ is a $(\lambda, \delta_l)$-limit model over $M$ for $l = 1, 2$,
  \[N_1 \text{ is isomorphic to } N_2 \text{ over } M \iff \operatorname{cf}(\delta_1) \geq \kappa\]
  Both implications in the conclusion have improvements. High cofinality limits are isomorphic without the $\aleph_0$-tameness assumption and assuming the independence relation is defined only on high cofinality limit models. Low cofinality limits are non-isomorphic without assuming non-forking amalgamation.
  We show how our results can be used to study limit models in both abstract settings and in natural examples of abstract elementary classes.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Logical Consistency in Transformers via Query-Key Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various natural language processing tasks, yet their ability to perform multi-step logical reasoning remains an open challenge. Although Chain-of-Thought prompting has improved logical reasoning by enabling models to generate intermediate steps, it lacks mechanisms to assess the coherence of these logical transitions. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight evaluation strategy for logical reasoning that uses query-key alignments inside transformer attention heads. By computing a single forward pass and extracting a "QK-score" from carefully chosen heads, our method reveals latent representations that reliably separate valid from invalid inferences, offering a scalable alternative to traditional ablation-based techniques. We also provide an empirical validation on multiple logical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating improved robustness of our evaluation method against distractors and increased reasoning depth. The experiments were conducted on a diverse set of models, ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters.</description>

      <title>Completeness in local positive logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the basic model theory of local positive logic, a new logic that mixes positive logic (where negation is not allowed) and local logic (where models omit types of infinite distant pairs). We study several basic model theoretic notions such as compactness, positive closedness (existential closedness) and completeness (irreducibility).</description>

      <title>The Borel complexity of the class of models of first-order theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the descriptive complexity of the set of models of first-order theories. Using classical results of Knight and Solovay, we give a sharp condition for complete theories to have a $\pmb\Pi_\omega^0$-complete set of models. In particular, any sequential theory (a class of foundational theories isolated by Pudl\'ak) has a $\pmb\Pi_\omega^0$-complete set of models. We also give sharp conditions for theories to have a $\pmb\Pi^0_n$-complete set of models.</description>

      <title>Separating complexity classes of LCL problems on grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complexity of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ from the point of view of descriptive set theory, computability theory, and factors of i.i.d. Our results separate various complexity classes that were not previously known to be distinct and serve as counterexamples to a number of natural conjectures in the field.</description>

      <title>Projective curves and weak second-order logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an algebraically closed field $K$ of characteristic zero, we study the incidence relation between points and irreducible projective curves, or more precisely the poset of irreducible proper subvarieties of $\mathbb P^2(K)$. Answering a question of Marcus Tressl, we prove that the poset interprets the field, and it is in fact bi-interpretable with the two-sorted structure consisting of the field $K$ and a sort for its finite subsets. In this structure one can define the integers, so the theory is undecidable. When $K$ is the field of complex numbers we can nevertheless obtain a recursive axiomatization modulo the theory of the integers. We also show that the integers are stably embedded and that the poset of irreducible varieties over the complex numbers is not elementarily equivalent to the one over the algebraic numbers.</description>
