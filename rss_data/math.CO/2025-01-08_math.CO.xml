      <title>A class of inequalities for intersection-closed set systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a finite set and $\mathcal{F}$, an intersection-closed family of subsets. Frankl conjectured that there always exists an element in $N$ which is contained in at most half the number of sets in $\mathcal{F}$ unless $\mathcal{F} =\{E\}$. We prove the validity of a class of inequalities which imply Frankl's conjecture.</description>

      <title>The hard-core model in graph theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An independent set may not contain both a vertex and one of its neighbours. This basic fact makes the uniform distribution over independent sets rather special. We consider the hard-core model, an essential generalization of the uniform distribution over independent sets. We show how its local analysis yields remarkable insights into the global structure of independent sets in the host graph, in connection with, for instance, Ramsey numbers, graph colourings, and sphere packings.</description>

      <title>On the upper tail of star counts in random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ count the number of $r$-stars in the random binomial graph $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$. We determine, for fixed $r$ and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the asymptotics of $\log \mathbb{P}(X \ge (1 + \varepsilon)\mathbb{E} X)$ assuming only $\mathbb{E} X \to \infty$ and $p \to 0$ thus giving a first class of irregular graphs for which the upper tail problem for subgraph counts (stated by Janson and Ruci\'nski in 2004) is solved in the sparse setting.</description>

      <title>On the anti-Ramsey threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a graph $G$ is anti-Ramsey for a graph $H$ if any proper edge-colouring of $G$ yields a rainbow copy of $H$, i.e. a copy of $H$ whose edges all receive different colours. In this work we determine the threshold at which the binomial random graph becomes anti-Ramsey for any fixed graph $H$, given that $H$ is sufficiently dense. Our proof employs a graph decomposition lemma in the style of the Nine Dragon Tree theorem that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Sharp bounds for product and sum throttling numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Throttling in graphs optimizes a sum or product of resources used, such as the number of vertices in an initial set, and time required, such as the propagation time, to complete a given task. We introduce a new technique to establish sharp upper bounds in terms of graph order for sum throttling and initial cost product throttling for power domination. Furthermore, we establish sharp bounds on possible changes of the product throttling number, both with and without initial cost, caused by certain graph operations for standard zero forcing, positive semidefinite forcing, and power domination.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration of Minimum PSD Forcing Sets and Minimum Skew Forcing Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfiguration graphs provide a way to represent relationships among solutions to a problem, and have been studied in many contexts. We investigate the reconfiguration graphs corresponding to minimum PSD forcing sets and minimum skew forcing sets. We present results for the structure and realizability of certain graph classes as token exchange and token sliding reconfiguration graphs. Additionally, we use a universal approach to establish structural properties for the reconfiguration graphs of many common graph parameters under these reconfiguration rules. Finally, we compare results on reconfiguration graphs for zero forcing variants.</description>

Abstract: For natural numbers $n$ and $l &gt; d \geq 2$, let $ES_d(l,n)$ be the minimum $N$ such that any set of at least $N$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ contains either $l$ points contained in a common $(d-1)$-dimensional hyperplane or $n$ points in convex position. In this papar, we give the upper and lower bounds for $ES_d(l,n)$.</description>

      <title>The log concavity of two graphical sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the large Cartesian powers of any graph have log-concave valencies with respect to a ffxed vertex. We show that the series of valencies of distance regular graphs is log-concave, thus improving on a result of (Taylor, Levingston, 1978). Consequences for strongly regular graphs, two-weight codes, and completely regular codes are derived. By P-Q duality of association schemes the series of multiplicities of Q-polynomial association schemes is shown, under some assumption, to be log-concave.</description>

      <title>Optimal List Recoloring of Subcubic Graphs and Complete Multipiartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a list-assignement $L$, the reconfiguration graph $C_L(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the graph whose vertices are proper $L$-colorings of $G$ and whose edges link two colorings that differ on only one vertex. If $|L(v)| \ge d(v) + 2$ for every vertex of $G$, it is known that $C_L(G)$ is connected. In this case, Cambie et al. investigated the diameter of $C_L(G)$. They conjectured that $diam(C_L(G)) \le n(G) + \mu(G)$ with $\mu(G)$ the size of a maximum matching of $G$ and proved several results towards this conjecture. We answer to two of their open problems by proving the conjecture for two classes of graphs, namely subcubic graphs and complete mulitpartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Do perfect powers repel partition numbers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2013 Zhi-Wei Sun conjectured that $p(n)$ is never a power of an integer when $n&gt;1.$ We confirm this claim in many cases. We also observe that integral powers appear to repel the partition numbers. If $k&gt;1$ and $\Delta_k(n)$ is the distance between $p(n)$ and the nearest $k$th power, then for every $d\geq 0$ we conjecture that there are at most finitely many $n$ for which $\Delta_k(n)\leq d.$ More precisely, for every $\varepsilon&gt;0,$ we conjecture that $$M_k(d):=\max\{n \ : \ \Delta_k(n)\leq d\}=o( d^{\varepsilon}).$$ In $k$-power aspect with $d$ fixed, we also conjecture that if $k$ is sufficiently large, then $$ M_k(d)=\max \left\{ n \ : \ p(n)-1\leq d\right\}. $$ In other words, $1$ generally appears to be the closest $k$th power among the partition numbers.</description>

      <title>Young domination on Hamming rectangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the neighborhood growth dynamics on a Hamming rectangle $[0,m-1]\times[0,n-1]\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_+^2$, the decision to add a point is made by counting the currently occupied points on the horizontal and the vertical line through it, and checking whether the pair of counts lies outside a fixed Young diagram. After the initially occupied set is chosen, the synchronous rule is iterated. The Young domination number with a fixed latency $L$ is the smallest cardinality of an initial set that covers the rectangle by $L$ steps, for $L=0,1,\ldots$ We compute this number for some special cases, including $k$-domination for any $k$ when $m=n$, and devise approximation algorithms in the general case. These results have implications in extremal graph theory, via an equivalence between the case $L = 1$ and bipartite Tur\'an numbers for families of double stars. Our approach is based on a variety of techniques including duality, algebraic formulations, explicit constructions, and dynamic programming.</description>

      <title>Bounds on $A_\alpha$-eigenvalues using graph invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2017, Nikiforov introduced the concept of the $A_{\alpha}$-matrix, as a linear convex combination of the adjacency matrix and the degree diagonal matrix of a graph. This matrix has attracted increasing attention in recent years, as it serves as a unifying structure that combines the adjacency matrix and the signless Laplacian matrix. In this paper, we present some bounds for the largest and smallest eigenvalue of $A_{\alpha}$-matrix involving invariants associated to graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study algebraic decompositions and secondary constructions of almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions. In many cases, we establish precise criteria which characterize when certain modifications of a given APN function yield new ones. Furthermore, we show that some of the newly constructed functions are extended-affine inequivalent to the original ones.</description>

Abstract: Let $n \ge 8$ be even, and let $G = \langle x, y \mid x^2 = y^{n/2}, y^n = 1, yx = xy^s \rangle$, where $s^2 \equiv 1 \pmod n$ and $s \not\equiv \pm1 \pmod n$. In this paper, we provide the precise values of some zero-sum constants over $G$, namely the small Davenport constant, $\eta$-constant, Gao constant, and Erd\H os-Ginzburg-Ziv constant. In particular, the Gao's and Zhuang-Gao's Conjectures hold for $G$. We also solve the associated inverse problems when $n \equiv 0 \pmod 4$.</description>

      <title>Crystals and Double Quiver Algebras from Jeffrey-Kirwan Residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct statistical mechanical models of crystal melting describing the flavoured Witten indices of $\mathcal{N}\ge 2$ supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. Our results can be derived from the Jeffrey-Kirwan (JK) residue formulas, and generalize the previous results for quivers corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds to a large class of quivers satisfying the no-overlap condition, including those corresponding to some non-toric Calabi-Yau manifolds. We construct new quiver algebras which we call the double quiver Yangians/algebras, as well as their representations in terms of the aforementioned crystals. For theories with four supercharges, we compare the double quiver algebras with the existing quiver Yangians/BPS algebras, which we show can also be constructed from the JK residues. For theories with two supercharges, the double quiver algebras provide an algebraic description of the BPS states, including the information of the fixed points and their relative coefficients in the full partition functions.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Combinatorial Approach to Proving Chernoff Bounds and Their Generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chernoff bound is one of the most widely used tools in theoretical computer science. It's rare to find a randomized algorithm that doesn't employ a Chernoff bound in its analysis. The standard proofs of Chernoff bounds are beautiful but in some ways not very intuitive. In this paper, I'll show you a different proof that has four features: (1) the proof offers a strong intuition for why Chernoff bounds look the way that they do; (2) the proof is user-friendly and (almost) algebra-free; (3) the proof comes with matching lower bounds, up to constant factors in the exponent; and (4) the proof extends to establish generalizations of Chernoff bounds in other settings. The ultimate goal is that, once you know this proof (and with a bit of practice), you should be able to confidently reason about Chernoff-style bounds in your head, extending them to other settings, and convincing yourself that the bounds you're obtaining are tight (up to constant factors in the exponent).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in spherical distance geometry aims to recover an $n$-tuple of points on a 2-sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$, viewed up to oriented isometry, from $O(n)$ input measurements. We solve this problem using algorithms that employ only the four arithmetic operations. Each algorithm recursively produces output data that we arrange into a new type of frieze pattern. These frieze patterns exhibit glide symmetry and a version of the Laurent phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Quasi-optimal cyclic orbit codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on two aspects of cyclic orbit codes: invariants under equivalence and quasi-optimality. Regarding the first aspect, we establish a connection between the codewords of a cyclic orbit code and a certain linear set on the projective line. This allows us to derive new bounds on the parameters of the code. In the second part, we study a particular family of (quasi-)optimal cyclic orbit codes and derive a general existence theorem for quasi-optimal codes in even-dimensional vector spaces over finite fields of any characteristic. Finally, for our particular code family we describe the automorphism groups under the general linear group and a suitable Galois group.</description>

      <title>Isogeny graphs with level structures arrising from the Verschiebung map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We enhance an isogeny graph of elliptic curves by incorporating level structures defined by bases of the kernels of iterates of the Verschiebung map. We extend several previous results on isogeny graphs with level structures defined by geometric points to these graphs. Firstly, we prove that these graphs form $\mathbb{Z}_p$-towers of graph coverings as the power of the Verschiebung map varies. Secondly, we prove that the connected components of these graphs display a volcanic structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate properties of $\mathbb{Z}_p$-towers of graph coverings that arise from a constant voltage assignment. We prove the existence and uniqueness (up to isomorphisms) of such towers. Furthermore, we study the Iwasawa invariants of these towers, and apply our results to towers of isogeny graphs enhanced with level structures, as well as towers arising from volcano graphs.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Approach to Zauner's Conjecture via the Stark Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a construction of $d^2$ complex equiangular lines in $\mathbb{C}^d$, also known as SICPOVMs, which were conjectured by Zauner to exist for all d. The construction gives a putatively complete list of SICs with Weyl-Heisenberg symmetry in all dimensions d &gt; 3. Specifically, we give an explicit expression for an object that we call a ghost SIC, which is constructed from the real multiplication values of a special function and which is Galois conjugate to a SIC. The special function, the Shintani-Faddeev modular cocycle, is a tuple of meromorphic functions indexed by a congruence subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We prove that our construction gives a valid SIC in every case assuming two conjectures: the order 1 abelian Stark conjecture for real quadratic fields and a special value identity for the Shintani-Faddeev modular cocycle. The former allows us to prove that the ghost and the SIC are Galois conjugate over an extension of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta})$ where $\Delta = (d+1)(d-3)$, while the latter allows us to prove idempotency of the presumptive fiducial projector. We provide computational tests of our SIC construction by cross-validating it with known exact solutions, with the numerical work of Scott and Grassl, and by constructing four numerical examples of inequivalent SICs in d=100, three of which are new. We further consider rank-r generalizations called r-SICs given by equichordal configurations of r-dimensional complex subspaces. We give similar conditional constructions for r-SICs for all r, d such that r(d-r) divides $(d^2-1)$. Finally, we study the structure of the field extensions conjecturally generated by the r-SICs. If $K$ is any real quadratic field, then either every abelian Galois extension of $K$, or else every abelian extension for which 2 is unramified, is generated by our construction; the former holds for a positive density of field discriminants.</description>

      <title>Refining trees of tangles in abstract separation systems: inessential parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01808v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robertson and Seymour proved two fundamental theorems about tangles in graphs: the tree-of-tangles theorem, which says that every graph has a tree-decomposition such that distinguishable tangles live in different nodes of the tree, and the tangle-tree duality theorem, which says that graphs without a $k$-tangle have a tree-decomposition that witnesses the non-existence of such tangles, in that $k$-tangles would have to live in a node but no node is large enough to accommodate one.
  Erde combined these two fundamental theorems into one, by constructing a single tree-decomposition such that every node either accommodates a single $k$-tangle or is too small to accommodate one. Such a tree-decomposition thus shows at a glance how many $k$-tangles a graph has and where they are.
  The two fundamental theorems have since been extended to abstract separation systems, which support tangles in more general discrete structures. In this paper we extend Erde's unified theorem to such general systems.</description>

      <title>Sidorenko-Type Inequalities for Pairs of Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two non-empty graphs $H$ and $T$, write $H\succcurlyeq T$ to mean that $t(H,G)^{|E(T)|}\geq t(T,G)^{|E(H)|}$ for every graph $G$, where $t(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the homomorphism density function. We obtain various necessary and sufficient conditions for two trees $H$ and $T$ to satisfy $H\succcurlyeq T$ and determine all such pairs on at most 8 vertices. This extends results of Leontovich and Sidorenko from the 1980s and 90s. Our approach applies an information-theoretic technique to reduce the problem of showing that $H\succcurlyeq T$ for two forests $H$ and $T$ to solving a linear program of Kopparty and Rossman. We also characterize trees $H$ which satisfy $H\succcurlyeq S_k$ or $H\succcurlyeq P_4$, where $S_k$ is the $k$-vertex star and $P_4$ is the $4$-vertex path and resolve a problem of Csikv\'ari and Lin.</description>

Abstract: We prove that $\chi(G) \le \lceil (\Delta+1)/2\rceil+1$ for any triangle-free graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ provided $\Delta \ge 524$. This gives tangible progress towards an old problem of Vizing, in a form cast by Reed. We use a method of Hurley and Pirot, which in turn relies on a new counting argument of the second author.</description>

      <title>Some frustrating questions on dimensions of products of posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $P$ a poset, the dimension of $P$ is defined to be the least cardinal $\kappa$ such that $P$ is embeddable in a direct product of $\kappa$ totally ordered sets. We study the behavior of this function on finite-dimensional (not necessarily finite) posets.
  In general, the dimension dim($P$ x $Q$) of a product of two posets can be smaller than dim($P$) + dim($Q$), though no cases are known where the discrepancy is greater than 2. We obtain a result that gives upper bounds on the dimensions of certain products of posets, including cases where the discrepancy 2 is achieved. But the paper is mainly devoted to stating questions, old and new, about dimensions of product posets, noting implications among their possible answers, and introducing some related concepts that might be helpful in tackling these questions.</description>

      <title>Structure of lower tails in sparse random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the typical structure of a sparse Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph conditioned on the lower tail subgraph count event. We show that in certain regimes, a typical graph sampled from the conditional distribution resembles the entropy minimizer of the mean field approximation in the sense of both subgraph counts and cut norm. The main ingredients are an adaptation of an entropy increment scheme of Kozma and Samotij, and a new stability for the solution of the associated entropy variational problem.
  The proof can be interpreted as a structural application of the new probabilistic hypergraph container lemma for sparser than average sets, and suggests a more general framework for establishing such typical behavior statements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ is a graph with vertex set $\{0,1\}^n$ such that there is an edge between two vertices if and only if they differ in exactly one coordinate. For any graph $H$, define $\text{ex}(Q_n,H)$ to be the maximum number of edges of a subgraph of $Q_n$ without a copy of $H$. In this short note, we prove that for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ $$\text{ex}(Q_n, C_{10}) &gt; 0.024 \cdot e(Q_n).$$ Our construction is strongly inspired by the recent breakthrough work of Ellis, Ivan, and Leader, who showed that "daisy" hypergraphs have positive Tur\'an density with an extremely clever and simple linear-algebraic argument.</description>

      <title>Deformed Rogers-Szeg\"o Polynomials and the Generalized $q$-Exponential Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the deformed Rogers-Szeg\"o polynomials R$_n(x,y;u,v|q)$. These polynomials are a generalization of the classical Rogers-Szeg\"o polynomials, the generalized Rogers-Szeg\"o polynomials, the Stieljes-Wigert polynomials, among others. Basic properties of the polynomial R$_n$ are given, along with recurrence relations, its $q$-difference equation, representations, and generating functions. We define the $u$-deformed $q$-exponential operator T$(tD_{q}|u)$, and we get for free the operators T$(yD_{q})$ the Chen, $\mathrm{R}(yD_{q})$ of Saad, $\mathcal{E}(yD_{q})$ of Exton, and $\mathcal{R}(yD_{q})$ of Rogers-Ramanujan, when $u=1,q,\sqrt{q},q^2$, respectively. The identities obtained here use a type of deformation for the basic hypergeometric series. Also, we find identities involving the polynomials R$_n(x,y;u,v|q)$, together with generalizations of the Mehler and Rogers formulas.</description>

      <title>Exact threshold and limiting distribution for non-linear Hamilton cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For positive integers $r &gt; \ell \geq 1$, an $\ell$-cycle in an $r$-uniform hypergraph is a cycle where each edge consists of $r$ vertices and each pair of consecutive edges intersect in $\ell$ vertices. For $\ell \geq 2$, we determine the limiting distribution of the number of Hamilton $\ell$-cycles in an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random hypergraph. The behavior is distinguished in two cases:
  -When $\ell \geq 3$, the number of cycles concentrates when the expectation diverges and converges to a Poisson distribution when the expectation is constant.
  -When $\ell = 2$, the normalized number of cycles converges to a lognormal distribution when the expectation diverges and converges to a lognormal mixture of Poisson distributions when the expectation is constant.
  As a result we pin down the exact threshold for the appearance of non-linear Hamilton cycles in random hypergraphs, confirming a conjecture of Narayanan and Schacht.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss optimal $1$-toroidal graphs (abbreviated as O1TG), which are drawn on the torus so that every edge crosses another edge at most once, and has $n$ vertices and exactly $4n$ edges. We first consider connectivity of O1TGs, and give the characterization of O1TGs having connectivity exactly $k$ for each $k\in \{4, 5, 6, 8\}$. In our argument, we also show that there exists no O1TG having connectivity exactly $7$. Furthermore, using the result above, we discuss extendability of matchings, and give the characterization of $1$-, $2$- and $3$-extendable O1TGs in turn.</description>

Abstract: We show that observables in QED-type theories can be realized in terms of a combinatorial structure called chord diagrams. One advantage of this combinatorial representation is that it simplifies the study of the asymptotic behavior of corresponding Green functions. Particularly, using the new representation, there is no need to use the standard approach of singularity analysis. This relation also reveals the unexplained correlation between the number of Feynman diagrams in Yukawa theory and the diagrams in quenched QED.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $H$-Induced Minor Containment problem ($H$-IMC) consists in deciding if a fixed graph $H$ is an induced minor of a graph $G$ given as input, that is, whether $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by deleting vertices and contracting edges. Several graphs $H$ are known for which $H$-IMC is NP-complete, even when $H$ is a tree. In this paper, we investigate which conditions on $H$ and $G$ are sufficient so that the problem becomes polynomial-time solvable. Our results identify three infinite classes of graphs such that, if $H$ belongs to one of these classes, then $H$-IMC can be solved in polynomial time. Moreover, we show that if the input graph $G$ excludes long induced paths, then $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for any fixed graph $H$. As a byproduct of our results, this implies that $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for all graphs $H$ with at most $5$ vertices, except for three open cases.</description>

Abstract: For a free curve $C$ of degree $d$ with exponents $(d_1,d_2)$ there is a simple formula relating $d,d_1, d_2$ and the total Tjurina number of $C$. Our first result discusses how this result changes when the curve $C$ is no longer free. For a free line arrangement with exponents $(d_1,d_2)$, the Poincar\'e polynomial coincides with the Betti polynomial $B(t)$ and with the product $P(t)=(1+d_1t)(1+d_2t)$. Our second result shows that for any curve $C$, the difference $P(t)-B(t)$ is a polynomial $a t +bt^2$, with $a$ and $b$ non-negative integers. Moreover $a =0$ or $b=0$ if and only if $C$ is a free line arrangement. We also give a combinatorial restriction which a potential minimal counter-example to Terao's Conjecture must satisfy. Moreover, we make more precise a result by H. Schenck concerning the relation between the exponents and the maximal multiplicity of points in any line arrangement.</description>
