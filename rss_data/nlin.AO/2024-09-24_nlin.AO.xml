      <title>Why collective behaviours self-organise to criticality: A primer on information-theoretic and thermodynamic utility measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective behaviours are frequently observed to self-organise to criticality. Existing proposals to explain these phenomena, such as Self-organised Criticality (SOC), are fragmented across disciplines and only partially answer the question. This paper investigates the underlying, intrinsic, utilities that may explain self-organisation of collective behaviours near criticality. We focus on information-driven approaches such as predictive information, empowerment, and active inference, as well as thermodynamic efficiency, which incorporates both information-theoretic and thermodynamic quantities. By interpreting the Ising model as a perception-action loop, we compare how different intrinsic utilities shape collective behaviour and analyse the distinct characteristics that arise when each is optimised. In particular, we highlight that at the critical regime thermodynamic efficiency balances the predictability gained by the system and its energy costs. Finally, we propose the Principle of Super-efficiency, suggesting that collective behaviours self-organise to the critical regime where optimal efficiency is achieved with respect to the entropy reduction relative to the thermodynamic costs.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility in Bacterial Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Irreversibility, in which a transient perturbation leaves a system in a new state, is an emergent property in systems of interacting entities. This property has well-established implications in statistical physics but remains underexplored in biological networks, especially for bacteria and other prokaryotes whose regulation of gene expression occurs predominantly at the transcriptional level. Focusing on the reconstructed regulatory network of \emph{Escherichia coli}, we examine network responses to transient single-gene perturbations. We predict irreversibility in numerous cases and find that the incidence of irreversibility increases with the proximity of the perturbed gene to positive circuits in the network. Comparison with experimental data suggests a connection between the predicted irreversibility to transient perturbations and the evolutionary response to permanent perturbations.</description>

      <title>Extreme events in two-coupled chaotic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since 1970, the R\"ossler system has remained as a considerably simpler and minimal dimensional chaos serving system. Unveiling the dynamics of a system of two coupled chaotic oscillators that leads to the emergence of extreme events in the system is an engrossing and crucial scientific research area. Our present study focuses on the emergence of extreme events in a system of diffusively and bidirectionally two coupled R\"ossler oscillators and unraveling the mechanism behind the genesis of extreme events. We find the appearance of extreme events in three different observables: average velocity, synchronization error, and one transverse directional variable to the synchronization manifold. The emergence of extreme events in average velocity variables happens due to the occasional in-phase synchronization. The on-off intermittency plays for the crucial role in the genesis of extreme events in the synchronization error dynamics and in the transverse directional variable to the synchronization manifold. The bubble transition of the chaotic attractor due to the on-off intermittency is illustrated for the transverse directional variable. We use generalized extreme value theory to study the statistics of extremes. The extreme events data sets concerning the average velocity variable follow generalized extreme value distribution. The inter-event intervals of the extreme events in the average velocity variable spread well exponentially. The upshot of the interplay between the coupling strength and the frequency mismatch between the system oscillators in the genesis of extreme events in the coupled system is depicted numerically.</description>

      <title>Sub-nanosecond all-optically reconfigurable photonics in optical fibres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel all-optical platform in multimode and multicore fibres. By using a low-power probe beam and a high-power counter-propagating control beam, we achieve advanced and dynamic control over light propagation within the fibres. This setup enables all-optical reconfiguration of the probe, which is achieved by solely tuning the control beam power. Key operations such as fully tuneable power splitting and mode conversion, core-to-core switching and combination, along with remote probe characterization, are demonstrated at the sub-nanosecond time scale. Our experimental results are supported by a theoretical model that extends to fibres with an arbitrary number of modes and cores. The implementation of these operations in a single platform underlines its versatility, a critical feature of next-generation photonic systems. These results represent a significant shift from existing methods that rely on electro-optical or thermo-optical modulation for tunability. They pave the way towards a fast and energy-efficient alternative through all-optical modulation, a keystone for the advancement of future reconfigurable optical networks and optical computing. Scaling these techniques to highly nonlinear materials could underpin ultrafast all-optically programmable integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order adaptive synchronization in a chaotic neural network with parameter mismatch: A dynamical system vs. machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the reduced-order synchronization problem between two chaotic memristive Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) neurons of different orders using two distinct methods. The first method employs the Lyapunov active control technique. Through this technique, we develop appropriate control functions to synchronize a 4D chaotic HR neuron (response system) with the canonical projection of a 5D chaotic HR neuron (drive system). Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. The second method is data-driven and leverages a machine learning-based control technique. Our technique utilizes an ad hoc combination of reservoir computing (RC) algorithms, incorporating reservoir observer (RO), online control (OC), and online predictive control (OPC) algorithms. We anticipate our effective heuristic RC adaptive control algorithm to guide the development of more formally structured and systematic, data-driven RC control approaches to chaotic synchronization problems, and to inspire more data-driven neuromorphic methods for controlling and achieving synchronization in chaotic neural networks in vivo.</description>
