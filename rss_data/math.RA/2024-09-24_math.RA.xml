      <title>Colour algebras over rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a unital commutative associative ring such that $\frac{1}{2}\in R$. We define colour algebras over $R$. Colour algebras can be constructed canonically by employing nondegenerate ternary hermitian forms with trivial determinant. We investigate their structure, automorphism group and derivations. As over fields, colour algebras over $R$ are closely related to octonion algebras over $R$.</description>

      <title>Invertibility in partially ordered nonassociative rings and in Hausdorff Cauchy-complete weak-quasi-topological nonassociative rings endowed with an ordered ring valued seminorm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16565v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Invertibility is important in ring theory because it enables division and facilitates solving equations. Moreover, (nonassociative) rings can be endowed with an extra ''structure'' such as order and topology allowing more richness in the theory. The two main theorems of this article are contributions to invertibility in the context of partially ordered nonassociative rings \textit{and} Hausdorff sequentially Cauchy-complete weak-quasi-topological nonassociative rings. Specifically, the first theorem asserts that the interval $]0,1]$ in any suitable partially ordered nonassociative ring consists entirely of invertible elements. The second theorem asserts that if $f$ is a suitably generalized concept of seminorm from a nonassociative ring to a partially ordered nonassociative ring endowed with Frink's interval topology, then under certain conditions, the subset of elements such that $f(1-a) &lt; 1$ consists entirely of invertible elements. Part of the assumption of the second theorem is that of Hausdorff sequential Cauchy-completeness of the first ring under the topology induced by the seminorm $f$ (which takes values in a partially ordered nonassociative ring endowed with Frink's interval topology). Frink's interval topology is an example of a coarse locally-convex $T_1$ topology. Moreover, to our knowledge, the topology induced by a seminorm into a partially ordered nonassociative ring has never been introduced. Some additional original facts, such as the fact that the topology on a nonassociative ring $R_1$ induced by a norm into a totally ordered associative division ring $R_2$ endowed with Frink's interval topology (or equivalently, with the order topology, since the order of $R_2$ is total) is a Hausdorff locally convex quasi-topological group with an additional separate continuity property of the product, are dealt with in the second section ''Preliminaries''.</description>

      <title>Nilpotency indices for quantum Schubert cell algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum analogs of $\operatorname{ad}$-nilpotency and Engel identities in quantum Schubert cell algebras ${\mathcal U}_q^+[w]$. For each pair of Lusztig root vectors, $X_\mu$ and $X_\lambda$, in ${\mathcal U}_q^+[w]$, where $w$ belongs to a finite Weyl group $W$ and $\mu$ precedes $\lambda$ with respect to a convex order on the roots in $\Delta_+ \cap w(\Delta_-)$, we find the smallest natural number $k$, called the nilpotency index, so that $\left(\operatorname{ad}_q X_\mu \right)^k$ sends $X_\lambda$ to $0$, where $\operatorname{ad}_q X_\mu$ is the $q$-adjoint map.
  We start by observing that every pair of Lusztig root vectors can be naturally associated to a triple $(u, i, j)$, where $u \in W$ and $i$ and $j$ are indices such that $\ell(s_i u s_j) = \ell(u) - 2$. In light of this, we define an equivalence relation, based upon the weak left and weak right Bruhat orders, on the set of such triples. We show this equivalence relation respects nilpotency indices, and that each equivalence class contains an element of the form $(v, r, s)$, where $v$ is either (1) a bigrassmannian element satisfying a certain orthogonality condition, or (2) the longest element of some subgroup of $W$ generated by two simple reflections. For each such $(v, r, s)$, we compute the associated nilpotency index.</description>

      <title>Linear independence over naturally-ordered semirings with applications to dimension arguments in extremal combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of subsets $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\{1, 2, \ldots, n\})$ has the disparate union property if any two disjoint subfamilies $\mathcal{F}_1, \mathcal{F}_2 \subseteq \mathcal{F}$ have distinct unions $\bigcup \mathcal{F}_1 \neq \bigcup \mathcal{F}_2$; what is the maximal size of a family with the disparate union property? Is there a simple and efficiently computable characterization of size-maximal families? This paper highlights a class of partially-ordered semirings -- difference ordered semirings with a multiplicatively absorbing element -- and shows it is common and easily constructed. We prove that a suitably modified definition of linear independence for semimodules over such semirings enjoys the same maximality property as for vector spaces, and can furthermore be efficiently detected by the bideterminant. These properties allow us to extend dimension argument in extremal combinatorics and provide simple and direct solutions to the puzzles above.</description>

      <title>On the faithful flatness of some modules arising in analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of faithful flatness of a module over a commutative ring is studied for two $R$-modules $M$ arising in functional analysis, where $R$ is a Banach algebra and $M$ is a Hilbert space. The following results are shown:
  If $X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff topological space, and $\mu$ is a positive Radon measure on $X$, then $L^2(X,\mu)$ is a flat $L^\infty(X,\mu)$-module.
  Moreover:
  (1) If $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite, then for every finitely generated, nonzero, proper ideal $\mathfrak{n}$ of $L^\infty(X,\mu)$, there holds $\mathfrak{n}L^2(X,\mu)\subsetneq L^2(X,\mu)$.
  (2) If $X$ is the union of an increasing family of Borel sets $U_n$, $n\in \mathbb{N}$, such that for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$, $\overline{U_n}$ is compact and $\mu(U_{n+1}\setminus U_n)&gt;0$, then $L^2(X,\mu)$ is not a faithfully flat $L^\infty(X,\mu)$-module.
  It is shown that the Hardy space $H^2$ is a flat, but not a faithfully flat $H^\infty$-module. This answers Alban Quadrat's question from 2005, and is based on an outline answer given by Donald Sarason.</description>

      <title>Nonstandard polynomials: algebraic properties and elementary equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the first-order classification problem for rings $R$ of polynomials $F[x_1, \ldots,x_n]$ and Laurent polynomials $F[x_1,x_1^{-1}, \ldots,x_n,x_n^{-1}]$ with coefficients in an infinite field $F$ or the ring of integers $\mathbb Z$, that is, we describe the algebraic structure of all rings $S$ that are first-order equivalent to $R$. Our approach is based on a new and very powerful method of regular bi-interpretations, or more precisely, regular invertible interpretations. Namely, we prove that $F[x_1, \ldots,x_n]$ and $F[x_1,x_1^{-1}, \ldots,x_n,x_n^{-1}]$ are regularly bi-interpretable with the list superstructure $\mathbb S(F,\mathbb N)$ of $F$, which is equivalent to regular bi-interpretation with the superstructure $HF(F)$ of hereditary finite sets over $F$. The expressive power of $\mathbb S(F,\mathbb N)$ is the same as that of the weak second-order logic over $F$. Hence, the first-order logic in $R = F[x_1, \ldots,x_n]$ or $R = F[x_1,x_1^{-1}, \ldots,x_n,x_n^{-1}]$ is equivalent to the weak second-order logic in $F$ (following the terminology of Kharlampovich, Myasnikov, and Sohrabi [16], such structures are necessarily rich), which allows one to describe the algebraic structure of all rings $S$ with $S\equiv R$. In fact, these rings $S$ are precisely the ``non-standard'' models of $R$, like in non-standard arithmetic or non-standard analysis. This is particularly straightforward when $F$ is regularly bi-interpretable with $\mathbb N$, in this case the ring $R$ is also bi-interpretable with $\mathbb N$. Using our approach, we describe various, sometimes rather surprising, algebraic and model-theoretic properties of the non-standard models of $R$.</description>

Abstract: A monomial algebra is the quotient of a polynomial algebra by an ideal generated by monomials. We prove that finite monomial algebras are characterized by their automorphism group among finite, local algebras with cotangent space of fixed dimension. In particular, we show how to recover a monomial ideal given the automorphism group of the corresponding monomial algebra.</description>

      <title>Scattering diagrams, tight gradings, and generalized positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2013, Lee, Li, and Zelevinsky introduced combinatorial objects called compatible pairs to construct the greedy bases for rank-2 cluster algebras, consisting of indecomposable positive elements including the cluster monomials. Subsequently, Rupel extended this construction to the setting of generalized rank-2 cluster algebras by defining compatible gradings. We discover a new class of combinatorial objects which we call tight gradings. Using this, we give a directly computable, manifestly positive, and elementary but highly nontrivial formula describing rank-2 consistent scattering diagrams. This allows us to show that the coefficients of the wall-functions on a generalized cluster scattering diagram of any rank are positive, which implies the Laurent positivity for generalized cluster algebras and the strong positivity of their theta bases.</description>

Abstract: Derived $A_\infty$-algebras have a wealth of theoretical advantages over regular $A_\infty$-algebras. However, due to their bigraded nature, in practice they are often unwieldy to work with. We develop a framework involving brace algebras on operads which allows us to study derived $A_\infty$ algebras in a new conceptual context. One particular advantage is that this construction allows us to generalize the Lie algebra structure on the Hochschild complex of an $A_\infty$-algebra, obtaining new and rigorous versions of the Deligne conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a field with a set of discrete valuations $V$, we show how the genus of a division algebra over the field is related to the genus of the residue algebras at various valuations in $V$ and the ramification data. When the division algebra is a quaternion, we show the triviality of genus over many fields which include higher local fields, function fields of curves over higher local fields and function fields of curves over real closed fields. We also consider function fields of curves over global fields with a rational point and show how the genus problem is related to the $2$-torsion of the Tate-Shafarevich group of its Jacobian. As a special case, we show how the methods developed yield better bounds on the size of the genus over function fields of elliptic curves and demonstrate how they can be computed directly using arithmetic data of the elliptic curve with a number of examples.</description>

Abstract: The Magnus expansion, introduced by Wilhelm Magnus in 1954, is an infinite Lie series employed to express solutions for first-order homogeneous linear differential equations involving a linear operator. Since its discovery it has evolved into a pivotal tool used across diverse disciplines, including physics, chemistry, and engineering. Over the past 25 years, the Magnus expansion has undergone significant mathematical developments which revealed an intricate interplay between algebra, combinatorics, and geometry. By emphasizing a modern perspectives based on the use of pre- and post-Lie algebras, we discuss the Magnus expansion from the viewpoint of the notion of crossed morphism.</description>

      <title>Multi-quasisymmetric functions with semigroup exponents, Hopf algebras and Rota-Baxter algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many years ago, G.-C.~Rota discovered a close connection between symmetric functions and Rota-Baxter algebras, and proposed to study generalizations of symmetric functions in the framework of Rota-Baxter algebras. Guided by this proposal, quasisymmetric functions from weak composition (instead of just compositions) were obtained from free Rota-Baxter algebras on one generator. This paper aims to generalize this approach to free Rota-Baxter algebras on multiple generators in order to obtain further generalizations of quasisymmetric functions. For this purpose and also for its independent interest, the space $\mathrm{MQSym}$ of quasisymmetric functions on multiple sequences of variables is defined, generalizing quasisymmetric functions and diagonally quasisymmetric functions of Aval, Bergeron and Bergeron. Linear bases of such multi-quasisymmetric functions are given by monomial multi-quasisymmetric functions and fundamental multi-quasisymmetric functions, the latter recover the fundamental $G^m$-quasisymmetric functions of Aval and Chapoton. Next introduced is the even more general notion of multi-quasisymmetric functions $\mathrm{MQSym}^E$ with exponents in a semigroup $E$, which also generalizes the quasisymmetric functions with semigroup exponents in a recent work. Through this approach, a natural Hopf algebraic structure is obtained on $\mathrm{MQSym}^E$. Finally, in support of Rota's proposal, the free commutative unitary Rota-Baxter algebra on a finite set is shown to be isomorphic to a scalar extension of $\mathrm{MQSym}^E$, a fact which in turn equips the free Rota-Baxter algebra with a Hopf algebra structure.</description>

Abstract: We extend based cluster algebras from finite ranks to infinite ranks. By extending (quantum) cluster algebras associated with double Bott-Samelson cells, we recover infinite rank cluster algebras arising from representations of (shifted) quantum affine algebras.
  As the main application, we show that the fundamental variables of the cluster algebras associated with double Bott-Samelson cells could be computed via a braid group action when the Cartan matrix is of finite type. We also obtain the result A=U for the associated infinite rank (quantum) cluster algebras. Additionally, several conjectures regarding quantum virtual Grothendieck rings by Jang-Lee-Oh and Oh-Park follow as consequences. Finally, we show that the cluster algebras arising from representations of shifted quantum affine algebras have natural quantization.</description>
