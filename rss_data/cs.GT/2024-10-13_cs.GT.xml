      <title>When does additional information lead to longer travel time in multi-origin-destination networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Informational Braess' Paradox (IBP) illustrates a counterintuitive scenario where revelation of additional roadway segments to some self-interested travelers leads to increased travel times for these individuals. IBP extends the original Braess' paradox by relaxing the assumption that all travelers have identical and complete information about the network. In this paper, we study the conditions under which IBP does not occur in networks with non-atomic selfish travelers and multiple origin-destination pairs. Our results completely characterize the network topologies immune to IBP, thus resolving an open question proposed by Acemoglu et al.</description>

      <title>Last-iterate Convergence in Regularized Graphon Mean Field Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To model complex real-world systems, such as traders in stock markets, or the dissemination of contagious diseases, graphon mean-field games (GMFG) have been proposed to model many agents. Despite the empirical success, our understanding of GMFG is limited. Popular algorithms such as mirror descent are deployed but remain unknown for their convergence properties. In this work, we give the first last-iterate convergence rate of mirror descent in regularized monotone GMFG. In tabular monotone GMFG with finite state and action spaces and under bandit feedback, we show a last-iterate convergence rate of $O(T^{-1/4})$. Moreover, when exact knowledge of costs and transitions is available, we improve this convergence rate to $O(T^{-1})$, matching the existing convergence rate observed in strongly convex games. In linear GMFG, our algorithm achieves a last-iterate convergence rate of $O(T^{-1/5})$. Finally, we verify the performance of the studied algorithms by empirically testing them against fictitious play in a variety of tasks.</description>

      <title>Best-of-Both-Worlds Fairness of the Envy-Cycle-Elimination Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of fairly dividing indivisible goods among agents with additive valuations. It is known that an Epistemic EFX and $2/3$-MMS allocation can be obtained using the Envy-Cycle-Elimination (ECE) algorithm. In this work, we explore whether this algorithm can be randomized to also ensure ex-ante proportionality. For two agents, we show that a randomized variant of ECE can compute an ex-post EFX and ex-ante envy-free allocation in near-linear time. However, for three agents, we show that several natural randomization methods for ECE fail to achieve ex-ante proportionality.</description>

      <title>Optimal Correlated Equilibria in General-Sum Extensive-Form Games: Fixed-Parameter Algorithms, Hardness, and Two-Sided Column-Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.07181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding optimal correlated equilibria of various sorts in extensive-form games: normal-form coarse correlated equilibrium (NFCCE), extensive-form coarse correlated equilibrium (EFCCE), and extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE). We make two primary contributions. First, we introduce a new algorithm for computing optimal equilibria in all three notions. Its runtime depends exponentially only on a parameter related to the information structure of the game. We also prove a fundamental complexity gap: while our size bounds for NFCCE are similar to those achieved in the case of team games by Zhang et al., this is impossible to achieve for the other two concepts under standard complexity assumptions. Second, we propose a two-sided column generation approach for use when the runtime or memory usage of the previous algorithm is prohibitive. Our algorithm improves upon the one-sided approach of Farina et al. by means of a new decomposition of correlated strategies which allows players to re-optimize their sequence-form strategies with respect to correlation plans which were previously added to the support. Experiments show that our techniques outperform the prior state of the art for computing optimal general-sum correlated equilibria.</description>

      <title>Approval-Based Voting with Mixed Goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a voting scenario in which the resource to be voted upon may consist of both indivisible and divisible goods. This setting generalizes both the well-studied model of multiwinner voting and the recently introduced model of cake sharing. Under approval votes, we propose two variants of the extended justified representation (EJR) notion from multiwinner voting, a stronger one called EJR for mixed goods (EJR-M) and a weaker one called EJR up to 1 (EJR-1). We extend three multiwinner voting rules to our setting -- GreedyEJR, the method of equal shares (MES), and proportional approval voting (PAV) -- and show that while all three generalizations satisfy EJR-1, only the first one provides EJR-M. In addition, we derive tight bounds on the proportionality degree implied by EJR-M and EJR-1, and investigate the proportionality degree of our proposed rules.</description>

      <title>Data-Scarce Identification of Game Dynamics via Sum-of-Squares Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how players adjust their strategies in games, based on their experience, is a crucial tool for policymakers. It enables them to forecast the system's eventual behavior, exert control over the system, and evaluate counterfactual scenarios. The task becomes increasingly difficult when only a limited number of observations are available or difficult to acquire. In this work, we introduce the Side-Information Assisted Regression (SIAR) framework, designed to identify game dynamics in multiplayer normal-form games only using data from a short run of a single system trajectory. To enhance system recovery in the face of scarce data, we integrate side-information constraints into SIAR, which restrict the set of feasible solutions to those satisfying game-theoretic properties and common assumptions about strategic interactions. SIAR is solved using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization, resulting in a hierarchy of approximations that provably converge to the true dynamics of the system. We showcase that the SIAR framework accurately predicts player behavior across a spectrum of normal-form games, widely-known families of game dynamics, and strong benchmarks, even if the unknown system is chaotic.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning of state-based potential games for process optimization in decentralized manufacturing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel transfer learning approach in state-based potential games (TL-SbPGs) for enhancing distributed self-optimization in manufacturing systems. The approach focuses on the practical relevant industrial setting where sharing and transferring gained knowledge among similar-behaved players improves the self-learning mechanism in large-scale systems. With TL-SbPGs, the gained knowledge can be reused by other players to optimize their policies, thereby improving the learning outcomes of the players and accelerating the learning process. To accomplish this goal, we develop transfer learning concepts and similarity criteria for players, which offer two distinct settings: (a) predefined similarities between players and (b) dynamically inferred similarities between players during training. We formally prove the applicability of the SbPG framework in transfer learning. Additionally, we introduce an efficient method to determine the optimal timing and weighting of the transfer learning procedure during the training phase. Through experiments on a laboratory-scale testbed, we demonstrate that TL-SbPGs significantly boost production efficiency while reducing power consumption of the production schedules while also outperforming native SbPGs.</description>

      <title>Hedging and Approximate Truthfulness in Traditional Forecasting Competitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In forecasting competitions, the traditional mechanism scores the predictions of each contestant against the outcome of each event, and the contestant with the highest total score wins. While it is well-known that this traditional mechanism can suffer from incentive issues, it is folklore that contestants will still be roughly truthful as the number of events grows. Yet thus far the literature lacks a formal analysis of this traditional mechanism. This paper gives the first such analysis. We first demonstrate that the ''long-run truthfulness'' folklore is false: even for arbitrary numbers of events, the best forecaster can have an incentive to hedge, reporting more moderate beliefs to increase their win probability. On the positive side, however, we show that two contestants will be approximately truthful when they have sufficient uncertainty over the relative quality of their opponent and the outcomes of the events, a case which may arise in practice.</description>

      <title>Admissibility Over Winning: A New Approach to Reactive Synthesis in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reactive synthesis is a framework for modeling and automatically synthesizing strategies in robotics, typically through computing a \emph{winning} strategy in a 2-player game between the robot and the environment. Winning strategies, however, do not always exist, even in some simple cases. In such situations, it is still desirable for the robot to attempt its task rather than "giving up". In this work, we explore the notion of admissibility to define strategies beyond winning, tailored specifically for robotic systems. We introduce an ordering of admissible strategies and define \emph{admissibly rational strategies}, which aim to be winning and cooperative when possible, and non-violating and hopeful when necessary. We present an efficient synthesis algorithm and demonstrate that admissibly rational strategies produce desirable behaviors through case studies.</description>
