      <title>Unraveling pairon excitations and the antiferromagnetic contributions in the cuprate specific heat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal measurements, such as the entropy and the specific heat, reveal key elementary excitations for understanding the cuprates. In this paper, we study the specific heat measurements on three different compounds La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ and YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ and show that the data are compatible with `pairons' and their excitations. However, the precise fits require the contribution of the antiferromagnetic entropy deduced from the magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)$.
  Two temperature scales are involved in the excitations above the critical temperature $T_c$: the pseudogap $T^*$, related to pairon excitations, and the magnetic correlation temperature, $T_{max}$, having very different dependencies on the carrier density ($p$). In agreement with our previous analysis of $\chi(T)$, the $T_{max}(p)$ line is not the signature of a gap in the electronic density of states, but is rather the temperature scale of strong local antiferromagnetic correlations which dominate for low carrier concentration. These progressively evolve into paramagnetic fluctuations in the overdoped limit.
  Our results are in striking contradiction with the model of J. L. Tallon and J. G. Storey [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 107}, 054507 (2023)], who reaffirm the idea of a $T$-independent gap $E_g$, whose temperature scale $T_g=E_g/k_B$ decreases linearly with $p$ and vanishes at a critical value $p_c \sim 0.19$.
  Finally, we discuss the unconventional fluctuation regime above $T_c$, which is associated with a mini-gap $\delta\sim$ 2\,meV in the pairon excitation spectrum. This energy scale is fundamental to the condensation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Quest for nuclear quadrupole relaxation in HgCa$_{2}$Ba$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derived a simple reduced form from the exact solution of the mixed magnetic and quadrupolar nuclear spin-lattice relaxation function at the central transition line of a quadrupole-split NMR spectrum for nuclear spin $I$ = 3/2. From the application of the reduced form to the $^{63}$Cu nuclear spin-lattice relaxation curves in the high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductors of $^{63}$Cu-enriched triple-layer HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{\delta}$, we estimated the nuclear electric quadrupole spin-lattice relaxation rate $^{63}W_Q$ and the upper limit.</description>

      <title>Large-scale simulations of vortex Majorana zero modes in topological crystalline insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological crystalline insulators are known to support multiple Majorana zero modes (MZMs) at a single vortex, their hybridization is forbidden by a magnetic mirror symmetry $M_T$. Due to the limited energy resolution of scanning tunneling microscopes and the very small energy spacing of trivial bound states, it remains challenging to directly probe and demonstrate the existence of multiple MZMs. In this work, we propose to demonstrate the existence of MZMs by studying the hybridization of multiple MZMs in a symmetry breaking field. The different responses of trivial bound states and MZMs can be inferred from their spatial distribution in the vortex. However, the theoretical simulations are very demanding since it requires an extremely large system in real space. By utilizing the kernel polynomial method, we can efficiently simulate large lattices with over $10^8$ orbitals to compute the local density of states which bridges the gap between theoretical studies based on minimal models and experimental measurements. We show that the spatial distribution of MZMs and trivial vortex bound states indeed differs drastically in tilted magnetic fields. The zero-bias peak elongates when the magnetic field preserves $M_T$, while it splits when $M_T$ is broken, giving rise to an anisotropic magnetic response. Since the bulk of SnTe are metallic, we also study the robustness of MZMs against the bulk states, and clarify when can the MZMs produce a pronounced anisotropic magnetic response.</description>

      <title>Topological gauge theory of vortices in type-III superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional superconductors fall into two categories, type-I, expelling magnetic fields, and type-II, into which magnetic fields exceeding a lower critical field $H_{\rm c1}$ penetrate in form of Abrikosov vortices. Abrikosov vortices are characterized by two spatial scales, the size of the normal core, $\xi$, where the superconducting order parameter is suppressed and the London penetration depth $\lambda$, describing the scale at which circulating superconducting currents forming vortices start to noticeably drop. Here we demonstrate that a novel type-III superconductivity, realized in granular media in any dimension hosts a novel vortex physics. Type-III vortices have no cores, are logarithmically confined and carry only a gauge scale $\lambda$. Accordingly, in type-III superconductors $H_{\rm c1}=0$ at zero temperature and the Ginzburg-Landau theory must be replaced by a topological gauge theory. Type-III superconductivity is destroyed not by Cooper pair breaking but by vortex proliferation generalizing the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless mechanism to any dimension.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised learning for denoising quasiparticle interference data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunneling spectroscopy is an important tool for the study of both real-space and momentum-space electronic structure of correlated electron systems. However, such measurements often yield noisy data. Machine learning provides techniques to reduce the noise in post-processing, but traditionally requires noiseless examples which are unavailable for scientific experiments. In this work we adapt the unsupervised Noise2Noise and self-supervised Noise2Self algorithms, which allow for denoising without clean examples, to denoise quasiparticle interference data. We first apply the techniques on simulated data, and demonstrate that we are able to reduce the noise while preserving finer details, all while outperforming more traditional denoising techniques. We then apply the Noise2Self technique to experimental data from an overdoped cuprate ((Pb,Bi)$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$) sample. Denoising enhances the clarity of quasiparticle interference patterns, and helps to obtain a precise extraction of electronic structure parameters. Self-supervised denoising is a promising tool for denoising quasiparticle interference data, facilitating deeper insights into the physics of complex materials.</description>

      <title>Finite-momentum superconductivity in two-dimensional altermagnets with a Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the finite-momentum superconductivity in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets with a Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (RSOC). We show the phase diagrams obtained by solving the linearized gap equation. We consider two directions of the N\'{e}el vector of the 2D altermagnet: parallel to the $x$-$y$ plane (in-plane) and perpendicular to the $x$-$y$ plane (out-of-plane). For the in-plane N\'{e}el vector, we find two different finite-momentum $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconducting states distinguished by a dominant pairing channel: the inter-band pairing or the intra-band pairing. Furthermore, it is shown that an asymmetric deformation of Fermi surfaces caused by spin-splitting effects due to the in-plane altermagnet and the RSOC stabilizes the finite-momentum superconductivity with a large band splitting. For the out-of-plane N\'{e}el vector, the finite-momentum superconductivity is found only in the inter-band pairing mechanism, which is in contrast to the in-plane case.</description>

      <title>Unique quantum metallic state in the titanium sesquioxide heterointerface superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum metallic state marked by a saturating finite electrical resistance in the zero-temperature limit in a variety of two-dimensional superconductors injects an exciting momentum to the realm of heterostructure superconductivity. Despite much research efforts over last few decades, there is not yet a general consensus on the nature of this unexpected quantum metal. Here, we report the observation of a unique quantum metallic state within the hallmark of Bose-metal in the titanium sesquioxide heterointerface superconductor Ti$_2$O$_3$/GaN. Remarkably, the quantum bosonic metallic state continuously tuned by a magnetic field in the vicinity of the two-dimensional superconductivity-metal transition persists in the normal phase, indicating the existence of composite bosons formed by electron Cooper pairs even in the normal phase. Our findings provide a distinct evidence for electron pairing in the normal phase of heterointerface superconductors, and shed fresh light on the pairing nature underlying heterointerface superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Photon Blockade for Nonreciprocal Quantum Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the flow of photons is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. We introduce the concept of spatiotemporal photon blockade for nonreciprocal quantum absorption, utilizing space-time-periodic metasurfaces. Our study presents a methodology for experimentally realizing this effect, where photon frequency coherence with the metasurface's space-time modulation enables one-way quantum absorption. In this system, forward-traveling photons are energetically modulated and absorbed within the slab, while backward-traveling photons are transmitted without interaction. Our analysis includes band structure, isofrequency diagrams, and nonreciprocal absorption results. These findings lay the groundwork for developing nonreciprocal quantum devices and enhancing photon management in milli-Kelvin temperature quantum systems.</description>
