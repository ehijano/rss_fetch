      <title>Adaptive Patching for Tensor Train Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantics Tensor Train (QTT) operations such as matrix product operator contractions are prohibitively expensive for large bond dimensions. We propose an adaptive patching scheme that exploits block-sparse QTT structures to reduce costs through divide-and-conquer, adaptively partitioning tensors into smaller patches with reduced bond dimensions. We demonstrate substantial improvements for sharply localized functions and show efficient computation of bubble diagrams and Bethe-Salpeter equations, opening the door to practical large-scale QTT-based computations previously beyond reach.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Interpretable Physical Laws in Materials via Language-Model-Guided Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering interpretable physical laws from high-dimensional data is a fundamental challenge in scientific research. Traditional methods, such as symbolic regression, often produce complex, unphysical formulas when searching a vast space of possible forms. We introduce a framework that guides the search process by leveraging the embedded scientific knowledge of large language models, enabling efficient identification of physical laws in the data. We validate our approach by modeling key properties of perovskite materials. Our method mitigates the combinatorial explosion commonly encountered in traditional symbolic regression, reducing the effective search space by a factor of approximately $10^5$. A set of novel formulas for bulk modulus, band gap, and oxygen evolution reaction activity are identified, which not only provide meaningful physical insights but also outperform previous formulas in accuracy and simplicity.</description>

      <title>Ceci n'est pas un committor, yet it samples like one: efficient sampling via approximated committor functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic simulations are widely used to investigate reactive processes but are often limited by the rare event problem due to kinetic bottlenecks. We recently introduced an enhanced sampling approach based on the committor function, machine-learned following a variational principle. This method combines a transition-state-oriented bias potential, expressed as a functional of the committor, with a metadynamics-like bias along a committor-based collective variable, enabling uniform exploration of reaction pathways. In its original formulation, the committor is represented by a neural network that takes physical descriptors as input and is trained by minimizing a functional involving gradients with respect to atomic coordinates, which can be computationally demanding in some cases. Here, we propose a simplified learning criterion formulated entirely in the descriptor space, which bypasses the need for explicit and costly coordinate gradients and provides a relaxed upper bound to the original variational principle. Although this approach does not formally target the exact committor, we show that it retains robust sampling performance while significantly reducing computational costs, thus enabling the study of processes that would be practically unfeasible using the original formulation.</description>

      <title>mrfmsim: a modular, extendable, and readable simulation platform for magnetic resonance force microscopy experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present mrfmsim, an open-source package that facilitates the design, simulation, and signal validation of magnetic resonance force microscopy experiments. The mrfmsim package uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to model experiments and employs a plugin system that enables adding custom experiments and functionalities. Unlike common DAG-powered workflow packages, mrfmsim allows flexible customization of experiments post-definition, such as optimized looping, without requiring rewriting the internal model. In this paper, we highlight the challenges of building simulation packages for experiments that undergo continuous development in a graduate research setting. We demonstrate how a one-off approach to experimental simulation yielded erroneous results, and how the modularity, extendibility, and readability of the new platform enabled correct results and a significantly accelerated development cycle.</description>

      <title>A Reduced Order Model approach for First-Principles Molecular Dynamics Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To leverage the redundancy between the electronic structure computed at each step of first-principles molecular dynamics, we present a data-driven modeling framework for Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory that bypasses the explicit optimization of electronic wavefunctions. We sample a priori representative atomic configurations and construct a low-dimensional basis that efficiently approximates the electronic structure subspace. Subsequently, we employ this reduced basis in a direct solver for the electronic single particle density matrix, thereby enabling the efficient determination of ground state without iterative wavefunction optimization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics of a water molecule, showing that the resulting simulations accurately reproduce key structural properties, such as bond lengths and bond angle, obtained from full first-principles molecular dynamics. This work highlights the potential of data-driven approaches to develop efficient electronic structure solvers for first-principles simulations.</description>

      <title>First-principles and tight-binding analysis of thermoelectricity in irradiated WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic and thermoelectric transport in zigzag monolayer WSe$_2$ nanoribbons are studied under monochromatic irradiation. The electronic structure is described within a six-orbital tight-binding framework constructed from the relevant tungsten and selenium orbitals, with atomic spin-orbit coupling included explicitly. Periodic driving is incorporated via the Peierls substitution, and in the high-frequency limit the system is mapped onto an effective static Floquet Hamiltonian with polarization-dependent renormalized hoppings. Coherent transport is evaluated using wave-function matching within the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism. The lattice thermal conductivity is obtained independently from density functional perturbation theory combined with an iterative solution of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. Light-induced hopping renormalization reshapes the band dispersion and transmission spectrum near the Fermi level, modifying the Landauer transport integrals that determine electrical and thermal conductances and the Seebeck coefficient. Together with spin-orbit-driven band splitting and reduced lattice thermal conductivity from enhanced anharmonic scattering, this leads to a thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$ exceeding unity over a broad temperature range.</description>

      <title>HELIOS: A surface integral equation software for light scattering in homogeneous, periodic, and stratified environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present HELIOS (HomogEneous and Layered medIa Optical Scattering), an open-source surface integral equation (SIE) software designed for modeling light scattering by particles embedded in homogeneous or layered media and periodic backgrounds. The code implements the Poggio-Miller-Chang-Harrington-Wu-Tsai (PMCHWT) formulation that has demonstrated exceptional reliability in solving scattering problems with penetrable objects. Domain boundaries are discretized using triangular meshes, upon which the electric and magnetic surface current densities are expanded using the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis functions. For periodic structures, such as photonic crystals and metasurfaces, HELIOS employs Ewald's transformation to efficiently evaluate the infinite series associated with 2D lattices. Regarding stratified media, the code utilizes a matrix-friendly approach for the layered media Green's tensor, computing Sommerfeld integrals and accelerating calculations through a tabulation-interpolation scheme. The source code is implemented in C++, while a Python interface manages the workflow, including simulation setup, solver run, and post-processing. The accuracy and versatility of HELIOS are demonstrated through various examples that cover all its functionalities.</description>

      <title>Shape optimization of metastable states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The definition of metastable states is an ubiquitous task in the design and analysis of molecular simulation, and is a crucial input in a variety of acceleration methods for the sampling of long configurational trajectories.
  Although standard definitions based on local energy minimization procedures can sometimes be used, these definitions are typically suboptimal, or entirely inadequate when entropic effects are significant, or when the lowest energy barriers are quickly overcome by thermal fluctuations.
  In this work, we propose an approach to the definition of metastable states, based on the shape-optimization of a local separation of timescale metric directly linked to the efficiency of a class of accelerated molecular dynamics algorithms.
  To realize this approach, we derive analytic expressions for shape-variations of Dirichlet eigenvalues for a class of operators associated with reversible elliptic diffusions, and use them to construct a local ascent algorithm, explicitly treating the case of multiple eigenvalues.
  We propose two methods to make our method tractable in high-dimensional systems: one based on dynamical coarse-graining, the other on recently obtained low-temperature shape-sensitive spectral asymptotics.
  We validate our method on a benchmark biomolecular system, showcasing a significant improvement over conventional definitions of metastable states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The finite difference time domain method is one of the simplest and most popular methods in computational electromagnetics. This work considers two possible ways of generalising it to a meshless setting by employing local radial basis function interpolation. The resulting methods remain fully explicit and are convergent if properly chosen hyperviscosity terms are added to the update equations. We demonstrate that increasing the stencil size of the approximation has a desirable effect on numerical dispersion. Furthermore, our proposed methods can exhibit a decreased dispersion anisotropy compared to the finite difference time domain method.</description>

      <title>MaxwellLink: A unified framework for self-consistent light-matter simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major challenge in light-matter simulations is bridging the disparate time and length scales of electrodynamics and molecular dynamics. Current computational approaches often rely on heuristic approximations of either the electromagnetic (EM) or the material component, hindering the exploration of complex light-matter systems. Herein, MaxwellLink -- a modular, open-source Python framework -- is developed for the massively parallel, self-consistent propagation of classical EM fields interacting with a large heterogeneous molecular ensemble. The package utilizes a robust TCP/UNIX socket interface to couple EM solvers with a wide range of molecular drivers. In this initial release, MaxwellLink supports EM solvers spanning from single-mode cavities to full-feature three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) engines, and molecules described by multilevel open quantum systems, force-field and first-principles molecular dynamics, and nonadiabatic real-time Ehrenfest dynamics. With the socket-based architecture, users can seamlessly switch between levels of theory of either the EM solver or molecules without modifying the counterpart. Moreover, the EM engine and molecular drivers scale independently across multiple high-performance computing (HPC) nodes, facilitating large-scale simulations previously inaccessible to existing numerical schemes. The versatility and accuracy of this code are further demonstrated through applications including superradiance, radiative energy transfer, vibrational strong coupling in Bragg resonators, and plasmonic heating of molecular gases. By providing a unified, extensible engine, MaxwellLink potentially offers a powerful platform for exploring emerging phenomena across the research fronts of spectroscopy, quantum optics, plasmonics, and polaritonics.</description>

      <title>SODAs: Sparse Optimization for the Discovery of Differential and Algebraic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) integrate ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with algebraic constraints, providing a fundamental framework for developing models of dynamical systems characterized by timescale separation, conservation laws, and physical constraints. While sparse optimization has revolutionized model development by allowing data-driven discovery of parsimonious models from a library of possible equations, existing approaches for dynamical systems assume DAEs can be reduced to ODEs by eliminating variables before model discovery. This assumption limits the applicability of such methods for DAE systems with unknown constraints and time scales. We introduce Sparse Optimization for Differential-Algebraic Systems (SODAs), a data-driven method for the identification of DAEs in their explicit form. By discovering the algebraic and dynamic components sequentially without prior identification of the algebraic variables, this approach leads to a sequence of convex optimization problems. It has the advantage of discovering interpretable models that preserve the structure of the underlying physical system. To this end, SODAs improves numerical stability when handling high correlations between library terms, caused by near-perfect algebraic relationships, by iteratively refining the conditioning of the candidate library. We demonstrate the performance of our method on biological, mechanical, and electrical systems, showcasing its robustness to noise in both simulated time series and real-time experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An adaptive physics-inspired model design strategy for machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is proposed. This strategy relies on iterative reconfigurations of composite models from single-term models, followed by a unified training procedure. A model evaluation method based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and multiple-property error metrics is also proposed to guide the model reconfiguration and hyperparameter optimization. By combining the reconfiguration and the evaluation subroutines, we provide an adaptive MLIP design strategy that balances flexibility and extensibility. In a case study of designing models against a structurally diverse niobium dataset, we managed to obtain an optimal model configuration with 75 parameters generated by our framework that achieved a force RMSE of 0.172 eV/{\AA} and an energy RMSE of 0.013 eV/atom.</description>

      <title>Fast and Flexible Probabilistic Forecasting of Dynamical Systems using Flow Matching and Physical Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning dynamical systems from incomplete or noisy data is inherently ill-posed, as a single observation may correspond to multiple plausible futures. While physics-based ensemble forecasting relies on perturbing initial states to capture uncertainty, standard Gaussian or uniform perturbations often yield unphysical initial states in high-dimensional systems. Existing machine learning approaches address this via diffusion models, which rely on inference via computationally expensive stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We introduce a novel framework that decouples perturbation generation from propagation. First, we propose a flow matching-based generative approach to learn physically consistent perturbations of the initial conditions, avoiding artifacts caused by Gaussian noise. Second, we employ deterministic flow matching models with Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) integrators for efficient ensemble propagation with fewer integration steps. We validate our method on nonlinear dynamical system benchmarks, including the Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey system, MovingMNIST, and high-dimensional WeatherBench data (5.625$^\circ$). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art probabilistic scoring, as measured by the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), and physical consistency, while offering significantly faster inference than diffusion-based baselines.</description>

      <title>Geometric Autoencoder Priors for Bayesian Inversion: Learn First Observe Later</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is paramount for inference in engineering. A common inference task is to recover full-field information of physical systems from a small number of noisy observations, a usually highly ill-posed problem. Sharing information from multiple distinct yet related physical systems can alleviate this ill-possendess. Critically, engineering systems often have complicated variable geometries prohibiting the use of standard multi-system Bayesian UQ. In this work, we introduce Geometric Autoencoders for Bayesian Inversion (GABI), a framework for learning geometry-aware generative models of physical responses that serve as highly informative geometry-conditioned priors for Bayesian inversion. Following a ''learn first, observe later'' paradigm, GABI distills information from large datasets of systems with varying geometries, without requiring knowledge of governing PDEs, boundary conditions, or observation processes, into a rich latent prior. At inference time, this prior is seamlessly combined with the likelihood of a specific observation process, yielding a geometry-adapted posterior distribution. Our proposed framework is architecture agnostic. A creative use of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) sampling yields an efficient implementation that utilizes modern GPU hardware. We test our method on: steady-state heat over rectangular domains; Reynold-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow around airfoils; Helmholtz resonance and source localization on 3D car bodies; RANS airflow over terrain. We find: the predictive accuracy to be comparable to deterministic supervised learning approaches in the restricted setting where supervised learning is applicable; UQ to be well calibrated and robust on challenging problems with complex geometries.</description>

Abstract: The efficiency of recombination is of crucial importance for the existence of ultracold plasmas (UCP), particularly, the ones formed in the magneto-optical traps. Unfortunately, the equilibrium thermodynamic treatment of the ionization-recombination processes is inappropriate for the evolving UCP clouds, while the straightforward kinetic simulation encounters the problem of huge difference in the spatial and temporal scales for free and bound motion of the electrons. As a result, only the "virtual" electron-ion pairs are usually reproduced in such modeling, and it is necessary to employ some heuristic criteria to identify them with the recombined atoms. It is the aim of this paper to present the first successful "ab initio" simulation of the non-equilibrium recombination in the evolving UCP plasmas. We employed a special algorithm, which is based on using the "scalable" reference frame, co-moving with the expanding substance. Then, the recombination events are identified by a series of sharp equidistant peaks in the kinetic and/or potential energies, which are caused by the captured electrons passing near the pericenters of their orbits; and this is confirmed by a detailed inspection of their trajectories. Thereby, we were able to trace the real - rather than "virtual" - electron-ion pairs, and the total efficiency of their formation was found to be about 20%, which is in agreement with the laboratory measurements.</description>

      <title>peapods: A Rust-Accelerated Monte Carlo Package for Ising Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present peapods (github.com/PeaBrane/peapods), an open-source Python package for Monte Carlo simulation of Ising spin systems with arbitrary coupling constants on periodic Bravais lattices with user-specified neighbor offsets. The computational core is written in Rust and exposed to Python via PyO3, combining the ergonomic interface of Python with the performance of compiled, memory-safe code. The package implements Metropolis and Gibbs single-spin-flip algorithms, Swendsen-Wang and Wolff cluster updates, parallel tempering, and three replica cluster moves for spin glasses: the Houdayer isoenergetic cluster move, the Jorg stochastic variant, and the Chayes-Machta-Redner (CMR) blue-bond algorithm. Overlap statistics between replica pairs enable computation of the spin glass order parameter and Binder ratio. Replica-level parallelism is achieved through the Rayon work-stealing scheduler. We validate the implementation against the exact critical temperatures of the two-dimensional Ising model on the square and triangular lattices via finite-size scaling of the Binder cumulant.</description>
