      <title>Seeing the Outer Edge of the Infant Type Ia Supernova 2024epr in the Optical and Near Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical-to-near infrared (NIR) photometry and spectroscopy of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2024epr, including NIR spectra observed within two days of first light. The early-time optical spectra show strong, high-velocity Ca and Si features near rarely-observed velocities at $\sim$0.1$c$, and the NIR spectra show a \CI\ "knee." Despite these high-velocity features at early times, SN~2024epr evolves into a normal SN Ia, albeit with stronger peak-light Ca absorption than other SNe Ia with the same light curve shape. Although we infer a normal decline rate, $\Delta m_{15}(B)=1.09\pm0.12$ mag, from the light-curve rise, SN 2024epr is a Branch "cool" object and has red early-time colors ($g-r\approx0.15$ mag at $-10$ days). The high velocities point to a density enhancement in the outer layers of the explosion, but thick-shell He-detonation models do not match the smoothly rising light curve or lack of He in our early-time NIR spectra. No current models (e.g., delayed detonation or thin He shell double detonation) appear to reproduce all of the observed properties. Such constraints are only possible for SN 2024epr from the earliest optical and NIR observations, highlighting their importance for constraining SN Ia models. Finally, we find several other SNe Ia with intermediate mass elements at $\sim$30\,000 km s$^{-1}$ within days after the explosion that evolve into otherwise normal SNe Ia at peak light, suggesting the early-time spectra of SNe Ia may hide a broad diversity of observational characteristics.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Low Universal Equilibrium Black Hole Spin in Luminous Magnetically Arrested Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic collimated outflows, or jets, provide a crucial mode of active galactic nucleus feedback. Although the jets extract their energy from the black hole (BH) rotation, their effect on the BH spin is poorly understood. Because the spin controls radiative and mechanical BH feedback, lack of first-principles models for BH spin evolution limits our ability to interpret observations, including the recent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA spin constraints. Particularly important are luminous disks, which rapidly grow and strongly torque their BHs. Jet-less and weakly magnetized standard luminous disks spin-up their BHs to near-maximum dimensionless spin, $a_{eq,NT}=0.998$. However, sufficient large-scale vertical magnetic flux can cause the inner disk to enter a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state, whose jets can efficiently extract BH rotational energy and significantly spin-down the BH. Indeed, Lowell et al. 2024 found that non-radiative MADs spin-down their BHs to very low $a_\text{eq,MAD}^\text{nr}=0.07$. Moreover, their analytic model predicted that luminous MADs also spin-down their BHs to low $a_{eq,MAD}^{lum}\sim0.3-0.5$. To test this prediction, we perform 3D general relativistic (radiation) magnetohydrodynamic (GR(R)MHD) simulations of MADs across a wide range of BH spin ($-0.9\le{}a\le0.99$) and disk dimensionless thickness ($0.03\le{}h/r\le0.3$, which corresponds to Eddington ratio, $0.35\le{}\dot{m}/\dot{m}_\text{Edd}\le\infty$). We find that luminous MADs spin-down their BHs to a low universal equilibrium spin value, $a_{eq,MAD}^{lum}\simeq0.3$ for $0.03\le{}h/r\le0.1$. Moreover, we find evidence for quadratic convergence, $a_{eq,MAD}\simeq0.31-2.71(h/r)^2\to0.31$ as $h/r\to0$. We attribute this to disk thermodynamics becoming irrelevant as the cooling becomes more aggressive and magnetic forces start to dominate. We finish by discussing the astrophysical implications.</description>

      <title>Viscous accretion and ejection from tori around black holes in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically perform long-term (millions of Schwarzschild time) axisymmetric viscous hydrodynamics simulations for tori around black holes in general relativity supposing the super Eddington accretion flow. The initial condition for the tori is modeled simply by the Fishbone-Moncrief torus with a constant specific angular momentum $j$ but with a wide variety of $j$. We find that for a given density profile, the fraction of the mass infall onto the black hole is approximately proportional to $j^{-1}$, indicating that only a minor fraction of the matter in the torus formed far from the black hole falls into the black hole while the majority is ejected with the typical average velocity of a few percent of the speed of light. We also find that the mass ejection is driven only outside $\approx 2\,r_\mathrm{ISCO}$ where $r_\mathrm{ISCO}$ is the areal radius of the innermost stable circular orbit around black holes, which depends strongly on the black hole spin. We derive an approximate fitting formula for the spin-dependence on the mass infall fraction as $\propto r_\mathrm{ISCO}^{0.7}$, which suggests that the rapid growth of supermassive black holes proceeded primarily by the accretion of the matter with the angular momentum counter-rotating with the black hole spin.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Hunt for Extraterrestrial High-Energy Neutrino Counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been a decade since the IceCube collaboration began detecting high-energy (HE) neutrinos originating from cosmic sources. Despite a few well-known individual associations and numerous phenomenological, observational, and statistical multiwavelength studies, the origin of astrophysical HE neutrinos largely remains a mystery. To date, the most convincing associations link HE neutrinos with active galactic nuclei (AGN). Consequently, many studies have attempted population-based correlation tests between HE neutrinos and specific AGN subpopulations (such as blazars). While some of associations are suggestive, no definitive population-based correlation has been established. This could result from either a lack of a population-based correlation or insufficient detection power, given the substantial atmospheric neutrino background. By leveraging blazar variability, we performed spatio-temporal blazar-neutrino correlation tests aimed at enhancing detection power by reliably incorporating temporal information into the statistical analysis. We used simulations to evaluate the detection power of our method under various test strategies. We find that: (1) with sufficiently large source samples, if 20% of astrophysical HE neutrinos originate from blazars, we should robustly observe $\sim$4$\sigma$ associations; (2) a counting-based test-statistic combined with a top-hat weighting scheme (rather than a Gaussian one) provides the greatest detection power; (3) applying neutrino sample cuts reduces detection power when a weighting scheme is used; (4) in top-hat-like weighting schemes, small p-values do not occur arbitrarily with an increase in HE neutrino error region size (any such occurrence is indicative of an underlying blazar-neutrino correlation).</description>

      <title>Effects of spacetime geometry on neutrino oscillation inside a Core-Collapse Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos are excellent probes of the inner structures of supernovas. However, an understanding of their dynamics remains incomplete, which is crucial for properly interpreting the detector data. The huge matter density inside a core-collapse supernova affects the self-coupling of the neutrinos through a geometrical four-fermion interaction induced by spacetime torsion generated by the fermions themselves. For normal mass hierarchy, the effect is negligible; for inverted mass hierarchy however, we find that the gravitational coupling can significantly alter the flavor dynamics. The possibility of constraining the said interactions through the relative abundance of different flavors of the neutrinos is discussed.</description>

      <title>The zoo of isolated neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovered over fifty years ago, neutron stars exhibit a remarkable variety of behaviors depending on their age, magnetic field strength, rotational dynamics, emission mechanisms, and surrounding environments. This diversity in their observational manifestations has led astronomers to classify neutron stars into numerous categories, much like wandering through a zoo and admiring various species. This chapter focuses on isolated (i.e., non-accreting) neutron stars. We review extensive observational results of rotation-powered pulsars, magnetars, X-ray dim isolated neutron stars and central compact objects, highlighting the unique properties and recent discoveries of these neutron star classes. We briefly touch on theoretical models that have significantly advanced our understanding of these classes, emphasizing the valuable insights they provide into the underlying physics of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Properties of 'Lite' Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Candidates in LIGO-Virgo's Third Observing Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over a hundred gravitational-wave (GW) detections and candidates have been reported from the first three observing runs of the Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detectors. Among these, the most intriguing events are binary black hole mergers that result in a 'lite' intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) of ${\sim}10^2~\mathrm{M}_\odot$, such as GW170502 and GW190521. In this study, we investigate 11 GW candidates from LVK's Third Observing Run (April 2019-March 2020) that have a total detector-frame masses in the lite IMBH range. Using the Bayesian inference algorithm \texttt{RIFT}, we systematically analyze these candidates with three state-of-the-art waveform models that incorporate higher harmonics, which are crucial for resolving lite IMBHs in LVK data. For each candidate, we infer the pre-merger and post-merger black hole masses in the source frame, along with black hole spin projections across all three models. Under the assumption that these are binary black hole mergers, our analysis finds that 5 of them have a post-merger lite IMBH with masses ranging from $110\sim 350~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ with over 90\% confidence interval. Additionally, we note that one of their pre-merger black holes is within the pair-instability supernova mass gap ($60-120~\mathrm{M}_\odot$) with more than 90\% confidence interval, and additional two pre-merger black holes above the mass-gap. Furthermore, we report discrepancies among the three waveform models in their mass and spin inferences of lite IMBHs, with at least three GW candidates showing deviations beyond accepted statistical limits. While the astrophysical certainty of these candidates cannot be established, our study provides a foundation to probe the lite IMBH population that emerge within the low-frequency noise spectrum of LVK detectors.</description>

      <title>Relationship between the $\gamma-$ray variability and the pc-scale jet in the blazar 3C 454.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3C 454.3 is a flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) known for its high variability across the electromagnetic spectrum, showing structural and flux variability in its pc-scale jet, and correlated variability among frequency bands. This study aims to identify the structure, dynamics, and radiative processes common to the innermost regions of the blazar 3C 454.3. We investigate whether any jet component can be associated with $\gamma-$ray emission and variability. We analyze the relationship between the variable $\gamma-$ray emission and pc-scale jet properties in 3C 454.3 by combining $\gamma-$ray data spanning twelve years with contemporaneous VLBA multi-epoch images at 15 and 43 GHz. Spearman rank correlation tests are conducted to determine if the flux variability of any jet component is associated with $\gamma-$ray variability. Core emission at 43 and 15 GHz strongly correlates with $\gamma-$ray emission. The 43 GHz core (Q0) contributes around 37$\%$ of the observed $\gamma-$ray variability, while the 15 GHz core (K0) accounts for 30$\%$. A quasi-stationary component at 43 GHz, at a projected distance of 4.6 pc, correlates with the $\gamma-$ray flux, accounting for 20$\%$ of its emission between 2016 and 2021. We found a mobile component (Q3 between 2010.18 and 2011.16) at 43 GHz with a projected distance between 0.8 and 2.3 pc and apparent velocity of $\beta_{app} = 9.9 \pm 1.1$ c, accounting for approximately 28% of the $\gamma-$ray emission. The observed simultaneous variability in emission regions beyond the central parsec strongly suggests synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) as the primary mechanism for $\gamma-$ray production in these regions. Our findings demonstrate the existence of multiple $\gamma-$ray emission regions within the blazar jet but also suggest that some of these regions are non-stationary over time.</description>

      <title>Seasonal Variations of the Atmospheric Muon Neutrino Spectrum measured with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an energy-dependent analysis of seasonal variations in the atmospheric muon neutrino spectrum, using 11.3 years of data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. By leveraging a novel spectral unfolding method, we explore the energy range from 125 GeV to 10 TeV for zenith angles between 90{\deg} to 110{\deg}, corresponding to the Antarctic atmosphere. Our findings reveal that the seasonal variation amplitude decreases with energy reaching ($-4.6 \pm 1.1$)\% during Austral winter and increases ($+3.9 \pm 1.2$)\% during Austral summer relative to the annual average at 10TeV. While the unfolded flux exceeds the model predictions by up to 30\%, the differential measurement of seasonal variations remains unaffected. The measured seasonal variations of the muon neutrino spectrum are consistent with theoretical predictions using the MCEq code and the NRLMSISE-00 atmospheric model.</description>

      <title>Rapidly spinning dark matter-admixed neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17948v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars, representing the older neutron star population, are believed to have undergone a prolonged period of dark matter accumulation, resulting in a higher dark matter content. Their extreme rotation makes them unique laboratories for studying rapidly rotating neutron stars admixed with dark matter. In this work, we model uniformly rotating neutron stars with a dark matter component that rotates independently from the baryon matter, allowing for the investigation of both co-rotating and counter-rotating scenarios. We examine the impact of dark matter rotation on the macroscopic properties of neutron stars, including the mass-radius relation, the mass-shedding Keplerian limit, and moments of inertia, for various dark matter particle masses and total fractions, considering both core and halo distributions. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of how dark matter influences the equilibrium properties of rotating neutron stars, offering new insights into the astrophysical implications of self-interacting dark matter.</description>

      <title>Identification and characterisation of the gamma-ray counterpart of the transitional pulsar candidate CXOU J110926.4-650224</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) represent a crucial link between the rotation-powered and accretion-powered states of binary pulsars. During their active X-ray state, tMSPs are the only low-mass X-ray binary systems detected up to GeV energies by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). CXOU J110926.4-650224 is a newly discovered tMSP candidate in an active X-ray state, potentially spatially compatible with a faint gamma-ray source listed in the latest Fermi-LAT point-source catalogue as 4FGL J1110.3-6501. Confirming the association between CXOU J110926.4-650224 and the Fermi source is a key step toward validating its classification as a tMSP. In this study, we analyse Fermi-LAT data collected from August 2008 to June 2023 to achieve a more accurate localisation of the gamma-ray source, characterise its spectral properties, and investigate potential time variability. By thoroughly reconstructing the gamma-ray background around the source using a weighted likelihood model, we obtain a new localisation that aligns with the position of the X-ray source at the 95% confidence level, with a Test Statistic value of $\sim 42$. This establishes a spatial association between the gamma-ray source and CXOU J110926.4-650224. The gamma-ray emission is adequately described by a power-law model with a photon index of $\Gamma = 2.5 \pm 0.1$ and a corresponding flux of $(3.7\pm0.9) \times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 0.1-300 GeV range.</description>

      <title>The cosmic-ray sea explains the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray and neutrino emission from GeV to PeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LHAASO collaboration has recently released the spectrum and the angular distribution of the $\gamma$-ray Galactic diffuse emission from 1 TeV to 1 PeV measured with the Kilometer-2 Array (KM2A) and Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA). We show that these data are in remarkably good agreement with a set of models that assume the emission to be produced by the Galactic population of cosmic rays if its spectral shape traces that measured by CALET and DAMPE as well as KASCADE at higher energies. No extra-components besides the CR sea is needed to explain LHAASO results. Accounting for unresolved sources, we consistently reproduce Tibet AS$\gamma$ as well as a wide set of $\gamma$-ray data at lower energy. To do this, we consider two different transport setups: a conventional one and a $\gamma$-optimized spatial-dependent one (a development of the widely adopted KRA$_\gamma$ model). We demonstrate that both setups are compatible with LHAASO results. However, the latter is preferred if one takes into account Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data and neutrino measurements. In fact, we also compute the associated Galactic neutrino diffuse emission finding that the contribution from sources cannot be dominant and showing that spatial-dependent propagation models closely match the ANTARES and IceCube best fits for the Galactic Center Ridge and the Galactic Plane emissions. We argue that our $\gamma$-optimized model should be used as a template for future analyses of upcoming data from the Global Neutrino Network.</description>

      <title>Effects of polar structure and moving ejecta on the dynamics of SGRB jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At least some short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) originate from neutron star mergers, systems that release both a relativistic collimated jet and slower, wider ejecta. These jets evolve through a dense, anisotropic medium shaped by the merger process, resulting in interactions that affect their morphology and observable signatures. We investigate the propagation of SGRB jets through funnel-like structures that can be static or expanding with mildly relativistic speed using 2D axisymmetric relativistic hydrodynamic simulations. Our models are based on radial and angular distributions of density and pressure from general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star mergers. We explore different values of the funnel opening angle and density contrast, observing that narrow funnels constrain jet expansion, leading to larger collimation. The polar structure of the ejecta mainly affects the jet evolution in the early stages, whereas the effect of expanding ejecta dominates in later stages. Jets propagating through a low-dense polar funnel move initially faster, while the presence of mildly relativistic ejecta maintains the outflow more collimated after the breakout. Our results highlight the importance of the structure and dynamical properties of the ejecta in shaping SGRB jets and their electromagnetic emission.</description>

      <title>How Does a Protostar Form by Magnetized Gravitational Collapse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star formation through the dynamical magnetized collapse remains an active area of astrophysical research. We carry out a comprehensive exploration on the magnetized gravitational collapse of a non-rotating self-gravitating initially spherically symmetric prestellar cloud core using two-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations incorporating ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation. Our study encompasses a broader range of equations of state (EOSs) in the form of $P(\rho) \propto \rho^{\Gamma}$, with the aim of constraining the choice of EOSs for allowing star formation. Our results reveal that the collapse with a $\Gamma$ no stiffer than $4/3$, complemented by magnetized virial theorem, allows the dynamical contraction of the prestellar core to happen continuously where a central point mass forms and steadily builds up its mass from the infalling envelope, with a mass accretion rate of a scale of the order of $c_{\rm s}^3/G$. The choice of an isothermal EOS most naturally facilitates the collapse as a magnetic analog of the inside-out collapse. In addition to that, our study exhibits that the nonisothermal magnetized collapse models with a $\Gamma$ no stiffer than 4/3 qualitatively demonstrate similar infall features to those of an isothermal EOS. Furthermore, the collapse models with a $\Gamma$ stiffer than $4/3$ fail to ensure the sufficient cooling to allow the direct mass growth of the central point mass, thus delaying the infall. Our work can offer deeper insights in understanding the significance of EOSs on the magnetized gravitational collapse, enabling star formation.</description>

      <title>Effects of limited core rejuvenation on the properties of massive contact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Massive contact binaries are both stellar merger and gravitational wave progenitors, but their evolution is still uncertain. An open problem in the population synthesis of massive contact binaries is the predicted mass ratio distribution. Current simulations evolve quickly to mass ratios close to unity, which is not supported by the sample of observed systems. It has been shown that modifying the near core mixing properties of massive stars can alter the evolution of contact binaries, but it has not been tested on a whole population. Aims. We implement a prescription of the convective core overshooting based on the molecular gradient. The goal of the implementation is to limit the rejuvenation efficiency of the accretor. We aim to investigate the effects of the reduced rejuvenation on the mass ratio distribution of massive contact binaries. Methods. We calculate a grid of 4896 models with the binary-evolution code MESA with our convective overshoot formulation, and we compare the simulations with the known observations of massive contact binaries. Results. We find that by limiting the core rejuvenation through the convective core overshoot, the predicted mass-ratio distribution shifts significantly to values away from unity. This improves the theoretical predictions of the mass ratios of massive contact binaries. Conclusions. The core rejuvenation of the components in massive contact binaries is a key parameter for their predicted mass ratio distribution. Establishing the rejuvenation efficiency with the contact binary population should therefore be possible. The sample size and uncertainties associated to the characterization of contact binaries however prevents us from doing so, and other methods like asteroseismology can place constraints on the rejuvenation process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of solar neutrinos confirmed that the inner workings of the Sun generally match our theoretical understanding of the fusion process. Solar neutrinos have also played a role in discovering that neutrinos have mass and that they oscillate. We combine the latest solar neutrino data along with other oscillation data from reactors to determine the Sun's density profile. We derive constraints given the current data and show the anticipated improvements with more reactor neutrino data from JUNO constraining the true oscillation parameters and more solar neutrino data from DUNE which should provide a crucial measurement of $hep$ neutrinos.</description>

      <title>General-Relativistic Lattice-Boltzmann Method for Radiation Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first extension of the special-relativistic Lattice-Boltzmann Method for radiative transport developed by Weih et al. (2020), to solve the radiative-transfer equation in curved spacetimes. The novel approach is based on the streaming of carefully selected photons along null geodesics and interpolating their final positions, velocities, and frequency shifts to all photons in a given velocity stencil. Furthermore, by transforming between the laboratory frame, the Eulerian frame, and the fluid frame, we are able to perform the collision step in the fluid frame, thus retaining the collision operator of the special-relativistic case with only minor modifications. As a result, with the new method we can model the evolution of the frequency-independent (grey) radiation field as it interacts with a background fluid via absorption, emission, and scattering in a curved background spacetime. Finally, by introducing a refined adaptive stencil, which is suitably distorted in the direction of propagation of the photon bundle, we can reduce the computational costs of the method while improving its performance in the optically-thin regime. A number of standard and novel tests are presented to validate the approach and exhibit its robustness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Optimal Follow-Up of Gravitational-Wave Events with the UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX) is a wide-field ultraviolet space telescope selected as a NASA Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) mission for launch in 2030. UVEX will undertake deep, cadenced surveys of the entire sky to probe low mass galaxies and explore the ultraviolet (UV) time-domain sky, and it will carry the first rapidly deployable UV spectroscopic capability for a broad range of science applications. One of UVEX's prime objectives is to follow up gravitational wave (GW) binary neutron star mergers as targets of opportunity (ToOs), rapidly scanning across their localization regions to search for their kilonova (KN) counterparts. Early-time multiband ultraviolet light curves of KNe are key to explaining the interplay between jet and ejecta in binary neutron star mergers. Owing to high Galactic extinction in the ultraviolet and the variation of GW distance estimates over the sky, the sensitivity to kilonovae can vary significantly across the GW localization and even across the footprint of a single image given UVEX's large field of view. Good ToO observing strategies to trade off between area and depth are neither simple nor obvious. We present an optimal strategy for GW follow-up with UVEX in which exposure time is adjusted dynamically for each field individually to maximize the overall probability of detection. We model the scheduling problem using the expressive and powerful mathematical framework of mixed integer linear programming (MILP), and employ a state-of-the-art MILP solver to automatically generate observing plan timelines that achieve high probabilities of kilonova detection. We have implemented this strategy in an open-source astronomical scheduling software package called the Multi-Mission Multi-Messenger Observation Planning Toolkit (M4OPT), on GitHub at https://github.com/m4opt/m4opt.</description>

      <title>A Massive Black Hole 0.8 kpc from the Host Nucleus Revealed by the Offset Tidal Disruption Event AT2024tvd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) that are spatially offset from the nucleus of their host galaxies offer a new probe of massive black hole (MBH) wanderers, binaries, triples, and recoiling MBHs. Here we present AT2024tvd, the first off-nuclear TDE identified through optical sky surveys. High-resolution imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope shows that AT2024tvd is $0.914\pm 0.010$ arcsec offset from the apparent center of its host galaxy, corresponding to a projected distance of $0.808\pm 0.009$ kpc at $z=0.045$. AT2024tvd exhibits typical properties of nuclear TDEs, including a persistent hot UV/optical component that peaks at $L_{ bb}\sim 6\times 10^{43}\,erg\,s^{-1}$, broad hydrogen lines in its optical spectra, and delayed brightening of luminous ($L_{ X,peak}\sim 3\times 10^{43}\,erg\,s^{-1}$), highly variable soft X-ray emission. The MBH mass of AT2024tvd is $10^{6\pm1}\,M_\odot$, at least 10 times lower than its host galaxy's central black hole mass ($\gtrsim 10^8\,M_\odot$). The MBH in AT2024tvd has two possible origins: a wandering MBH from the lower-mass galaxy in a minor merger during the dynamical friction phase or a recoiling MBH ejected by triple interactions. Combining AT2024tvd with two previously known off-nuclear TDEs discovered in X-rays (3XMM\,J2150 and EP240222a), which likely involve intermediate-mass black holes in satellite galaxies, we find that the parent galaxies of all three events are very massive ($\sim 10^{10.9}\,M_\odot$). This result aligns with expectations from cosmological simulations that the number of offset MBHs scales linearly with the host halo mass.</description>

      <title>Hybrid stars with large quark cores within the parity doublet model and modified NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17859v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the parity doublet model (PDM) for hadronic matter and a modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model for quark matter, we investigate the potential existence of two- and three-flavor quark matter in neutron star cores. Both models respect chiral symmetry, and a sharp first-order phase transition is implemented via Maxwell construction. We find stable neutron stars with quark cores within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. Typical neutron stars with masses around $1.4 \ M_\odot$ may possess deconfined quark matter in their centers. The hybrid star scenario with a two-flavor quark core offers enough parameter space to allow the neutron stars with large quark cores exceeding $\sim 1\ M_\odot$, and allow the early deconfinement position before $2\ \rho_0$, where $\rho_0$ is the nuclear saturation density. The observations of gravitational wave event GW170817 suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600\ \rm MeV$ in the PDM for scenarios involving three-flavor quark matter cores. The maximum mass of the hybrid star with a quark core is found to be approximately $2.2\ M_\odot$ for both two- or three-flavor quark matter in their centers.</description>

      <title>Towards robust gravitational wave detections from individual supermassive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of the stochastic gravitational-wave background via pulsar timing arrays will likely be followed by the detection of individual black hole binaries that stand out above the background. However, to confidently claim the detection of an individual binary, we need not only more and better data, but also more sophisticated analysis techniques. In this paper, we develop two new approaches that can help us more robustly ascertain if a candidate found by a search algorithm is indeed an individual supermassive black hole binary. One of these is a coherence test that directly compares the full signal model to an incoherent version of that. The other is a model scrambling approach that builds null distributions of our detection statistic and compares that with the measured value to quantify our confidence in signal coherence. Both of these rely on finding the coherence between pulsars characteristic to gravitational waves from a binary system. We test these methods on simple simulated datasets and find that they work well in correctly identifying both true gravitational waves and false positives. However, as expected for such a flexible and simple signal model, confidently identifying signal coherence is significantly harder than simply finding a candidate in most scenarios. Our analyses also indicate that the confidence with which we can identify a true signal depends not only on the signal-to-noise ratio, but also on the number of contributing pulsars and the amount of frequency evolution shown by the signal.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal filaments and AGN recurrent activity in the galaxy group Nest200047: a LOFAR, uGMRT, MeerKAT, VLA radio spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18244</link>

Abstract: Nest200047 is a clear example of multiple radio bubbles from an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in a galaxy group, featuring non-thermal filaments likely shaped by buoyancy, gas motions, and stabilized by magnetic fields. This study presents high-quality data obtained from uGMRT, MeerKAT, and VLA, alongside existing LOFAR data, to analyze the system's morphology and spectrum over a broad frequency range (53-1518 MHz). Our findings reveal new filamentary emission in the inner 60 kpc, surrounding and extending from the inner bubbles and jets, suggesting complex dynamical evolution of the non-thermal plasma in the group core. The filaments have widths of a few kpc and lengths from tens to hundreds of kpc, with a steep and curved radio spectrum ($\rm \alpha=1\sim2$). They exhibit a constant spectral index profile along their length, implying particles are either (re-)accelerated together or move at super-Alfvenic speeds. Spectral aging analysis yields jet active times between 50 and 100 Myr with short inactive phases, suggesting continuous energy injection typical of AGN feedback in galaxy groups. This study highlights the potential of combining high-quality radio data to understand recurrent jet activity and feedback, with implications for future research with the SKA observatory.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Lorentz invariance violation in neutrino sector from the ultra-high-energy event KM3-230213A</title>

Abstract: Lorentz invariance is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime and serves as the cornerstone of modern physics, supporting the constancy of the speed of light. A crucial implication of this principle is that no particle can propagate faster than this universal speed limit. In this study, we present a stringent neutrino-based test of Lorentz invariance, utilizing the highest-energy neutrino ever detected, known as event KM3-230213A. The detection of this neutrino, with measured energy of approximately 220 PeV, allows us to establish a lower bound on the scale of second-order Lorentz invariance violation, quantified as \(\Lambda_2&gt;5.0\times 10^{19}\) GeV at 90 \% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Effects of Superradiance in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

Abstract: A supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the core of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) provides room for the elusive ultra-light scalar particles (ULSP) to be produced through a phenomenon called \textit{superradiance}. This phenomenon produces a cloud of scalar particles around the black hole by draining its spin angular momentum. In this work, we present a study of the superradiant instability due to a scalar field in the vicinity of the central SMBH in an AGN. We begin by showing that the time-evolution of the gravitational coupling $\alpha$ in a realistic ambiance created by the accretion disk around the SMBH in AGN leads to interesting consequences such as the amplified growth of the scalar cloud, enhancement of the gravitational wave emission rate, and appearance of higher modes of superradiance within the age of the Universe. We then explore the consequence of superradiance on the characteristics of the AGN. Using the Novikov-Thorne model for an accretion disk, we divide the full spectrum into three wavelength bands- X-ray ($10^{-4}-10^{-2}~\mu$m), UV (0.010-0.4~$\mu$m), and Vis-IR (0.4-100~$\mu$m) and observe sudden drops in the time-variations of the luminosities across these bands and Eddington ratio ($f_{\textrm{Edd}}$) with a characteristic timescale of superradiance. Using a uniform distribution of spin and mass of the SMBHs in AGNs, we demonstrate the appearance of depleted regions and accumulations along the boundaries of these regions in the planes of different band-luminosities and $f_{\textrm{Edd}}$. Finally, we discuss some possible signatures of superradiance that can be drawn from the observed time-variation of the AGN luminosities.</description>

Abstract: The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Telescope (HAWC) has detected TeV halos associated with two nearby pulsars/pulsar wind nebulae (PWN) -- Geminga and B0656+14. These TeV halos extend up to tens of pc from the central accelerators, indicating that the diffusion of ultrarelativistic electrons and positrons in the interstellar medium has been suppressed by two orders of magnitude. Although Geminga and B0656+14 are at similar distances and in the same field of view, they have distinct histories. Notably, B0656+14 probably still resides within its parent supernova remnant, the Monogem Ring, which can be observed in X-rays. In this work, we perform high-resolution simulations of the propagation and emission of relativistic lepton pairs around B0656+14 using a two-zone diffusion model using the GALPROP numerical code. We compared the predicted inverse-Compton spectrum to the observations made by HAWC and Fermi-LAT and found physically plausible model parameters that resulted in a good fit to the data. Additionally, we estimated the contribution of this TeV-halo to the positron flux observed on Earth and found it to be smaller than 10\% of the measured flux. We conclude that future observations of the TeV halo and its synchrotron emission counterpart in radio and X-ray frequencies will be crucial to distinguish between various possible models.</description>

Abstract: Kilonovae are key to advancing our understanding of r-process nucleosynthesis. To date, only two kilonovae have been spectroscopically observed, AT 2017gfo and AT 2023vfi. Here, we present an analysis of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spectra obtained +29 and +61 days post-merger for AT 2023vfi (the kilonova associated with GRB 230307A). After re-reducing and photometrically flux-calibrating the data, we empirically model the observed X-ray to mid-infrared continua with a power law and a blackbody, to replicate the non-thermal afterglow and apparent thermal continuum $\gtrsim 2 \, \mu$m. We fit Gaussians to the apparent emission features, obtaining line centroids of $20218_{-38}^{+37}$, $21874 \pm 89$ and $44168_{-152}^{+153}$\,\AA, and velocity widths spanning $0.057 - 0.110$\,c. These line centroid constraints facilitated a detailed forbidden line identification search, from which we shortlist a number of r-process species spanning all three r-process peaks. We rule out Ba II and Ra II as candidates and propose Te I-III, Er I-III and W III as the most promising ions for further investigation, as they plausibly produce multiple emission features from one (W III) or multiple (Te I-III, Er I-III) ion stages. We compare to the spectra of AT 2017gfo, which also exhibit prominent emission at $\sim 2.1 \, \mu$m, and conclude that [Te III] $\lambda$21050 remains the most plausible cause of the observed $\sim 2.1 \, \mu$m emission in both kilonovae. However, the observed line centroids are not consistent between both objects, and they are significantly offset from [Te III] $\lambda$21050. The next strongest [Te III] transition at 29290\,\AA\ is not observed, and we quantify its detectability. Further study is required, with particular emphasis on expanding the available atomic data to enable quantitative non-LTE spectral modelling.</description>

      <title>Unusual intra-burst variations of polarization states in FRB 20210912A and FRB 20230708A : Effects of plasma birefringence?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are highly energetic events of short-duration intense radio emission, the origin of which remains elusive till date. Polarization of the FRB signals carry information about the emission source as well as the magneto-ionic media the signal passes through before reaching terrestrial radio telescopes. Currently known FRBs show a diverse range of polarization, sometimes with complex features, making it challenging to describe them in a unified model. FRB 20230708A and FRB 20210912A are two bright and highly polarized (apparently) one-off FRBs detected in the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) survey with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) that exhibit time-dependent conversion between linear and circular polarizations as well as intra-burst (apparent) variation of Faraday rotation measure. We investigate the intra-burst temporal evolution of the polarization state of radio emission in these two events using the Poincar\'e sphere representation and find that the trajectories of the polarization state are well described by great circles on the Poincar\'e sphere. These polarization features may be signatures of a transition between two partially coherent orthogonal polarization modes or propagation through a birefringent medium. We find that the observed variations of the polarization states of these two FRBs are qualitatively consistent with a magnetospheric origin of the bursts and the effects of propagation through a birefringent medium with linearly polarized modes located close to the emission source -- likely in the outer magnetosphere or near-wind region of a neutron star.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a PRS associated with FRB 20240114A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery of the fourth persistent radio source (PRS) associated with a fast radio burst (FRB). Following previous indications of a candidate PRS associated with FRB20240114A, we performed deep VLBA observations at 5 GHz to test the presence of a compact radio source within the uncertainty position of this FRB ($\pm$200 mas). We detect a component $\sim$50 mas northwards the nominal position provided by the PRECISE collaboration. The corresponding radio luminosity, together with the Faraday rotation measure provided by previous observations of the FRB, locate this PRS in the expected region of the $L$ vs |RM| relation for the nebular model, further supporting it. The comparison of the measured flux density with the values collected at lower frequency by previous studies indicates a possible steepening of the radio spectrum in the 1-5 GHz range. Optical observations performed with the LBT could reveal that the FRB and its PRS lie at $\sim$1 kpc from the centre of the host galaxy, which is a dwarf sub-solar metallicity starburst galaxy with SFR $\sim 1 M_\odot\;\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ and stellar mass $M\sim10^8 M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>A Search for Low-Mass Neutron Stars in the Third Observing Run of Advanced LIGO and Virgo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most observed neutron stars have masses around 1.4 $M_\odot$, consistent with current formation mechanisms. To date, no sub-solar mass neutron star has been observed. Observing a low-mass neutron star would be a significant milestone, providing crucial constraints on the nuclear equation of state, unveiling a new population of neutron stars, and advancing the study of their formation processes and underlying mechanisms. We present the first targeted search for tidally deformed sub-solar mass binary neutron stars (BNS), with primary masses ranging from 0.1 to 2 $M_\odot$ and secondary masses from 0.1 to 1 $M_\odot$, using data from the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors. We account for the tidal deformabilities of up to $O(10^4)$ of these systems, as low-mass neutron stars are more easily distorted by their companions' gravitational forces. Previous searches that neglect tidal deformability lose sensitivity to low-mass sources, potentially missing more than $\sim30\%$ of detectable signals from a system with a chirp mass of 0.6 $M_\odot$ binaries. No statistically significant detections were made. In the absence of a detection, we place a $90\%$ confidence upper limit on the local merger rate for sub-solar mass BNS systems, constraining it to be $&lt; 6.4\times10^4$ Gpc$^{-3}$Yr$^{-1}$ for a chirp mass of 0.2 $M_\odot$ and $&lt; 2.2\times 10^3$ Gpc$^{-3}$Yr$^{-1}$ for 0.7 $M_\odot$. With future upgrades to detector sensitivity, development of next-generation detectors, and ongoing improvements in search pipelines, constraints on the minimum mass of neutron stars will improve, providing the potential to constrain the nuclear equation of state, reveal new insights into neutron star formation channels, and potentially identify new classes of stars.</description>

      <title>Isolated Black Holes as Potential PeVatrons and Ultrahigh-energy Gamma-ray Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of PeV cosmic rays is a long-standing mystery, and ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray observations would play a crucial role in identifying it. Recently, LHAASO reported the discovery of ``dark'' gamma-ray sources that were detected above 100 TeV without any GeV--TeV gamma-ray counterparts. The origins of these dark gamma-ray sources are unknown. We propose isolated black holes (IBHs) wandering in molecular clouds as the origins of PeV cosmic rays and LHAASO dark sources. An IBH accretes surrounding dense gas, which forms a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) around the IBH. Magnetic reconnection in the MAD can accelerate cosmic-ray protons up to PeV energies. Cosmic-ray protons of GeV-TeV energies fall to the IBH, whereas cosmic-ray protons at sub-PeV energies can escape from the MAD, providing PeV CRs into the interstellar medium. The sub-PeV cosmic-ray protons interact with the surrounding molecular clouds, producing TeV-PeV gamma rays without emitting GeV-TeV gamma rays. This scenario can explain the dark sources detected by LHAASO. Taking into account the IBH and molecular cloud distributions in our Galaxy, we demonstrate that IBHs can provide a significant contribution to the PeV cosmic rays observed on Earth. Future gamma-ray detectors in the southern sky and neutrino detectors would provide a concrete test to our scenario.</description>

Abstract: Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) dominate the galactic gamma-ray sky at very high energies and they are major contributors to the leptonic cosmic ray flux. However, the question of whether or not pulsars also accelerate ions to comparable energies has not yet been experimentally confirmed. We aim to constrain the birth period and pair-production multiplicity for a set of pulsars. In doing so, we aim to constrain the proportion of ions in the pulsar magnetosphere and, hence, the proportion of ions that could enter the pulsar wind. We estimated possible ranges of the value of the average pair production multiplicity for a sample of 26 pulsars in the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) catalogue, which have also been observed by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) telescopes. We then derived lower limits for the pulsar birth periods and average pair production multiplicities for a subset of these sources where the extent of the pulsar wind nebula and surrounding supernova shell have been measured in the radio. We also derived curves for the average pair production multiplicities as a function of birth period for sources recently observed by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). We show that there is a potential for hadrons entering the pulsar wind for most of the H.E.S.S. and LHAASO sources we consider here, which is dependent upon the efficiency of luminosity conversion into particles. We also present estimates of the pulsar birth period for six of these sources, all falling into the range of $\sim$10-50 ms.</description>

Abstract: Lorentz invariance is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime and foundational to modern physics. One of its most important consequences is the constancy of the speed of light. This invariance, together with the geometry of spacetime, implies that no particle can move faster than the speed of light. In this article, we present the most stringent neutrino-based test of this prediction, using the highest energy neutrino ever detected to date, KM3-230213A. The arrival of this event, with an energy of $220^{+570}_{-110}\,\text{PeV}$, sets a constraint on $\delta \equiv c_\nu^2-1 &lt; 4\times10^{-22}$.</description>

      <title>On testing in-vacuo dispersion with the most energetic neutrinos: KM3-230213A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion, an effect such that quantum properties of spacetime slow down particles proportionally to their energies, has been a very active research area since the advent of the Fermi telescope. One of the assumptions made in this 15-year effort is that the phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion has a particle-energy sweet spot: the energy of the particle should be large enough to render the analysis immune to source-intrinsic confounding effects but still small enough to facilitate the identification of the source of the particle. We use the gigantic energy of KM3-230213A as an opportunity to challenge this expectation. For a neutrino of a few hundred PeVs a transient source could have been observed at lower energies several years earlier, even assuming the characteristic scale of in-vacuo dispersion to be close to the Planck scale. We report that GRB090401B is in excellent directional agreement with KM3-230213A, and we discuss a strategy of in-vacuo-dispersion analysis suitable for estimating the significance of KM3-230213A as a GRB090401B-neutrino candidate. The p-value resulting from our analysis (0.015) is not small enough to warrant any excitement, but small enough to establish the point that a handful of such coincidences would be sufficient to meaningfully test in-vacuo dispersion.</description>

      <title>Classical general relativity effects by magnetars with massive quadrupole, angular momentum and a magnetic dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we obtain classical tests of general relativity using the Hartle-Thorne metric endowed with magnetic dipole and electric charge. This metric represents the approximate stationary spacetime of a massive object with the other characteristics mentioned. These tests are light deflection, time delay, peri-astron precession, and gravitational redshift. We also provide numerical estimates for real magnetars and magnetar candidates from the McGill magnetar catalog, the millisecond pulsar PSR B1257+12 and for the Sun in low-activity cycles. Our results find that, although the magnetic dipole moment contribution tends to be negligible compared to the total amount, its comparison to the massive quadrupole moment and rotational contributions varies from one classical test to the next. For light deflection, the magnetic dipole contribution is about 2 orders of magnitude smaller, compared to the rotational contribution. The magnetic dipole moment contribution is present, but is about 6 orders of magnitude smaller than the second-order rotational contribution to the periastron precession, 5 orders of magnitude smaller for the time delay, and negligible within the approximation presented for the gravitational redshift. The magnetic dipole contribution 1 for the calculations made with PSR B1257+12 was also negligible, but the rotational and quadrupole moment contributions were more significant, which makes the argument for possible future detection stronger than the magnetar case. The rotation, massive quadrupole moment and magnetic dipole contributions for the Sun turned out to be negligible as well.</description>

      <title>RAMBO I: Project introduction and first results with uGMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic hot stars can emit both coherent and incoherent non-thermal radio emission. Understanding the nature of these emissions and their connection to stellar rotation and magnetic field characteristics remains incomplete. The RAdio Magnetospheres of B and O stars (RAMBO) project aims to address this gap by systematically detecting and characterizing gyrosynchrotron and cyclotron maser radio emission in rapidly rotating magnetic hot stars. Using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, we present the first detection of radio emission from HD55522 at 650 MHz, confirming it as a new radio-bright magnetic hot star. This supports the predictions of the Centrifugal Breakout model, furthering its application in understanding particle acceleration mechanisms in centrifugal magnetospheres of hot stars. Additionally, we report non-detections for four other targets, improving sensitivity limits by a factor of a few compared to previous observations. These findings demonstrate the potential of RAMBO to uncover the complexities of radio emission in massive stars and highlight the need for broader, multi-wavelength observations to probe magnetospheric physics comprehensively. The sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array will enable significant advancements.</description>

      <title>Influence of dark matter on the structure of strange quark stars in one-fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies the influence of scalar dark matter on the structural properties of strange quark stars (SQS) within a one-fluid framework, considering Yukawa interactions between dark matter and quark matter. Contributions from perturbative QCD, Yukawa interaction between scalar dark matter and quarks, and Bose-Einstein condensation of dark matter are included in the model. We first determine the allowable range of Yukawa interaction coupling by imposing the stability condition for strange quark matter (SQM). Using this range, we derive the equation of state (EOS) for different fractions of dark matter within the total pressure of SQS. These fractions are constrained by the tidal deformability limit from GW170817. The presence of dark matter alters the EOS, leading to changes in the mass-radius relationship, tidal deformability, and stability of SQS. We demonstrate that increasing the mass of dark matter softens the EOS, whereas higher fractions of dark matter lead to stiffer EOSs. We also explore the reasons behind this behavior. Our EOSs not only describe massive objects, such as PSR J0952-0607 and PSR J2215+5135, but also satisfy the tidal deformability constraint from GW170817. These results reveal that incorporating dark matter modifies the EOS, enabling the support of higher stellar masses while maintaining consistency with observational data.</description>
