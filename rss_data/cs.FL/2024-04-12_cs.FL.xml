      <title>Learning Deterministic Multi-Clock Timed Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for active learning of deterministic timed automata with multiple clocks. The algorithm is within the querying framework of Angluin's $L^*$ algorithm and follows the idea proposed in existing work on the active learning of deterministic one-clock timed automata. We introduce an equivalence relation over the reset-clocked language of a timed automaton and then transform the learning problem into learning the corresponding reset-clocked language of the target automaton. Since a reset-clocked language includes the clock reset information which is not observable, we first present the approach of learning from a powerful teacher who can provide reset information by answering reset information queries from the learner. Then we extend the algorithm in a normal teacher situation in which the learner can only ask standard membership query and equivalence query while the learner guesses the reset information. We prove that the learning algorithm terminates and returns a correct deterministic timed automaton. Due to the need of guessing whether the clocks reset at the transitions, the algorithm is of exponential complexity in the size of the target automaton.</description>

      <title>Trading Determinism for Noncommutativity in Edmonds' Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X=X_1\sqcup X_2\sqcup\ldots\sqcup X_k$ be a partitioned set of variables such that the variables in each part $X_i$ are noncommuting but for any $i\neq j$, the variables $x\in X_i$ commute with the variables $x'\in X_j$. Given as input a square matrix $T$ whose entries are linear forms over $\mathbb{Q}\langle{X}\rangle$, we consider the problem of checking if $T$ is invertible or not over the universal skew field of fractions of the partially commutative polynomial ring $\mathbb{Q}\langle{X}\rangle$ [Klep-Vinnikov-Volcic (2020)]. In this paper, we design a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for this problem for constant $k$. The special case $k=1$ is the noncommutative Edmonds' problem (NSINGULAR) which has a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm by recent results [Garg-Gurvits-Oliveira-Wigderson (2016), Ivanyos-Qiao-Subrahmanyam (2018), Hamada-Hirai (2021)].
  En-route, we obtain the first deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for the equivalence testing problem of $k$-tape \emph{weighted} automata (for constant $k$) resolving a long-standing open problem [Harju and Karhum"{a}ki(1991), Worrell (2013)]. Algebraically, the equivalence problem reduces to testing whether a partially commutative rational series over the partitioned set $X$ is zero or not [Worrell (2013)]. Decidability of this problem was established by Harju and Karhum\"{a}ki (1991). Prior to this work, a \emph{randomized} polynomial-time algorithm for this problem was given by Worrell (2013) and, subsequently, a deterministic quasipolynomial-time algorithm was also developed [Arvind et al. (2021)].</description>

      <title>On asymptotically automatic sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the notion of an asymptotically automatic sequence, which generalises the notion of an automatic sequence. While $k$-automatic sequences are characterised by finiteness of $k$-kernels, the $k$-kernels of asymptotically $k$-automatic sequences are only required to be finite up to equality almost everywhere. We prove basic closure properties and a linear bound on asymptotic subword complexity, show that results concerning frequencies of symbols are no longer true for the asymptotic analogue, and discuss some classification problems.</description>
