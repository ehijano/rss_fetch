      <title>Drift-cyclotron loss-cone instability in 3D simulations of a sloshing-ion simple mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetic stability of collisionless, sloshing beam-ion (45{\deg} pitch angle) plasma is studied in a 3D simple magnetic mirror, mimicking the Wisconsin High-temperature superconductor Axisymmetric Mirror (WHAM) experiment. The collisional Fokker-Planck code CQL3D-m provides a slowing-down beam-ion distribution to initialize the kinetic-ion/fluid-electron code Hybrid-VPIC, which then simulates free plasma decay without external heating or fueling. Over 1-10 $\mu$s, drift-cyclotron loss-cone (DCLC) modes grow and saturate in amplitude. DCLC scatters ions to a marginally-stable distribution with gas-dynamic rather than classical-mirror confinement. Sloshing ions can trap cool (low-energy) ions in an electrostatic potential well to stabilize DCLC, but DCLC itself does not scatter sloshing beam-ions into said well. Instead, cool ions must come from external sources such as charge-exchange collisions with a low-density neutral population. Manually adding cool ~1 keV ions improves beam-ion confinement ~2-5x in Hybrid-VPIC simulations, which qualitatively corroborates measurements from real mirror devices with sloshing ions.</description>

      <title>Thermal condensation with polybaric pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have carried out a two-dimensional (2D) simulation of thermal instability (TI) in interstellar matter (ISM), considering it to be a weakly ionized inviscid plasma with radiation loss. We carry out the simulation with the help of our multi-fluid flux-corrected transport (mFCT) code which incorporates a background magnetic field and anisotropic pressure. The anisotropic pressure is modeled with a polybaric pressure model (Stasiewicz 2004). We find that the resultant turbulent state of the interstellar matter (ISM), driven purely by time-dependent heating and cooling with polybaric pressure is similar in nature to the one driven by external forcing such as by supernova feedback. This demonstrates the universal nature of the turbulence in ISM, which is largely isobaric and incompressible. The findings of our analysis is consistent with the contemporary status of knowledge about the multiphase nature of the ISM with volume and mass fractions of the various components of the ISM that is warm, cold, and unstable neutral matter (UNM) in the ranges reported by various numerical and observational analysis.Though the strength of the background magnetic field only marginally affects the overall evolution, the ratio of the parallel and perpendicular pressures can considerably alter the mass and volume fractions of the three phases, which can affect the overall evolution of the TI in the long run.</description>

      <title>Stochastic modeling of blob-like plasma filaments in the scrape-off layer: Time-dependent velocities and pulse stagnation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stochastic model for a super-position of uncorrelated pulses with a random distribution of and correlations between amplitudes and velocities is analyzed. The pulses are assumed to move radially with fixed shape and amplitudes decreasing exponentially in time due to linear damping. The pulse velocities are taken to be time-dependent with a power law dependence on the instantaneous amplitudes, as suggested by blob velocity scaling theories. In accordance with experimental measurements, the pulse function is assumed to be exponential and the amplitudes are taken to be exponentially distributed. As a consequence of linear damping and time-dependent velocities, it is demonstrated that the pulses stagnate during their radial motion. This makes the average pulse waiting time increase radially outwards in the scrape-off layer of magnetically confined plasmas. In the case that pulse velocities are proportional to their amplitudes, the mean value of the process decreases exponentially with radial coordinate, similar to the case when all pulses have the same, time-independent velocity. The profile e-folding length is then given by the product of the average pulse velocity and the parallel transit time. Moreover, both the average pulse amplitude and the average velocity are the same at all radial positions due to stagnation of slow and small-amplitude pulses. In general, an increasing average pulse velocity results in a flattened radial profile of the mean value of the process as well as a higher relative fluctuation level, strongly enhancing plasma-surface interactions.</description>

      <title>Space Time Algebra Formulation of Cold Magnetized Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation and scattering of electromagnetic waves in magnetized plasmas in a state where a global mode has been established or is in turbulence, are of theoretical and experimental interest in thermonuclear fusion research. Interpreting experimental results, as well as predicting plasma behavior requires the numerical solutions of the underlying physics, that is, the numerical solution of Maxwell equations under various initial conditions and, under the circumstances, complex boundary conditions. Casting, the underlying equations in a coordinate free form that exploits the symmetries and the conserved quantities in a form that can easily encompass a variety of initial and boundary conditions is of tantamount importance. Pursuing this task we utilize the advantages the Clifford Algebras can possibly provide. For simplicity we deal with a cold multi-species lossless magnetized plasma. The formulation renders a Dirac type evolution equation for am augmented state that consists of the electric and magnetic field bivectors as well as the polarizations and their associated currents for each species. This evolution equation can be dealt with a general spatial lattice disretization scheme. The evolution operator that dictates the temporal advancement of the state is Hermitian. This formulation is computationally simpler whatever the application could be. However, small wavelength capabilities (on the Debye length scale) for spatially large systems (magnetic confinement devices) is questionable even for conventional super-computers. However, the formulation provided in this work it is entirely suitable and it can be directly transferred in a quantum computer. It is shown that the simplified problem in the present work could be suitable for contemporary rudimentary quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Impact of Two-Population $\alpha$-particle Distributions on Plasma Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of weakly collisional plasmas is well represented by linear theory, and the generated waves play an essential role in the thermodynamics of these systems. The velocity distribution functions (VDF) characterizing kinetic particle behavior are commonly represented as a sum of anisotropic bi-Maxwellians. For the majority of in situ observations of solar wind plasmas enabled by heliospheric missions, a three bi-Maxwellian model is commonly applied for the ions, assuming that the VDF consists of a proton core, proton beam, and a single He ($\alpha$) particle population, each with their own density, bulk velocity, and anisotropic temperature. Resolving an $\alpha$-beam component was generally not possible due to instrumental limitations. The Solar Orbiter Solar Wind Analyser Proton and Alpha Sensor (SWA PAS) resolves velocity space with sufficient coverage and accuracy to routinely characterize secondary $\alpha$ populations consistently. This design makes the SWA PAS dataset ideal for examining effects of the $\alpha$-particle beam on the plasma's kinetic stability. We test the wave signatures observed in the magnetic field power spectrum at ion scales and compare them to the predictions from linear plasma theory, Doppler-shifted into the spacecraft reference frame. We find that taking into account the $\alpha$-particle beam component is necessary to predict the coherent wave signatures in the observed power spectra, emphasizing the importance of separating the $\alpha$-particle populations as is traditionally done for protons. Moreover, we demonstrate that the drifts of beam components are responsible for the majority of the modes that propagate in oblique direction to the magnetic field, while their temperature anisotropies are the primary source of parallel Fast Magnetosonic Modes in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Stability of plasmas through magnetic helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.01193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic helicity, and more broadly magnetic field line topology, impose constraints on the plasma dynamics. Helically interlocked magnetic rings are in a non-trivial topological state. It is harder to bring them into a topologically trivial state than two rings that are not linked. This particular restriction has the consequence that helical plasmas exhibit increased stability in laboratory devices, in the Sun and in the intergalactic medium. Here we discuss how a magnetic field is stabilizing the plasma and preventing it from disruption by the presence of magnetic helicity. We present observational results, numerical experiments and analytical results that illustrate how helical magnetic fields strongly contribute to the long-term stability of some plasmas. We discuss several cases, such as that of solar corona, toroidal fusion devices, the galactic and extragalactic medium, with a special emphasis on extragalactic bubbles.</description>

      <title>Triboplasma assisted chemical conversion in granular systems: a semi-analytic model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a semi-analytic model for a novel plasma-assisted chemical conversion pathway using triboplasmas generated in granular flows. Triboelectric charge relaxation is a well known phenomena where the potential generated from contact charging of particles exceeds the breakdown voltage of the background gas. In this work, we extend the triboelectric charge relaxation theory to include non equilibrium plasma energy and particle balance equations to predict the formation of dissociated and excited species that act as precursors to chemical conversion, for example in plasma-assisted ammonia synthesis. Our example case study with nitrogen background gas and teflon/aluminum tribomaterial system yielded high excited nitrogen species densities per collision that are comparable to current plasma-assisted conversion pathways. We also present a regime diagram for various gases where Paschen breakdown parameters are used to determine whether triboplasmas can be formed for a given effective work-function difference between two materials. Our sensitivity studies indicate particle velocity, particle radius, solids fraction and space charge effects play a critical role in overall plasma densities and excited species production.</description>

      <title>Predicting Thermal Stress and Failure Risk in Monoblock Divertors Using 2D Finite Difference Modelling and Gradient Boosting Regression for Fusion Energy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a combined approach using a 2D finite difference method and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) to analyze thermal stress and identify potential failure points in monoblock divertors made of tungsten, copper, and CuCrZr alloy. The model simulates temperature and heat flux distributions under typical fusion reactor conditions, highlighting regions of high thermal gradients and stress accumulation. These stress concentrations, particularly at the interfaces between materials, are key areas for potential failure, such as thermal fatigue and microcracking. Using the GBR model, a predictive maintenance framework is developed to assess failure risk based on thermal stress data, allowing for early intervention. This approach provides insights into the thermomechanical behavior of divertors, contributing to the design and maintenance of more resilient fusion reactor components.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic anomalous diffusion in microgravity dusty plasma. Part One: Nonequilibrium Statistical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic anomalous dust diffusion in microgravity dusty plasma is investigated using experimental data from the Plasmakristall-4 (PK-4) facility on board the International Space Station. The PK-4 experiment uses video cameras to track individual dust particles, which allows the collection of large amounts of statistical information on the dust particle positions and velocities. These statistics are used to quantify anomalous dust diffusion caused by anisotropies in the plasma-mediated dust-dust interactions in PK-4. Anisotropies are caused by an externally applied polarity-switched electric field, which modifies the ion wakefields surrounding the dust grains. Video data for nine sets of pressure-current conditions are used to recover Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) plots after subtracting particle drift. Position and velocity histograms are fitted to Tsallis nonextensive probability distribution functions (PDFs). Both MSDs and PDFs indicate a crossover from suprathermal to L\'evy diffusion in the axial direction at higher pressure conditions. In addition, increasing the pressure enhances dust thermal equilibrium, while increasing the current drives the system away from equilibrium.</description>
