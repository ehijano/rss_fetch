      <title>Contribution to the study of the flora in the central-west of Tunisia landscape dynamics and evaluation of plant biodiversity of mountain Bouchebka</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study was conducted during 2013 in Bouchebka, located in the central west of Tunisia.Such territory has a typical landscape of the transfrontier region. The series of the forest in Bouchebka is a part of the great mass of Aleppo pine. It is distinguished by the importance of the forest area which covers 92 % of the surface area (19,700 ha). The study attempts to inventory the natural vegetation and characterize ecological terms while highlighting the importance of environmental conditions. The method is based on a phytoecological analysis to quantify the floristic richness and diversity of the ecosystem in the forest of mountains in Bouchebka on the basis of floristic surveys and transects distributed in a stratified, systematic sampling in different vegetation formations that were previously distinguished. Statistical analyzes were performed using the Factorial Correspondence Analysis (FCA). The results show that the forest is composed primarily of the Aleppo pine trees, these forests are characterized by the abundance of young feet (10-25 cm diameter class). The ecosystem includes 12 families and 17 genera, 26 species. Thus the study has identified that the biological spectrum of the study area is characterized by a clear dominance of shrubs (41%) and chamaephytes (32 %). The distribution of plant species is influenced by ecological features of the region: the results show that 82% of species are drought tolerant which shows the arid environment. The region is also characterized by its windy side: 32% of species spread via anemochory. Factor analysis showed a pastoral aspect in the study area, with a presence of cultured human action exerted on the forest land species. Phytological spectrum indicates a predominance of woody species reflecting a territory dominated by open grassy areas, predominantly reflecting an arid climate.</description>

      <title>Controllability in a class of cancer therapy models with co-evolving resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive therapy is a recent paradigm in cancer treatment aiming at indefinite, safe containment of the disease when cure is judged unattainable. In modeling this approach, inherent limitations arise due to the structure of the vector fields and the bounds imposed by toxic side-effects of the drug. In this work we analyze these limitations in a minimal class of models describing a cancer population with a slowly co-evolving drug resistance trait. Chemotherapeutic treatment is introduced as any bounded time-varying input, forcing the cells to adapt to a changing environment. We leverage the affine structure and low dimension of the system to explicitly construct controllable subsets of the state space enclosing sets of equilibria. We show that these controllable sets entirely determine the asymptotic behavior of all trajectories that cannot lead to a cure.</description>

      <title>Costs and benefits of phytoplankton motility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motility skills of phytoplankton have evolved and persisted over millions of years, primarily in response to factors such as nutrient and light availability, temperature and viscosity gradients, turbulence, and predation pressure. Phytoplankton motility is broadly categorized into swimming and buoyancy regulation. Despite studies in the literature exploring the motility costs and benefits of phytoplankton, there remains a gap in our integrative understanding of direct and indirect energy expenditures, starting from when an organism initiates movement due to any biophysical motive, to when the organism encounters intracellular and environmental challenges. Here we gather all available pieces of this puzzle from literature in biology, physics, and oceanography to paint an overarching picture of our current knowledge. The characterization of sinking and rising behavior as passive motility has resulted in the concept of sinking and rising internal efficiency being overlooked. We define this efficiency based on any energy dissipation associated with processes of mass density adjustment, as exemplified in structures like frustules and vacuoles. We propose that sinking and rising are active motility processes involving non-visible mechanisms, as species demonstrate active and rapid strategies in response to turbulence, predation risk, and gradients of nutrients, light, temperature, and viscosity. Identifying intracellular buoyancy-regulating dissipative processes offers deeper insight into the motility costs relative to the organism's total metabolic rate.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle solutions to the 1D nonlocal Fisher--KPP equation with a fractal time derivative in the weak diffusion approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach for constructing quasiparticle-like asymptotic solutions within the weak diffusion approximation for the generalized population Fisher--Kolmogorov--Petrovskii--Piskunov (Fisher--KPP) equation, which incorporates nonlocal quadratic competitive losses and a fractal time derivative of non-integer order $\alpha$, where $0&lt;\alpha\leq 1$. This approach is based on the semiclassical approximation and the principles of the Maslov method. The fractal time derivative is introduced in the framework of $F^{\alpha}$-calculus. The Fisher--KPP equation is decomposed into a system of nonlinear equations that describe the dynamics of interacting quasiparticles within classes of trajectory-concentrated functions. A key element in constructing approximate quasiparticle solutions is the interplay between the dynamical system of quasiparticle moments and an auxiliary linear system of equations, which is coupled with the nonlinear system. General constructions are illustrated through examples that examine the effect of the fractal parameter $\alpha$ on quasiparticle behavior.</description>

      <title>Bang-Bang Optimal Control of Vaccination in Metapopulation Epidemics with Linear Cost Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates optimal vaccination strategies in a metapopulation epidemic model. We consider a linear cost to better capture operational considerations, such as the total number of vaccines or hospitalizations, in contrast to the standard quadratic cost assumption on the control. The model incorporates state and mixed control-state constraints, and we derive necessary optimality conditions based on Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. We use Pontryagin's result to rule out the possibility of the occurrence of singular arcs and to provide a full characterization of the optimal control.</description>

      <title>Random Evolutionary Dynamics in Predator-Prey Systems Yields Large, Clustered Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of speciation, i.e. the introduction of new species through evolution into communities, in the setting of predator-prey systems. Predator-prey dynamics is classically well modeled by Lotka-Volterra equations, also when multiple predator and prey species co-exist. The consequences of the emergence of new species in such systems are much less well understood. We find that introducing random evolving species leads to robust ecosystems in which large numbers of species coexist. Crucially, in these large ecosystems an emergent clustering of species is observed, tying functional differences to phylogenetic history.</description>

      <title>A symmetry-based approach to species-rich ecological communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disordered systems theory provides powerful tools to analyze the generic behaviors of highdimensional systems, such as species-rich ecological communities or neural networks. By assuming randomness in their interactions, universality ensures that many microscopic details are irrelevant to system-wide dynamics; but the choice of a random ensemble still limits the generality of results. We show here, in the context of ecological dynamics, that these analytical tools do not require a specific choice of ensemble, and that solutions can be found based only on a fundamental rotational symmetry in the interactions, encoding the idea that traits can be recombined into new species without altering global features. Dynamical outcomes then depend on the spectrum of the interaction matrix as a free parameter, allowing us to bridge between results found in different models of interactions, and extend beyond them to previously unidentified behaviors. The distinctive feature of ecological models is the possibility of species extinctions, which leads to an increased universality of dynamics as the fraction of extinct species increases. We expect that these findings can inform new developments in theoretical ecology as well as for other families of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Opinion-driven risk perception and reaction in SIS epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze a mathematical model to study the feedback between behavior and epidemic spread in a population that is actively assessing and reacting to risk of infection. In our model, a population dynamically forms an opinion that reflects its willingness to engage in risky behavior (e.g., not wearing a mask in a crowded area) or reduce it (e.g., social distancing). We consider SIS epidemic dynamics in which the contact rate within a population adapts as a function of its opinion. For the new coupled model, we prove the existence of two distinct parameter regimes. One regime corresponds to a low baseline infectiousness, and the equilibria of the epidemic spread are identical to those of the standard SIS model. The other regime corresponds to a high baseline infectiousness, and there is a bistability between two new endemic equilibria that reflect an initial preference towards either risk seeking behavior or risk aversion. We prove that risk seeking behavior increases the steady-state infection level in the population compared to the baseline SIS model, whereas risk aversion decreases it. When a population is highly reactive to extreme opinions, we show how risk aversion enables the complete eradication of infection in the population. Extensions of the model to a network of populations or individuals are explored numerically.</description>
