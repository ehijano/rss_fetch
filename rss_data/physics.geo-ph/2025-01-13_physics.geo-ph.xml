      <title>Resultant force on grains of a real sand dune: How to measure it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dunes are bedforms found on sandy terrains shaped by fluid flow on Earth, Mars, and other celestial bodies. Despite their prevalence, understanding dune dynamics at the grain scale is challenging due to the vast number of grains involved. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach to estimate the forces acting on individual dune grains using images. By combining subaqueous experiments, high-speed camera recordings, discrete numerical simulations, and a specially trained convolutional neural network, we can quantify these forces with high accuracy. This method represents a breakthrough in studying granular dynamics, offering a new way to measure forces not only on dune grains but also on smaller objects, such as rocks, boulders, rovers, and man-made structures, observed in satellite images of both Earth and Mars. This technique expands our ability to analyze and understand fluid-grain interactions in diverse environments.</description>

      <title>Monitoring of tectonic deformation in the seismic gap of the Mentawai Islands using ALOS-1 and ALOS-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ever since the last occurrence of a significant earthquake in the Mentawai megathrust zone in 2000, no significant earthquake events have been recorded, which, according to the earthquake repetition cycle, suggests that the zone is a potential epicenter of future earthquakes. The southern and northern parts of the zone have been struck by a significant earthquake with magnitude M &gt; 8.0; however, in the potential location of the Mentawai Islands, earthquake energy has not been released. This research shows the tectonic activity, velocity, and shift that occurred owing to the thrust of the plate. The information is a vital reference for estimating the epicenter of the earthquake whose energy has not yet been released. We analyzed the tectonic characteristics according to the synthetic aperture radar data and geodetic global positioning system observations. The results show that the Pagai Islands are experiencing consistent tectonic deformations. The northern region of North Pagai and the Northern region of South Pagai are experiencing significant subsidence, while the southwest (SW) region of North Pagai and the south segment of South Pagai are experiencing significant uplift. The government and local authorities can use this information as a guide for developing strategies for disaster preparation.</description>

      <title>Simulation and modelling of convective mixing of carbon dioxide in geological formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform large-scale numerical simulations of convection in 3D porous media at Rayleigh-Darcy numbers up to $Ra=8\times10^4$. To investigate convective mixing of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) in geological formations, we consider a semi-infinite domain, where the CO$_2$ concentration is constant at top and no flux is prescribed at bottom. Convection begins with a diffusion-dominated phase, transitions to convection-driven solute finger formation, and ends with a shutdown stage as fingers reach the bottom boundary and the concentration in the system increases. For $Ra \ge 5\times10^3$, we observe a constant flux regime with dissolution flux stabilizing at 0.019, approximately 13\% higher than in 2D estimates. At high $Ra$, the top boundary exhibits hierarchical flow structures that drive the formation of large megaplumes in the interior, consistent with Rayleigh-Darcy convection. These findings extend solutal convection insights to 3D and high-$Ra$, improving the reliability of models predicting the long-term CO$_2$ dynamics in the subsurface.</description>
