      <title>VAInpaint: Zero-Shot Video-Audio inpainting framework with LLMs-driven Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video and audio inpainting for mixed audio-visual content has become a crucial task in multimedia editing recently. However, precisely removing an object and its corresponding audio from a video without affecting the rest of the scene remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose VAInpaint, a novel pipeline that first utilizes a segmentation model to generate masks and guide a video inpainting model in removing objects. At the same time, an LLM then analyzes the scene globally, while a region-specific model provides localized descriptions. Both the overall and regional descriptions will be inputted into an LLM, which will refine the content and turn it into text queries for our text-driven audio separation model. Our audio separation model is fine-tuned on a customized dataset comprising segmented MUSIC instrument images and VGGSound backgrounds to enhance its generalization performance. Experiments show that our method achieves performance comparable to current benchmarks in both audio and video inpainting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are the primary medium for human-computer interaction, yet automating GUI interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of visual elements, dynamic environments, and the need for multi-step reasoning. Existing methods based on vision-language models (VLMs) often suffer from limited resolution, domain mismatch, and insufficient sequential decisionmaking capability. To address these issues, we propose Mano, a robust GUI agent built upon a multi-modal foundation model pre-trained on extensive web and computer system data. Our approach integrates a novel simulated environment for high-fidelity data generation, a three-stage training pipeline (supervised fine-tuning, offline reinforcement learning, and online reinforcement learning), and a verification module for error recovery. Mano demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple GUI benchmarks, including Mind2Web and OSWorld, achieving significant improvements in success rate and operational accuracy. Our work provides new insights into the effective integration of reinforcement learning with VLMs for practical GUI agent deployment, highlighting the importance of domain-specific data, iterative training, and holistic reward design.</description>

      <title>Seeing Culture: A Benchmark for Visual Reasoning and Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) have made substantial progress in various tasks that require a combined understanding of visual and textual content, particularly in cultural understanding tasks, with the emergence of new cultural datasets. However, these datasets frequently fall short of providing cultural reasoning while underrepresenting many cultures. In this paper, we introduce the Seeing Culture Benchmark (SCB), focusing on cultural reasoning with a novel approach that requires VLMs to reason on culturally rich images in two stages: i) selecting the correct visual option with multiple-choice visual question answering (VQA), and ii) segmenting the relevant cultural artifact as evidence of reasoning. Visual options in the first stage are systematically organized into three types: those originating from the same country, those from different countries, or a mixed group. Notably, all options are derived from a singular category for each type. Progression to the second stage occurs only after a correct visual option is chosen. The SCB benchmark comprises 1,065 images that capture 138 cultural artifacts across five categories from seven Southeast Asia countries, whose diverse cultures are often overlooked, accompanied by 3,178 questions, of which 1,093 are unique and meticulously curated by human annotators. Our evaluation of various VLMs reveals the complexities involved in cross-modal cultural reasoning and highlights the disparity between visual reasoning and spatial grounding in culturally nuanced scenarios. The SCB serves as a crucial benchmark for identifying these shortcomings, thereby guiding future developments in the field of cultural reasoning. https://github.com/buraksatar/SeeingCulture</description>

      <title>On the de-duplication of the Lakh MIDI dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large-scale dataset is essential for training a well-generalized deep-learning model. Most such datasets are collected via scraping from various internet sources, inevitably introducing duplicated data. In the symbolic music domain, these duplicates often come from multiple user arrangements and metadata changes after simple editing. However, despite critical issues such as unreliable training evaluation from data leakage during random splitting, dataset duplication has not been extensively addressed in the MIR community. This study investigates the dataset duplication issues regarding Lakh MIDI Dataset (LMD), one of the largest publicly available sources in the symbolic music domain. To find and evaluate the best retrieval method for duplicated data, we employed the Clean MIDI subset of the LMD as a benchmark test set, in which different versions of the same songs are grouped together. We first evaluated rule-based approaches and previous symbolic music retrieval models for de-duplication and also investigated with a contrastive learning-based BERT model with various augmentations to find duplicate files. As a result, we propose three different versions of the filtered list of LMD, which filters out at least 38,134 samples in the most conservative settings among 178,561 files.</description>

      <title>Speech-to-See: End-to-End Speech-Driven Open-Set Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio grounding, or speech-driven open-set object detection, aims to localize and identify objects directly from speech, enabling generalization beyond predefined categories. This task is crucial for applications like human-robot interaction where textual input is impractical. However, progress in this domain faces a fundamental bottleneck from the scarcity of large-scale, paired audio-image data, and is further constrained by previous methods that rely on indirect, text-mediated pipelines. In this paper, we introduce Speech-to-See (Speech2See), an end-to-end approach built on a pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, in the pre-training stage, we design a Query-Guided Semantic Aggregation module that employs learnable queries to condense redundant speech embeddings into compact semantic representations. During fine-tuning, we incorporate a parameter-efficient Mixture-of-LoRA-Experts (MoLE) architecture to achieve deeper and more nuanced cross-modal adaptation. Extensive experiments show that Speech2See achieves robust and adaptable performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its strong generalization ability and broad applicability.</description>

      <title>PhysHDR: When Lighting Meets Materials and Scene Geometry in HDR Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low Dynamic Range (LDR) to High Dynamic Range (HDR) image translation is a fundamental task in many computational vision problems. Numerous data-driven methods have been proposed to address this problem; however, they lack explicit modeling of illumination, lighting, and scene geometry in images. This limits the quality of the reconstructed HDR images. Since lighting and shadows interact differently with different materials, (e.g., specular surfaces such as glass and metal, and lambertian or diffuse surfaces such as wood and stone), modeling material-specific properties (e.g., specular and diffuse reflectance) has the potential to improve the quality of HDR image reconstruction. This paper presents PhysHDR, a simple yet powerful latent diffusion-based generative model for HDR image reconstruction. The denoising process is conditioned on lighting and depth information and guided by a novel loss to incorporate material properties of surfaces in the scene. The experimental results establish the efficacy of PhysHDR in comparison to a number of recent state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Bi-modal Prediction and Transformation Coding for Compressing Complex Human Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For dynamic human motion sequences, the original KeyNode-Driven codec often struggles to retain compression efficiency when confronted with rapid movements or strong non-rigid deformations. This paper proposes a novel Bi-modal coding framework that enhances the flexibility of motion representation by integrating semantic segmentation and region-specific transformation modeling. The rigid transformation model (rotation &amp; translation) is extended with a hybrid scheme that selectively applies affine transformations-rotation, translation, scaling, and shearing-only to deformation-rich regions (e.g., the torso, where loose clothing induces high variability), while retaining rigid models elsewhere. The affine model is decomposed into minimal parameter sets for efficient coding and combined through a component selection strategy guided by a Lagrangian Rate-Distortion optimization. The results show that the Bi-modal method achieves more accurate mesh deformation, especially in sequences involving complex non-rigid motion, without compromising compression efficiency in simpler regions, with an average bit-rate saving of 33.81% compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>SemanticGarment: Semantic-Controlled Generation and Editing of 3D Gaussian Garments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D digital garment generation and editing play a pivotal role in fashion design, virtual try-on, and gaming. Traditional methods struggle to meet the growing demand due to technical complexity and high resource costs. Learning-based approaches offer faster, more diverse garment synthesis based on specific requirements and reduce human efforts and time costs. However, they still face challenges such as inconsistent multi-view geometry or textures and heavy reliance on detailed garment topology and manual rigging. We propose SemanticGarment, a 3D Gaussian-based method that realizes high-fidelity 3D garment generation from text or image prompts and supports semantic-based interactive editing for flexible user customization. To ensure multi-view consistency and garment fitting, we propose to leverage structural human priors for the generative model by introducing a 3D semantic clothing model, which initializes the geometry structure and lays the groundwork for view-consistent garment generation and editing. Without the need to regenerate or rely on existing mesh templates, our approach allows for rapid and diverse modifications to existing Gaussians, either globally or within a local region. To address the artifacts caused by self-occlusion for garment reconstruction based on single image, we develop a self-occlusion optimization strategy to mitigate holes and artifacts that arise when directly animating self-occluded garments. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate our superior performance in 3D garment generation and editing.</description>

      <title>Attentive AV-FusionNet: Audio-Visual Quality Prediction with Hybrid Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning-based audio-visual quality (AVQ) prediction model that leverages internal features from state-of-the-art unimodal predictors. Unlike prior approaches that rely on simple fusion strategies, our model employs a hybrid representation that combines learned Generative Machine Listener (GML) audio features with hand-crafted Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) video features. Attention mechanisms capture cross-modal interactions and intra-modal relationships, yielding context-aware quality representations. A modality relevance estimator quantifies each modality's contribution per content, potentially enabling adaptive bitrate allocation. Experiments demonstrate improved AVQ prediction accuracy and robustness across diverse content types.</description>

      <title>Optimized Learned Image Compression for Facial Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient data compression is crucial for the storage and transmission of visual data. However, in facial expression recognition (FER) tasks, lossy compression often leads to feature degradation and reduced accuracy. To address these challenges, this study proposes an end-to-end model designed to preserve critical features and enhance both compression and recognition performance. A custom loss function is introduced to optimize the model, tailored to balance compression and recognition performance effectively. This study also examines the influence of varying loss term weights on this balance. Experimental results indicate that fine-tuning the compression model alone improves classification accuracy by 0.71% and compression efficiency by 49.32%, while joint optimization achieves significant gains of 4.04% in accuracy and 89.12% in efficiency. Moreover, the findings demonstrate that the jointly optimized classification model maintains high accuracy on both compressed and uncompressed data, while the compression model reliably preserves image details, even at high compression rates.</description>

      <title>RealBench: A Chinese Multi-image Understanding Benchmark Close to Real-world Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While various multimodal multi-image evaluation datasets have been emerged, but these datasets are primarily based on English, and there has yet to be a Chinese multi-image dataset. To fill this gap, we introduce RealBench, the first Chinese multimodal multi-image dataset, which contains 9393 samples and 69910 images. RealBench distinguishes itself by incorporating real user-generated content, ensuring high relevance to real-world applications. Additionally, the dataset covers a wide variety of scenes, image resolutions, and image structures, further increasing the difficulty of multi-image understanding. Ultimately, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of RealBench using 21 multimodal LLMs of different sizes, including closed-source models that support multi-image inputs as well as open-source visual and video models. The experimental results indicate that even the most powerful closed-source models still face challenges when handling multi-image Chinese scenarios. Moreover, there remains a noticeable performance gap of around 71.8\% on average between open-source visual/video models and closed-source models. These results show that RealBench provides an important research foundation for further exploring multi-image understanding capabilities in the Chinese context.</description>

      <title>Does Audio Matter for Modern Video-LLMs and Their Benchmarks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern multimodal large language models often claim "video understanding," yet most evaluations use muted videos or simply discard audio. We ask a direct question: how much does audio actually matter for contemporary Video-LLMs and the benchmarks that certify them? We audit widely used suites and observe that many items are even solvable from a single frame, rendering audio largely redundant. Building on LLaVA-OneVision architecture, we attach a speech/audio encoder (e.g., Whisper) and analyze when audio helps, while addressing audio token explosion with a lightweight Mamba-based state-space token compressor. We find that audio yields minimal gains on recent video benchmarks but is decisive on curated, audio-sensitive subsets. To enable faithful evaluation, we release AVQA-Hard and Music-AVQA-Hard, our model, and code. Our findings surface a growing gap between current academic practice and real-world expectations, and provide practical tools for scalable audio-visual Video-LLMs. We will fully open-source our work at https://github.com/naver-ai/LLaVA-AV-SSM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.13542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affective computing has garnered the attention and interest of researchers in recent years, as there is a need for AI systems to better understand and react to human emotions. However, analyzing human emotions, such as mood or stress, is quite complex. While various stress studies use facial expressions and wearables, most existing datasets rely on processing data from a single modality. This paper presents EmpathicSchool, a novel dataset that captures facial expressions and the associated physiological signals, such as heart rate, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature, under different stress levels. The data was collected from 30 participants during different sessions for about ninety minutes each (for a total of 40 hours). The data includes seven different signal types, including both computer vision and physiological features that can be used to detect stress. In addition, various experiments were conducted to validate the signal quality.</description>

      <title>Both Text and Images Leaked! A Systematic Analysis of Data Contamination in Multimodal LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced performance across benchmarks. However, data contamination-unintentional memorization of benchmark data during model training-poses critical challenges for fair evaluation. Existing detection methods for unimodal large language models (LLMs) are inadequate for MLLMs due to multimodal data complexity and multi-phase training. We systematically analyze multimodal data contamination using our analytical framework, MM-Detect, which defines two contamination categories-unimodal and cross-modal-and effectively quantifies contamination severity across multiple-choice and caption-based Visual Question Answering tasks. Evaluations on twelve MLLMs and five benchmarks reveal significant contamination, particularly in proprietary models and older benchmarks. Crucially, contamination sometimes originates during unimodal pre-training rather than solely from multimodal fine-tuning. Our insights refine contamination understanding, guiding evaluation practices and improving multimodal model reliability.</description>

      <title>PerceiverS: A Multi-Scale Perceiver with Effective Segmentation for Long-Term Expressive Symbolic Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08307v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-based music generation has made significant progress in recent years. However, generating symbolic music that is both long-structured and expressive remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose PerceiverS (Segmentation and Scale), a novel architecture designed to address this issue by leveraging both Effective Segmentation and Multi-Scale attention mechanisms. Our approach enhances symbolic music generation by simultaneously learning long-term structural dependencies and short-term expressive details. By combining cross-attention and self-attention in a Multi-Scale setting, PerceiverS captures long-range musical structure while preserving performance nuances. The proposed model has been evaluated using the Maestro dataset and has demonstrated improvements in generating coherent and diverse music, characterized by both structural consistency and expressive variation. The project demos and the generated music samples can be accessed through the link: https://perceivers.github.io.</description>

      <title>Audio-Reasoner: Improving Reasoning Capability in Large Audio Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reasoning have largely overlooked the audio modality. We introduce Audio-Reasoner, a large-scale audio language model for deep reasoning in audio tasks. We meticulously curated a large-scale and diverse multi-task audio dataset with simple annotations. Then, we leverage closed-source models to conduct secondary labeling, QA generation, along with structured COT process. These datasets together form a high-quality reasoning dataset with 1.2 million reasoning-rich samples, which we name CoTA. Following inference scaling principles, we train Audio-Reasoner on CoTA, enabling it to achieve great logical capabilities in audio reasoning. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance across key benchmarks, including MMAU-mini (+25.42%), AIR-Bench chat/foundation(+14.57%/+10.13%), and MELD (+8.01%). Our findings stress the core of structured CoT training in advancing audio reasoning.</description>

      <title>SD-VSum: A Method and Dataset for Script-Driven Video Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the task of script-driven video summarization, which aims to produce a summary of the full-length video by selecting the parts that are most relevant to a user-provided script outlining the visual content of the desired summary. Following, we extend a recently-introduced large-scale dataset for generic video summarization (VideoXum) by producing natural language descriptions of the different human-annotated summaries that are available per video. In this way we make it compatible with the introduced task, since the available triplets of ``video, summary and summary description'' can be used for training a method that is able to produce different summaries for a given video, driven by the provided script about the content of each summary. Finally, we develop a new network architecture for script-driven video summarization (SD-VSum), that employs a cross-modal attention mechanism for aligning and fusing information from the visual and text modalities. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the advanced performance of SD-VSum against SOTA approaches for query-driven and generic (unimodal and multimodal) summarization from the literature, and document its capacity to produce video summaries that are adapted to each user's needs about their content.</description>

      <title>Diversity-Guided MLP Reduction for Efficient Large Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer models achieve excellent scaling property, where the performance is improved with the increment of model capacity. However, large-scale model parameters lead to an unaffordable cost of computing and memory. We analyze popular transformer architectures and find that multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules take up the majority of model parameters. To this end, we focus on the recoverability of the compressed models and propose a Diversity-Guided MLP Reduction (DGMR) method to significantly reduce the parameters of large vision transformers with only negligible performance degradation. Specifically, we conduct a Gram-Schmidt weight pruning strategy to eliminate redundant neurons of MLP hidden layer, while preserving weight diversity for better performance recover during distillation. Compared to the model trained from scratch, our pruned model only requires 0.06\% data of LAION-2B (for the training of large vision transformers) without labels (ImageNet-1K) to recover the original performance. Experimental results on several state-of-the-art large vision transformers demonstrate that our method achieves a more than 57.0\% parameter and FLOPs reduction in a near lossless manner. Notably, for EVA-CLIP-E (4.4B), our method accomplishes a 71.5\% parameter and FLOPs reduction without performance degradation. The source code and trained weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/DGMR.</description>

      <title>SoundMind: RL-Incentivized Logic Reasoning for Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities, their extension to the audio modality, particularly within large audio-language models (LALMs), remains underexplored. Addressing this gap requires a systematic approach that involves a capable base model, high-quality reasoning-oriented audio data, and effective training algorithms. In this work, we present a comprehensive solution for audio logical reasoning (ALR) tasks: we introduce SoundMind, a dataset of 6,446 audio-text annotated samples specifically curated to support complex reasoning. Building on this resource, we propose SoundMind-RL, a rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to equip audio-language models with robust audio-text reasoning capabilities. By fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on the proposed SoundMind dataset using SoundMind-RL, we achieve strong and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on the SoundMind benchmark. This work highlights the benefit of combining high-quality, reasoning-focused datasets with specialized RL techniques, and contributes to advancing auditory intelligence in language models. The code and dataset introduced in this work are publicly available at https://github.com/xid32/SoundMind.</description>

      <title>Automating Steering for Safe Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns, particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical, interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Primitive Embodied World Models: Towards Scalable Robotic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4) decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.</description>
