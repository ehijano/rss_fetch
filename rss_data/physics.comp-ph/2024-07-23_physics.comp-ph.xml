      <title>Benchmark: Tao's symplectic integration method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A benchmark test was conducted for a new symplectic integration method developed by Molei Tao. The method raises interest due to its explicit evolution equation, with applicability to both separable and non-separable Hamiltonian systems, and an easy-to-implement, easily generalizable algorithm. In order to compare the method with other, more well-known methods, namely St\"{o}rmer-Verlet and Runge-Kutta, we conducted a series of benchmark tests comparing their performance in terms of CPU time, system invariants functions conservation, and numerical symplectic area conservation. Overall, it was found that despite being slower than the more optimized Runge-Kutta-Cash-Karp, Tao's method presents a similar performance to St\"{o}rmer-Verlet, with the extra perk of being more generic and not requiring the use of implicit equations for the evolution of the equations of motion.</description>

      <title>COLOSS: Complex-scaled Optical and couLOmb Scattering Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce COLOSS, a program designed to address the scattering problem using a bound-state technique known as complex scaling. In this method, the oscillatory boundary conditions of the wave function are transformed into exponentially decaying ones, accommodating the long-range Coulomb interaction. The program implements the Woods-Saxon form of a realistic optical potential, with all potential parameters included in a well-designed input format for ease of use. This design offers users straightforward access to compute \(S\)-matrices and cross-sections of the scattering process. We provide thorough discussions on the precision of Lagrange functions and their benefits in evaluating matrix elements. Additionally, COLOSS incorporates two distinct rotation methods, making it adaptable to potentials without analytical expressions. Comparative results demonstrate that COLOSS achieves high accuracy when compared with the direct integration method, Numerov, underscoring its utility and effectiveness in scattering calculations.</description>

      <title>A reinforcement learning strategy to automate and accelerate h/p-multigrid solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a reinforcement learning strategy to automate and accelerate h/p-multigrid methods in high-order solvers. Multigrid methods are very efficient but require fine-tuning of numerical parameters, such as the number of smoothing sweeps per level and the correction fraction (i.e., proportion of the corrected solution that is transferred from a coarser grid to a finer grid). The objective of this paper is to use a proximal policy optimization algorithm to automatically tune the multigrid parameters and, by doing so, improve stability and efficiency of the h/p-multigrid strategy.
  Our findings reveal that the proposed reinforcement learning h/p-multigrid approach significantly accelerates and improves the robustness of steady-state simulations for one dimensional advection-diffusion and nonlinear Burgers' equations, when discretized using high-order h/p methods, on uniform and nonuniform grids.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking of quantum fidelity kernels for Gaussian process regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing algorithms have been shown to produce performant quantum kernels for machine-learning classification problems. Here, we examine the performance of quantum kernels for regression problems of practical interest. For an unbiased benchmarking of quantum kernels, it is necessary to construct the most optimal functional form of the classical kernels and the most optimal quantum kernels for each given data set. We develop an algorithm that uses an analog of the Bayesian information criterion to optimize the sequence of quantum gates used to estimate quantum kernels for Gaussian process models. The algorithm increases the complexity of the quantum circuits incrementally, while improving the performance of the resulting kernels, and is shown to yield much higher model accuracy with fewer quantum gates than a fixed quantum circuit ansatz. We demonstrate that quantum kernels thus obtained can be used to build accurate models of global potential energy surfaces (PES) for polyatomic molecules. The average interpolation error of the six-dimensional PES obtained with a random distribution of 2000 energy points is 16 cm$^{-1}$ for H$_3$O$^+$, 15 cm$^{-1}$ for H$_2$CO and 88 cm$^{-1}$ for HNO$_2$. We show that a compositional optimization of classical kernels for Gaussian process regression converges to the same errors. This indicates that quantum kernels can achieve the same, though not better, expressivity as classical kernels for regression problems.</description>

      <title>WaterLily.jl: A differentiable and backend-agnostic Julia solver to simulate incompressible viscous flow and dynamic bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software into optimization and machine-learning frameworks is hampered by the rigidity of classic computational languages and the slow performance of more flexible high-level languages. In this work, we introduce WaterLily.jl: an open-source incompressible viscous flow solver written in the Julia language. An immersed boundary method is used to enforce the effect of solid boundaries on flow past complex geometries with arbitrary motions. The small code base is multidimensional, multiplatform and backend-agnostic (serial and multithreaded CPU, and GPU execution). Additionally, the dynamically typed language allows the solver to be fully differentiable using automatic differentiation. The computational time per time step scales linearly with the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) on CPUs, and we measure up to a 200x speed-up using CUDA kernels resulting in a cost of 1.44 nanoseconds per DOF and time step. This leads to comparable performance with low-level CFD solvers written in C and Fortran on research-scale problems, opening up exciting possible future applications on the cutting edge of machine-learning research.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity in magic-strain graphene superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive investigations on the Moir\'e magic-angle have been conducted in twisted bilayer graphene, unlocking the mystery of unconventional superconductivity and insulating states. In analog to magic angle, here we demonstrate the new concept of magic-strain in graphene systems by judiciously tailoring mechanical relaxation (stretch and compression) which is easier to implement in practice. We elucidate the interplay of strain-induced effects and delve into the resulting unconventional superconductivity or semimetal-insulator transition in relaxation-strained graphene, going beyond the traditional twisting approach. Our findings reveal how relaxation strain can trigger superconducting transitions (with an ultra-flat band at the Fermi level) or the semimetal-insulator transition (with a gap opening at the $K$ point of $0.39\rm{~eV}$) in both monolayer and bilayer graphene. These discoveries open up a new branch for correlated phenomena and provide deeper insights into the underlying physics of superconductors, which positions graphene as a highly tunable platform for novel electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Crystals with Transformers on Graphs, for Prediction of Unconventional Crystal Material Properties and the Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ionic bonding across the lattice and ordered microscopic structures endow crystals with unique symmetry and determine their macroscopic properties. Unconventional crystals, in particular, exhibit non-traditional lattice structures or possess exotic physical properties, making them intriguing subjects for investigation. Therefore, to accurately predict the physical and chemical properties of crystals, it is crucial to consider long-range orders. While GNN excels at capturing the local environment of atoms in crystals, they often face challenges in effectively capturing longer-ranged interactions due to their limited depth. In this paper, we propose CrysToGraph ($\textbf{Crys}$tals with $\textbf{T}$ransformers $\textbf{o}$n $\textbf{Graph}$s), a novel transformer-based geometric graph network designed specifically for unconventional crystalline systems, and UnconvBench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate models' predictive performance on unconventional crystal materials such as defected crystals, low-dimension crystals and MOF. CrysToGraph effectively captures short-range interactions with transformer-based graph convolution blocks as well as long-range interactions with graph-wise transformer blocks. CrysToGraph proofs its effectiveness in modelling unconventional crystal materials in multiple tasks, and moreover, it outperforms most existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the benchmarks of both unconventional crystals and traditional crystals.</description>

Abstract: This review is devoted to the different techniques that have been developed to compute the coherent transport properties of quantum nanoelectronic systems connected to electrodes. Beside a review of the different algorithms proposed in the literature, we provide a comprehensive and pedagogical derivation of the two formalisms on which these techniques are based: the scattering approach and the Green's function approach. We show that the scattering problem can be formulated as a system of linear equations and that different existing algorithms for solving this scattering problem amount to different sequences of Gaussian elimination. We explicitly prove the equivalence of the two formalisms. We discuss the stability and numerical complexity of the existing methods.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Unsaturated Slope Stability under Seismic and Surcharge Loading by Upper Bound Rigid Block Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Failure of earthen slopes is a very recurrent phenomenon, credited mainly due to the excess rainfall and application of surfeit surcharge. However, most of the analyses regarding slope stability were performed without considering the unsaturated state of the soil. The prime purpose of the present manuscript is to address the stability of unsaturated homogeneous slopes subjected to surcharge load and pseudo-static seismic forces under different climatic conditions. The upper bound limit analysis technique was used based on the log-spiral failure mechanism. The suction stress-based effective stress approach was used to capture the effect of the unsaturated zone of the slope. The suction stress is modelled using Gardner's one-parameter hydraulic conductivity function and van-Genuchten's soil water characteristics curve. An extensive parametric study is carried out to assess the combined effect of slope geometry, soil-strength parameters, hydro-mechanical parameters, depth of water table, various flow conditions, surcharge load, and seismic loading. A few stability charts are proposed to show the impact of surcharge load and seismic load separately on unsaturated homogeneous slopes subjected to various climatic conditions. The present computed solutions match quite well with the available solutions prescribed in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe our contribution as industrial stakeholders to the existing open-source GPU4PySCF project (https: //github.com/pyscf/gpu4pyscf), a GPU-accelerated Python quantum chemistry package. We have integrated GPU acceleration into other PySCF functionality including Density Functional Theory (DFT), geometry optimization, frequency analysis, solvent models, and density fitting technique. Through these contributions, GPU4PySCF v1.0 can now be regarded as a fully functional and industrially relevant platform which we demonstrate in this work through a range of tests. When performing DFT calculations on modern GPU platforms, GPU4PySCF delivers 30 times speedup over a 32-core CPU node, resulting in approximately 90% cost savings for most DFT tasks. The performance advantages and productivity improvements have been found in multiple industrial applications, such as generating potential energy surfaces, analyzing molecular properties, calculating solvation free energy, identifying chemical reactions in lithium-ion batteries, and accelerating neural-network methods. With the improved design that makes it easy to integrate with the Python and PySCF ecosystem, GPU4PySCF is natural choice that we can now recommend for many industrial quantum chemistry applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum estimation bound of Gaussian matrix permanent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.01328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exact calculation and even multiplicative error estimation of matrix permanent are challenging for both classical and quantum computers. Regarding the permanents of random Gaussian matrices, the additive error estimation is closely linked to boson sampling, and achieving multiplicative error estimation requires exponentially many samplings. Our newly developed formula for matrix permanents and its corresponding quantum expression have enabled better estimation of the average additive error for random Gaussian matrices compared to Gurvits' classical sampling algorithm. The well-known Ryser formula has been converted into a quantum permanent estimator. When dealing with real random Gaussian square matrices of size $N$, the quantum estimator can approximate the matrix permanent with an additive error smaller than $\epsilon(\sqrt{\mathrm{e}N})^{N}$, where $\epsilon$ is the estimation precision. In contrast, Gurvits' classical sampling algorithm has an estimation error of $\epsilon(2\sqrt{N})^{N}$, which is exponentially larger ($1.2^{N}$) than the quantum method. As expected, the quantum additive error bound fails to reach the multiplicative error bound of $(2\pi N)^{1/4}\epsilon(\sqrt{N/\mathrm{e}})^{N}$. Additionally, the quantum permanent estimator can be up to quadratically faster than the classical estimator when using quantum phase estimation-based amplitude estimation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic parameter optimization analysis of dynamical quantum critical phenomena in long-range transverse-field Ising chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum phase transition of the one-dimensional long-range transverse-field Ising model is explored by combining the quantum Monte Carlo method and stochastic parameter optimization, specifically achieved by tuning correlation ratios so that space and imaginary time are isotropic. In our simulations, the simulator automatically determines the parameters to sample from, even without prior knowledge of the critical point and universality class. The leading order finite-size corrections are eliminated by comparing two systems with different sizes; this procedure is also performed automatically. Varying the decay exponent of the long-range interaction, $\sigma$, we investigate $\sigma$-dependence of the dynamical exponent and the other critical exponents precisely in the mean-field, non-universal, and two-dimensional classical Ising universality regimes. We successfully determine the universality boundary between the latter two as $\sigma = 7/4$ based on the dynamical exponent and settle a long-standing dispute on the location of the universality boundary.</description>

      <title>Sampling Error Analysis in Quantum Krylov Subspace Diagonalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization (QKSD) is an emerging method used in place of quantum phase estimation in the early fault-tolerant era, where limited quantum circuit depth is available. In contrast to the classical Krylov subspace diagonalization (KSD) or the Lanczos method, QKSD exploits the quantum computer to efficiently estimate the eigenvalues of large-size Hamiltonians through a faster Krylov projection. However, unlike classical KSD, which is solely concerned with machine precision, QKSD is inherently accompanied by errors originating from a finite number of samples. Moreover, due to difficulty establishing an artificial orthogonal basis, ill-conditioning problems are often encountered, rendering the solution vulnerable to noise. In this work, we present a nonasymptotic theoretical framework to assess the relationship between sampling noise and its effects on eigenvalues. We also propose an optimal solution to cope with large condition numbers by eliminating the ill-conditioned bases. Numerical simulations of the one-dimensional Hubbard model demonstrate that the error bound of finite samplings accurately predicts the experimental errors in well-conditioned regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new magnetic phase, has been theoretically proposed and experimentally verified to be distinct from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Although altermagnets have been found to possess many exotic physical properties, the limited availability of known altermagnetic materials hinders the study of such properties. Hence, discovering more types of altermagnetic materials with different properties is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of altermagnetism and thus facilitating new applications in the next generation information technologies, e.g., storage devices and high-sensitivity sensors. Since each altermagnetic material has a unique crystal structure, we propose an automated discovery approach empowered by an AI search engine that employs a pre-trained graph neural network to learn the intrinsic features of the material crystal structure, followed by fine-tuning a classifier with limited positive samples to predict the altermagnetism probability of a given material candidate. Finally, we successfully discovered 50 new altermagnetic materials that cover metals, semiconductors, and insulators confirmed by the first-principles electronic structure calculations. The wide range of electronic structural characteristics reveals that various novel physical properties manifest in these newly discovered altermagnetic materials, e.g., anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Kerr effect, and topological property. Noteworthy, we discovered 4 $i$-wave altermagnetic materials for the first time. Overall, the AI search engine performs much better than human experts and suggests a set of new altermagnetic materials with unique properties, outlining its potential for accelerated discovery of the materials with targeted properties.</description>

      <title>MPSDynamics.jl: Tensor network simulations for finite-temperature (non-Markovian) open quantum system dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The MPSDynamics.jl package provides an easy to use interface for performing open quantum systems simulations at zero and finite temperatures. The package has been developed with the aim of studying non-Markovian open system dynamics using the state-of-the-art numerically exact Thermalized-Time Evolving Density operator with Orthonormal Polynomials Algorithm (T-TEDOPA) based on environment chain mapping. The simulations rely on a tensor network representation of the quantum states as matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network (TTN) states. Written in the Julia programming language, MPSDynamics.jl is a versatile open-source package providing a choice of several variants of the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) method for time evolution (including novel bond-adaptive one-site algorithms). The package also provides strong support for the measurement of single and multi-site observables, as well as the storing and logging of data, which makes it a useful tool for the study of many-body physics. It currently handles long-range interactions, time-dependent Hamiltonians, multiple environments, bosonic and fermionic environments, and joint system-environment observables.</description>

Abstract: We propose the Artificial Intelligence Velocimetry-Thermometry (AIVT) method to infer hidden temperature fields from experimental turbulent velocity data. This physics-informed machine learning method enables us to infer continuous temperature fields using only sparse velocity data, hence eliminating the need for direct temperature measurements. Specifically, AIVT is based on physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (not neural networks) and is trained by optimizing a combined loss function that minimizes the residuals of the velocity data, boundary conditions, and the governing equations. We apply AIVT to a unique set of experimental volumetric and simultaneous temperature and velocity data of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) that we acquired by combining Particle Image Thermometry and Lagrangian Particle Tracking. This allows us to compare AIVT predictions and measurements directly. We demonstrate that we can reconstruct and infer continuous and instantaneous velocity and temperature fields from sparse experimental data at a fidelity comparable to direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulence. This, in turn, enables us to compute important quantities for quantifying turbulence, such as fluctuations, viscous and thermal dissipation, and QR distribution. This paradigm shift in processing experimental data using AIVT to infer turbulent fields at DNS-level fidelity is a promising avenue in breaking the current deadlock of quantitative understanding of turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, where DNS is computationally infeasible.</description>
