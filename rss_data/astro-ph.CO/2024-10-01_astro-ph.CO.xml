      <title>Massive neutrinos and cosmic composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological data probe massive neutrinos via their effects on the geometry of the Universe and the growth of structure, both of which are degenerate with the late-time expansion history. We clarify the nature of these degeneracies and the individual roles of both probes in neutrino mass inference. Geometry is strongly sensitive to neutrino masses: within $\Lambda$CDM, the primary cosmic microwave background anisotropies alone impose that the matter fraction $\Omega_m$ must increase fivefold with increasing neutrino mass. Moreover, large-scale structure observables, like weak lensing of the CMB, are dimensionless and thus depend not on the matter density (as often quoted) but in fact the matter fraction. We explore the consequential impact of this distinction on the interplay between probes of structure, low-redshift distances, and CMB anisotropies. We derive constraints on the neutrino's masses independently from their suppression of structure and impact on geometry, showing that the latter is at least as important as the former. While the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's recent baryon acoustic oscillation data place stringent bounds largely deriving from their geometric incompatibility with massive neutrinos, all recent type Ia supernova datasets drive marginal preferences for nonzero neutrino masses because they prefer substantially larger matter fractions. Recent CMB lensing data, however, neither exclude neutrinos' suppression of structure nor constrain it strongly enough to discriminate between mass hierarchies. Current data thus evince not a need for modified dynamics of neutrino perturbations or structure growth but rather an inconsistent compatibility with massive neutrinos' impact on the expansion history. We identify two of DESI's measurements that strongly influence its constraints, and we also discuss neutrino mass measurements in models that alter the sound horizon.</description>

      <title>Improving Precision in Kinematic Weak Lensing with MIRoRS: Model-Independent Restoration of Reflection Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel, model-independent technique for fitting the cross-component of weak lensing shear, $\gamma_\times$, along a line of sight by combining kinematic and photometric measurements of a single lensed galaxy. Rather than relying on parametric models, we fit for the shear parameter that best transforms the velocity field to restore its underlying symmetries, while also incorporating photometric data for the change in position angle due to shear. We first validate our technique with idealized mock data, exploring the method's response to variations in shear, position angle, inclination, and noise. On this idealized mock data, our combined kinematic and photometric model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional parametric or kinematic-only approaches. Subsequently, we apply our method to a dataset of 358 halos from the Illustris TNG simulations, achieving a notable reduction in the uncertainty of $\gamma_\times$ to 0.039, marking a substantial improvement over previous analysis of the dataset with a parametric model. Finally, we introduce an outlier rejection method based on Moran's I-test for spatial autocorrelation. Identifying and filtering out halos with spatially correlated residuals reduces the overall uncertainty to 0.028. Our results underscore the efficacy of combining kinematic and photometric data for weak lensing studies, providing a more precise and targeted measurement of shear along an individual line of sight.</description>

      <title>Inner structure of cold and warm dark matter halos from particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the number of apocenter passages $p$ and the radial action $J_r$ of each particle, we characterize the phase-space structure within the multi-stream regions of cold and warm dark matter halos in cosmological $N$-body simulations. Building on previous work by Enomoto et al. (2024), we analyze the radial density profiles of particles classified by $p$ and $J_r$. We find that the profiles consistently follow a double power-law structure, independent of the dark matter model or halo mass. The inner profile exhibits a $\rho \propto r^{-1}$ behavior, which is consistent with previous studies. Notably, this characteristics persist across both classification schemes. In contrast, the outer power-law profiles display distinct behaviors depending on the classification. While particles classified by $p$ exhibit a steeper slope, ranging from $-6$ to $-8$, those classified by $J_r$ follow a common slope of approximately $-3.5$. Overall, the amplitude of the double power-law profiles varies between simulations for different dark matter models, but this variation can be attributed to statistical differences in the concentration of halos across the models.</description>

      <title>GalaxiesML: a dataset of galaxy images, photometry, redshifts, and structural parameters for machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dataset built for machine learning applications consisting of galaxy photometry, images, spectroscopic redshifts, and structural properties. This dataset comprises 286,401 galaxy images and photometry from the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Survey PDR2 in five imaging filters ($g,r,i,z,y$) with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts as ground truth. Such a dataset is important for machine learning applications because it is uniform, consistent, and has minimal outliers but still contains a realistic range of signal-to-noise ratios. We make this dataset public to help spur development of machine learning methods for the next generation of surveys such as Euclid and LSST. The aim of GalaxiesML is to provide a robust dataset that can be used not only for astrophysics but also for machine learning, where image properties cannot be validated by the human eye and are instead governed by physical laws. We describe the challenges associated with putting together a dataset from publicly available archives, including outlier rejection, duplication, establishing ground truths, and sample selection. This is one of the largest public machine learning-ready training sets of its kind with redshifts ranging from 0.01 to 4. The redshift distribution of this sample peaks at redshift of 1.5 and falls off rapidly beyond redshift 2.5. We also include an example application of this dataset for redshift estimation, demonstrating that using images for redshift estimation produces more accurate results compared to using photometry alone. For example, the bias in redshift estimate is a factor of 10 lower when using images between redshift of 0.1 to 1.25 compared to photometry alone. Results from dataset such as this will help inform us on how to best make use of data from the next generation of galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Gaussian Process Approach to Shear Mapping with MuyGPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of cosmic shear is an integral part of understanding structure growth across cosmic time, which in-turn provides us with information about the nature of dark energy. Conventional methods generate \emph{shear maps} from which we can infer the matter distribution in the universe. Current methods (e.g., Kaiser-Squires inversion) for generating these maps, however, are tricky to implement and can introduce bias. Recent alternatives construct a spatial process prior for the lensing potential, which allows for inference of the convergence and shear parameters given lensing shear measurements. Realizing these spatial processes, however, scales cubically in the number of observations - an unacceptable expense as near-term surveys expect billions of correlated measurements. Therefore, we present a linearly-scaling shear map construction alternative using a scalable Gaussian Process (GP) prior called MuyGPs. MuyGPs avoids cubic scaling by conditioning interpolation on only nearest-neighbors and fits hyperparameters using batched leave-one-out cross validation. We use a suite of ray-tracing results from N-body simulations to demonstrate that our method can accurately interpolate shear maps, as well as recover the two-point and higher order correlations. We also show that we can perform these operations at the scale of billions of galaxies on high performance computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Fractional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar field cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our paper introduces a new theory called Fractional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar field cosmology, which has significant implications for Cosmology. We derived a modified Friedmann equation and a modified Klein-Gordon equation using fractional calculus to modify the gravitational action integral. Our research reveals non-trivial solutions associated with exponential potential, exponential couplings to the Gauss-Bonnet term, and logarithmic scalar field, which are dependent on two cosmological parameters, $m$ and $\alpha_{0}=t_{0}H_{0}$ and the fractional derivative order $\mu$. By employing linear stability theory, we reveal the phase space structure and analyze the dynamic effects of the Gauss-Bonnet couplings. The scaling behavior at some equilibrium points reveals that the geometric corrections in the coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet scalar can mimic the behavior of the dark sector in modified gravity. Using data from cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae, supermassive black hole shadows, and strong gravitational lensing, we estimated the values of $m$ and $\alpha_{0}$, indicating that the solution is consistent with an accelerated expansion at late times with the values $\alpha_0=1.38\pm 0.05$, $m=1.44\pm 0.05$, and $\mu=1.491$ (consistent with $\Omega_{m,0}=0.311\pm 0.016$ and $h=0.712\pm 0.007$), resulting in an age of the Universe $t_{0}=19.0\pm 0.7$ [Gyr] at 1$\sigma$ CL. Ultimately, we obtained late-time accelerating power-law solutions supported by the most recent cosmological data, and we proposed an alternative explanation for the origin of cosmic acceleration other than $\Lambda$CDM. Our results generalize and significantly improve previous achievements in the literature, highlighting the practical implications of fractional calculus in Cosmology.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints using Minkowski functionals from the first year data of the Hyper Suprime-Cam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Minkowski functionals to analyse weak lensing convergence maps from the first-year data release of the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC-Y1) survey. Minkowski functionals provide a description of the morphological properties of a field, capturing the non-Gaussian features of the Universe matter-density distribution. Using simulated catalogs that reproduce survey conditions and encode cosmological information, we emulate Minkowski functionals predictions across a range of cosmological parameters to derive the best-fit from the data. By applying multiple scales cuts, we rigorously mitigate systematic effects, including baryonic feedback and intrinsic alignments. From the analysis, combining constraints of the angular power spectrum and Minkowski functionals, we obtain $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{{\rm m}}/0.3} = {0.808}_{-0.046}^{+0.033}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = {0.293}_{-0.043}^{+0.157}$. These results represent a $40\%$ improvement on the $S_8$ constraints compared to using power spectrum only, and are consistent with previous non-Gaussian statistics analyses of the same dataset. Our study demonstrates the power of Minkowski functionals beyond two-point statistics for constraining and breaking the degeneracy between $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Ly$\alpha$ Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ly$\alpha$ emission has emerged as a powerful tool for probing diffuse gas within the large-scale structure of the universe. In this paper, we investigate cosmic Ly$\alpha$ emission by post-processing cosmological simulations from \texttt{IllustrisTNG} and \texttt{THESAN} project. Specifically, we calculate the Ly$\alpha$ emission from galaxies, circum-galactic medium (CGM) and inter-galactic medium (IGM) across various redshifts. Our results show that IGM alone is significantly under the current observational upper limits. Meanwhile, CGM overshoots the observed galaxy contribution at $z \lesssim 0.5$ indicating that either the escape fraction for the inner CGM is less than unity or the current photoionization equilibrium treatment with an approximate self-shielding prescription is less accurate. The galaxy component also overshoots at low redshift, indicating that the escape fraction has strong evolution caused by an evolving halo mass function and dust growth distribution, that agrees with observationally inferred escape fractions. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the Ly$\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas (CGM+IGM) peaked at $z \sim 4$ and diminishes toward lower redshift. The Ly$\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas mainly originates through the collisional excitation of hot plasma. By comparing models with observation, our predicted Ly$\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas remains $\sim 6$ times fainter than the observed cosmic Ly$\alpha$ emission at $z=1-3$. However, future large telescopes may hold great promise to detect Ly$\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas toward $z&gt;3$.</description>

      <title>General constraints on Tsallis holographic dark energy from observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated Tsallis holographic dark energy (THDE) model in light of modern observations of supernovae, Hubble parameter measurements, data for baryon acoustic oscillations and fluctuations of matter density. The dark energy density for THDE model is written as $\rho_d = 3C^2 / L^{4-2\gamma}$ where $C$ and $\gamma$ are some constants. Scale $L$ is infrared cut-off lenght for which we use the event horizon. For analysis of type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) data Pantheon+ samples are involved. Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 measurements serves as source of data about ratios between sound horizon $r_d$ and Hubble ($d_H$) or volume averaged ($d_V$) distances. The updated dataset of Hubble parameter for various redshift is also used in our analysis. Finally we considered the dependence of matter density fluctuations in past from redshift. The standard stratefy of $\chi^2$ minimizing allows to estimate the optimal values of parameters ($\Omega_{de}$ and $H_0$) for some fixed values of $C$ and $\gamma$. One note that best-fit values for parameters $H_0$ from Hubble parameter and SNeIa data are more close than in standard $\Lambda$CDM model for some $C$ and $\gamma$ although problem of Hubble tension remains unsolved. The combined data analysis also gives slightly better results in comparison with standard cosmology. We included in our consideration the possible interaction between matter and holographic component and estimated the acceptable interval of model parameters in this case.</description>

      <title>Viability of loop quantum cosmology at the level of bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations by Planck indicate that CMB anisotropies are consistent with predictions of nearly Gaussian primordial perturbations as the one generated in slow-roll inflation. On the other hand, loop quantum cosmology (LQC) generates a non-Gaussian bispectrum. In particular, calculations of primordial bispectrum generated in LQC shows that the non-Gaussianity function $f_{_{\rm NL}}(k_1,\, k_2,\, k_3)$ is highly scale-dependent and oscillatory at long wavelengths and is nearly scale-invariant as in slow-roll at small scales. We discuss the viability of such a non-Gaussian bispectrum in the light of observations by Planck. More specifically, we model the bispectrum generated in LQC and compute its imprints on the CMB bispectrum. We then show that the CMB bispectrum generated in LQC though non-Gaussian, due to its highly oscillatory nature, is similar to that generated in slow-roll inflation and hence consistent with the observations by Planck.</description>

      <title>Searching for new physics using high precision absorption spectroscopy; continuum placement uncertainties and $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ towards the quasar PHL957</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting or placing upper limits on spacetime variations of fundamental constants requires quantifying every potential source of uncertainty. We continue our previous study into the impact of continuum variations on measurements of the fine structure constant, here in the context of quasar absorption systems. An automated (hence objective and reproducible) continuum modelling method is reported in an accompanying paper. We apply the method to the $z_{abs}=1.7975$ absorption system towards the quasar PHL957. Multiple continuum fits are generated, and for each, we derive independent models of the system, each giving its own measurement of the fine structure constant $\alpha$. This process isolates and quantifies the error contribution associated with continuum placement uncertainty. This source of uncertainty, ignored in many previous measurements, arises in two ways: (i) slight local continuum tilt uncertainty generates small line shifts, and (ii) different continuum estimates produce slightly different kinematic structures in the absorption system model. Taking continuum placement uncertainty into account, the new PHL957 measurement we obtain is $\Delta\alpha/\alpha= -0.53^{+5.45}_{-5.51} \times 10^{-6}$. This measurement assumes terrestrial magnesium isotopic abundances. Recommendations are provided for future $\alpha$ measurements. Finally, we also note the potential importance of the effects identified here for future redshift drift experiments.</description>

      <title>Inverse Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing: Magnification, Intrinsic Alignments and Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current and upcoming imaging galaxy surveys are pushing galaxy samples to higher and higher redshifts. This push will be more pronounced for lens galaxies, for which we only need to measure galaxy positions, not shapes. As a result, we will increasingly often have lens galaxy samples at redshifts higher than those of source galaxies, changing the traditional configuration of galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL). In this paper, we explore this situation, where lens galaxies are behind source galaxies, which we call inverse galaxy-galaxy lensing (IGGL). We take projected lens and source sample specifications from the Vera Rubin Observatory LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) to compare astrophysical and cosmological constraints between traditional GGL and IGGL. We find IGGL to behave in a different way than GGL, being especially sensitive to lensing magnification, intrinsic alignments (IA) and cosmology, but largely independent of galaxy bias (as opposed to traditional GGL). In this way, we find IGGL can provide independent and robust cosmological constraints without combination with galaxy clustering, and can also probe IA at high redshift and baryonic effects at small scales without being entwined with the effects of non-linear galaxy bias. When combined with cosmic shear, we find IGGL to improve $S_8$ constraints by 25\% compared to cosmic shear alone, while also providing tighter and more robust constraints on IA and baryons.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Hubble and matter density parameters with and without modelling the CMB anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider constraints on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$ from: (i) the age of the Universe based on old stars and stellar populations in the Galactic disc and halo (Cimatti &amp; Moresco 2023); (ii) the turnover scale in the matter power spectrum, which tells us the cosmological horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality (Philcox et al. 2022); and (iii) the shape of the expansion history from supernovae (SNe) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) with no absolute calibration of either, a technique known as uncalibrated cosmic standards (UCS; Lin, Chen, &amp; Mack 2021). A narrow region is consistent with all three constraints just outside their $1\sigma$ uncertainties. Although this region is defined by techniques unrelated to the physics of recombination and the sound horizon then, the standard $Planck$ fit to the CMB anisotropies falls precisely in this region. This concordance argues against early-time explanations for the anomalously high local estimate of $H_0$ (the 'Hubble tension'), which can only be reconciled with the age constraint at an implausibly low $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$. We suggest instead that outflow from the local KBC supervoid (Keenan, Barger, &amp; Cowie 2013) inflates redshifts in the nearby universe and thus the apparent local $H_0$. Given the difficulties with solutions in the early universe, we argue that the most promising alternative to a local void is a modification to the expansion history at late times, perhaps due to a changing dark energy density.</description>

      <title>DESI constraints on $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent results on the baryon acoustic oscillations measurements from the DESI collaboration have shown tantalizing hints for a time-evolving dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$, with a statistically significant deviation from the cosmological constant and cold dark matter (\lcdm) model. One of the simplest and theoretically well-motivated plausible candidates to explain the observed behavior of $w(z)$, is scalar-field quintessence. Here, we consider a class of models known as $\alpha$-attractor, which describe in a single framework both inflation and the late-time acceleration of the Universe. Using the recent DESI data, in conjunction with other cosmological observations, we place stringent constraints on $\alpha$-attractor models and compare them to the \lcdm\, model. We find the $\alpha$ parameter of the theory, which is physically motivated from supergravity and supersymmentry theories to have the values $3\alpha \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$, is constrained to be $\alpha\simeq 1.89_{-0.35}^{+0.40}$. In addition, we find that the rest of the cosmological parameters of the model agree with the corresponding values of \lcdm, while a bayesian analysis finds strong support in favor of the $\alpha$-attractor model. We also highlight an interesting connection between the $\alpha$-attractor models and the stochastic gravitational wave background, where a contribution to the latter could derive from an enhancement of inflationary gravitational waves at high frequencies due to an early kination phase, thus providing an interesting alternative way to constrain the theory in the near future.</description>

      <title>Aemulus $\nu$: Precision halo mass functions in w$\nu$CDM cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise and accurate predictions of the halo mass function for cluster mass scales in $w\nu{\rm CDM}$ cosmologies are crucial for extracting robust and unbiased cosmological information from upcoming galaxy cluster surveys. Here, we present a halo mass function emulator for cluster mass scales ($\gtrsim 10^{13}M_\odot /h$) up to redshift $z=2$ with comprehensive support for the parameter space of $w\nu{\rm CDM}$ cosmologies allowed by current data. Based on the Aemulus $\nu$ suite of simulations, the emulator marks a significant improvement in the precision of halo mass function predictions by incorporating both massive neutrinos and non-standard dark energy equation of state models. This allows for accurate modeling of the cosmology dependence in large-scale structure and galaxy cluster studies. We show that the emulator, designed using Gaussian Process Regression, has negligible theoretical uncertainties compared to dominant sources of error in future cluster abundance studies. Our emulator is publicly available, providing the community with a crucial tool for upcoming cosmological surveys such as LSST and Euclid.</description>

      <title>Massive $\nu$s through the CNN lens: interpreting the field-level neutrino mass information in weak lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern cosmological surveys probe the Universe deep into the nonlinear regime, where massive neutrinos suppress cosmic structure. Traditional cosmological analyses, which use the 2-point correlation function to extract information, are no longer optimal in the nonlinear regime, and there is thus much interest in extracting beyond-2-point information to improve constraints on neutrino mass. Quantifying and interpreting the beyond-2-point information is thus a pressing task. We study the field-level information in weak lensing convergence maps using convolution neural networks. We find that the network performance increases as higher source redshifts and smaller scales are considered -- investigating up to a source redshift of 2.5 and $\ell_{\rm max}\simeq10^4$ -- verifying that massive neutrinos leave a distinct effect on weak lensing. However, the performance of the network significantly drops after scaling out the 2-point information from the maps, implying that most of the field-level information can be found in the 2-point correlation function alone. We quantify these findings in terms of the likelihood ratio and also use Integrated Gradient saliency maps to interpret which parts of the map the network is learning the most from, finding that the network extracts information from the most overdense and underdense regions.</description>

      <title>RHINO: A large horn antenna for detecting the 21cm global signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sky-averaged brightness temperature of the 21cm line from neutral hydrogen provides a sensitive probe of the thermal state of the intergalactic medium, particularly before and during Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionisation. This `global signal' is faint, on the order of tens to hundreds of millikelvin, and spectrally relatively smooth, making it exceedingly difficult to disentangle from foreground radio emission and instrumental artefacts. In this paper, we introduce RHINO, an experiment based around a large horn antenna operating from 60-85 MHz. Horn antennas are highly characterisable and provide excellent shielding from their immediate environment, which are potentially decisive advantages when it comes to the beam measurement and modelling problems that are particularly challenging for this kind of experiment. The system also includes a novel continuous wave calibration source to control correlated gain fluctuations, allowing continuous monitoring of the overall gain level without needing to rapidly switch between the sky and a calibration source. Here, we describe the basic RHINO concept, including the antenna design, EM simulations, and receiver electronics. We use a basic simulation and analysis pipeline to study the impact of the limited bandwidth on recovery of physical 21cm global signal model parameters, and discuss a basic calibration scheme that incorporates the continuous wave signal. Finally, we report on the current state of a scaled-down prototype system under construction at Jodrell Bank Observatory.</description>

      <title>Large neutrino asymmetry from forbidden decay of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM), in spite of being stable or long-lived on cosmological scales, can decay in the early Universe due to finite-temperature effects. In particular, a first order phase transition (FOPT) in the early Universe can provide a finite window for such decay, guaranteeing DM stability at lower temperatures, consistent with observations. The FOPT can lead to the generation of stochastic gravitational waves (GW) with peak frequencies correlated with DM mass. On the other hand, early DM decay into neutrinos can create a large neutrino asymmetry which can have interesting cosmological consequences in terms of enhanced effective relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$, providing a solution to the recently observed Helium anomaly among others. Allowing DM decay to occur below sphaleron decoupling temperature, thereby avoiding overproduction of baryon asymmetry, forces the FOPT to occur at sub-electroweak scale. This leaves the stochastic GW within range of experiments like LISA, $\mu$ARES, NANOGrav etc.</description>

      <title>Back to the origins of brane-antibrane inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a new framework for brane-antibrane inflation where moduli stabilisation relies purely on perturbative corrections to the effective action. This guarantees that the model does not suffer from the eta-problem. The inflationary potential has two contributions: the tension of an antibrane at the tip of a warped throat, and its Coulomb interaction with a mobile brane. This represents the first realisation of the original idea of brane-antibrane inflation, as opposed to inflection point inflation which arises when the moduli are fixed with non-perturbative effects. Moreover, we formulate the brane-antibrane dynamics as an F-term potential of a nilpotent superfield in a manifestly supersymmetric effective theory. We impose compatibility with data and consistency conditions on control over the approximations and find that slow-roll inflation can occur in a large region of the underlying parameter space. The scalar spectral index is in agreement with data and the tensor-to-scalar ratio is beyond current observational reach. Interestingly, after the end of inflation the volume mode can, but does not need to, evolve towards a late-time minimum at larger values.</description>

      <title>Cross Correlating the Unresolved Gamma-Ray Background with Cosmic Large-Scale Structure from DESI: Implications for Astrophysics and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) is a diffuse gamma-ray emission arising from numerous extragalactic sources below the detection threshold and is an important component of the gamma-ray sky. Studying the UGRB is crucial for understanding high-energy astrophysical processes in the universe and for probing fundamental physics, such as the nature of dark matter. In this work, we forecast the cross-correlation between the UGRB and galaxy catalogs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. First, we study the expected astrophysical contributions to the UGRB and their cross-correlation with DESI spectroscopic galaxies. Our calculations show that the cross-correlation signal-to-noise ratio is expected to be significant, with the highest value predicted to be 20.6 for DESI luminous red galaxies due to a higher predicted overlap in the redshift distribution with the UGRB. We consider two science cases that the UGRB-spectroscopic galaxies cross-correlation can be applied to: 1) measuring the UGRB flux as a function of redshift, achieving a precision of 10\% in some redshift bins, and 2) searching for annihilating dark matter potentially up to a mass of about 300~GeV, three times higher than the currently strongest constraints. This work underscores the importance of cross correlating the UGRB with cosmic large-scale structure tracers and highlights the multiwavelength approaches to advancing our understanding of high-energy astrophysical phenomena and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>On the temperature effects in QCD axion mass mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the QCD axion mass mixing in the early Universe and investigate the temperature effects in the mixing. We explore the scenario where two $Z_{\mathcal N}$ QCD axions undergo mass mixing during the QCD phase transition, yielding three distinct mixing scenarios: mixing I, II, and III. These scenarios are realized through fine-tuning of the axion decay constants, the temperature parameters, as well as the value of $\mathcal N$. We conduct a thorough analysis of the level crossing phenomena in these three mixing scenarios, detailing the conditions under which they occur. Notably, in the mixing I and II, the level crossing precedes the critical temperature of the QCD phase transition ($T_{\rm QCD}$), with minimal non-essential discrepancies in the cosmological evolution of the mass eigenvalues at $T_{\rm QCD}$. In contrast, the mixing III exhibits a unique double level crossings, occurring both before and at $T_{\rm QCD}$. Despite superficial similarities in axion evolution between the mixing II and III, we uncover fundamental differences between them. Additionally, we briefly address the transition in energy density between the two axions within our mixing scenarios. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of the QCD axion in the early Universe and its potential implications for dark matter.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Weak AGNs from Super-Eddington Accretion onto Infant Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple model for the X-ray weakness of JWST-selected broad-line AGNs is proposed under the assumption that the majority of these sources are fed at super-Eddington accretion rates. In these conditions, the hot inner corona above the geometrically thin disk that is responsible for the emission of X-rays in "normal" AGNs will be embedded instead in a funnel-like reflection geometry. The coronal plasma will Compton upscatter optical/UV photons from the underlying thick disk as well as the surrounding funnel walls, and the high soft-photon energy density will cool down the plasma to temperatures in the range 30-40 keV. The resulting X-ray spectra are predicted to be extremely soft, with power-law photon indices Gamma=2.8-4.0, making high-z super-Eddington AGNs largely undetectable by Chandra.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Mysterious Origin of FRB 20121102A with Machine-learning Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio waves from the Universe. Even though more than 50 physical models have been proposed, the origin and physical mechanism of FRB emissions are still unknown. The classification of FRBs is one of the primary approaches to understanding their mechanisms, but previous studies classified conventionally using only a few observational parameters, such as fluence and duration, which might be incomplete. To overcome this problem, we use an unsupervised machine-learning model, the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to handle seven parameters simultaneously, including amplitude, linear temporal drift, time duration, central frequency, bandwidth, scaled energy, and fluence.
  We test the method for homogeneous 977 sub-bursts of FRB 20121102A detected by the Arecibo telescope. Our machine-learning analysis identified five distinct clusters, suggesting the possible existence of multiple different physical mechanisms responsible for the observed FRBs from the FRB 20121102A source. The geometry of the emission region and the propagation effect of FRB signals could also make such distinct clusters.
  This research will be a benchmark for future FRB classifications when dedicated radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) or Bustling Universe Radio Survey Telescope in Taiwan (BURSTT) discover more FRBs than before.</description>

      <title>Astraeus X: Indications of a top-heavy initial mass function in highly star-forming galaxies from JWST observations at z&gt;10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered an abundance of $z&gt;10$ galaxies bright in the ultraviolet (UV) that has challenged traditional theoretical models at high redshifts. Recently, various new models have emerged to address this discrepancy by refining their description of star formation. Here we investigate whether modifications to the stellar initial mass function (IMF) alone can reproduce the $z&gt;10$ UV luminosity functions (UV LFs) when the star formation rate is used as a proxy for the fraction of massive stars. We incorporate an Evolving IMF into the {\sc astraeus} galaxy evolution and reionisation simulation framework, which becomes increasingly top-heavy as the gas density in a galaxy rises above a given threshold. Our implementation accounts for the IMF's effects on supernova (SN) feedback, metal enrichment, and the UV and ionising emissivities. For this Evolving IMF model, we find that (i) the maximum UV luminosity enhancement is twice as large in massive galaxies ($\Delta M_\mathrm{UV}\simeq2.6$) than those where star formation is strongly limited by SN feedback ($\Delta M_\mathrm{UV}\simeq1.3$); (ii) it successfully reproduces the observed UV LFs at $z=5-15$; (iii) galaxies with top-heavy IMFs exhibit the highest star formation rates, driven by their location in local density peaks, which facilitates higher gas accretion rates; (iv) the $1\sigma$ variances in the UV luminosity are only slightly higher compared to when assuming a Salpeter IMF, but the $2\sigma$ variances are significantly increased by a factor of $1.4-2$ boosting the abundance of UV-bright galaxies at $z&gt;10$; (v) reionisation begins earlier with more extended large ionised regions and fewer smaller ones during its initial stages, though these differences diminish at lower redshifts, leading to a similar end of reionisation at $z\simeq5.6$.}</description>

      <title>Box Replication Effects in Weak Lensing Light-cone Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing simulations serve as indispensable tools for obtaining precise cosmological constraints. In particular, it is crucial to address the systematic uncertainties in theoretical predictions, given the rapid increase in galaxy numbers and the reduction in observational noise. Both on-the-fly and post-processing methods for constructing lensing light-cones encounter limitations due to the finite simulated volume, necessitating the replication of the simulation box to encompass the volume to high redshifts. To address this issue, our primary focus lies on investigating and quantifying the impact of box replication on the convergence power spectrum and higher-order moments of lensing fields. Subsequently, a univariate model is utilized to estimate the amplitude parameter $A$ by fitting four statistics measured from partial-sky light-cones along specific angles, to the averaged result from random directions. The investigation demonstrates that the systematic bias stemming from the box replication phenomenon falls within the bounds of statistical errors for the majority of cases. However, caution should be exercised when considering high-order statistics on a small sky coverage ($\lesssim 25~\mathrm{deg^2}$). For this case, we have developed a code that facilitates the identification of optimal viewing angles for the light-cone construction. This code has been made publicly accessible at https://github.com/czymh/losf.</description>

      <title>KiDS-1000 and DES-Y1 combined: Cosmology from peak count statistics</title>

Abstract: We analyse the fourth data release of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) and extract cosmological parameter constraints based on the cosmic shear peak count statistics. Peaks are identified in aperture mass maps in which the filter is maximally sensitive to angular scales in the range 2-4arcmin, probing deep into the non-linear regime of structure formation. We interpret our results with a simulation-based inference pipeline, sampling over a broad $w$CDM prior volume and marginalising over uncertainties on shape calibration, photometric redshift distribution, intrinsic alignment and baryonic feedback. Our measurements constrain the structure growth parameter and the amplitude of the non-linear intrinsic alignment model to $\Sigma_8 \equiv \sigma_8\left[\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3\right]^{0.60}=0.765^{+0.030}_{-0.030}$ and $A_{\rm IA}= 0.71^{+0.42}_{-0.42}$, respectively, in agreement with previous KiDS-1000 results based on two-point shear statistics. These results are robust against modelling of the non-linear physics, different scale cuts and selections of tomographic bins. The posterior is also consistent with that from the Dark Energy Survey Year-1 peak count analysis presented in Harnois-D\'eraps et al (2021), and hence we jointly analyse both surveys. We obtain $\Sigma_8^{\rm joint} \equiv \sigma_8\left[\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3\right]^{0.57}=0.759^{+0.020}_{-0.017}$, in agreement with the Planck $w$CDM results. The shear-CMB tension on this parameter increases to $3.1\sigma$ when forcing $w=-1.0$, and to $4.1\sigma$ if comparing instead with $S_{8,\Lambda{\rm CDM}}^{\rm joint} = 0.736^{+0.016}_{-0.018}$, one of the tightest constraints to date on this quantity.

      <title>Cosmology with varying fundamental constants from hyperlight, coupled scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental constants at recombination can differ from their present-day values due to degeneracies in cosmological parameters, raising the possibility of yet-undiscovered physics coupled directly to the Standard Model. We study the cosmology of theories in which a new, hyperlight scalar field modulates the electron mass and fine-structure constant at early times. We find new degeneracies in cosmologies that pair early recombination with a new contribution to the matter density arising at late times, whose predictions can be simultaneously consistent with CMB and low-redshift distance measurements. Such "late dark matter" already exists in the Standard Model in the form of massive neutrinos but is necessarily realized by the scalar responsible for shifting the early-time fundamental constants. After detailing the physical effects of varying constants and hyperlight scalar fields on cosmology, we show that variations of the electron mass and fine structure constant are constrained at the percent and permille level, respectively, and a hyperlight scalar in the mass range $10^{-32}~\mathrm{eV} \lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-28}~\mathrm{eV}$ can impact what variations are allowed while composing up to a percent of the present dark matter density. We comment on the potential for models with a varying electron mass to reconcile determinations of the Hubble constant from cosmological observations and distance-ladder methods, and we show that parameter inference varies significantly between recent baryon acoustic oscillation and type Ia supernova datasets.</description>

      <title>Memory burden effect mimics reheating signatures on SGWB from ultra-low mass PBH domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-low mass primordial black holes (PBH), briefly dominating the expansion of the universe, would leave detectable imprints in the secondary stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Such a scenario leads to a characteristic doubly peaked spectrum of SGWB and strongly depends on the Hawking evaporation of such light PBHs. However, these observable signatures are significantly altered if the memory burden effect during the evaporation of PBHs is taken into account. We show that for the SGWB induced by PBH density fluctuations, the memory burden effects on the Hawking evaporation of ultra-low mass PBHs can mimic the signal arising due to the non-standard reheating epoch before PBH domination. Finally, we point out that this degeneracy can be broken by the simultaneous detection of the first peak in the SGWB, which is typically induced by the inflationary adiabatic perturbations.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Hellings-Downs curve: Non-Einsteinian gravitational waves in pulsar timing array correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent astronomical milestone by the pulsar timing arrays (PTA) has revealed galactic-size gravitational waves (GW) in the form of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), correlating the radio pulses emitted by millisecond pulsars. This draws the outstanding questions toward the origin and the nature of the SGWB; the latter is synonymous to testing how quadrupolar the inter-pulsar spatial correlation is. In this paper, we tackle the nature of the SGWB by considering correlations beyond the Hellings-Downs (HD) curve of Einstein's general relativity. We put the HD and non-Einsteinian GW correlations under scrutiny with the NANOGrav and the CPTA data, and find that both data sets allow a graviton mass $m_{\rm g} \lesssim 1.04 \times 10^{-22} \ {\rm eV}/c^2$ and subluminal traveling waves. We discuss gravitational physics scenarios beyond general relativity that could host non-Einsteinian GW correlations in the SGWB and highlight the importance of the cosmic variance inherited from the stochasticity in interpreting PTA observation.</description>

      <title>Arm-Locking Frequency Noise Suppression for Astronomical Middle-Frequency Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For space gravitational wave (GW) detection, arm locking is a proposal useful in decreasing the frequency noise of the laser sources for current developing space missions LISA and Taiji/TianQin. In this paper, we study the application of arm locking to the Astrodynamical Middle-frequency Interferometric Gravitational wave Observatory (AMIGO) to decrease the frequency noise of laser sources. For AMIGO, the arm-locking technique can suppress the laser frequency noise by three orders of magnitude. The advantage of this is to make the auxiliary noise assignment for AMIGO easier and more relaxed. For the first-generation time-delay interferometry (TDI) configuration, the laser frequency noise contribution is already below the core noise contribution. For the simple Michelson TDI configuration (X0), the arm locking makes the acceleration-thrust scheme, the delay-line scheme, or the combined scheme easier to implement. Within a relatively short period of less than a day (compared to less than twenty days for LISA/Taiji), the Doppler frequency pulling can be efficiently reduced to within $\pm$ 0.001 Hz and does not affect the mission duty cycle much.</description>

      <title>Probing Light Inelastic Dark Matter from Direct Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For dark matter (DM) direct detections, the kinematic effects such as those of the inelastic scattering can play important role in light DM searches. The light DM detection is generally difficult because of its small recoil energy. But the recoil energy of the exothermic inelastic DM scattering could exceed the detection threshold due to the contribution from the DM mass-splitting, making the direct detection of sub-GeV DM feasible. In this work, we systematically study signatures of the light exothermic inelastic DM from the recoil spectra including both the DM-electron scattering and Migdal effect. Such inelastic DM has mass around (sub-)GeV scale with DM mass-splitting of $O(1-10^2)$keV. We analyze the direct detection sensitivities to such light inelastic DM. For different inelastic DM masses and mass-splittings, we find that the DM-electron recoil and Migdal effect can contribute significantly and differently to the direct detection signatures. The DM-lepton and/or DM-quark interactions may vary for different DM models, and their interplay leads to a diversity in the recoil spectra. Hence, it is important to perform a combined analysis to include both the DM-electron recoil and Migdal effect. We further demonstrate that this analysis has strong impacts on the cosmological and laboratory bounds for the inelastic DM.</description>

      <title>Search for the Hawking radiation of primordial black holes: prospective sensitivity of LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), more generally, BHs, undergo evaporation and, in principle, will end their lives in bursts of very high-energy gamma rays. The notable aspect of the PBHs with an initial mass of $\sim10^{14}$ g is that they are expected to end their lives today. In this work, we assess the potential sensitivity of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) in detecting the local burst rate density of PBHs. Our results suggest that LHAASO is capable of probing for PBH bursts within a proximity of $\sim0.1$ pc from the Sun, measuring a local burst rate density of $\sim$ 1200 (or 700)$\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ with $99\%$ confidence during a 3-year (or 5-year) observational campaign. This level of sensitivity surpasses the most rigorous observational constraint provided by the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC) by an order of magnitude. Additionally, we propose data analysis strategies for LHAASO to optimize the search for PBHs and reach its potential detection limits.</description>

      <title>Search for GeV gamma-ray emission from SPT-CL J2012-5649 with six years of DAMPE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for gamma-ray emission from the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J2012-5649 in the energy range from 3 GeV to 1 TeV using the DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) telescope. For our analysis, we use three different templates: point source, radial disk, and radial Gaussian. We do not detect a signal with significance $&gt;3\sigma$ for any of these templates at any location within $R_{200}$ of the cluster center. We obtain 95\% C.L. upper limit on the energy flux ranging between $\sim 10^{-6}$ and $10^{-4} \rm{MeV~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$ depending on the energy range. These upper limits are consistent with a previously reported non-zero flux detected by Fermi-LAT at $6\sigma$ significance. This work represents the first proof of principle search for gamma-ray emission from a single galaxy cluster using DAMPE data.</description>

      <title>Constraining burdened PBHs with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of memory burden on the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum arising from the Hawking evaporation of light primordial black holes (PBHs). By considering both rotating (Kerr) and non-rotating (Schwarzschild) PBHs, we demonstrate that the overproduction of primordial GWs from burdened PBHs could impose stringent constraints on the parameters governing backreaction effects. These constraints, derived from $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ measurements by Planck and prospective experiments such as CMB-S4 and CMB-HD, offer novel insights into the impact of memory burden on PBH dynamics.</description>
