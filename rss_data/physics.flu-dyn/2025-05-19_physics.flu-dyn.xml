      <title>State-dependent convergence of Galerkin-based reduced-order models for Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the effect of basis functions on the performance and convergence of the Galerkin projection-based reduced-order model (ROM) in the minimal flow unit of Couette flow. POD (proper orthogonal decomposition) modes obtained from direct numerical simulation and controllability and balanced truncation modes from the linearised Navier-Stokes equations (LNSE) with different base flows (laminar base flow and turbulent mean flow) and an eddy viscosity model are considered. In the neighbourhood of the laminar base state, the ROMs based on the modes from the LNSE with the laminar base flow and molecular viscosity are found to perform very well as they are able to capture the linear stability of the laminar base flow for each plane Fourier component only with a single degree of freedom. In particular, the ROM based on the balanced truncation modes models the linear dynamics involving transient growth around the laminar base flow most effectively, consistent with previous studies. In contrast, for turbulent state, the ROM based on POD modes is found to reproduce its statistics and coherent dynamics most effectively. The ROMs based on the modes from the LNSE with turbulent mean flow and an eddy viscosity model performs better compared to any other ROMs using the modes from the LNSE. These observations suggest that the performance and convergence of a ROM are highly state-dependent. In particular, this state dependence is strongly correlated with the information and dynamics that each of the basis functions contains. Discussions supporting these observations are also provided in relation to the flow physics involved and the form of coherent structures in Couette flow.</description>

      <title>Upstream history quantification and scale-decomposed energy analysis for weak-to-strong adverse-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study delineates the effects of pressure gradient history and local disequilibration on the small and large-scale energy in turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) imposed with a broad range of adverse-pressure-gradients (APG). This is made possible by analyzing four published high-fidelity APG TBL databases, which span weak to strong APGs and cover dynamic conditions ranging from near-equilibrium to strong disequilibrium. The influence of PG history on TBL statistics is quantified by the accumulated PG parameter ($\overline{\beta}$), proposed previously by Vinuesa et al. (2017) to study integral quanitites, which is compared here between cases at matched local PG strength ($\beta$), Reynolds number ($Re$) and ${\rm d}{\beta}/{{\rm d}{Re}}$ at nominally similar orders of magnitude. While the effects of local disequilibration (${\rm d}{\beta}/{{\rm d}{Re}}$) are investigated by considering TBL cases at matched $\beta$, $Re$, and fairly matched $\overline{\beta}$. It is found that $\overline{\beta}$ cannot unambiguously capture history effects when ${\rm d}{\beta}/{{\rm d}{Re}}$ levels are significantly high, as it does not account for the delayed response of the mean flow and turbulence, nor the attenuation of the pressure gradient effect with distance. In two comparisons of APG TBLs under strong non-equilibrium, the values of $\overline{\beta}$ and ${\rm d}{\beta}/{\rm d}{Re}$ expressed using Zagarola-Smits scaling were found to be consistent with the trends in mean velocity defect and Reynolds stresses noted previously for weak APG TBLs. While an increase in $\overline{\beta}$ is associated with energisation of both the small and large scales in the outer regions of APG TBLs, it affects only the large scales in the near-wall region. This confirms the ability of near-wall small scales to rapidly adjust to changes in PG strength.</description>

      <title>Theoretical framework for designing phase change material systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) hold considerable promise for thermal energy storage applications. However, designing a PCM system to meet specific performance presents a formidable challenge, given the intricate influence of multiple factors on the performance. To address this challenge, we hereby develop a theoretical framework that elucidates the melting process of PCMs. By integrating stability analysis with theoretical modeling, we derive a transition criterion to demarcate different melting regimes, and subsequently formulate the melting curve that uniquely characterizes the performance of an exemplary PCM system. This theoretical melting curve captures the key trends observed in experimental and numerical data across a broad parameter space, establishing a convenient and quantitative relationship between design parameters and system performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of the theoretical framework across diverse configurations. Overall, our findings deepen the understanding of thermo-hydrodynamics in melting PCMs, thereby facilitating the evaluation, design, and enhancement of PCM systems.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty and Error Quantification for Data-Driven Reynolds-Averaged Turbulence Modelling with Mean-Variance Estimation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amid growing interest in machine learning, numerous data-driven models have recently been developed for Reynolds-averaged turbulence modelling. However, their results generally show that they do not give accurate predictions for test cases that have different flow phenomena to the training cases. As these models have begun being applied to practical cases typically seen in industry such as in cooling and nuclear, improving or incorporating metrics to measure their reliability has become an important matter. To this end, a novel data-driven approach that uses mean-variance estimation networks (MVENs) is proposed in the present work. MVENs enable efficient computation as a key advantage over other uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods - during model training with maximum likelihood estimation, and UQ with a single forward propagation. Furthermore, the predicted standard deviation is also shown to be an appropriate proxy variable for the error in the mean predictions, thereby providing error quantification (EQ) capabilities. The new tensor-basis neural network with MVEN integration was compared with its popular underlying data-driven model by evaluating them on two test cases: a separated flow and a secondary flow. In both cases, the proposed approach preserved the predictive accuracy of the underlying data-driven model, while efficiently providing reliability metrics in the form of UQ and EQ. For the purposes of turbulence modelling, this work demonstrates that the UQ and EQ mechanisms in MVENs enable risk-informed predictions to be made and therefore can be insightful reliability measures in more complex cases, such as those found in industry.</description>

      <title>Evolution of perturbed long nonlinear plane, ring and hybrid surface waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolution of perturbed long nonlinear surface plane, ring and hybrid waves, consisting, to leading order, of a part of a ring and two tangent plane waves, is modelled numerically within the scope of the 2D Boussinesq-Peregrine parent system and reduced 2+1-dimensional cKdV-type equation derived from it. The latter leads to two different models, the KdV$\theta$ and cKdV equations, depending on whether we use the general or singular (i.e. the envelope of the general) solution of an associated nonlinear first-order differential equation. The KdV$\theta$ equation is used to analytically describe the intermediate 2D asymptotics of line solitons subject to sufficiently long transverse perturbations of arbitrary strength, while cKdV equation is used to describe outward and inward propagating ring waves with localised and periodic perturbations. Both models are used to describe the evolution of hybrid waves, where we show, in particular, that large lumps can appear as transient states in the evolution of such curved waves, contributing to the possible mechanisms of generation of rogue waves. Detailed comparisons are made between the modelling using the relevant reduced equations, including the KPII equation, and the parent system.</description>

      <title>CLIP: A CUDA-Accelerated Lattice Boltzmann Framework for Interfacial Phenomena with Application to Liquid Jet Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces CLIP, a CUDA-accelerated phase-field lattice Boltzmann framework for simulating immiscible two-phase flows with high density and viscosity ratios in both two- and three-dimensional domains. By leveraging GPU parallelism, the framework delivers substantial computational speedups, enabling large-scale simulations to be performed efficiently on standard desktop hardware without the need for high-performance computing clusters. It employs the Weighted Multi-Relaxation Time (WMRT) collision operator to enhance numerical stability and improve interface tracking under challenging multiphase conditions. The model is validated through a series of benchmark cases, including capillary wave dynamics, stationary drop tests, two-phase Poiseuille flow, shear-driven interface deformation, and Rayleigh-Taylor instability. It is further applied to simulate liquid jet breakup, capturing the transition from dripping to jetting regimes and identifying a critical Weber number of approximately 2.2. The results closely match experimental observations, offering detailed insights into breakup length, drop size distributions, and flow regime transitions. With its efficiency, accuracy, and scalability, the proposed framework serves as a powerful and accessible tool for investigating complex interfacial phenomena in multiphase flow physics.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic description of flake orientation suspended in rotating wave flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fluid dynamics experiments, flake-based flow visualization is a common technique to capture flow structures through the rays reflected from flat tracers suspended in the fluid. However, the correspondence between light intensity patterns in visualization images and the underlying physical properties of the flow can only be elucidated when the flow is known {\it a priori}. To reframe this limitation, just as the introduction of spin variable transformed quantum mechanics, we introduced the orientation variable into fluid dynamics and derived the time-dependent equation of the tracer orientation probability density field from an Eulerian perspective. As a first example in which a dimensionless parameter distinguishes the dependency on the initial condition, we illustrated an analytical solution of the orientation probability in a rotating wave flow. With the inclusion of the diffusion term in the governing equation, the probability converged to the flow-determined state with spatially varying anisotropy, eliminating dependency on initial conditions. As a second example, we solved the orientation probability field in the axisymmetric state in spherical Couette flow, to demonstrate independence from initial conditions consistent with experimental observations. An asymmetric pattern in experimental images, unexplained by the dynamics of the tracer orientation, was reproduced from the unique solution of the proposed equations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic stall reattachment revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic stall on airfoils is an undesirable and potentially dangerous phenomenon. The motto for aerodynamic systems with unsteadily moving wings, such as helicopters or wind turbines, is that prevention beats recovery. In case prevention fails or is not feasible, we need to know when recovery starts, how long it takes, and how we can improve it. This study revisits dynamic stall reattachment to identify the sequence of events during flow and load recovery and to characterise key observable features in the pressure, force, and flow field. Our analysis is based on time-resolved velocity field and surface pressure data obtained experimentally for a two-dimensional, sinusoidally pitching airfoil. Stall recovery is a transient process that does not start immediately when the angle of attack falls below the critical stall angle. The onset of recovery is delayed to angles below the critical stall angle and the duration of the reattachment delay decreases with increasing unsteadiness of the pitching motion. An angle of attack below the critical angle is a necessary, but not sufficient condition to initiate the stall recovery process. We identified a critical value of the leading-edge suction parameter, independent of the pitch rate, that is a threshold beyond which reattachment consistently initiates. Based on prominent changes in the evolution of the shear layer, the leading-edge suction, and the lift deficit due to stall, we divided the reattachment process into three stages: the reaction delay, wave propagation, and boundary layer relaxation stage, and extracted the characteristic features and time-scales for each stage.</description>

      <title>Near-wall turbulence and transitional behavior on the rib-roughened surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study utilizes Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to investigate the impact of longitudinal triangular riblets on the laminar-to-turbulent transition in boundary layer flow. Five cases are examined: one involving a flat plate and four with ribbed plates. Among the ribbed cases, three use a riblet aspect ratio of two, whereas one has an aspect ratio of one. Arrays of longitudinal triangular riblets are positioned on a flat plate, and the transition to turbulence is initiated by controlled excitation of a Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) wave imposed on a Blasius velocity profile in a stable region. The longitudinal triangular riblets attenuate the TS wave, leading to a lower growth rate of turbulence. For higher riblet height ($h$) and width ($w$), with inner-scaled dimensions $h^+ = 25$, $w^+ = S^+ = 50$ (where $S$ is the spacing between two riblets), an early transition is triggered by high-frequency disturbances generated at the leading edge of the roughness elements. However, increasing riblet spacing to $S^+ = 75$ delays the transition by 17.5 percent. Both cases exhibited increased drag compared to the flat plate. For $h^+ = 12.5$ and $w^+ = S^+ = 25$, transition was delayed by 37 percent, with a modest overall drag reduction of 8.8 percent. The most significant result from the considered cases, $h^+ = w^+ = S^+ = 12.5$, showed a 47 percent delay in transition and a 13.69 percent reduction in overall drag. Smaller riblets cause minimal disturbance at the leading edge of roughness, resulting in a transition mechanism similar to a flat plate, while also reducing pressure loss, secondary flows, and velocity fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent model for active control of wind turbine wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active wake control (AWC) has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing wind turbine wake recovery, but accurately modelling its underlying fluid mechanisms remains challenging. This study presents a computationally efficient wake model that provides end-to-end prediction capability from rotor actuation to wake recovery enhancement by capturing the coupled dynamics of wake meandering and meanflow modification, requiring only two inputs: a reference wake without control and a user-defined AWC strategy. The model combines physics-based resolvent modelling for large-scale coherent structures and an eddy viscosity modelling for small-scale turbulence. A Reynolds stress model is introduced to account for the influence of both coherent and incoherent wake fluctuations, so that the time-averaged wake recovery enhanced by the AWC can be quantitatively predicted. Validation against large-eddy simulations (LES) across various AWC approaches and actuating frequencies demonstrates the model's predictive capability, accurately capturing AWC-specific and frequency-dependent mean wake recovery with less than 8% error from LES while reducing computational time from thousands of CPU hours to minutes. The efficiency and accuracy of the model makes it a promising tool for practical AWC design and optimization of large-scale wind farms.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Slip Boundary Condition: Surface Roughness as a Hidden Tuning Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effect of boundary surface roughness on numerical simulations of incompressible fluid flow past a cylinder in two and three spatial dimensions furnished with slip boundary conditions. The governing equations are approximated using a continuous finite element method, stabilized with a Galerkin least-squares approach.
  Through a series of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that: $(i)$ the introduction of surface roughness through numerical discretization error, or mesh distortion, makes the potential flow solution unstable; $(ii)$ when numerical surface roughness and mesh distortion are minimized by using high-order isoparametric geometry mappings, a stable potential flow is obtained in both two and three dimensions; $(iii)$ numerical surface roughness, mesh distortion and refinement level can be used as control parameters to manipulate drag and lift forces resulting in numerical values spanning more than an order of magnitude.
  Our results cast some doubt on the predictive capability of the slip boundary condition for wall modeling in turbulent simulations of incompressible flow.</description>

      <title>Flow interactions and forward flight dynamics of tandem flapping wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine theoretically the flow interactions and forward flight dynamics of tandem or in-line flapping wings. Two wings are driven vertically with prescribed heaving-and-plunging motions, and the horizontal propulsion speeds and positions are dynamically selected through aero- or hydro-dynamic interactions. Our simulations employ an improved vortex sheet method to solve for the locomotion of the pair within the collective flow field, and we identify 'schooling states' in which the wings travel together with nearly constant separation. Multiple terminal configurations are achieved by varying the initial conditions, and the emergent separations are approximately integer multiples of the wavelength traced out by each wing. We explain the stability of these states by perturbing the follower and mapping out an effective potential for its position in the leader's wake. Each equilibrium position is stabilized since smaller separations are associated with in-phase follower-wake motions that constructively reinforce the flow but lead to decreased thrust on the follower; larger separations are associated with antagonistic follower-wake motions, increased thrust, and a weakened collective wake. The equilibria and their stability are also corroborated by a linearized theory for the motion of the leader, the wake it produces, and its effect on the follower. We also consider a weakly-flapping follower driven with lower heaving amplitude than the leader. We identify 'keep-up' conditions for which the wings may still 'school' together despite their dissimilar kinematics, with the 'freeloading' follower passively assuming a favorable position within the wake that permits it to travel significantly faster than it would in isolation.</description>

      <title>A conformally mapped numerical wave tank supporting piston and flap wavemakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper advances the development of the conformally mapped model for accurate simulation of two-dimensional water waves, here with emphasis on mapping boundaries that represent piston- and flap-type wavemakers. With this, a complete numerical representation of wave flumes is provided -- the first of its kind based on conformal mapping. The model is validated both theoretically and experimentally, with special attention devoted to wavemaker characteristics and the generation of spurious waves. It is further demonstrated that the method accurately predicts the spectral evolutions of generated wave fields. The model is computationally efficient, with beyond real-time computation but for the smallest tested periods, making it ideal for numerical wave calibration and for replicating experiments.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical solutions of passive scalar transport in generalized Newtonian fluid flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport during flow of generalized Newtonian fluids (GNFs) appears often in systems that can be treated in a simplified form as either cylindrical tubes or slit openings between parallel plates. Based on the pioneering work of Taylor, analytical solutions for transport in these simplified systems were derived generally. This includes analytical solutions for advection dominated transport, as well as a computation of the enhanced molecular diffusion coefficient in low Peclet number systems. The newly derived general solutions for species transport were applied to Cross and Carreau model fluids using a semi-analytical solution for velocity of these fluids. The semi-analytical solutions derived herein were compared to microscale simulations and showed agreement to within the numerical error of those simulations. The semi-analytical transport solutions derived here were developed without assuming any specific fluid rheology, thus these solutions can be applied to other non-Newtonian fluids, such as viscoelastic or viscoplastic fluids, as a straightforward extension of this work.</description>

      <title>Ionic strength-driven cavitation nucleation: from energy deposition-based to tension-based cavitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a unified experimental and simulation investigation of cavitation in aqueous electrolyte solutions, combining nanosecond laser-induced optical breakdown and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations under tensile stress. Across both cavitation scenarios, we find that cavitation inception and intensity (bubble nucleation count, cavitation-zone length, vapor-volume fraction) are governed by ionic strength alone, with negligible dependence on the ion species. In laser experiments, increasing ionic strength lowers the breakdown threshold and amplifies bubble generation by supplying extra seed electrons for inverse Bremsstrahlung-driven avalanche ionization. We elucidate the mechanism of action of the ionic strength through the MD simulations, which essentially quantifies the net charge density in the bulk, and thus its combined influence on the generation of seed electrons and the perturbation of the hydration network. These findings identify ionic strength serving as a unifying parameter controlling cavitation in electrolyte solutions: whether driven by rapid energy deposition or by tensile stress imposed.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Automatic Shaping of Liquid Droplets on an Air-Ferrofluid Interface with Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating the shape of a liquid droplet is essential for a wide range of applications in medicine and industry. However, existing methods are typically limited to generating simple shapes, such as ellipses, or rely on predefined templates. Although recent approaches have demonstrated more complex geometries, they remain constrained by limited adaptability and lack of real-time control. Here, we introduce a data-efficient method that enables real-time, programmable shaping of nonmagnetic liquid droplets into diverse target forms at the air-ferrofluid interface using Bayesian optimization. The droplet can adopt either convex or concave shapes depending on the actuation of the surrounding electromagnets. Bayesian optimization determines the optimal magnetic flux density for shaping the liquid droplet into a desired target shape. Our method enables automatic shaping into various triangular and rectangular shapes with a maximum shape error of 0.81 mm, as well as into letter-like patterns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of real-time, automatic shaping of nonmagnetic liquid droplets into desired target shapes using magnetic fields or other external energy fields.</description>

      <title>Suppressing instabilities in mixed baroclinic flow using an actuation based on receptivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a method to stabilise oscillations occurring in a mixed convective flow in a nearly hemispherical cavity, using actuation based on the receptivity map of the unstable mode. This configuration models the continuous casting of metallic alloys, where hot liquid metal is poured at the top of a hot sump with cold walls pulled in a solid phase at the bottom. The model focuses on the underlying fundamental thermo-hydrodynamic processes without dealing with the complexity inherent to the real configuration (Flood &amp; Davidson 1994). This flow exhibits three branches of instability (Kumar &amp; Poth{\'e}rat 2020). The solution of the adjoint eigenvalue problem for the convective flow equations reveals that the regions of highest receptivity for unstable modes of each branch concentrate near the inflow upper surface. Simulations of the linearised governing equations show that a thermo-mechanical actuation modelled on the adjoint eigenmode asymptotically suppresses the unstable mode. If the actuation's amplitude is kept constant in time, which is easier to implement in an industrial environment, the suppression is still effective but only over a finite time, after which it becomes destabilising. Based on this phenomenology, we apply the same actuation during the stabilising phase only in the nonlinear evolution of the unstable mode. It turns out stabilisation persists, even when the unstable mode is left to evolve freely after the actuation period. These results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of receptivity-informed actuation in stabilising convective oscillations but also suggest a simple strategy for their long-term control.</description>

      <title>Generative prediction of flow fields around an obstacle using the diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a geometry-to-flow diffusion model that utilizes obstacle shape as input to predict a flow field around an obstacle. The model is based on a learnable Markov transition kernel to recover the data distribution from the Gaussian distribution. The Markov process is conditioned on the obstacle geometry, estimating the noise to be removed at each step, implemented via a U-Net. A cross-attention mechanism incorporates the geometry as a prompt. We train the geometry-to-flow diffusion model using a dataset of flows around simple obstacles, including circles, ellipses, rectangles, and triangles. For comparison, two CNN-based models and a VAE model are trained on the same dataset. Tests are carried out on flows around obstacles with simple and complex geometries, representing interpolation and generalization on the geometry condition, respectively. To evaluate performance under demanding conditions, the test set incorporates scenarios including crosses and the characters `PKU.' Generated flow fields show that the geometry-to-flow diffusion model is superior to the CNN-based models and the VAE model in predicting instantaneous flow fields and handling complex geometries. Quantitative analysis of the accuracy and divergence demonstrates the model's robustness.</description>

      <title>Internal shear layers generated by a vertically oscillating cylinder in unbounded and bounded rotating fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In rotating fluids, the viscous smoothing of inviscid singular inertial waves leads to the formation of internal shear layers.
  In previous works, we analysed the internal shear layers excited by a viscous forcing (longitudinal libration) in a spherical shell geometry (He \textit{et al.}, \textit{J. Fluid Mech.} {\bf 939}, A3, 2022; {\bf 974}, A3, 2023). We now consider the stronger inviscid forcing corresponding to the vertical oscillation of the inner boundary.
  We limit our analysis to two-dimensional geometries but examine three different configurations: freely-propagating wave beams in an unbounded domain and two wave patterns (a periodic orbit and an attractor) in a cylindrical shell geometry. The asymptotic structures of the internal shear layers are assumed to follow the similarity solution of Moore \&amp; Saffman (\textit{Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A}, 264 (1156), 1969, 597-634) in the small viscous limit. The two undefined parameters of the similarity solution (singularity strength and amplitude) are derived by asymptotically matching the similarity solution with the inviscid solution. For each case, the derivation of the latter is achieved either through separation of variables combined with analytical continuation or the method of characteristics. Global inviscid solutions, when obtained, closely match numerical solutions for small Ekman numbers far from the critical lines, while viscous asymptotic solutions show excellent performance near those lines. The amplitude scalings of the internal shear layers excited by an inviscid forcing are found to be divergent as the Ekman number $E$ decreases, specifically $O(E^{-1/6})$ for the critical point singularity and $O(E^{-1/3})$ for attractors, in contrast to the convergent scalings found for a viscous forcing.</description>

      <title>A novel simulation approach for concentration-driven evaporation in capillaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long liquid retention times in industrial gaps, due to capillary effects, significantly affect product lifetime by facilitating corrosion on solid surfaces. Concentration-driven evaporation plays a major role in mitigating this corrosion. Accurate evaporation rate predictions are crucial for improved product design. However, simulating capillary-driven flows with evaporation in complex geometries is challenging, requiring consideration of surface tension, wetting, and phase-change effects. Traditional approaches, such as the Volume-of-Fluid method, are prone to curvature calculation errors and have long simulation times due to strict time step limitations. This study introduces a novel semi-transient simulation approach for fast evaporation rate prediction in arbitrarily shaped cavities. The approach involves a unidirectional coupling circuit, simulating the fluid surface in Surface Evolver and combining it with a vapor-in-gas diffusion simulation in OpenFOAM. The approach assumes that the evaporation rate is calculated solely based on the conditions at a given liquid filling level, without considering the evaporation history. This allows for highly parallelized simulations, achieving simulation runtimes in the order of 10 min to cover up to 150 h of physical time. Numerical investigations are conducted for water evaporation in air at a temperature of 23{\deg}C and a relative humidity of 17%, for round and polygonal-shaped capillaries with inner diameters ranging from 1 mm to 13 mm. The results are validated using experimental data and show strong agreement. Simulations are also performed for complex industrial relevant gaps, demonstrating the applicability of the approach to a wide range of crevice geometries.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Attention Tensor Networks for Velocity Gradient Statistical Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulation of turbulence at realistic Reynolds numbers is still beyond current computational capability, necessitating models that reduce the number of resolved spatial scales. Motivated by phenomenology and recent data-driven works based on universality of the smallest scales in fully developed turbulence, the statistical dynamics of the velocity gradient tensor (VGT) at the Kolmogorov scale become of critical importance in advancing turbulence models. Physics-informed machine learning has found considerable success in exploiting large datasets taken from direct numerical simulation of Navier-Stokes to improve models for the evolution of the VGT. In this work, we follow the long line of blending physical insight with data analysis to simultaneously advance both the modeling and understanding of the phenomenology of the VGT. Using the intimate connection between VGT evolution and fluid deformation, we develop the Lagrangian attention tensor network approach that significantly improves over current physics-informed machine learning methods. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both a-priori and a-posteriori metrics, before interpreting the trained attention mechanisms to discover a surprising connection between the history of the strain-rate-tensor and the pressure Hessian.</description>

      <title>VICON: Vision In-Context Operator Networks for Multi-Physics Fluid Dynamics Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-Context Operator Networks (ICONs) have demonstrated the ability to learn operators across diverse partial differential equations using few-shot, in-context learning. However, existing ICONs process each spatial point as an individual token, severely limiting computational efficiency when handling dense data in higher spatial dimensions. We propose Vision In-Context Operator Networks (VICON), which integrates vision transformer architectures to efficiently process 2D data through patch-wise operations while preserving ICON's adaptability to multiphysics systems and varying timesteps. Evaluated across three fluid dynamics benchmarks, VICON significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines: DPOT and MPP, reducing the averaged last-step rollout error by 37.9% compared to DPOT and 44.7% compared to MPP, while requiring only 72.5% and 34.8% of their respective inference times. VICON naturally supports flexible rollout strategies with varying timestep strides, enabling immediate deployment in imperfect measurement systems where sampling frequencies may differ or frames might be dropped - common challenges in real-world settings - without requiring retraining or interpolation. In these realistic scenarios, VICON exhibits remarkable robustness, experiencing only 24.41% relative performance degradation compared to 71.37%-74.49% degradation in baseline methods, demonstrating its versatility for deploying in realistic applications. Our scripts for processing datasets and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Eydcao/VICON.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Three-dimensional Nematic Guidance of Microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that an anisotropic liquid crystalline (LC) environment can be used to guide the self-propulsion dynamics of dispersed microswimmers, such as bacteria. This type of composite system is named "living nematic" (LN). In the dilute limit, bacteria are found to mainly follow the local director field. Beyond the dilute limit, however, they exhibit novel dynamical behaviors, from swirling around a spiral +1 defect pattern to forming undulating waves, and to active turbulence. Our current knowledge of how these different behaviors emerge at different population densities remains limited. Here we develop a hybrid method to simulate the dynamics of microswimmers dispersed in a nematic LC. Specifically, we model the microswimmers using active Brownian dynamics method, which is coupled to a hydrodynamic model of nematic LCs to describe the evolution of the flow field and the LC structure. Our method is validated by comparing to existing quasi-two-dimensional (2D) experiments, including undulated swirling around a spiral pattern and stabilized undulated jets on a periodic C-pattern. We further extend our method to three-dimensional (3D) systems by examining loop-defect dynamics. We find that the morphodynamics and destiny of a loop defect not only depend on the activity (self-propulsion velocity), effective size, and the initial distribution of the swimmers, but also rely on its winding profile. Specifically, +1/2 wedge and radial twist winding can dictate the dynamics of loop defects. By varying the characteristic reversal time, we predict that microswimmers not necessarily accumulate in splay regions. Taken together, our hybrid method provides a faithful tool to explain and guide the experiments of LNs in both 2D and 3D, sheds light on the interplay between microswimmer distribution and defect dynamics, and unravels the design principles of using LCs to control active matter.</description>
