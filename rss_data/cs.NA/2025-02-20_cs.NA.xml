      <title>A universal preprocessing algorithm of average kernel method with Gauss-Laguerre quadrature for double integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the computational challenges posed by nonlinear collision kernels in the Smoluchowski equation, this study proposes a universal preprocessing algorithm for the average kernel method based on the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature for double integrals. With this algorithm, the numerical code accurately and efficiently determines the pre-exponential factor of the average kernel. Additionally, the exact pre-exponential factors of the four fundamental average kernels and their associated truncation error estimations were analyzed. The results demonstrate the reasonability and reliability of the preprocessing algorithm.</description>

      <title>Efficient space-time discretizations for tracking the boundaries of reachable sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reachable sets of nonlinear control systems can in general only be numerically approximated, and are often very expensive to calculate. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that tracks only the boundaries of the reachable sets and that chooses the temporal and spatial discretizations in a non-uniform way to reduce the computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Brief introduction in greedy approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse approximation is important in many applications because of concise form of an approximant and good accuracy guarantees. The theory of compressed sensing, which proved to be very useful in the image processing and data sciences, is based on the concept of sparsity. A fundamental issue of sparse approximation is the problem of construction of efficient algorithms, which provide good approximation. It turns out that greedy algorithms with respect to dictionaries are very good from this point of view. They are simple in implementation and there are well developed theoretical guarantees of their efficiency. This survey/tutorial paper contains brief description of different kinds of greedy algorithms and results on their convergence and rate of convergence. Also, Chapter IV gives some typical proofs of convergence and rate of convergence results for important greedy algorithms and Chapter V gives some open problems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Iterative Decoupling Methods for Thermo-Poroelasticity Based on a Four-Field Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the thermo-poroelasticity model. By introducing an intermediate variable, we transform the original three-field model into a four-field model. Building upon this four-field model, we present both a coupled finite element method and a decoupled iterative finite element method. We prove the stability and optimal convergence of the coupled finite element method. Furthermore, we establish the convergence of the decoupled iterative method. This paper focuses primarily on analyzing the iterative decoupled algorithm. It demonstrates that the algorithm's convergence does not require any additional assumptions about physical parameters or stabilization parameters. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and theoretical validity of these new methods.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Bias in Inverting Random Sampling Matrices with Application to Sub-sampled Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A substantial body of work in machine learning (ML) and randomized numerical linear algebra (RandNLA) has exploited various sorts of random sketching methodologies, including random sampling and random projection, with much of the analysis using Johnson--Lindenstrauss and subspace embedding techniques. Recent studies have identified the issue of inversion bias -- the phenomenon that inverses of random sketches are not unbiased, despite the unbiasedness of the sketches themselves. This bias presents challenges for the use of random sketches in various ML pipelines, such as fast stochastic optimization, scalable statistical estimators, and distributed optimization.
  In the context of random projection, the inversion bias can be easily corrected for dense Gaussian projections (which are, however, too expensive for many applications). Recent work has shown how the inversion bias can be corrected for sparse sub-gaussian projections. In this paper, we show how the inversion bias can be corrected for random sampling methods, both uniform and non-uniform leverage-based, as well as for structured random projections, including those based on the Hadamard transform. Using these results, we establish problem-independent local convergence rates for sub-sampled Newton methods.</description>

      <title>A Two-Step Formulation of Maxwell's Equations Using Generalized Tree-Cotree Gauges for Low-Frequency-Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new low-frequency stabilization for a two-step formulation solving the full set of Maxwell's equations. The formulation is based on a electric scalar and magnetic vector potential equation using the electroquasistatic problem as gauge condition. The proposed stabilization technique consists of an adequate frequency scaling for the electroquasistatic problem, and a tree-cotree decomposition of the magnetic vector potential such that its divergence remains consistent with the partial decoupling of the magnetic and electric potentials. The paper discusses two variants and demonstrates the effectiveness by a few computational examples.</description>

      <title>A dynamic domain semi-Lagrangian method for stochastic Vlasov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a dynamic domain semi-Lagrangian method for stochastic Vlasov equations driven by transport noises, which arise in plasma physics and astrophysics. This method combines the volume-preserving property of stochastic characteristics with a dynamic domain adaptation strategy and a reconstruction procedure. It offers a substantial reduction in computational costs compared to the traditional semi-Lagrangian techniques for stochastic problems. Furthermore, we present the first-order convergence analysis of the proposed method, partially addressing the conjecture in the work [C.-E. Br\'{e}hier and D. Cohen, J. Comput. Dyn., 2024] on the convergence order of numerical methods for stochastic Vlasov equations. Several numerical tests are provided to show good performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Rationally presented metric spaces and complexity, the case of the space of uniformly continuous real functions on a compact interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the notion of {\em rational presentation of a complete metric space} in order to study metric spaces from the algorithmic complexity point of view. In this setting, we study some presentations of the space $\czu$ of uniformly continuous real functions over [0,1] with the usual norm: $\norme{f}_{\infty} = {\bf Sup} \{ \abs{f(x)} ; \;0 \leq x \leq 1\}.$ This allows us to have a comparison of a global kind between complexity notions attached to these presentations. In particular, we get a generalisation of Hoover's results concerning the {\sl Weierstrass approximation theorem in polynomial time}. We get also a generalisation of previous results on analytic functions which are computable in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Linearized Localized Orthogonal Decomposition for Quasilinear Nonmonotone Elliptic PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze a multiscale method for a class of quasilinear elliptic problems of nonmonotone type with spatially multiscale coefficient. The numerical approach is inspired by the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition (LOD), so that we do not require structural assumptions such as periodicity or scale separation and only need minimal regularity assumptions on the coefficient.To construct the multiscale space, we solve linear fine-scale problems on small local subdomains, for which we consider two different linearization techniques. For both, we present a rigorous well-posedness analysis and convergence estimates in the $H^1$-semi norm. We compare and discuss theoretically and numerically the performance of our strategies for different linearization points. Numerical experiments underline the theoretical findings and illustrate the applicability of the method.</description>

      <title>Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks with Encoder-Decoder for Time-Dependent Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear time-dependent partial differential equations are essential in modeling complex phenomena across diverse fields, yet they pose significant challenges due to their computational complexity, especially in higher dimensions. This study explores Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks within an encoder-decoder framework, integrating Variational Quantum Circuits into Gated Recurrent Units and Long Short-Term Memory networks. Using this architecture, the model efficiently compresses high-dimensional spatiotemporal data into a compact latent space, facilitating more efficient temporal evolution. We evaluate the algorithms on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, Burgers' equation, the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion system, and the three dimensional Michaelis-Menten reaction-diffusion equation. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the quantum-based algorithms in capturing nonlinear dynamics, handling high-dimensional spaces, and providing stable solutions, highlighting their potential as an innovative tool in solving challenging and complex systems.</description>

      <title>A CFL condition for the finite cell method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immersed boundary finite element methods allow the user to bypass the potentially troublesome task of boundary-conforming mesh generation. However, they suffer from the influence of cut elements, i.e., elements that are intersected by the physical domain boundaries. When combined with explicit time integration, poorly cut elements with little support in the physical domain have a detrimental effect on the critical time step size, thereby hampering the application of immersed boundary methods to wave propagation simulations. In this paper, we investigate the stabilizing effect of the finite cell method concerning explicit time integration. Starting with an analytical solution of an example with one degree of freedom, we systematically study the influence of $\alpha$-stabilization on the maximum eigenvalue and thus on the critical time step size. The analysis is then complemented by a numerical study of an example with one element and an increasing polynomial degree. We demonstrate that the critical time step size does not decrease below a certain limit, even when further reducing the cut fraction of the element. This minimum critical time step size is controlled by the chosen $\alpha$ value and becomes less severe for higher dimensions. Increasing the polynomial degree has little effect on the degradation of the minimum critical time step size. Finally, we provide an estimate of the minimum critical time step size depending on the chosen stabilization parameter $\alpha$ and the dimension of the problem. Based on this estimate, we propose a modified CFL condition for the finite cell method, the validity of which we demonstrate on a numerical example of a perforated plate.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Physics Informed Neural Networks for Linear Inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems arise almost everywhere in science and engineering where we need to infer on a quantity from indirect observation. The cases of medical, biomedical, and industrial imaging systems are the typical examples. A very high overview of classification of the inverse problems method can be: i) Analytical, ii) Regularization, and iii) Bayesian inference methods. Even if there are straight links between them, we can say that the Bayesian inference based methods are the most powerful, as they give the possibility of accounting for prior knowledge and can account for errors and uncertainties in general. One of the main limitations stay in computational costs in particular for high dimensional imaging systems. Neural Networks (NN), and in particular Deep NNs (DNN), have been considered as a way to push farther this limit. Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN) concept integrates physical laws with deep learning techniques to enhance the speed, accuracy and efficiency of the above mentioned problems.
  In this work, a new Bayesian framework for the concept of PINN (BPINN) is presented and discussed which includes the deterministic one if we use the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation framework. We consider two cases of supervised and unsupervised for training step, obtain the expressions of the posterior probability of the unknown variables, and deduce the posterior laws of the NN's parameters. We also discuss about the challenges of implementation of these methods in real applications.</description>

      <title>Variable aggregation for nonlinear optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variable aggregation has been largely studied as an important pre-solve algorithm for optimization of linear and mixed-integer programs. Although some nonlinear solvers and algebraic modeling languages implement variable aggregation as a pre-solve, the impact it can have on constrained nonlinear programs is unexplored. In this work, we formalize variable aggregation as a pre-solve algorithm to develop reduced-space formulations of nonlinear programs. A novel approximate maximum variable aggregation strategy is developed to aggregate as many variables as possible. Furthermore, aggregation strategies that preserve the problem structure are compared against approximate maximum aggregation. Our results show that variable aggregation can generally help to improve the convergence reliability of nonlinear programs. It can also help in reducing total solve time. However, Hessian evaluation can become a bottleneck if aggregation significantly increases the number of variables appearing nonlinearly in many constraints.</description>

      <title>New twofold saddle-point formulations for Biot poroelasticity with porosity-dependent permeability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose four-field and five-field Hu--Washizu-type mixed formulations for nonlinear poroelasticity -- a coupled fluid diffusion and solid deformation process -- considering that the permeability depends on a linear combination between fluid pressure and dilation. As the determination of the physical strains is necessary, the first formulation is written in terms of the primal unknowns of solid displacement and pore fluid pressure as well as the poroelastic stress and the infinitesimal strain, and it considers strongly symmetric Cauchy stresses. The second formulation imposes stress symmetry in a weak sense and it requires the additional unknown of solid rotation tensor. We study the unique solvability of the problem using the Banach fixed-point theory, properties of twofold saddle-point problems, and the Banach--Ne\v{c}as--Babu\v{s}ka theory. We propose monolithic Galerkin discretisations based on conforming Arnold--Winther for poroelastic stress and displacement, and either PEERS or Arnold--Falk--Winther finite element families for the stress-displacement-rotation field variables. The wellposedness of the discrete problem is established as well, and we show a priori error estimates in the natural norms. Some numerical examples are provided to confirm the rates of convergence predicted by the theory, and we also illustrate the use of the formulation in some typical tests in Biot poroelasticity.</description>

      <title>Finite Element Operator Network for Solving Elliptic-type parametric PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underlie our understanding and prediction of natural phenomena across numerous fields, including physics, engineering, and finance. However, solving parametric PDEs is a complex task that necessitates efficient numerical methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for solving parametric PDEs using a Finite Element Operator Network (FEONet). Our proposed method leverages the power of deep learning in conjunction with traditional numerical methods, specifically the finite element method, to solve parametric PDEs in the absence of any paired input-output training data. We performed various experiments on several benchmark problems and confirmed that our approach has demonstrated excellent performance across various settings and environments, proving its versatility in terms of accuracy, generalization, and computational flexibility. While our method is not meshless, the FEONet framework shows potential for application in various fields where PDEs play a crucial role in modeling complex domains with diverse boundary conditions and singular behavior. Furthermore, we provide theoretical convergence analysis to support our approach, utilizing finite element approximation in numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Uniform multi-penalty regularization for linear ill-posed inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines, in the framework of variational regularization methods, a multi-penalty regularization approach which builds upon the Uniform PENalty (UPEN) method, previously proposed by the authors for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data processing. The paper introduces two iterative methods, UpenMM and GUpenMM, formulated within the Majorization-Minimization (MM) framework. These methods are designed to identify appropriate regularization parameters and solutions for linear inverse problems utilizing multi-penalty regularization. The paper demonstrates the convergence of these methods and illustrates their potential through numerical examples in one and two-dimensional scenarios, showing the practical utility of point-wise regularization terms in solving various inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Optimal approximation of infinite-dimensional holomorphic functions II: recovery from i.i.d. pointwise samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinite-dimensional, holomorphic functions have been studied in detail over the last several decades, due to their relevance to parametric differential equations and computational uncertainty quantification. The approximation of such functions from finitely many samples is of particular interest, due to the practical importance of constructing surrogate models to complex mathematical models of physical processes. In a previous work, [6] we studied the approximation of so-called Banach-valued, $(\boldsymbol{b},\varepsilon)$-holomorphic functions on the infinite-dimensional hypercube $[-1,1]^{\mathbb{N}}$ from $m$ (potentially adaptive) samples. In particular, we derived lower bounds for the adaptive $m$-widths for classes of such functions, which showed that certain algebraic rates of the form $m^{1/2-1/p}$ are the best possible regardless of the sampling-recovery pair. In this work, we continue this investigation by focusing on the practical case where the samples are pointwise evaluations drawn identically and independently from a probability measure. Specifically, for Hilbert-valued $(\boldsymbol{b},\varepsilon)$-holomorphic functions, we show that the same rates can be achieved (up to a small polylogarithmic or algebraic factor) for essentially arbitrary tensor-product Jacobi (ultraspherical) measures. Our reconstruction maps are based on least squares and compressed sensing procedures using the corresponding orthonormal Jacobi polynomials. In doing so, we strengthen and generalize past work that has derived weaker nonuniform guarantees for the uniform and Chebyshev measures (and corresponding polynomials) only. We also extend various best $s$-term polynomial approximation error bounds to arbitrary Jacobi polynomial expansions. Overall, we demonstrate that i.i.d.\ pointwise samples are near-optimal for the recovery of infinite-dimensional, holomorphic functions.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Picard approximations overcome the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of general semilinear PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neufeld and Wu (arXiv:2310.12545) developed a multilevel Picard (MLP) algorithm which can approximately solve general semilinear parabolic PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities, allowing also for coefficient functions of the corresponding PDE to be non-constant. By introducing a particular stochastic fixed-point equation (SFPE) motivated by the Feynman-Kac representation and the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula and identifying the first and second component of the unique fixed-point of the SFPE with the unique viscosity solution of the PDE and its gradient, they proved convergence of their algorithm. However, it remained an open question whether the proposed MLP schema in arXiv:2310.12545 does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we prove that the MLP algorithm in arXiv:2310.12545 indeed can overcome the curse of dimensionality, i.e. that its computational complexity only grows polynomially in the dimension $d\in \mathbb{N}$ and the reciprocal of the accuracy $\varepsilon$, under some suitable assumptions on the nonlinear part of the corresponding PDE.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-preserving IMEX schemes for the Euler equations of non-ideal gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze schemes based on a general Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) time discretization for the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics, showing that they are asymptotic-preserving (AP) in the low Mach number limit. The analysis is carried out for a general equation of state (EOS). We consider both a single asymptotic length scale and two length scales. We then show that, when coupling these time discretizations with a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) space discretization with appropriate fluxes, a numerical method effective for a wide range of Mach numbers is obtained. A number of benchmarks for ideal gases and their non-trivial extension to non-ideal EOS validate the performed analysis.</description>

      <title>Extending Irksome: improvements in automated Runge--Kutta time stepping for finite element methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Irksome is a library based on the Unified Form Language (UFL) that enables automated generation of Runge--Kutta methods for time-stepping finite element spatial discretizations of partial differential equations (PDE). Allowing users to express semidiscrete forms of PDE, it generates UFL representations for the stage-coupled variational problems to be solved at each time step. The Firedrake package then generates efficient code for evaluating these variational problems and allows users a wide range of options to deploy efficient algebraic solvers in PETSc.
  In this paper, we describe several recent advances in Irksome. These include alternate formulations of the Runge--Kutta time-stepping methods and optimized support for diagonally implicit (DIRK) methods. Additionally, we present new and improved tools for building preconditioners for the resulting linear and linearized systems, demonstrating that these can lead to efficient approaches for solving fully implicit Runge-Kutta discretizations.
  The new features are demonstrated through a sequence of computational examples demonstrating the high-level interface and obtained solver performance.</description>

      <title>Machine learning of continuous and discrete variational ODEs with convergence guarantee and uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article introduces a method to learn dynamical systems that are governed by Euler--Lagrange equations from data. The method is based on Gaussian process regression and identifies continuous or discrete Lagrangians and is, therefore, structure preserving by design. A rigorous proof of convergence as the distance between observation data points converges to zero is provided. Next to convergence guarantees, the method allows for quantification of model uncertainty, which can provide a basis of adaptive sampling techniques. We provide efficient uncertainty quantification of any observable that is linear in the Lagrangian, including of Hamiltonian functions (energy) and symplectic structures, which is of interest in the context of system identification. The article overcomes major practical and theoretical difficulties related to the ill-posedness of the identification task of (discrete) Lagrangians through a careful design of geometric regularisation strategies and through an exploit of a relation to convex minimisation problems in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Fully guaranteed and computable error bounds on the energy for periodic Kohn-Sham equations with convex density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we derive fully guaranteed error bounds for the energy of convex nonlinear mean-field models. These results apply in particular to Kohn-Sham equations with convex density functionals, which includes the reduced Hartree-Fock (rHF) model, as well as the Kohn-Sham model with exact exchange-density functional (which is unfortunately not explicit and therefore not usable in practice). We then decompose the obtained bounds into two parts, one depending on the chosen discretization and one depending on the number of iterations performed in the self-consistent algorithm used to solve the nonlinear eigenvalue problem, paving the way for adaptive refinement strategies. The accuracy of the bounds is demonstrated on a series of test cases, including a Silicon crystal and an Hydrogen Fluoride molecule simulated with the rHF model and discretized with planewaves. We also show that, although not anymore guaranteed, the error bounds remain very accurate for a Silicon crystal simulated with the Kohn-Sham model using nonconvex exchangecorrelation functionals of practical interest.</description>

      <title>Adaptive higher order reversible integrators for memory efficient deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The depth of networks plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of deep learning. However, the memory requirement for backpropagation scales linearly with the number of layers, which leads to memory bottlenecks during training. Moreover, deep networks are often unable to handle time-series data appearing at irregular intervals. These issues can be resolved by considering continuous-depth networks based on the neural ODE framework in combination with reversible integration methods that allow for variable time-steps. Reversibility of the method ensures that the memory requirement for training is independent of network depth, while variable time-steps are required for assimilating time-series data on irregular intervals. However, at present, there are no known higher-order reversible methods with this property. High-order methods are especially important when a high level of accuracy in learning is required or when small time-steps are necessary due to large errors in time integration of neural ODEs, for instance in context of complex dynamical systems such as Kepler systems and molecular dynamics. The requirement of small time-steps when using a low-order method can significantly increase the computational cost of training as well as inference. In this work, we present an approach for constructing high-order reversible methods that allow adaptive time-stepping. Our numerical tests show the advantages in computational speed when applied to the task of learning dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Decoupled finite element methods for a fourth-order exterior differential equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes novel decoupled finite element methods for a fourth-order exterior differential equation. Based on differential complexes and the Helmholtz decomposition, the fourth-order exterior differential equation is decomposed into two second-order exterior differential equations and one generalized Stokes equation. A key advantage of this decoupled formulation is that it avoids the use of quotient spaces. A family of conforming finite element methods are developed for the decoupled formulation. Numerical results are provided for verifying the decoupled finite element methods of the biharmonic equation in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Convexification With Viscosity Term for an Inverse Problem of Tikhonov</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1965 A.N. Tikhonov, the founder of the theory of Ill-Posed and Inverse Problems, has posed an coefficient inverse problem of the recovery of the unknown electric conductivity coefficient from measurements of the back reflected electrical signal. In the geophysical application targeted by Tikhonov, this coefficient depends only on the depth and characterizes the electrical conductivity of the ground. The goal of this paper is to construct for this problem a version of the globally convergent convexification numerical method for this problem. In this version, the viscosity term is introduced. A Carleman estimate allows to prove global convergence of this method.</description>

      <title>A novel dual-decomposition method for non-convex two-stage stochastic mixed-integer quadratically constrained quadratic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09872v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the novel p-branch-and-bound method for solving two-stage stochastic programming problems whose deterministic equivalents are represented by non-convex mixed-integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming (MIQCQP) models. The precision of the solution generated by the p-branch-and-bound method can be arbitrarily adjusted by altering the value of the precision factor p. The proposed method combines two key techniques. The first one, named p-Lagrangian decomposition, generates a mixed-integer relaxation of a dual problem with a separable structure for a primal non-convex MIQCQP problem. The second one is a version of the classical dual decomposition approach that is applied to solve the Lagrangian dual problem and ensures that integrality and non-anticipativity conditions are met once the optimal solution is obtained. This paper also presents a comparative analysis of the p-branch-and-bound method efficiency considering two alternative solution methods for the dual problems as a subroutine. These are the proximal bundle method and Frank-Wolfe progressive hedging. The latter algorithm relies on the interpolation of linearisation steps similar to those taken in the Frank-Wolfe method as an inner loop in the classic progressive hedging. The p-branch-and-bound method's efficiency was tested on randomly generated instances and demonstrated superior performance over commercial solver Gurobi.</description>

      <title>Neural Green's Operators for Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces neural Green's operators (NGOs), a novel neural operator network architecture that learns the solution operator for a parametric family of linear partial differential equations (PDEs). Our construction of NGOs is derived directly from the Green's formulation of such a solution operator. Similar to deep operator networks (DeepONets) and variationally mimetic operator networks (VarMiONs), NGOs constitutes an expansion of the solution to the PDE in terms of basis functions, that is returned from a sub-network, contracted with coefficients, that are returned from another sub-network. However, in accordance with the Green's formulation, NGOs accept weighted averages of the input functions, rather than sampled values thereof, as is the case in DeepONets and VarMiONs. Application of NGOs to canonical linear parametric PDEs shows that, while they remain competitive with DeepONets, VarMiONs and Fourier neural operators when testing on data that lie within the training distribution, they robustly generalize when testing on finer-scale data generated outside of the training distribution. Furthermore, we show that the explicit representation of the Green's function that is returned by NGOs enables the construction of effective preconditioners for numerical solvers for PDEs.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Simulation of a Fluid-Heat System in a Thin, Rough Layer in Contact With a Solid Bulk Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effective coupling between heat and fluid dynamics within a thin fluid layer in contact with a solid structure via a rough surface. Moreover, the opposing vertical surfaces of the thin layer are in relative motion. This setup is particularly relevant to grinding processes, where cooling lubricants interact with the rough surface of a rotating grinding wheel. The resulting model is non-linearly coupled through(i) temperature-dependent viscosity and (ii) convective heat transport. The underlying geometry is highly heterogeneous due to the thin, rough surface characterized by a small parameter representing both the height of the layer and the periodicity of the roughness. We analyze this non-linear system for existence, uniqueness, and energy estimates and study the limit behavior within the framework of two-scale convergence in thin domains. In this limit, we derive an effective interface model in 3D (a line in 2D) for the heat and fluid interactions inside the fluid. We implement the system numerically and validate the limit problem through direct comparison with the micromodel. Additionally, we investigate the influence of the temperature-dependent viscosity and various geometrical configurations via simulation experiments. The corresponding numerical code is freely available on GitHub.</description>
