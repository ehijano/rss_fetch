      <title>Access Point Deployment for Localizing Accuracy and User Rate in Cell-Free Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolving next-generation mobile networks is designed to provide ubiquitous coverage and networked sensing. With utility of multi-view sensing and multi-node joint transmission, cell-free is a promising technique to realize this prospect. This paper aims to tackle the problem of access point (AP) deployment in cell-free systems to balance the sensing accuracy and user rate. By merging the D-optimality with Euclidean criterion, a novel integrated metric is proposed to be the objective function for both max-sum and max-min problems, which respectively guarantee the overall and lowest performance in multi-user communication and target tracking scenario. To solve the corresponding high dimensional non-convex multi-objective problem, the Soft actor-critic (SAC) is utilized to avoid risk of local optimal result. Numerical results demonstrate that proposed SAC-based APs deployment method achieves $20\%$ of overall performance and $120\%$ of lowest performance.</description>

      <title>When Graph Meets Retrieval Augmented Generation for Wireless Networks: A Tutorial and Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of next-generation networking technologies underscores their transformative role in revolutionizing modern communication systems, enabling faster, more reliable, and highly interconnected solutions. However, such development has also brought challenges to network optimizations. Thanks to the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years, tools including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) have been developed and applied in various fields including networking, and have shown their effectiveness. Taking one step further, the integration of knowledge graphs into RAG frameworks further enhanced the performance of RAG in networking applications such as Intent-Driven Networks (IDNs) and spectrum knowledge maps by providing more contextually relevant responses through more accurate retrieval of related network information. This paper introduces the RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs in its database and explores such framework's application in networking. We begin by exploring RAG's applications in networking and the limitations of conventional RAG and present the advantages that knowledge graphs' structured knowledge representation brings to the retrieval and generation processes. Next, we propose a detailed GraphRAG-based framework for networking, including a step-by-step tutorial on its construction. Our evaluation through a case study on channel gain prediction demonstrates GraphRAG's enhanced capability in generating accurate, contextually rich responses, surpassing traditional RAG models. Finally, we discuss key future directions for applying knowledge-graphs-empowered RAG frameworks in networking, including robust updates, mitigation of hallucination, and enhanced security measures for networking applications.</description>

      <title>Reducing Traffic Wastage in Video Streaming via Bandwidth-Efficient Bitrate Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bitrate adaptation (also known as ABR) is a crucial technique to improve the quality of experience (QoE) for video streaming applications. However, existing ABR algorithms suffer from severe traffic wastage, which refers to the traffic cost of downloading the video segments that users do not finally consume, for example, due to early departure or video skipping. In this paper, we carefully formulate the dynamics of buffered data volume (BDV), a strongly correlated indicator of traffic wastage, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first time to rigorously clarify the effect of downloading plans on potential wastage. To reduce wastage while keeping a high QoE, we present a bandwidth-efficient bitrate adaptation algorithm (named BE-ABR), achieving consistently low BDV without distinct QoE losses. Specifically, we design a precise, time-aware transmission delay prediction model over the Transformer architecture, and develop a fine-grained buffer control scheme. Through extensive experiments conducted on emulated and real network environments including WiFi, 4G, and 5G, we demonstrate that BE-ABR performs well in both QoE and bandwidth savings, enabling a 60.87\% wastage reduction and a comparable, or even better, QoE, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization of Age of Incorrect Information with Dynamic Epistemic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed medium access schemes have a key advantage in anomaly tracking applications, as individual sensors know their own observations and can exploit them to reduce their Age of Incorrect Information (AoII). However, the risk of collisions has so far limited their performance. We present Dynamic Epistemic Logic for Tracking Anomalies (DELTA), a medium access protocol that limits collisions and minimizes AoII in anomaly reporting over dense networks. This is achieved by a process of inferring AoII from plain Age of Information (AoI). In a network scenario with randomly generated anomalies, the individual AoII for each sensor is known only to itself, but all nodes can infer its AoI by simply tracking the transmission process. Thus, we adopt an approach based on dynamic epistemic logic, which allows individual nodes to infer how their AoII values rank among the entire network by exploiting public information such as the AoI and the identity of transmitting nodes. We analyze the resulting DELTA protocol both from a theoretical standpoint and with Monte Carlo simulation, showing that our approach is significantly more efficient and robust than basic random access, while outperforming state-of-the-art scheduled schemes by at least 30%.</description>

      <title>RIS-aided Wireless-Powered Backscatter Communications for Sustainable Internet of Underground Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless-powered underground sensor networks (WPUSNs), which enable wireless energy transfer to sensors located underground, is a promising approach for establishing sustainable internet of underground things (IoUT). To support urgent information transmission and improve resource utilization within WPUSNs, backscatter communication (BC) is introduced, resulting in what is known as wireless-powered backscatter underground sensor networks (WPBUSNs). Nevertheless, the performance of WPBUSNs is significantly limited by severe channel impairments caused by the underground soil and the blockage of direct links. To overcome this challenge, in this work, we propose integrating reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with WPBUSNs, leading to the development of RIS-aided WPBUSNs. We begin by reviewing the recent advancements in BC-WPUSNs and RIS. Then, we propose a general architecture of RIS-aided WPBUSNs across various IoUT scenarios, and discuss its advantages and implementation challenges. To illustrate the effectiveness of RIS-aided WPBUSNs, we focus on a realistic farming case study, demonstrating that our proposed framework outperforms the three benchmarks in terms of the sum throughput. Finally, we discuss the open challenges and future research directions for translating this study into practical IoUT applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal Routing and Link Configuration for Covert Heterogeneous Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nodes in contemporary radio networks often have multiple interfaces available for communication: WiFi, cellular, LoRa, Zigbee, etc. This motivates understanding both link and network configuration when multiple communication modalities with vastly different capabilities are available to each node. In conjunction, covertness or the hiding of radio communications is often a significant concern in both commercial and military wireless networks. We consider the optimal routing problem in wireless networks when nodes have multiple interfaces available and intend to hide the presence of the transmission from attentive and capable adversaries. We first consider the maximization of the route capacity given an end-to-end covertness constraint against a single adversary and we find a polynomial-time algorithm for optimal route selection and link configuration. We further provide optimal polynomial-time algorithms for two important extensions: (i) statistical uncertainty during optimization about the channel state information for channels from system nodes to the adversary; and, (ii) maintaining covertness against multiple adversaries. Numerical results are included to demonstrate the gains of employing heterogeneous radio resources and to compare the performance of the proposed approach versus alternatives.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Split Federated Learning: Convergence Analysis and System Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI models expand in size, it has become increasingly challenging to deploy federated learning (FL) on resource-constrained edge devices. To tackle this issue, split federated learning (SFL) has emerged as an FL framework with reduced workload on edge devices via model splitting; it has received extensive attention from the research community in recent years. Nevertheless, most prior works on SFL focus only on a two-tier architecture without harnessing multi-tier cloudedge computing resources. In this paper, we intend to analyze and optimize the learning performance of SFL under multi-tier systems. Specifically, we propose the hierarchical SFL (HSFL) framework and derive its convergence bound. Based on the theoretical results, we formulate a joint optimization problem for model splitting (MS) and model aggregation (MA). To solve this rather hard problem, we then decompose it into MS and MA subproblems that can be solved via an iterative descending algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the tailored algorithm can effectively optimize MS and MA for SFL within virtually any multi-tier system.</description>

      <title>Lazy Eye Inspection: Capturing the State of Happy Eyeballs Implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Happy Eyeballs (HE) started out by describing a mechanism that prefers IPv6 connections while ensuring a fast fallback to IPv4 when IPv6 fails. The IETF is currently working on the third version of HE. While the standards include recommendations for HE parameters choices, it is up to the client and OS to implement HE. In this paper we investigate the state of HE in various clients, particularly web browsers and recursive resolvers. We introduce a framework to analyze and measure client's HE implementations and parameter choices. According to our evaluation, only Safari supports all HE features. Safari is also the only client implementation in our study that uses a dynamic IPv4 connection attempt delay, a resolution delay, and interlaces addresses. We further show that problems with the DNS A record lookup can even delay and interrupt the network connectivity despite a fully functional IPv6 setup with Chrome and Firefox. We publish our testbed measurement framework and a web-based tool to test HE properties on arbitrary browsers.</description>

      <title>Federated Split Learning with Model Pruning and Gradient Quantization in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a paradigm of distributed machine learning, federated learning typically requires all edge devices to train a complete model locally. However, with the increasing scale of artificial intelligence models, the limited resources on edge devices often become a bottleneck for efficient fine-tuning. To address this challenge, federated split learning (FedSL) implements collaborative training across the edge devices and the server through model splitting. In this paper, we propose a lightweight FedSL scheme, that further alleviates the training burden on resource-constrained edge devices by pruning the client-side model dynamicly and using quantized gradient updates to reduce computation overhead. Additionally, we apply random dropout to the activation values at the split layer to reduce communication overhead. We conduct theoretical analysis to quantify the convergence performance of the proposed scheme. Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed lightweight FedSL in wireless network environments.</description>
