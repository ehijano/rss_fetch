      <title>Suppressing spurious oscillations and particle noise in particle-in-cell simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are essential for studying kinetic plasma processes, but they often suffer from statistical noise, especially in plasmas with fast flows. We have also found that the typical central difference scheme used in PIC codes to solve Maxwell's equations produces spurious oscillations near discontinuities, which can lead to unphysical solutions. In this work, we present numerical techniques to address these challenges within the semi-implicit PIC code FLEKS, which is based on the Gauss's Law-satisfying Energy-Conserving Semi-Implicit Particle-in-Cell method (GL-ECSIM). First, we introduce a Lax-Friedrichs-type diffusion term with a flux limiter into the Maxwell solver to suppress unphysical oscillations near discontinuities. Second, we propose a novel approach for calculating the current density in the comoving frame, which significantly reduces particle noise in simulations with fast plasma flows. Numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in mitigating spurious oscillations and noise in shock and magnetic reconnection simulations.</description>

      <title>Accurate Reduced Floating-Point Precision Implicit Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work describes methodologies to successfully implement the Implicit Monte Carlo (IMC) scheme for thermal radiative transfer in reduced-precision floating-point arithmetic. The methods used can be broadly categorized into scaling approaches and floating-point arithmetic manipulations. Scaling approaches entail re-scaling values to ensure computations stay within a representable range. Floating-point arithmetic manipulations involve changes to order of operations and alternative summation algorithms to minimize errors in calculations. The Implicit Monte Carlo method has nonlinear dependencies, quantities spanning many orders of magnitude, and a sensitive coupling between radiation and material energy that provide significant difficulties to accurate reduced-precision implementations. Results from reduced and higher-precision implementations of IMC solving the Su &amp; Olson volume source benchmark problem are compared to demonstrate the accuracy of a correctly implemented reduced-precision IMC code. We show that the scaling approaches and floating-point manipulations used in this work can produce solutions with similar accuracy using half-precision data types as compared to a standard double-precision implementation.</description>

      <title>Physical Constraint Preserving Higher Order Finite Volume Schemes for Divergence-Free Astrophysical MHD and RMHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher order finite volume schemes for magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) are very valuable because they allow us to carry out astrophysical simulations with very high accuracy. However, astrophysical problems sometimes have unusually large Mach numbers, exceptionally high Lorentz factors and very strong magnetic fields. All these effects cause higher order codes to become brittle and prone to code crashes. In this paper we document physical constraint preserving (PCP) methods for treating numerical MHD and RMHD. While unnecessary for standard problems, for stringent astrophysical problems these methods show their value. We describe higher order methods that allow divergence-free evolution of the magnetic field. We present a novel two-dimensional Riemann solver. This two-dimensional Riemann solver plays a key role in the design of PCP schemes for MHD and RMHD. We present a very simple PCP formulation and show how it is amalgamated with the evolution of face-centered magnetic fields. The methods presented here are time-explicit and do not add much to the computational cost. We show that the methods meet their design accuracies and work well on problems that would otherwise be considered too extreme for typical higher order Godunov methods of the type used in computational astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Mechanism and Stability of Li-Dynamics in Amorphous Li-Ti-P-S Based Mixed Ionic-Electronic Conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed ionic-electronic conductor (MIEC) exhibit both high ionic and electronic conductivity to improve the battery performance. In this work, we investigate the mechanism and stability of transport channels in recently developed our MIEC material, amorphous Ti-doped lithium phosphorus sulfide (LPS), using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a 99\% accurate machine-learning force field (MLFF) trained on \textit{ab-initio} MD data. The achieved MLFF helps efficient large-scale MD simulations on LPS with three Ti concentrations (10\%, 20\%, and 30\%) and six temperatures (25$^\mathrm{o}$C to 225$^\mathrm{o}$C) to calculate ionic conductivity, activation energy, Li-ion transport mechanism, and configurational entropy. Results show that ionic conductivities and activation energies are consistent with our recent experimental values. Moreover, Li-ion transport occurs via free-volume diffusion facilitated by the formation of disordered Li-S polyhedra. Enhanced stability of transport channels at 10\% and 20\% Ti doping, compared to 0\% and 30\%, is observed through the analysis of the vibrational and configurational entropy of these disordered Li-S polyhedra. Overall, this study highlights the utility of MLFF-based large-scale MD simulations in explaining the transport mechanism and its stability of Li-ion in Ti doped LPS electrolyte with significant computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Integral Decimation Method for Quantum Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to numerically evaluate functional integrals called integral decimation (ID). It constructs a separable decomposition of the integrand as a spectral tensor train (STT), a continuous generalization of the matrix product state. ID builds the STT by mapping the integrand to an auxiliary many-body wavefunction that evolves in time from an initially unentangled state. Each body-ordered term of the action corresponds to a quantum gate, applied to the state during its evolution. The gates generate entanglement, and decimation during the gate sequence compresses the integral, alleviating memory bottlenecks in high dimensional integration. In the application of ID to moment-generating and partition functions, the continuous nature of the STTs allows for analytical differentiation of the result. To demonstrate its versatility, we employ ID to calculate the partition function of a classical XY model and to solve a non-Markovian quantum relaxation problem. By circumventing the barren plateau problem that limited our earlier STT-based approaches to quantum relaxation [J. Chem. Phys. 161, 234111 (2024)], ID enables high-accuracy simulations of quantum dynamics in systems as large as a 40-site chain.</description>

      <title>The QUEST Database of Highly-Accurate Excitation Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report theoretical best estimates of vertical transition energies (VTEs) for a large number of excited states and molecules: the \textsc{quest} database. This database includes 1489 \emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ VTEs (731 singlets, 233 doublets, 461 triplets, and 64 quartets) for both valence and Rydberg transitions occurring in molecules containing from 1 to 16 non-hydrogen atoms. \textsc{Quest} also includes a significant list of VTEs for states characterized by a partial or genuine double-excitation character, known to be particularly challenging for many computational methods. The vast majority of the reported values are deemed chemically-accurate, that is, are within $\pm0.05$ eV of the FCI/\emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ estimate. This allows for a balanced assessment of the performance of popular excited-state methodologies. We report the results of such benchmarks for various single- and multi-reference wavefunction approaches, and provide extensive supporting information allowing testing of other models. All corresponding data associated with the \textsc{quest} database, along with analysis tools, can be found in the associated \textsc{GitHub} repository at the following URL: https://github.com/pfloos/QUESTDB.</description>

      <title>Automatic differentiation for Lax-Wendroff-type discretizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lax-Wendroff methods combined with discontinuous Galerkin/flux reconstruction spatial discretization provide a high-order, single-stage, quadrature-free method for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. In this work, we introduce automatic differentiation (AD) in the element-local time average flux computation step (the predictor step) of Lax-Wendroff methods. The application of AD is similar for methods of any order and does not need positivity corrections during the predictor step. This contrasts with the approximate Lax-Wendroff procedure, which requires different finite difference formulas for different orders of the method and positivity corrections in the predictor step for fluxes that can only be computed on admissible states. The method is Jacobian-free and problem-independent, allowing direct application to any physical flux function. Numerical experiments demonstrate the order and positivity preservation of the method. Additionally, performance comparisons indicate that the wall-clock time of automatic differentiation is always on par with the approximate Lax-Wendroff method.</description>

      <title>SIMSHIFT: A Benchmark for Adapting Neural Surrogates to Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer significant performance degradation when evaluated on unseen problem configurations, such as novel material types or structural dimensions. Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling, sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations, together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios.

      <title>Event generation and consistency tests with sliced Wasserstein distance in high-energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of modern high-energy physics research, there is a growing emphasis on utilizing deep learning techniques to optimize event simulation, thereby expanding the statistical sample size for more accurate physical analysis. Traditional simulation methods often encounter challenges when dealing with complex physical processes and high-dimensional data distributions, resulting in slow performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a solution based on deep learning with the sliced Wasserstein distance as the loss function. By employing an advanced transformer learning architecture, we initiate the learning process from a Monte Carlo sample and generate high-dimensional data. Through the integration of the sliced Wasserstein distance with the permutation test, we introduce a novel, statistically rigorous, and more sensitive metric for assessing the distribution differences, which significantly outperforms other metrics in detecting subtle distributional shifts, further validating its effectiveness for precise evaluation in high-energy physics generative models and high-dimensional consistency test. The generated data samples maintain all the original distribution features from a limited number of training samples, as evidenced by their successful passage of all common consistency tests using a test sample size of the same order of statistical magnitude. This development opens up new possibilities for improving event simulation and high-dimensional consistency tests in high-energy physics research.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the mystery of enhanced open-circuit voltages in nanotextured perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells have reached power conversion efficiencies that rival those of established silicon photovoltaic technologies. Nanotextures in perovskite solar cells optimise light trapping and scattering, thereby improving optical absorption. In addition, nanotextures have been experimentally shown to enhance electronic performance, in particular, by increasing the open-circuit voltage $V_{\text{OC}}$ -- a phenomenon that, until now, has remained not fully understood. This study investigates the underlying reasons by combining multi-dimensional optical and charge-transport simulations for a single-junction perovskite solar cell. Our results reveal that the increased open-circuit voltage is not driven by optical effects but by the textured geometry itself. For voltages near $V_{\text{OC}}$, texturing one of the absorber/transport layer interfaces increases the imbalance between electron and hole densities in the absorber, thereby reducing Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination, which is the dominant loss mechanism in this study. While idealised solar cells benefit unconditionally from increasing texture height, in realistic cells there is an optimal texture height which maximizes the power conversion efficiency. These findings provide new insights into the opto-electronic advantages of texturing and offer guidance for the design of next-generation textured perovskite-based solar cells, light emitting diodes, and photodetectors.</description>

      <title>DFT+U+J with linear response parameters predicts non-magnetic oxide band gaps with hybrid-functional accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.08487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-principles Hubbard-corrected approximate density-functional theory (DFT+U) is a low-cost, potentially high throughput method of simulating materials, but it has been hampered by empiricism and inconsistent band-gap correction in transition-metal oxides. DFT+U property prediction of non-magnetic systems such as d0 and d10 transition-metal oxides is typically faced with excessively large calculated Hubbard U values, and with difficulty in obtaining acceptable band-gaps and lattice volumes. Meanwhile, Hund's exchange coupling J is an important but often neglected component of DFT+U, and the J parameter has proven challenging to directly calculate by means of linear response. In this work, we provide a revised formula for computing Hund's J using established self-consistent field DFT+U codes. For non-magnetic systems, we introduce a non-approximate technique for calculating U and J simultaneously in such codes, at no additional cost. Using unmodified Quantum ESPRESSO, we assess the resulting values using two different DFT+U functionals incorporating J, namely the widely used DFT+(U-J) and the readily available DFT+U+J. We assess a test set comprising TiO2, ZrO2, HfO2, Cu2O and ZnO, and apply the corrections both to metal and oxygen centered pseudoatomic subspaces. Starting from the PBE functional, we find that DFT+(U-J) is significantly out-performed in band-gap accuracy by DFT+U+J, the mean absolute band-gap error of which matches that of the hybrid functional HSE06. ZnO, a long-standing challenge case for DFT+U, is addressed by means of Zn 4s instead of Zn 3d correction, whereupon the first-principles DFT+U+J band-gap error falls to half of that reported for HSE06, yet remains larger than for PBE0.</description>

      <title>Computation of Magnetohydrodynamic Equilibria with Voigt Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19594v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first numerical investigation of using Voigt regularization as a method for obtaining magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria without the assumption of nested magnetic flux surfaces. Voigt regularization modifies the MHD dynamics by introducing additional terms that vanish in the infinite-time limit, allowing for magnetic reconnection and the formation of magnetic islands, which can overlap and produce field-line chaos. The utility of this approach is demonstrated through numerical solutions of two-dimensional ideal and resistive test problems. Our results show that Voigt regularization can significantly accelerate the convergence to solutions in resistive MHD problems, while also highlighting challenges in applying the method to ideal MHD systems. This research opens up new possibilities for developing more efficient and robust MHD equilibrium solvers, which could contribute to the design and optimization of future fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Field Generation Based on Hybrid Mamba-Transformer with Physics-informed Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11578v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research confronts the challenge of substantial physical equation discrepancies encountered in the generation of spatiotemporal physical fields through data-driven trained models. A spatiotemporal physical field generation model, named HMT-PF, is developed based on the hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture, incorporating unstructured grid information as input. A fine-tuning block, enhanced with physical information, is introduced to effectively reduce the physical equation discrepancies. The physical equation residuals are computed through a point query mechanism for efficient gradient evaluation, then encoded into latent space for refinement. The fine-tuning process employs a self-supervised learning approach to achieve physical consistency while maintaining essential field characteristics. Results show that the hybrid Mamba-Transformer model achieves good performance in generating spatiotemporal fields, while the physics-informed fine-tuning mechanism further reduces significant physical errors effectively. A MSE-R evaluation method is developed to assess the accuracy and realism of physical field generation.</description>
