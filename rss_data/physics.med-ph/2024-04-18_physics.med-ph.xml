      <title>Review of speckle-tracking algorithms for x-ray phase contrast imaging: low dose applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray speckles have been used for a wide variety of experiments, ranging from imaging (and tomography), wavefront sensing, spatial coherence measurements all the way to x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) and ptychography. In the near-field regime, x-ray speckle-grains preserve shape and size under free-space propagation for a static random modulation of the illumination, which permits using them as wavefront markers. The introduction of an object in the modulated field will lead to a displacement of the speckles due to refraction. Retrieving the local displacements enables access to the gradient of the phase-shift induced by the sample. The numerical process to retrieve the phase information is not trivial and numerous algorithms have been developed in the past decade with various advantages and limitations. This review focuses on near-field x-ray speckle phase imaging in the differential mode as described previously, introducing the existing algorithms with their specifications and comparing their performances under various experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Models for High-Quality MR-to-CT Synthesis for Head and Neck Proton Treatment Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent advancements in proton therapy, MR-based treatment planning is gaining momentum to minimize additional radiation exposure compared to traditional CT-based methods. This transition highlights the critical need for accurate MR-to-CT image synthesis, which is essential for precise proton dose calculations. Our research introduces the Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Models (DSBM), an innovative approach for high-quality MR-to-CT synthesis. DSBM learns the nonlinear diffusion processes between MR and CT data distributions. This method improves upon traditional diffusion models by initiating synthesis from the prior distribution rather than the Gaussian distribution, enhancing both generation quality and efficiency. We validated the effectiveness of DSBM on a head and neck cancer dataset, demonstrating its superiority over traditional image synthesis methods through both image-level and dosimetric-level evaluations. The effectiveness of DSBM in MR-based proton treatment planning highlights its potential as a valuable tool in various clinical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Analysis of blurring due to short T2 decay at different resolutions in 23Na MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear magnetic resonance signal from sodium (23Na) nuclei demonstrates a fast bi-exponential T2 decay in biological tissues (T2,short = 0.5-5 ms and T2,long = 10-30 ms). Hence, blurring observed in sodium images acquired with center-out sequences is generally assumed to be dominated by signal attenuation at higher k-space frequencies. Most of the studies in the field primarily focus on the impact of readout duration on blurring but neglect the impact of resolution. In this paper, we examine the blurring effect of short T2 on images at different resolutions. A series of simulations, as well as phantom and in vivo scans were performed at varying resolutions and readout durations in order to evaluate progressive changes in image quality. We demonstrate that, given a fixed readout duration, T2 decay produces distinct blurring effects at different resolutions. Therefore, in addition to voxel size-dependent partial volume effects, the choice of resolution adds additional T2-dependent blurring.</description>

      <title>Learning the Domain Specific Inverse NUFFT for Accelerated Spiral MRI using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for accelerated MRI achieve state-of-the-art results but largely ignore additional speedups possible with noncartesian sampling trajectories. To address this gap, we created a generative diffusion model-based reconstruction algorithm for multi-coil highly undersampled spiral MRI. This model uses conditioning during training as well as frequency-based guidance to ensure consistency between images and measurements. Evaluated on retrospective data, we show high quality (structural similarity &gt; 0.87) in reconstructed images with ultrafast scan times (0.02 seconds for a 2D image). We use this algorithm to identify a set of optimal variable-density spiral trajectories and show large improvements in image quality compared to conventional reconstruction using the non-uniform fast Fourier transform. By combining efficient spiral sampling trajectories, multicoil imaging, and deep learning reconstruction, these methods could enable the extremely high acceleration factors needed for real-time 3D imaging.</description>

      <title>A Computational Model of the Electrically or Acoustically Evoked Compound Action Potential in Cochlear Implant Users with Residual Hearing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: In cochlear implant users with residual acoustic hearing, compound action potentials (CAPs) can be evoked by acoustic (aCAP) or electric (eCAP) stimulation and recorded through the electrodes of the implant. We propose a novel computational model to simulate aCAPs and eCAPs in humans, considering the interaction between combined electric-acoustic stimulation that occurs in the auditory nerve. Methods: The model consists of three components: a 3D finite element method model of an implanted cochlea, a phenomenological single-neuron spiking model for electric-acoustic stimulation, and a physiological multi-compartment neuron model to simulate the individual nerve fiber contributions to the CAP. Results: The CAP morphologies closely resembled those known from humans. The spread of excitation derived from eCAPs by varying the recording electrode along the cochlear implant electrode array was consistent with published human data. The predicted CAP amplitude growth functions largely resembled human data, with deviations in absolute CAP amplitudes for acoustic stimulation. The model reproduced the suppression of eCAPs by simultaneously presented acoustic tone bursts for different masker frequencies and probe stimulation electrodes. Conclusion: The proposed model can simulate CAP responses to electric, acoustic, or combined electric-acoustic stimulation. It considers the dependence on stimulation and recording sites in the cochlea, as well as the interaction between electric and acoustic stimulation in the auditory nerve. Significance: The model enhances comprehension of CAPs and peripheral electric-acoustic interaction. It can be used in the future to investigate objective methods, such as hearing threshold assessment or estimation of neural health through aCAPs or eCAPs.</description>

      <title>The Required Spatial Resolution to Assess Imbalance using Plantar Pressure Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Roughly 1/3 of adults older than 65 fall each year, resulting in more than 3 million emergency room visits, thousands of deaths, and over $50 Billion in direct costs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that 1/3 of falls are preventable with effective mitigation strategies, particularly for imbalance. Therefore, quantification of imbalance is being studied extensively in recent years. In this study we investigate the feasibility of plantar pressure mapping in balance assessment through a healthy human subject study. We used an in-house plantar pressure mapping device with high precision based on Frustrated Total Internal Reflection to measure subjects sway during the Romberg test. Through the measurements obtained from all subjects, we measured the minimum spatial resolution required for plantar pressure mapping devices in assessment of balance. We conclude that most of the current devices in the market lack the requirements for imbalance measurements.</description>
