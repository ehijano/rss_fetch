      <title>Reliability of coherent systems whose operating life is defined by the lifetime and power of the components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider systems whose lifetime is measured by the time of physical degradation of components, as well as the degree of power each component contributes to the system. The lifetimes of the components of the system are random variables. The power that each component contributes to the system is the product of a random variable and a time-decreasing stable function. The operational reliability of these systems is investigated and shown that it is determined by the joint lifetime functions of the order statistics and their concomitants. In addition to general formulas, examples are given using some known life distributions, and graphs of the operation life functions are shown.</description>

      <title>The Wasserstein Space of Stochastic Processes in Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers from different areas have independently defined extensions of the usual weak convergence of laws of stochastic processes with the goal of adequately accounting for the flow of information. Natural approaches are convergence of the Aldous--Knight prediction process, Hellwig's information topology, convergence in adapted distribution in the sense of Hoover--Keisler and the weak topology induced by optimal stopping problems. The first main contribution of this article is that on continuous processes with natural filtrations there exists a canonical adapted weak topology which can be defined by all of these approaches; moreover, the adapted weak topology is metrized by a suitable adapted Wasserstein distance $\mathcal{AW}$.
  While the set of processes with natural filtrations is not complete, we establish that its completion consists precisely of the space ${\rm FP}$ of stochastic processes with general filtrations. We also show that $({\rm FP}, \mathcal{AW})$ exhibits several desirable properties. Specifically, it is Polish, martingales form a closed subset and approximation results such as Donsker's theorem extend to $\mathcal{AW}$.</description>

      <title>The critical velocity of the bullet process appears pathwise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the bullet process, a gun fires bullets in the same direction at independent random speeds. When two bullets collide, they vanish. The critical velocity is the slowest speed the first bullet can take and still have positive probability of surviving forever. We prove that the critical velocity is the $\limsup$ of the speeds of the bullets that survive from the last position in each truncation. This result allows us to prove several properties about the bullet process. Infinitely many bullets survive when the velocity distribution has finite support, and in general there is a zero-one law. We obtain continuity results for the probability of survival with respect to velocity. Along the way we answer a question from arXiv:1709.00789, showing that if a bullet survives, it does so in all but finitely many truncations of the bullet process.</description>

      <title>Hitting probabilities, thermal capacity, and Hausdorff dimension results for the Brownian sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $W= \{W(t): t \in \mathbb{R}_+^N \}$ be an $(N, d)$-Brownian sheet and let $E \subset (0, \infty)^N$ and $F \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be compact sets. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for $W(E)$ to intersect $F$ with positive probability and determine the essential supremum of the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection set $W(E)\cap F$ in terms of the thermal capacity of $E \times F$. This extends the previous results of Khoshnevisan and Xiao (2015) for the Brownian motion and Khoshnevisan and Shi (1999) for the Brownian sheet in the special case when $E \subset (0, \infty)^N$ is an interval.</description>

      <title>Anticipated backward stochastic Volterra integral equations and their applications to nonzero-sum stochastic differential games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the stochastic differential game problem, in this paper we introduce and study a more general class of anticipated backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (anticipated BSVIEs, for short) whose generator includes both pointwise time-advanced functions and average time-advanced functions. The well-posedness and the comparison theorem of anticipated BSVIEs are established, and some regularity results of adapted M-solutions are proved by applying Malliavin calculus, which cover the previous results for BSVIEs. Moreover, by virtue of the duality principle, we present the maximum principle for the nonzero-sum differential game system of stochastic delay Volterra integral equations (SDVIEs, for short) for the first time. As one of the applications of the theorem, a Nash equilibrium point of the linear-quadratic differential game problem of SDVIEs is obtained. It should be pointed out that optimal controls of stochastic Volterra integral equations can be regarded as a special case of our game problem.</description>

      <title>First passage locations for two-dimensional lattice random walks and the bell-shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X_n, Y_n)$ be a two-dimensional diagonal random walk on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$, with transition probabilities depending only on the position of $Y_n$. In this paper, we study its first passage locations $X(\tau_a)$, where $\tau_a$ is the first time $Y_n$ hits level $a \in \mathbb{Z}$. We prove that the probability mass function of appropriately rescaled $X(\tau_a)$ is a convolution of geometric sequences, two-point sequences and an $\mathscr{AM}$-$\mathscr{CM}$ (absolutely monotone then completely monotone) sequence. In particular, rescaled first passage locations have bell-shaped distributions. In order to prove our results, we introduce and study two new classes of rational functions with alternating zeros or poles. We also prove analogous theorems for standard random walks on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and random walks on the honeycomb lattice.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Edge Universality of Orthogonal Polynomial Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the mesoscopic fluctuations at edges of orthogonal polynomial ensembles with both continuous and discrete measures. Our main result is a Central limit Theorem (CLT) for linear statistics at mesoscopic scales. We show that if the recurrence coefficients for the associated orthogonal polynomials are slowly varying, a universal CLT holds. Our primary tool is the resolvent for the truncated Jacobi matrices associated with the orthogonal polynomials. While the Combes-Thomas estimate has been successful in obtaining bulk mesoscopic fluctuations in the literature, it is too rough at the edges. Instead, we prove an estimate for the resolvent of Jacobi matrices with slowly varying entries. Particular examples to which our CLT applies are Jacobi, Laguerre and Gaussian unitary ensembles as well as discrete ensembles from random tilings.</description>

      <title>Poisson representations for tree-indexed Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In~\cite{fgs}, the class of Poisson representable processes was introduced. Several well-known processes were shown not to belong to this class, with examples including both the Curie Weiss model and the Ising model on $ \mathbb{Z}^2 $ for certain choices of parameters. Curiously, it was also shown that all positively associated $ \{ 0,1 \}$-valued Markov chains do belong to this class. In this paper, we interpolate between Markov chains and Ising models by considering tree-indexed Markov chains. In particular, we show that for any finite tree that is not a path, whether or not the corresponding tree-indexed Markov chain is representable always depends on the parameters. Moreover, we give an example of a family of infinite trees such that the corresponding tree-indexed Markov chains are representable for some non-trivial parameters. In addition, we give alternative proofs and arguments and also strengthen several of the results in~\cite{fgs}.</description>

      <title>Mixing for Poisson representable processes and consequences for the Ising model and the contact process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forsstr\"om et al. [8] recently introduced a large class of $\{0,1\}$-valued processes that they named Poisson representable. In addition to deriving several interesting properties for these processes, their main focus was determining which processes are contained in this class.
  In this paper, we derive new characteristics for Poisson representable processes in terms of certain mixing properties. Using these, we argue that neither the upper invariant measure of the supercritical contact process on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ nor the plus state of the Ising model on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ within the phase transition regime is Poisson representable. Moreover, we show that on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$, any non-extremal translation invariant state of the Ising model cannot be Poisson representable. Together, these results provide answers to questions raised in [8].</description>

      <title>On the multidimensional elephant random walk with stops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to investigate the asymptotic behavior of the multidimensional elephant random walk with stops (MERWS). In contrast with the standard elephant random walk, the elephant is allowed to stay on his own position. We prove that the Gram matrix associated with the MERWS, properly normalized, converges almost surely to the product of a deterministic matrix, related to the axes on which the MERWS moves uniformly, and a Mittag-Leffler distribution. It allows us to extend all the results previously established for the one-dimensional elephant random walk with stops. More precisely, in the diffusive and critical regimes, we prove the almost sure convergence of the MERWS. In the superdiffusive regime, we establish the almost sure convergence of the MERWS, properly normalized, to a nondegenerate random vector. We also study the self-normalized asymptotic normality of the MERWS.</description>

      <title>Analytic continuation of time in Brownian motion. Stochastic distributions approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the use of Hida's white noise space theory space theory and spaces of stochastic distributions, we present a detailed analytic continuation theory for classes of Gaussian processes, with focus here on Brownian motion. For the latter, we prove and make use a priori bounds, in the complex plane, for the Hermite functions; as well as a new approach to stochastic distributions. This in turn allows us to present an explicit formula for an analytically continued white noise process, realized this way in complex domain. With the use of the Wick product, we then apply our complex white noise analysis in a derivation of a new realization of Hilbert space-valued stochastic integrals</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for the number of sign and level-set clusters of the Gaussian free field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the limiting fluctuations of the number of sign and level-set clusters of the Gaussian free field on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d \ge 3$, that are contained in a large domain. In dimension $d \ge 4$ we prove that the fluctuations are Gaussian at all non-critical levels, while in dimension $d=3$ we show that fluctuations may be Gaussian or non-Gaussian depending on the level. We also show that the sign clusters experience a form of Berry cancellation in all dimensions, that is, the fluctuations of the sign cluster count is suppressed compared to generic levels.
  Our proof is based on controlling the Weiner-It\^{o} chaos expansion of the cluster count using percolation theoretic inputs; to our knowledge this is the first time that chaos expansion techniques have been applied to analyse a non-local functional of a strongly correlated Gaussian field.</description>

      <title>On Extended Concentration Inequalities for Fast JL Embeddings of Infinite Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma allows subsets of a high-dimensional space to be embedded into a lower-dimensional space while approximately preserving all pairwise Euclidean distances. This important result has inspired an extensive literature, with a significant portion dedicated to constructing structured random matrices with fast matrix-vector multiplication algorithms that generate such embeddings for finite point sets. In this paper, we briefly consider fast JL embedding matrices for {\it infinite} subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$. Prior work in this direction such as \cite{oymak2018isometric, mendelson2023column} has focused on constructing fast JL matrices $HD \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times d}$ by multiplying structured matrices with RIP(-like) properties $H \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times d}$ against a random diagonal matrix $D \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$. However, utilizing RIP(-like) matrices $H$ in this fashion necessarily has the unfortunate side effect that the resulting embedding dimension $k$ must depend on the ambient dimension $d$ no matter how simple the infinite set is that one aims to embed. Motivated by this, we explore an alternate strategy for removing this $d$-dependence from $k$ herein: Extending a concentration inequality proven by Ailon and Liberty \cite{Ailon2008fast} in the hope of later utilizing it in a chaining argument to obtain a near-optimal result for infinite sets. %, and $(ii)$ utilizing a simple secondary Gaussian embedding of an initial fast JL embedding of a given infinite set.
  Though this strategy ultimately fails to provide the near-optimal embedding dimension we seek, along the way we obtain a stronger-than-sub-exponential extension of the concentration inequality in \cite{Ailon2008fast} which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this note we provide a gentle introduction to the concepts and intuition behind the recent breakthrough results on the mathematically rigorous construction of a non-trivial 2D conformal field theory, namely the so-called Liouville theory. This gives us the opportunity to review Segal's axioms for conformal field theories and to discuss in some detail how the free field fits into them.</description>

      <title>Statistical Verification of Linear Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a homogeneity test closely related to the concept of linear separability between two samples. Using the test one can answer the question whether a linear classifier is merely ``random'' or effectively captures differences between two classes. We focus on establishing upper bounds for the test's \emph{p}-value when applied to two-dimensional samples. Specifically, for normally distributed samples we experimentally demonstrate that the upper bound is highly accurate. Using this bound, we evaluate classifiers designed to detect ER-positive breast cancer recurrence based on gene pair expression. Our findings confirm significance of IGFBP6 and ELOVL5 genes in this process.</description>

      <title>Diffusive transport on the real line: semi-contractive gradient flows and their discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusive transport distance, a novel pseudo-metric between probability measures on the real line, is introduced. It generalizes Martingale optimal transport, and forms a hierarchy with the Hellinger and the Wasserstein metrics. We observe that certain classes of parabolic PDEs, among them the porous medium equation of exponent two, are formally semi-contractive metric gradient flows in the new distance. This observation is made rigorous for a suitable spatial discretization of the considered PDEs: these are semi-contractive gradient flows with respect to an adapted diffusive transport distance for measures on the point lattice. The main result is that the modulus of convexity is uniform with respect to the lattice spacing. Particularly for the quadratic porous medium equation, this is in contrast to what has been observed for discretizations of the Wasserstein gradient flow structure.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limit from general mixtures of experts to quantum neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the asymptotic behavior of Mixture of Experts (MoE) trained via gradient flow on supervised learning problems. Our main result establishes the propagation of chaos for a MoE as the number of experts diverges. We demonstrate that the corresponding empirical measure of their parameters is close to a probability measure that solves a nonlinear continuity equation, and we provide an explicit convergence rate that depends solely on the number of experts. We apply our results to a MoE generated by a quantum neural network.</description>

      <title>Profile cut-off phenomenon for the ergodic Feller root process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15457v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present manuscript is devoted to the study of the convergence to equilibrium as the noise intensity $\varepsilon&gt;0$ tends to zero for ergodic random systems out of equilibrium of the type \begin{align*} \mathrm{d} X^{\varepsilon}_t(x) = (\mathfrak{b}-\mathfrak{a} X^{\varepsilon}_t(x))\mathrm{d} t+\varepsilon \sqrt{X^{\varepsilon}_t(x)}\mathrm{d} B_t, \quad X^{\varepsilon}_0(x) = x, \quad t\geqslant 0, \end{align*} where $x\geqslant 0$, $\mathfrak{a}&gt;0$ and $\mathfrak{b}&gt;0$ are constants, and $(B_t)_{t \geqslant 0}$ is a one dimensional standard Brownian motion. More precisely, we show the strongest notion of asymptotic profile cut-off phenomenon in the total variation distance and in the renormalized Wasserstein distance when $\varepsilon$ tends to zero with explicit cut-off time, explicit time window, and explicit profile function. In addition, asymptotics of the so-called mixing times are given explicitly.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus via Stopping Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a substantial portion of stochastic calculus can be developed along similar lines to ordinary calculus, with derivative-based concepts driving the development. We define a notion of stopping derivative, which is a form of right derivative with respect to stopping times. Using this, we define the drift and variance rate of a process as stopping derivatives for (generalised) conditional expectation and conditional variance respectively. Applying elementary, derivative-based methods, we derive a calculus of rules describing how drift and variance rate transform under constructions on processes, culminating in a version of the multi-dimensional It\^o formula. Our approach connects with the standard machinery of stochastic calculus via a theorem establishing that continuous processes with zero drift coincide with random translations of continuous local martingales. This equivalence allows us to derive a Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for stopping derivatives, which relates the quantities of drift and variance rate, defined as stopping derivatives, to parameters used in the description of a process as a stochastic integral.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of a general class of random block Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a natural class of extensions of the Anderson model on $\mathbb Z^d$, called random block Schr\"odinger operators (RBSO), which feature a random block potential. They are defined on the $d$-dimensional lattice $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$ and take the form $H=V+\lambda \Psi$, where $V$ is a diagonal block matrix with diagonal blocks that are i.i.d. $W^d\times W^d$ GUE, $\Psi$ describes the interactions between neighboring blocks, and $\lambda&gt;0$ is a coupling parameter. We focus on three specific RBSOs: the block Anderson model, where $\Psi$ is the Laplacian operator on $\mathbb Z^d$; the Anderson orbital model, where $\Psi$ is a block Laplacian operator; the Wegner orbital model, where the nearest-neighbor blocks of $\Psi$ are random matrices. Let $\Lambda_\Psi$ denote the strength of interaction between two neighboring blocks. Assuming $d\ge 7$ and $W\ge L^\epsilon$ for a small constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, under the condition $ W^{d/4}/\Lambda_\Psi\ll\lambda\ll 1$, we prove delocalization and quantum unique ergodicity for the bulk eigenvectors, as well as a quantum diffusion estimate for the Green's function. Together with the localization result proved in arXiv:1608.02922, our results rigorously establish an Anderson localization-delocalization transition of RBSOs as $\lambda$ varies.
  Our proof is based on a nontrivial extension of the $T$-expansion method and the concept of self-energy renormalization developed for random band matrices in arXiv:2104.12048. Additionally, we explore a conceptually new idea called coupling renormalization. This phenomenon extends the self-energy renormalization and is prevalent in quantum field theory, yet it is identified here for the first time within the context of random Schr\"odinger operators. We anticipate that our techniques can be adapted to real or non-Gaussian block potentials and more general interactions $\Psi$.</description>

      <title>Numerical Ergodicity and Uniform Estimate of Monotone SPDEs Driven by Multiplicative Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the long-time behavior of numerical schemes for a class of monotone stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) driven by multiplicative noise. By deriving several time-independent a priori estimates for the numerical solutions, combined with the ergodic theory of Markov processes, we establish the exponential ergodicity of these schemes with a unique invariant measure, respectively. Applying these results to the stochastic Allen--Cahn equation indicates that these schemes always have at least one invariant measure, respectively, and converge strongly to the exact solution with sharp time-independent rates. We also show that these numerical invariant measures are exponentially ergodic and thus give an affirmative answer to a question proposed in (J. Cui, J. Hong, and L. Sun, Stochastic Process. Appl. (2021): 55--93), provided that the interface thickness is not too small.</description>

      <title>Numerical Ergodicity of Stochastic Allen--Cahn Equation driven by Multiplicative White Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the unique ergodicity of a fully discrete scheme for monotone SPDEs with polynomial growth drift and bounded diffusion coefficients driven by multiplicative white noise. The main ingredient of our method depends on the satisfaction of a Lyapunov condition followed by a uniform moments' estimate, combined with the regularity property for the full discretization. We transform the original stochastic equation into an equivalent random equation where the discrete stochastic convolutions are uniformly controlled to derive the desired uniform moments' estimate. Applying the main result to the stochastic Allen--Cahn equation driven by multiplicative white noise indicates that this full discretization is uniquely ergodic for any interface thickness. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic modelling of car traffic accidents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a counting process to model the random occurrence in time of car traffic accidents, taking into account some aspects of the self-excitation typical of this phenomenon. By combining methods from probability and differential equations, we study this stochastic process in terms of its statistical moments and large-time trend. Moreover, we derive analytically the probability density functions of the times of occurrence of traffic accidents and of the time elapsing between two consecutive accidents. Finally, we demonstrate the suitability of our modelling approach by means of numerical simulations, which address also a comparison with real data of weekly trends of traffic accidents.</description>

      <title>Artificial Barriers for stochastic differential equations and for construction of boundary-preserving schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the novel method of artificial barriers for scalar stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and use it to construct boundary-preserving numerical schemes for strong approximations of scalar SDEs, possibly with non-globally Lipschitz drift and diffusion coefficients, whose state-space is either bounded or half-bounded. The idea of artificial barriers is to augment the SDE with artificial barriers outside the state-space to not change the solution process, and then apply a boundary-preserving numerical scheme to the resulting reflected SDE (RSDE). This enables us to construct boundary-preserving numerical schemes with the same strong convergence rate as the strong convergence rate of the numerical scheme for the corresponding RSDE. Based on the method of artificial barriers, we construct two boundary-preserving schemes that we call the Artificial Barriers Euler--Maruyama (ABEM) scheme and the Artificial Barriers Euler--Peano (ABEP) scheme, respectively. We provide numerical experiments for the ABEM scheme and the numerical results agree with the obtained theoretical results.</description>
