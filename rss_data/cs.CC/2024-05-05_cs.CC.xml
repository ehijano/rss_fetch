      <title>From Proof Complexity to Circuit Complexity via Interactive Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Folklore in complexity theory suspects that circuit lower bounds against $\mathbf{NC}^1$ or $\mathbf{P}/\operatorname{poly}$, currently out of reach, are a necessary step towards proving strong proof complexity lower bounds for systems like Frege or Extended Frege. Establishing such a connection formally, however, is already daunting, as it would imply the breakthrough separation $\mathbf{NEXP} \not\subseteq \mathbf{P}/\operatorname{poly}$, as recently observed by Pich and Santhanam (2023).
  We show such a connection conditionally for the Implicit Extended Frege proof system ($\mathsf{iEF}$) introduced by Kraj\'i\v{c}ek (The Journal of Symbolic Logic, 2004), capable of formalizing most of contemporary complexity theory. In particular, we show that if $\mathsf{iEF}$ proves efficiently the standard derandomization assumption that a concrete Boolean function is hard on average for subexponential-size circuits, then any superpolynomial lower bound on the length of $\mathsf{iEF}$ proofs implies $\#\mathbf{P} \not\subseteq \mathbf{FP}/\operatorname{poly}$ (which would in turn imply, for example, $\mathbf{PSPACE} \not\subseteq \mathbf{P}/\operatorname{poly}$). Our proof exploits the formalization inside $\mathsf{iEF}$ of the soundness of the sum-check protocol of Lund, Fortnow, Karloff, and Nisan (Journal of the ACM, 1992). This has consequences for the self-provability of circuit upper bounds in $\mathsf{iEF}$. Interestingly, further improving our result seems to require progress in constructing interactive proof systems with more efficient provers.</description>

      <title>Privacy-aware Berrut Approximated Coded Computing for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an interesting strategy that enables the collaborative training of an AI model among different data owners without revealing their private datasets. Even so, FL has some privacy vulnerabilities that have been tried to be overcome by applying some techniques like Differential Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), or Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However, these techniques have some important drawbacks that might narrow their range of application: problems to work with non-linear functions and to operate large matrix multiplications and high communication and computational costs to manage semi-honest nodes. In this context, we propose a solution to guarantee privacy in FL schemes that simultaneously solves the previously mentioned problems. Our proposal is based on the Berrut Approximated Coded Computing, a technique from the Coded Distributed Computing paradigm, adapted to a Secret Sharing configuration, to provide input privacy to FL in a scalable way. It can be applied for computing non-linear functions and treats the special case of distributed matrix multiplication, a key primitive at the core of many automated learning tasks. Because of these characteristics, it could be applied in a wide range of FL scenarios, since it is independent of the machine learning models or aggregation algorithms used in the FL scheme. We provide analysis of the achieve privacy and complexity of our solution and, due to the extensive numerical results performed, it can be observed a good trade-off between privacy and precision.</description>

      <title>Refuting approaches to the log-rank conjecture for XOR functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The log-rank conjecture, a longstanding problem in communication complexity, has persistently eluded resolution for decades. Consequently, some recent efforts have focused on potential approaches for establishing the conjecture in the special case of XOR functions, where the communication matrix is lifted from a boolean function, and the rank of the matrix equals the Fourier sparsity of the function, which is the number of its nonzero Fourier coefficients.
  In this note, we refute two conjectures. The first has origins in Montanaro and Osborne (arXiv'09) and is considered in Tsang et al. (FOCS'13), and the second one is due to Mande and Sanyal (FSTTCS'20). These conjectures were proposed in order to improve the best-known bound of Lovett (STOC'14) regarding the log-rank conjecture in the special case of XOR functions. Both conjectures speculate that the set of nonzero Fourier coefficients of the boolean function has some strong additive structure. We refute these conjectures by constructing two specific boolean functions tailored to each.</description>

      <title>Tight Fine-Grained Bounds for Direct Access on Join Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02401v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the task of lexicographic direct access to query answers. That is, we want to simulate an array containing the answers of a join query sorted in a lexicographic order chosen by the user. A recent dichotomy showed for which queries and orders this task can be done in polylogarithmic access time after quasilinear preprocessing, but this dichotomy does not tell us how much time is required in the cases classified as hard. We determine the preprocessing time needed to achieve polylogarithmic access time for all join queries and all lexicographical orders. To this end, we propose a decomposition-based general algorithm for direct access on join queries. We then explore its optimality by proving lower bounds for the preprocessing time based on the hardness of a certain online Set-Disjointness problem, which shows that our algorithm's bounds are tight for all lexicographic orders on join queries. Then, we prove the hardness of Set-Disjointness based on the Zero-Clique Conjecture which is an established conjecture from fine-grained complexity theory. Interestingly, while proving our lower bound, we show that self-joins do not affect the complexity of direct access (up to logarithmic factors). Our algorithm can also be used to solve queries with projections and relaxed order requirements, though in these cases, its running time not necessarily optimal. We also show that similar techniques to those used in our lower bounds can be used to prove that, for enumerating answers to Loomis-Whitney joins, it is not possible to significantly improve upon trivially computing all answers at preprocessing. This, in turn, gives further evidence (based on the Zero-Clique Conjecture) to the enumeration hardness of self-join free cyclic joins with respect to linear preprocessing and constant delay.</description>

      <title>Temporal Reachability Dominating Sets: contagion in temporal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a population with dynamic pairwise connections, we ask if the entire population could be (indirectly) infected by a small group of $k$ initially infected individuals. We formalise this problem as the Temporal Reachability Dominating Set (TaRDiS}) problem on temporal graphs. We provide positive and negative parameterized complexity results in four different parameters: the number $k$ of initially infected, the lifetime $\tau$ of the graph, the number of locally earliest edges in the graph, and the treewidth of the footprint graph $\mathcal{G}_\downarrow$.
  We additionally introduce and study the MaxMinTaRDiS problem, where the aim is to schedule connections between individuals so that at least $k$ individuals must be infected for the entire population to become fully infected. We classify three variants of the problem: Strict, Nonstrict, and Happy. We show these to be coNP-complete, NP-hard, and $\Sigma_2^P$-complete, respectively. Interestingly, we obtain hardness of the Nonstrict variant by showing that a natural restriction is exactly the well-studied Distance-3 Independent Set problem on static graphs.</description>
