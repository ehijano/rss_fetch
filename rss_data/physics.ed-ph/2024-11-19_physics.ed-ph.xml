      <title>Presenting a STEM Ways of Thinking Framework for Engineering Design-based Physics Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating students' thinking in classroom tasks, particularly in science and engineering, is essential for improving educational practices and advancing student learning. In this context, the notion of Ways of Thinking (WoT) has gained traction in STEM education, offering a framework to explore how students approach and solve interdisciplinary problems. Building on our earlier studies and contributing to ongoing discussions on WoT frameworks, this paper introduces a new WoT framework: Ways of Thinking in Engineering Design based Physics (WoT4EDP). WoT4EDP integrates five key elements: design, science, mathematics, metacognitive reflection, and computational thinking within an undergraduate introductory physics laboratory. This framework offers a novel perspective by emphasizing how these interconnected elements work together to foster deeper learning and holistic problem-solving in Engineering Design based projects. We describe the development of WoT4EDP, situate it within the broader landscape of undergraduate STEM education, and provide detailed characterizations of its components. Additionally, we compare WoT4EDP with two contemporary frameworks: Dalal et al. (2021) and English (2023), to glean insights that enhance its application and promote interdisciplinary thinking. This paper is the first of a two-part series. In the upcoming second part, we will demonstrate the application of the WoT4EDP framework, showcasing how it can be used to analyze student thinking in real-world, ED-based physics projects.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Laplace Transform in Quantum Mechanics: Correcting a Flawed Approach for the Stationary Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laplace transform is a valuable tool in physics, particularly in solving differential equations with initial or boundary conditions. A 2014 study by Tsaur and Wang (2014 \emph{Eur.~J.~Phys.} \textbf{35} 015006) introduced a Laplace-transform-based method to solve the stationary Schr\"odinger equation for various potentials. However, their approach contains critical methodological flaws: the authors disregard essential boundary conditions and apply the residue theorem incorrectly in the inverse transformation process. These errors ultimately cancel out, leading to correct results despite a flawed derivation. In this paper, we revisit the use of the Laplace transform for the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation, clarifying correct practices in handling boundary conditions and singularities. This analysis offers a sound and consistent framework for the application of Laplace transforms in stationary quantum mechanics, underscoring their educational utility in quantum mechanics coursework.</description>

      <title>Polarization and energy ellipsoids for an introductory visualization of tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ``The Feynman Lectures on Physics'' is discussed an introduction to tensors by means of the polarization tensor, including a way of ``visualizing'' this tensor via the energy ellipsoid, which is drawn by the electric fields which produce the same polarization energy density in an anisotropic crystal. Here, we discuss an alternative way of visualizing the polarization tensor, by means of the polarization ellipsoid, which is based on the ideas of Lam\'e's stress ellipsoid and is drawn by the polarization vectors produced by electric fields having the same magnitude. We compare both ellipsoids as a first introductory way of visualizing the polarization tensor.</description>

      <title>How to make your research group more inclusive for autistic trainees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a university professor, one of my most important responsibilities is mentoring the junior members of my research group and creating an inclusive environment in which they can thrive. Since my autism diagnosis two years ago, colleagues have asked me how they can make their research groups more welcoming to autistic trainees. This short guide, based on conversations with autistic students and academics, intense reflection on my own lived experience, and a deep dive into the literature, provides five concrete steps toward this goal.</description>
