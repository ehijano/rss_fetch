      <title>Controversy and consensus: common ground and best practices for life cycle assessment of emerging technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10382v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past decade has seen a surge in public and private interest in the application of life cycle assessment (LCA), further accelerated by the emergence of new policies and disclosure practices explicitly mandating LCA. Simultaneously, the magnitude and diversity of stakeholder groups affected by LCA and LCA-based decision making have expanded rapidly. These shifts have brought about a renewed sense of urgency in conducting LCA faster, more accurately, and (often) earlier in the technology development cycle when products and materials can be more easily replaced, modified, or optimized. However, this increased demand for LCA of emerging technologies has revealed several crucial yet unsettled areas of debate regarding best practices for assessing sustainability at early stages of technology development. In this paper, we explore six such controversial topics: (1) appropriate use of LCA, (2) uncertainty assessment, (3) comparison with incumbents, (4) adopting standards, (5) system scale-up, and (6) stakeholder engagement. These topics encompass key issues vigorously debated during a series of workshop-style discussions convened by the LCA of Emerging Technologies Research Network (currently hosted by ACLCA). In this paper, we present the main points of support and opposition for a declarative resolution representing each topic, along with points of consensus, held amongst our research network of LCA practitioners and experts. These debates and associated open questions are intended to build awareness amongst practitioners and decision-makers of the common challenges associated with assessing emerging technologies, while fostering evidence-based and context-informed discussions that are both transparent and impactful for the broader community.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Parameter Tuning of Level-1 QAOA for Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving combinatorial optimisation problems. QAOA encodes solutions into the ground state of a Hamiltonian, approximated by a $p$-level parameterised quantum circuit composed of problem and mixer Hamiltonians, with parameters optimised classically. While deeper QAOA circuits can offer greater accuracy, practical applications are constrained by complex parameter optimisation and physical limitations such as gate noise, restricted qubit connectivity, and state-preparation-and-measurement errors, limiting implementations to shallow depths. This work focuses on QAOA$_1$ (QAOA at $p=1$) for QUBO problems, represented as Ising models. Despite QAOA$_1$ having only two parameters, $(\gamma, \beta)$, we show that their optimisation is challenging due to a highly oscillatory landscape, with oscillation rates increasing with the problem size, density, and weight. This behaviour necessitates high-resolution grid searches to avoid distortion of cost landscapes that may result in inaccurate minima. We propose an efficient optimisation strategy that reduces the two-dimensional $(\gamma, \beta)$ search to a one-dimensional search over $\gamma$, with $\beta^*$ computed analytically. We establish the maximum permissible sampling period required to accurately map the $\gamma$ landscape and provide an algorithm to estimate the optimal parameters in polynomial time. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that for regular graphs on average, the globally optimal $\gamma^* \in \mathbb{R}^+$ values are concentrated very close to zero and coincide with the first local optimum, enabling gradient descent to replace exhaustive line searches. This approach is validated using Recursive QAOA (RQAOA), where it consistently outperforms both coarsely optimised RQAOA and semidefinite programs across all tested QUBO instances.</description>

      <title>Embracing Reconfigurable Antennas in the Tri-hybrid MIMO Architecture for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication has led to immense enhancements in data rates and efficient spectrum management. The evolution of MIMO has been accompanied by increased hardware complexity and array sizes, causing system power consumption to rise as a result. Despite past advances in power-efficient hybrid architectures, new solutions are needed to enable extremely large-scale MIMO deployments for 6G and beyond. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture that integrates low-power reconfigurable antennas with both digital and analog precoding. This \emph{tri-hybrid} approach addresses key limitations in traditional and hybrid MIMO systems by improving power consumption and adding new layer for signal processing. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed architecture and compare its performance with existing solutions, including fully-digital and hybrid MIMO systems. The results demonstrate significant improvements in energy efficiency, highlighting the potential of the tri-hybrid system to meet the growing demands of future wireless networks. We also discuss several design and implementation challenges, including the need for technological advancements in reconfigurable array hardware and tunable antenna parameters.</description>

      <title>QuEst: Graph Transformer for Quantum Circuit Reliability Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among different quantum algorithms, PQC for QML show promises on near-term devices. To facilitate the QML and PQC research, a recent python library called TorchQuantum has been released. It can construct, simulate, and train PQC for machine learning tasks with high speed and convenient debugging supports. Besides quantum for ML, we want to raise the community's attention on the reversed direction: ML for quantum. Specifically, the TorchQuantum library also supports using data-driven ML models to solve problems in quantum system research, such as predicting the impact of quantum noise on circuit fidelity and improving the quantum circuit compilation efficiency.
  This paper presents a case study of the ML for quantum part. Since estimating the noise impact on circuit reliability is an essential step toward understanding and mitigating noise, we propose to leverage classical ML to predict noise impact on circuit fidelity. Inspired by the natural graph representation of quantum circuits, we propose to leverage a graph transformer model to predict the noisy circuit fidelity. We firstly collect a large dataset with a variety of quantum circuits and obtain their fidelity on noisy simulators and real machines. Then we embed each circuit into a graph with gate and noise properties as node features, and adopt a graph transformer to predict the fidelity.
  Evaluated on 5 thousand random and algorithm circuits, the graph transformer predictor can provide accurate fidelity estimation with RMSE error 0.04 and outperform a simple neural network-based model by 0.02 on average. It can achieve 0.99 and 0.95 R$^2$ scores for random and algorithm circuits, respectively. Compared with circuit simulators, the predictor has over 200X speedup for estimating the fidelity.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Bootstrapping of Quantum Dot Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a promising platform for multiple different qubit implementations, all of which are voltage controlled by programmable gate electrodes. However, as the QD arrays grow in size and complexity, tuning procedures that can fully autonomously handle the increasing number of control parameters are becoming essential for enabling scalability. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm for initializing a depletion-mode QD device in preparation for subsequent phases of tuning. During bootstrapping, the QD device functionality is validated, all gates are characterized, and the QD charge sensor is made operational. We demonstrate the bootstrapping protocol in conjunction with a coarse-tuning module, showing that the combined algorithm can efficiently and reliably take a cooled-down QD device to a desired global-state configuration in under 8 min with a success rate of 96 %. Finally, by following heuristic approaches to QD device initialization and combining the efficient ray-based measurement with the rapid radio-frequency reflectometry measurements, the proposed algorithm establishes a reference in terms of performance, reliability, and efficiency against which alternative algorithms can be benchmarked.</description>

      <title>TinkerXR: In-Situ, Reality-Aware CAD and 3D Printing Interface for Novices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing accessibility of augmented reality (AR) for visualization, existing computer-aided design (CAD) systems remain confined to traditional screens or require complex setups or predefined parameters, limiting immersion and accessibility for novices. We present TinkerXR, an open-sourced interface enabling in-situ design and fabrication through Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) modeling. TinkerXR operates solely with a headset and 3D printer, allowing users to design directly in and for their physical environments. By leveraging spatial awareness, depth occlusion, recognition of physical constraints, reference objects, and intuitive hand movement controls, TinkerXR enhances realism, precision, and ease of use. Its AR-based workflow integrates design and 3D printing with a drag-and-drop interface for a 3D printer's virtual twin. A user study comparing TinkerXR with Tinkercad demonstrates higher accessibility, engagement, and ease of use for novices. By bridging the gap between digital creation and physical output, TinkerXR transforms everyday spaces into accessible and expressive creative studios.</description>

      <title>Reformulating Regression Test Suite Optimization using Quantum Annealing -- an Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maintaining software quality is crucial in the dynamic landscape of software development. Regression testing ensures that software works as expected after changes are implemented. However, re-executing all test cases for every modification is often impractical and costly, particularly for large systems. Although very effective, traditional test suite optimization techniques are often impractical in resource-constrained scenarios, as they are computationally expensive. Hence, quantum computing solutions have been developed to improve their efficiency but have shown drawbacks in terms of effectiveness. We propose reformulating the regression test case selection problem to use quantum computation techniques better. Our objectives are (i) to provide more efficient solutions than traditional methods and (ii) to improve the effectiveness of previously proposed quantum-based solutions. We propose SelectQA, a quantum annealing approach that can outperform the quantum-based approach BootQA in terms of effectiveness while obtaining results comparable to those of the classic Additional Greedy and DIV-GA approaches. Regarding efficiency, SelectQA outperforms DIV-GA and has similar results with the Additional Greedy algorithm but is exceeded by BootQA.</description>

      <title>Conversation Routines: A Prompt Engineering Framework for Task-Oriented Dialog Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces Conversation Routines (CR), a structured prompt engineering framework for developing task-oriented dialog systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable natural language understanding capabilities, engineering them to reliably execute complex business workflows remains challenging. The proposed CR framework enables the development of Conversation Agentic Systems (CAS) through natural language specifications, embedding task-oriented logic within LLM prompts. This approach provides a systematic methodology for designing and implementing complex conversational workflows while maintaining behavioral consistency. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through two proof-of-concept implementations: a Train Ticket Booking System and an Interactive Troubleshooting Copilot. These case studies validate CR's capability to encode sophisticated behavioral patterns and decision logic while preserving natural conversational flexibility. Results show that CR enables domain experts to design conversational workflows in natural language while leveraging custom enterprise functionalities (tools) developed by software engineers, creating an efficient division of responsibilities where developers focus on core API implementation and domain experts handle conversation design. While the framework shows promise in accessibility and adaptability, we identify key challenges including computational overhead, non-deterministic behavior, and domain-specific logic optimization. Future research directions include CR evaluation methods based on prompt engineering framework driven by goal-oriented grading criteria, improving scalability for complex multi-agent interactions, enhancing system robustness addressing the identified limitations across diverse business applications.</description>
