      <title>An Introduction to Categorical Proof Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These expanded lecture notes are based on a tutorial on categorical proof theory presented at the summer school associated with the conference "Topology, Algebra, and Categories in Logic 2021-2022." The chapter delves into various applications of categorical methods in proof theory. It is designed to be accessible, with no prior familiarity with category theory required. The necessary categorical background is introduced gradually, with a focus on the philosophical and informal aspects of proof. The only prerequisites are a basic understanding of logic, computability theory, topology, and ordered structures.</description>

      <title>A mixed logic with binary operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work "Betweenness algebras" we introduced and examined the class of betweenness algebras. In the current paper we study a larger class of algebras with binary operators of possibility and sufficiency, the weak mixed algebras. Furthermore, we develop a system of logic with two binary modalities, sound and complete with respect to the class of frames closely related to the aforementioned algebras, and we prove an embedding theorem which solves an open problem from "Betweenness algebras".</description>

      <title>Measurable Regular Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every $d$-regular bipartite Borel graph admits a Baire measurable $k$-regular spanning subgraph if and only if $d$ is odd or $k$ is even. This gives the first example of a locally checkable coloring problem which is known to have a Baire measurable solution on Borel graphs but not a computable solution on highly computable graphs. We also prove the analogous result in the measure setting for hyperfinite graphs.</description>

      <title>Independence and Induction in Reverse Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the project of the study of reverse mathematics principles inspired by cardinal invariants. In this article in particular we focus on principles encapsulating the existence of large families of objects that are in some sense mutually independent. More precisely, we study the principle MAD stating that a maximal family of pairwise almost disjoint sets exists; and the principle MED expressing the existence of a maximal family of functions that are pairwise eventually different. We investigate characterisations of and relations between these principles and some of their variants. It will turn out that induction strength is an essential parameter in this context.</description>

      <title>Proper classes of maximal $\theta$-independent families from large cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While maximal independent families can be constructed from ZFC via Zorn's lemma, the presence of a maximal $\sigma$-independent family already gives an inner model with a measurable cardinal, and Kunen has shown that from a measurable cardinal one can construct a forcing extension in which there is a maximal $\sigma$-independent family. We extend this technique to construct proper classes of maximal $\theta$-independent families for various uncountable $\theta$. In the first instance, a single $\theta^+$-strongly compact cardinal has a set-generic extension with a proper class of maximal $\theta$-independent families. In the second, we take a class-generic extension of a model with a proper class of measurable cardinals to obtain a proper class of $\theta$ for which there is a maximal $\theta$-independent family.</description>

Abstract: Generalizing a result of T\"ornquist and Weiss, we study the connection between the existence of $\varSigma_2^1$ Sierpi\'{n}ski's coverings of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and a cardinal invariant of the upper semi-lattice of constructibility degrees known as breadth.</description>

      <title>Some model theory of quadratic geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal spaces are vector spaces together with a quadratic form whose associated bilinear form is non-degenerate. Over fields of characteristic two, there are many quadratic forms associated to a given bilinear form and quadratic geometries are structures that encode a vector space over a field of characteristic 2 with a non-degenerate bilinear form together with a space of associated quadratic forms. These structures over finite fields of characteristic 2 form an important part of the basic geometries that appear in the Lie coordinatizable structures of Cherlin and Hrushovski. We (a) describe the respective model companions of the theory of orthogonal spaces and the theory of quadratic geometries and (b) classify the pseudo-finite completions of these theories. We also (c) give a neostability-theoretic classification of the model companions and these pseudo-finite completions. This is a small step towards understanding the analogue of the Cherlin-Hrushovski theory of Lie coordinatizable structures in a setting where the involved fields may be pseudo-finite.</description>

      <title>Nullnorms on bounded trellises</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of nullnorms on bounded trellises and study some basic properties. Based on the existence of $t$-norms and $t$-conorms on arbitrary bounded trellises, we propose some construction methods of nullnorms on bounded trellises. Moreover, some illustrative examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Additivity of derived limits in the Cohen model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, in the model constructed by adding sufficiently many Cohen reals, derived limits are additive on a large class of systems. This generalizes the work of Jeffrey Bergfalk, Michael Hru\v s\'ak, and Chris Lambie-Hanson which focuses on the system $\mathbf{A}$. In the process, we isolate a partition principle responsible for the vanishing of derived limits on collections of Cohen reals and reframe the propagating trivializations result of as a theorem of ZFC. In light of results of the author, Jeffrey Bergfalk, and Justin Moore in \cite{ASH}, the additivity of derived limits also implies additivity results for strong homology.</description>

      <title>The Hartogs-Lindenbaum Spectrum of Symmetric Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We expand the classic result that $\mathsf{AC}_{\mathsf{WO}}$ is equivalent to the statement "For all $X$, $\aleph(X)=\aleph^*(X)$" by proving the equivalence of many more related statements. Then, we introduce the Hartogs-Lindenbaum spectrum of a model of $\mathsf{ZF}$, and inspect the structure of these spectra in models that are obtained by a symmetric extension of a model of $\mathsf{ZFC}$. We prove that all such spectra fall into a very rigid pattern.</description>

      <title>$\Pi^0_4$ conservation of Ramsey's theorem for pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that Ramsey's theorem for pairs and two colors is a $\forall \Pi^0_4$ conservative extension of $\mathsf{RCA}_0 + \mathsf{B}\Sigma^0_2$, where a $\forall \Pi^0_4$ formula consists of a universal quantifier over sets followed by a $\Pi^0_4$ formula. The proof is an improvement of a result by Patey and Yokoyama and a step towards the resolution of the longstanding question of the first-order part of Ramsey's theorem for pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this memoir, we seek to construct a dynamical theory as complete as possible to describe the algebraic properties of the field of real numbers in constructive mathematics without axiom of dependent choice. We propose a theory which turns out to be very close to the theory of real closed local rings in classical mathematics. The theory of real closed rings is presented here in constructive form as a natural purely equational theory, which uses virtual root functions introduced in previous work. This work is also a first step through an essential goal for the future, which is to obtain a constructive version of o-minimal structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ernst Zermelo's axiomatization of set theory (1908) did not exclude `a set that is a member of itself'. We call a set that is a member of itself `an individual'. In this article we prove the elimination of Russell's paradox is equivalent to "For every set S, an individual is a member of S or a set (but not an individual) is not a member of S". This shows there is place is set theory for individuals. We give individuals the place they deserve according to formal logic.</description>

      <title>Various Properties of Various Ultrafilters, Various Graph Width Parameters, and Various Connectivity Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02299v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filters are collections of sets that are closed under supersets and finite intersections, serving as fundamental tools in topology and set theory. An ultrafilter, a maximal filter on a set, plays a crucial role in these fields by rigorously handling limits, convergence, and compactness. A connectivity system is defined as a pair (X,f) , where X is a finite set and f is a symmetric submodular function. Understanding the duality in these parameters elucidates the relationship between different decompositions and measures of a graph's complexity. In this paper, we delve into ultrafilters on connectivity systems, applying Tukey's Lemma to these systems. Additionally, we explore prefilters, ultra-prefilters, and subbases within the context of connectivity systems. Furthermore, we introduce and investigate new parameters related to width, length, and depth, enhancing our understanding of these mathematical structures.</description>
