      <title>Text-to-SQL based on Large Language Models and Database Keyword Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL prompt strategies based on Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance on well-known benchmarks. However, when applied to real-world databases, their performance is significantly less than for these benchmarks, especially for Natural Language (NL) questions requiring complex filters and joins to be processed. This paper then proposes a strategy to compile NL questions into SQL queries that incorporates a dynamic few-shot examples strategy and leverages the services provided by a database keyword search (KwS) platform. The paper details how the precision and recall of the schema-linking process are improved with the help of the examples provided and the keyword-matching service that the KwS platform offers. Then, it shows how the KwS platform can be used to synthesize a view that captures the joins required to process an input NL question and thereby simplify the SQL query compilation step. The paper includes experiments with a real-world relational database to assess the performance of the proposed strategy. The experiments suggest that the strategy achieves an accuracy on the real-world relational database that surpasses state-of-the-art approaches. The paper concludes by discussing the results obtained.</description>

      <title>Billion-scale Similarity Search Using a Hybrid Indexing Approach with Advanced Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for similarity search with complex filtering capabilities on billion-scale datasets, optimized for CPU inference. Our method extends the classical IVF-Flat index structure to integrate multi-dimensional filters. The proposed algorithm combines dense embeddings with discrete filtering attributes, enabling fast retrieval in high-dimensional spaces. Designed specifically for CPU-based systems, our disk-based approach offers a cost-effective solution for large-scale similarity search. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a case study, showcasing its potential for various practical uses.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Limit: Verified Performance-Optimal Causally-Consistent Database Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern web services crucially rely on high-performance distributed databases, where concurrent transactions are isolated from each other using concurrency control protocols. Relaxed isolation levels, which permit more complex concurrent behaviors than strong levels like serializability, are used in practice for higher performance and availability.
  In this paper, we present Eiger-PORT+, a concurrency control protocol that achieves a strong form of causal consistency, called TCCv (Transactional Causal Consistency with convergence). We show that Eiger-PORT+ also provides performance-optimal read transactions in the presence of transactional writes, thus refuting an open conjecture that this is impossible for TCCv. We also deductively verify that Eiger-PORT+ satisfies this isolation level by refining an abstract model of transactions. This yields the first deductive verification of a complex concurrency control protocol. Furthermore, we conduct a performance evaluation showing Eiger-PORT+'s superior performance over the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Large Language Model-Based Generative AI for Text-to-SQL: Benchmarks, Applications, Use Cases, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems facilitate smooth interaction with databases by translating natural language queries into Structured Query Language (SQL), bridging the gap between non-technical users and complex database management systems. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of AI-driven text-to-SQL systems, highlighting their foundational components, advancements in large language model (LLM) architectures, and the critical role of datasets such as Spider, WikiSQL, and CoSQL in driving progress. We examine the applications of text-to-SQL in domains like healthcare, education, and finance, emphasizing their transformative potential for improving data accessibility. Additionally, we analyze persistent challenges, including domain generalization, query optimization, support for multi-turn conversational interactions, and the limited availability of datasets tailored for NoSQL databases and dynamic real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we outline future research directions, such as extending text-to-SQL capabilities to support NoSQL databases, designing datasets for dynamic multi-turn interactions, and optimizing systems for real-world scalability and robustness. By surveying current advancements and identifying key gaps, this paper aims to guide the next generation of research and applications in LLM-based text-to-SQL systems.</description>

      <title>ARTEMIS-DA: An Advanced Reasoning and Transformation Engine for Multi-Step Insight Synthesis in Data Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Advanced Reasoning and Transformation Engine for Multi-Step Insight Synthesis in Data Analytics (ARTEMIS-DA), a novel framework designed to augment Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving complex, multi-step data analytics tasks. ARTEMIS-DA integrates three core components: the Planner, which dissects complex user queries into structured, sequential instructions encompassing data preprocessing, transformation, predictive modeling, and visualization; the Coder, which dynamically generates and executes Python code to implement these instructions; and the Grapher, which interprets generated visualizations to derive actionable insights. By orchestrating the collaboration between these components, ARTEMIS-DA effectively manages sophisticated analytical workflows involving advanced reasoning, multi-step transformations, and synthesis across diverse data modalities. The framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on benchmarks such as WikiTableQuestions and TabFact, demonstrating its ability to tackle intricate analytical tasks with precision and adaptability. By combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with automated code generation and execution and visual analysis, ARTEMIS-DA offers a robust, scalable solution for multi-step insight synthesis, addressing a wide range of challenges in data analytics.</description>
