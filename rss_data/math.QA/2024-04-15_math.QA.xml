      <title>Diagramatics for cyclic pointed fusion categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a parametrization of cyclic pointed categories associated to the cyclic group of order $n$ in terms of $n$-th roots of unity. We also provide a diagramatic description of these categories by generators and relations, and use it to characterize their $2$-group of automorphisms.</description>

      <title>Abelian Group Quantum Error Correction in Kitaev's Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a detailed mathematical description of the error correction process for Kitaev's model for finite Abelian groups. The number of errors Kitaev's model can correct depends on the lattice and its topology. Although there is a theoretical maximum number of errors that can be corrected, we prove that correcting this number of errors, in general, is an NP-complete problem. Consequently, we introduce a polynomial-time correction algorithm that corrects a number of errors below the theoretical maximum.</description>

      <title>Particle Physics: a crash course for Mathematicians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This introductory work combines bottom-up and top-down approaches towards understanding the underlying categorical structure of possible unifying theories descending from string theory. Guided by well-established developments in the realm of categorical algebraic geometry, we explain why abelianisation could potentially lead to furthering the understanding of how to embed Beyond the Standard Model scenarios in supersymmetric setups.</description>

      <title>Algebraic formulas and Geometric derivation of Source Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Source identities are fundamental identities between multivariable special functions. We give a geometric derivation of rational and trigonometric source identities. We also give a systematic derivation and extension of various determinant representations for source functions which appeared in previous literature as well as introducing the elliptic version of the determinants, and obtain identities between determinants. We also show several symmetrization formulas for the rational version.</description>

      <title>The Reduced Tensor Product of Braided Tensor Categories Containing a Symmetric Fusion Category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.13562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We detail a construction of a symmetric monoidal structure, called the reduced tensor product on the 2-category of braided tensor categories $\mathbf{BTC}(\mathcal{A})$ containing a fixed symmetric fusion subcategory $\mathcal{A}$. The construction only depends on the braiding and monoidal structure of the categories involved. The main tool in the construction is an enriching procedure that is shown to give an equivalence between $\mathbf{BTC}(\mathcal{A})$ and a 2-category of so-called Drinfeld centre crossed braided tensor categories. As an application of the reduced tensor product, we show that it gives a pairing between minimal modular extensions of braided tensor categories containing $\mathcal{A}$ as their transparent subcategory.</description>

      <title>Quantum group deformations and quantum $ R $-(co)matrices vs. Quantum Duality Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the effect on quantum groups -- namely, both QUEA's and QFSHA's -- of deformations by twist and by 2-cocycles, showing how such deformations affect the semiclassical limit. As a second, more important task, we discuss how these deformation procedures can be "stretched" to a new extent, via a formal variation of the original recipes, using "quasi-twists" and "quasi-2-cocycles". These recipes seemingly should make no sense at all, yet we prove that they actually work, thus providing well-defined, more general deformation procedures. Later on, we explain the underlying reason that motivates such a result in light of the "Quantum Duality Principle", through which every "quasi-twist/2-cocycle" for a given quantum group can be seen as a standard twist/2-cocycle for another quantum group, associated to the original one via the appropriate Drinfeld functor. As a third task, we consider standard constructions involving $R$-(co)matrices in the general theory of Hopf algebras. First we adapt them to quantum groups, then we show that they extend to the case of "quasi-$R$-(co)matrices", and finally we discuss how these constructions interact with the Quantum Duality Principle. As a byproduct, this yields new special symmetries (isomorphisms) for the underlying pair of dual Poisson (formal) groups that one gets by specialization.</description>

      <title>Binomial Coefficients and Littlewood--Richardson Coefficients for Interpolation Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous versions of Jack and Macdonald polynomials, called interpolation polynomials, have been introduced by Knop-Sahi (type $A$) and Okounkov (type $BC$). In this paper, we study binomial coefficients and Littlewood-Richardson (LR) coefficients for these interpolation polynomials. We extend to type $BC$ the weighted sum formula for binomial coefficients due to the second author in type $A$, and obtain a new weighted sum formula for LR coefficients for both types $A$ and $BC$. We prove that binomial coefficients are positive and monotone using the weighted sum formula and the combinatorial formulas due to Okounkov. As an application, we show that the containment partial order can be characterized in terms of Schur positivity or Jack positivity. This result is in parallel with the work of Cuttler-Greene-Skandera, Sra and Khare-Tao, which characterize two other partial orders, majorization and weak majorization, in terms of evaluation positivity of Schur functions.</description>

      <title>A Canonical Quantization of Poisson Manifolds: a 2-Groupoid Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We canonically quantize a Poisson manifold to a Lie 2-groupoid, complete with a quantization map, and show that it relates geometric and deformation quantization: the perturbative expansion in $\hbar$ of the (formal) convolution of two quantized functions yields Kontsevich's star product. Meanwhile, we can push forward this quantization map (by integrating over homotopies of paths) to obtain a quantization map in traditional geometric quantization. This gives a polarization-free, path integral definition of the quantization map, which does not have a prior prescription for Poisson manifolds and which only has a partial prescription for symplectic manifolds. We show that in conventional quantum mechanics our operators are defined on the entire prequantum Hilbert space and that they all preserve polarized sections, contrary to the Kostant-Souriau approach.</description>
