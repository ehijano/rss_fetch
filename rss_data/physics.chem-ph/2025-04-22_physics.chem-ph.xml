      <title>Kinetic rates calculation via non-equilibrium dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel computational approach based on ratchet-and-pawl molecular dynamics (rMD) for accurately estimating ligand dissociation kinetics in protein-ligand complexes. By integrating Kramers' theory with Bell's equation, our method systematically investigates the relationship between the effective biasing force applied during simulations and the ligand residence times. The proposed technique is demonstrated through extensive simulations of the benzamidine-trypsin complex, employing first an implicit solvent model (multi-eGO) to set up the approach parameters and thus an explicit solvent model. Our results illustrate the method's reliability, accuracy, and computational efficiency, with calculated kinetic rates closely matching experimental values. Overall, this study highlights rMD as a versatile and efficient non-equilibrium methodology, broadly applicable to kinetic analyses in chemical and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Improved Treatment of 1-4 interactions in Force Fields for Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional force fields commonly use a combination of bonded torsional terms and empirically scaled non-bonded interactions to capture 1-4 energies and forces of atoms separated by three bonds in a molecule. While this approach can yield accurate torsional energy barriers, it often leads to inaccurate forces and erroneous geometries, and creates an interdependence between dihedral terms and non-bonded interactions, complicating parameterization and reducing transferability. In this paper, we demonstrate that 1-4 interactions can be accurately modeled using only bonded coupling terms, eliminating the need for arbitrarily scaled non-bonded interactions altogether. Furthermore by leveraging the automated parameterization capabilities of the Q-Force toolkit, we efficiently determine the necessary coupling terms without the need for manual adjustment. Our approach is validated on a range of representative molecular systems, encompassing both flexible and rigid structures, and shows a significant improvement in force field accuracy, obtaining sub-kcal/mol mean absolute error for every molecule tested. These results suggest that a bonded-only model for 1-4 interactions can provide a more accurate alternative to that used in traditional force field models for chemical, biomolecular, and materials systems.</description>

      <title>Mitigating error cancellation in density functional approximations via machine learning correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) with density functional theory has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the accuracy of density functional methods. While practical implementations of density functional approximations (DFAs) often exploit error cancellation between chemical species to achieve high accuracy in thermochemical and kinetic energy predictions, this approach is inherently system-dependent, which severely limits the transferability of DFAs. To address this challenge, we develop a novel ML-based correction to the widely used B3LYP functional, directly targeting its deviations from the exact exchange-correlation functional. By utilizing highly accurate absolute energies as exclusive reference data, our approach eliminates the reliance on error cancellation. To optimize the ML model, we attribute errors to real-space pointwise contributions and design a double-cycle protocol that incorporates self-consistent-field calculations into the training workflow. Numerical tests demonstrate that the ML model, trained solely on absolute energies, improves the accuracy of calculated relative energies, demonstrating that robust DFAs can be constructed without resorting to error cancellation. Comprehensive benchmarks further show that our ML-corrected B3LYP functional significantly outperforms the original B3LYP across diverse thermochemical and kinetic energy calculations, offering a versatile and superior alternative for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Excitation Transfer in an Artificial Photosynthetic Light-Harvesting System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically derive transfer probabilities and efficiencies for an artificial light-harvesting photosynthetic system, which consists of a ring coupled to a central acceptor. For an incident photon pair, we find near-perfect single excitation transfer efficiency with negligible double excitation transfer in the weak coupling regime. In the strong coupling regime, single excitation transfer efficiency was greater than 90%, while the double excitation efficiency was approximately 50%. We have found that the three main factors which determine high transfer efficiencies are large acceptor probabilities, long acceptor decay times, and strong photon-ring coupling. A possible implementation of the theoretical framework to bio-inspired solar energy devices is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Dynamics in Entangled Biphoton Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum light spectroscopy highlight the potential of using entangled photons as a sensitive probe for many-body dynamics and material correlations. However, a comprehensive theory to explain experimental results remains elusive, primarily due to the complexity of the Hilbert space and the intricate interactions and nonlinearities inherent in material systems. In this work, we introduce a tractable model based on a finite-sized correlation matrix governed by a bilinear bosonic Hamiltonian, enabling efficient simulations through Gaussian-preserving dynamics. We apply this framework to compute the output joint spectral intensity (JSI) and von Neumann entropy of frequency-entangled biphotons, and find close agreement with experimental observations in empty microcavities. Our results reveal the emergence of off-diagonal spectral correlations that can be interpreted as irreversible decay of cavity excitations into the biphoton continua. This approach offers a powerful theoretical tool for interpreting quantum spectroscopic data and paves the way for probing more complex light-matter interactions in materials.</description>

      <title>Path sampling challenges in large biomolecular systems: RETIS and REPPTIS for ABL-imatinib kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the kinetics of drug-protein interactions is crucial for understanding drug efficacy, particularly in personalized medicine, where protein mutations can significantly alter drug residence times. This study applies Replica Exchange Transition Interface Sampling (RETIS) and its Partial Path variant (REPPTIS) to investigate the dissociation kinetics of imatinib from Abelson nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (ABL) and mutants relevant to chronic myeloid leukemia therapy. These path-sampling methods offer a bias-free alternative to conventional approaches requiring qualitative predefined reaction coordinates. Nevertheless, the complex free-energy landscape of ABL-imatinib dissociation presents significant challenges. Multiple metastable states and orthogonal barriers lead to parallel unbinding pathways, complicating convergence in TIS-based methods. Despite employing computational efficiency strategies such as asynchronous replica exchange, full convergence remained elusive. This work provides a critical assessment of path sampling in high-dimensional biological systems, discussing the need for enhanced initialization strategies, advanced Monte Carlo path generation moves, and machine learning-derived reaction coordinates to improve kinetic predictions of drug dissociation with minimal prior knowledge.</description>

      <title>Maximum Entropy Production Principle of Thermodynamics for the Birth and Evolution of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on the birth and evolution of life are reviewed with reference to the maximum entropy production principle (MEPP). It has been shown that this principle is essential for consistent understanding of the birth and evolution of life. First, a recent work for the birth of a self-replicative system as pre-RNA life is reviewed in relation to the MEPP. A critical condition of polymer concentration in a local system is reported by a dynamical system approach, above which, an exponential increase of entropy production is guaranteed. Secondly, research works of early stage of evolutions are reviewed; experimental research for the numbers of cells necessary for forming a multi-cellular organization, and numerical research of differentiation of a model system and its relation with MEPP. It is suggested by this review article that the late stage of evolution is characterized by formation of society and external entropy production. A hypothesis on the general route of evolution is discussed from the birth to the present life which follows the MEPP. Some examples of life which happened to face poor thermodynamic condition are presented with thermodynamic discussion. It is observed through this review that MEPP is consistently useful for thermodynamic understanding of birth and evolution of life, subject to a thermodynamic condition far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Predicting Methane Adsorption in Metal-Substituted MOFs: A Comparative Study between Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for methane capture due to their high surface area and tunable properties. Metal substitution represents a powerful strategy to enhance MOF performance, yet systematic exploration of the vast chemical space remains challenging. In this work, we compare density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) in predicting methane adsorption properties in metal-substituted variants of three high-performing MOFs: M-HKUST-1, M-ATC, and M-ZIF-8 (M = Cu, Zn). DFT calculations reveal significant differences in methane binding energetics between Cu and Zn variants of all three MOFs. On the other hand, we fine-tuned a pretrained multimodal ML model, PMTransformer, on a curated subset of hypothetical MOF (hMOF) structures to predict macroscopic adsorption properties. While the model qualitatively predicts adsorption properties for the original unaltered MOFs, it fails to distinguish between metal variants despite their different binding energetics identified by DFT. We trace this limitation to the hMOF training data generated using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations based on classical force fields (UFF/TraPPE). Our study highlights a key challenge in ML-based MOF screening: ML models inherit the limitations of their training data, particularly when electronic effects significantly impact adsorption behavior. Our findings emphasize the need for improved force fields or hybrid GCMC/DFT datasets to incorporate both geometric and electronic factors for accurate prediction of adsorption properties in metal-substituted MOFs.</description>

      <title>Simulating biochemical reactions: The Linear Noise Approximation can capture non-linear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a plethora of highly stochastic non-linear dynamical systems in fields such as molecular biology, chemistry, epidemiology, and ecology. Yet, none of the currently available stochastic models are both accurate and computationally efficient for long-term predictions of large systems. The Linear Noise Approximation (LNA) model for biochemical reaction networks is analytically tractable, which makes it computationally efficient for simulation, analysis, and inference. However, it is only accurate for linear systems and short-time transitions. Other methods can achieve greater accuracy across a wider range of systems, including non-linear ones, but lack analytical tractability. This paper seeks to challenge the prevailing view by demonstrating that the Linear Noise Approximation can indeed capture non-linear dynamics after certain modifications. We introduce a new framework that utilises centre manifold theory allowing us to identify simple interventions to the LNA that do not significantly compromise its computational efficiency. We develop specific algorithms for systems that exhibit oscillations or bi-stability and demonstrate their accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple examples.</description>

      <title>Broadband Fourier transform spectroscopy of quantum emitters photoluminescence with sub-nanosecond temporal resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral characterization of quantum emitter luminescence over broad wavelength ranges and fast timescales is important for applications ranging from biophysics to quantum technologies. Here we present the application of time-domain Fourier transform spectroscopy, based on a compact and stable birefringent interferometer coupled to low-dark-count superconducting single-photon detectors, to the study of quantum emitters. We experimentally demonstrate that the system enables spectroscopy of quantum emitters over a broad wavelength interval from the near-infrared to the telecom range, where grating-based spectrometers coupled to InGaAs cameras are typically noisy and inefficient. We further show that the high temporal resolution of single-photon detectors, which can be on the order of tens of picoseconds, enables the monitoring of spin-dependent spectral changes on sub-nanosecond timescales.</description>

      <title>Laser-Synthesized Ligand-Free Cu Nanocatalysts in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Methane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) represents a pivotal strategy for mitigating global carbon emissions while simultaneously converting renewable energy into storable chemical fuels. Copper-based catalysts have been extensively explored in this field due to their unique capability to catalyze multi-carbon products. However, the intrinsic complexity of eCO2R pathways on Cu surfaces often leads to mixed product distributions, posing a significant challenge for achieving high selectivity toward a single desired hydrocarbon. Herein, we report a breakthrough in methane selectivity using laser-synthesized, ligand-free Cu nanomaterials. Unlike conventional Cu catalysts that produce diverse products, these ligand-free nanoparticles exhibit unprecedented selectivity for methane (CH4) with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 70% at superior overpotentials. The absence of surface ligands, a direct consequence of the ultrafast laser ablation synthesis, ensures abundant exposed active sites with tailored electronic and geometric configurations. We attribute the exceptional methane selectivity to the synergistic effects of active sites-rich surfaces and optimized *CO intermediate binding energetics, which favor the protonation pathway toward CH4 rather than C-C coupling. This work not only resolves the long-standing selectivity dilemma in Cu-catalyzed eCO2R but also establishes laser-synthesized ligand-free nanomaterials as a versatile platform for designing high-performance electrocatalysts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</description>
