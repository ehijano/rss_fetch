      <title>Classification of Adventitious Sounds Combining Cochleogram and Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early identification of respiratory irregularities is critical for improving lung health and reducing global mortality rates. The analysis of respiratory sounds plays a significant role in characterizing the respiratory system's condition and identifying abnormalities. The main contribution of this study is to investigate the performance when the input data, represented by cochleogram, is used to feed the Vision Transformer architecture, since this input classifier combination is the first time it has been applied to adventitious sound classification to our knowledge. Although ViT has shown promising results in audio classification tasks by applying self attention to spectrogram patches, we extend this approach by applying the cochleogram, which captures specific spectro-temporal features of adventitious sounds. The proposed methodology is evaluated on the ICBHI dataset. We compare the classification performance of ViT with other state of the art CNN approaches using spectrogram, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients, constant Q transform, and cochleogram as input data. Our results confirm the superior classification performance combining cochleogram and ViT, highlighting the potential of ViT for reliable respiratory sound classification. This study contributes to the ongoing efforts in developing automatic intelligent techniques with the aim to significantly augment the speed and effectiveness of respiratory disease detection, thereby addressing a critical need in the medical field.</description>

      <title>A Kalman Filter model for synchronization in musical ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synchronization of motor responses to rhythmic auditory cues is a fundamental biological phenomenon observed across various species. While the importance of temporal alignment varies across different contexts, achieving precise temporal synchronization is a prominent goal in musical performances. Musicians often incorporate expressive timing variations, which require precise control over timing and synchronization, particularly in ensemble performance. This is crucial because both deliberate expressive nuances and accidental timing deviations can affect the overall timing of a performance. This discussion prompts the question of how musicians adjust their temporal dynamics to achieve synchronization within an ensemble. This paper introduces a novel feedback correction model based on the Kalman Filter, aimed at improving the understanding of interpersonal timing in ensemble music performances. The proposed model performs similarly to other linear correction models in the literature, with the advantage of low computational cost and good performance even in scenarios where the underlying tempo varies.</description>

      <title>Speech-Based Estimation of Schizophrenia Severity Using Feature Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech-based assessment of the schizophrenia spectrum has been widely researched over in the recent past. In this study, we develop a deep learning framework to estimate schizophrenia severity scores from speech using a feature fusion approach that fuses articulatory features with different self-supervised speech features extracted from pre-trained audio models. We also propose an auto-encoder-based self-supervised representation learning framework to extract compact articulatory embeddings from speech. Our top-performing speech-based fusion model with Multi-Head Attention (MHA) reduces Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 9.18% and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 9.36% for schizophrenia severity estimation when compared with the previous models that combined speech and video inputs.</description>

      <title>Selective State Space Model for Monaural Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voice user interfaces (VUIs) have facilitated the efficient interactions between humans and machines through spoken commands. Since real-word acoustic scenes are complex, speech enhancement plays a critical role for robust VUI. Transformer and its variants, such as Conformer, have demonstrated cutting-edge results in speech enhancement. However, both of them suffers from the quadratic computational complexity with respect to the sequence length, which hampers their ability to handle long sequences. Recently a novel State Space Model called Mamba, which shows strong capability to handle long sequences with linear complexity, offers a solution to address this challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid convolution-Mamba backbone, denoted as MambaDC, for speech enhancement. Our MambaDC marries the benefits of convolutional networks to model the local interactions and Mamba's ability for modeling long-range global dependencies. We conduct comprehensive experiments within both basic and state-of-the-art (SoTA) speech enhancement frameworks, on two commonly used training targets. The results demonstrate that MambaDC outperforms Transformer, Conformer, and the standard Mamba across all training targets. Built upon the current advanced framework, the use of MambaDC backbone showcases superior results compared to existing \textcolor{black}{SoTA} systems. This sets the stage for efficient long-range global modeling in speech enhancement.</description>

      <title>PSELDNets: Pre-trained Neural Networks on Large-scale Synthetic Datasets for Sound Event Localization and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound event localization and detection (SELD) has seen substantial advancements through learning-based methods. These systems, typically trained from scratch on specific datasets, have shown considerable generalization capabilities. Recently, deep neural networks trained on large-scale datasets have achieved remarkable success in the sound event classification (SEC) field, prompting an open question of whether these advancements can be extended to develop general-purpose SELD models. In this paper, leveraging the power of pre-trained SEC models, we propose pre-trained SELD networks (PSELDNets) on large-scale synthetic datasets. These synthetic datasets, generated by convolving sound events with simulated spatial room impulse responses (SRIRs), contain 1,167 hours of audio clips with an ontology of 170 sound classes. These PSELDNets are transferred to downstream SELD tasks. When we adapt PSELDNets to specific scenarios, particularly in low-resource data cases, we introduce a data-efficient fine-tuning method, AdapterBit. PSELDNets are evaluated on a synthetic-test-set using collected SRIRs from TAU Spatial Room Impulse Response Database (TAU-SRIR DB) and achieve satisfactory performance. We also conduct our experiments to validate the transferability of PSELDNets to three publicly available datasets and our own collected audio recordings. Results demonstrate that PSELDNets surpass state-of-the-art systems across all publicly available datasets. Given the need for direction-of-arrival estimation, SELD generally relies on sufficient multi-channel audio clips. However, incorporating the AdapterBit, PSELDNets show more efficient adaptability to various tasks using minimal multi-channel or even just monophonic audio clips, outperforming the traditional fine-tuning approaches.</description>

      <title>CTC-Assisted LLM-Based Contextual ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextual ASR or hotword customization holds substantial practical value. Despite the impressive performance of current end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, they often face challenges in accurately recognizing rare words. Typical E2E contextual ASR models commonly feature complex architectures and decoding mechanisms, limited in performance and susceptible to interference from distractor words. With large language model (LLM)-based ASR models emerging as the new mainstream, we propose a CTC-Assisted LLM-Based Contextual ASR model with an efficient filtering algorithm. By using coarse CTC decoding results to filter potential relevant hotwords and incorporating them into LLM prompt input, our model attains WER/B-WER of 1.27%/3.67% and 2.72%/8.02% on the Librispeech test-clean and test-other sets targeting on recognizing rare long-tail words, demonstrating significant improvements compared to the baseline LLM-based ASR model, and substantially surpassing other related work. More remarkably, with the help of the large language model and proposed filtering algorithm, our contextual ASR model still performs well with 2000 biasing words.</description>

      <title>Debatts: Zero-Shot Debating Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In debating, rebuttal is one of the most critical stages, where a speaker addresses the arguments presented by the opposing side. During this process, the speaker synthesizes their own persuasive articulation given the context from the opposing side. This work proposes a novel zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis system for rebuttal, namely Debatts. Debatts takes two speech prompts, one from the opposing side (i.e. opponent) and one from the speaker. The prompt from the opponent is supposed to provide debating style prosody, and the prompt from the speaker provides identity information. In particular, we pretrain the Debatts system from in-the-wild dataset, and integrate an additional reference encoder to take debating prompt for style. In addition, we also create a debating dataset to develop Debatts. In this setting, Debatts can generate a debating-style speech in rebuttal for any voices. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system in comparison with the classic zero-shot TTS systems.</description>

      <title>Diff-MSTC: A Mixing Style Transfer Prototype for Cubase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our demo, participants are invited to explore the Diff-MSTC prototype, which integrates the Diff-MST model into Steinberg's digital audio workstation (DAW), Cubase. Diff-MST, a deep learning model for mixing style transfer, forecasts mixing console parameters for tracks using a reference song. The system processes up to 20 raw tracks along with a reference song to predict mixing console parameters that can be used to create an initial mix. Users have the option to manually adjust these parameters further for greater control. In contrast to earlier deep learning systems that are limited to research ideas, Diff-MSTC is a first-of-its-kind prototype integrated into a DAW. This integration facilitates mixing decisions on multitracks and lets users input context through a reference song, followed by fine-tuning of audio effects in a traditional manner.</description>

      <title>DCF-DS: Deep Cascade Fusion of Diarization and Separation for Speech Recognition under Realistic Single-Channel Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a single-channel Deep Cascade Fusion of Diarization and Separation (DCF-DS) framework for back-end speech recognition, combining neural speaker diarization (NSD) and speech separation (SS). First, we sequentially integrate the NSD and SS modules within a joint training framework, enabling the separation module to leverage speaker time boundaries from the diarization module effectively. Then, to complement DCF-DS training, we introduce a window-level decoding scheme that allows the DCF-DS framework to handle the sparse data convergence instability (SDCI) problem. We also explore using an NSD system trained on real datasets to provide more accurate speaker boundaries during decoding. Additionally, we incorporate an optional multi-input multi-output speech enhancement module (MIMO-SE) within the DCF-DS framework, which offers further performance gains. Finally, we enhance diarization results by re-clustering DCF-DS outputs, improving ASR accuracy. By incorporating the DCF-DS method, we achieved first place in the realistic single-channel track of the CHiME-8 NOTSOFAR-1 challenge. We also perform the evaluation on the open LibriCSS dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on single-channel speech recognition.</description>

      <title>Beyond Correlation: Evaluating Multimedia Quality Models with the Constrained Concordance Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the evaluation of multimedia quality models, focusing on the inherent uncertainties in subjective Mean Opinion Score (MOS) ratings due to factors like rater inconsistency and bias. Traditional statistical measures such as Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC), and Kendall's Tau (KTAU) often fail to account for these uncertainties, leading to inaccuracies in model performance assessment. We introduce the Constrained Concordance Index (CCI), a novel metric designed to overcome the limitations of existing metrics by considering the statistical significance of MOS differences and excluding comparisons where MOS confidence intervals overlap. Through comprehensive experiments across various domains including speech and image quality assessment, we demonstrate that CCI provides a more robust and accurate evaluation of instrumental quality models, especially in scenarios of low sample sizes, rater group variability, and restriction of range. Our findings suggest that incorporating rater subjectivity and focusing on statistically significant pairs can significantly enhance the evaluation framework for multimedia quality prediction models. This work not only sheds light on the overlooked aspects of subjective rating uncertainties but also proposes a methodological advancement for more reliable and accurate quality model evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for Arabic, a language characterized by its rich dialectal diversity and often considered a low-resource language in speech technology, demands effective strategies to manage its complexity. This study explores three critical factors influencing ASR performance: the role of dialectal coverage in pre-training, the effectiveness of dialect-specific fine-tuning compared to a multi-dialectal approach, and the ability to generalize to unseen dialects. Through extensive experiments across different dialect combinations, our findings offer key insights towards advancing the development of ASR systems for pluricentric languages like Arabic.</description>

      <title>NeKo: Toward Post Recognition Generative Correction Large Language Models with Task-Oriented Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Construction of a general-purpose post-recognition error corrector poses a crucial question: how can we most effectively train a model on a large mixture of domain datasets? The answer would lie in learning dataset-specific features and digesting their knowledge in a single model. Previous methods achieve this by having separate correction language models, resulting in a significant increase in parameters. In this work, we present Mixture-of-Experts as a solution, highlighting that MoEs are much more than a scalability tool. We propose a Multi-Task Correction MoE, where we train the experts to become an ``expert'' of speech-to-text, language-to-text and vision-to-text datasets by learning to route each dataset's tokens to its mapped expert. Experiments on the Open ASR Leaderboard show that we explore a new state-of-the-art performance by achieving an average relative $5.0$% WER reduction and substantial improvements in BLEU scores for speech and translation tasks. On zero-shot evaluation, NeKo outperforms GPT-3.5 and Claude-Opus with $15.5$% to $27.6$% relative WER reduction in the Hyporadise benchmark. NeKo performs competitively on grammar and post-OCR correction as a multi-task model.</description>

      <title>Toward Transdisciplinary Approaches to Audio Deepfake Discernment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This perspective calls for scholars across disciplines to address the challenge of audio deepfake detection and discernment through an interdisciplinary lens across Artificial Intelligence methods and linguistics. With an avalanche of tools for the generation of realistic-sounding fake speech on one side, the detection of deepfakes is lagging on the other. Particularly hindering audio deepfake detection is the fact that current AI models lack a full understanding of the inherent variability of language and the complexities and uniqueness of human speech. We see the promising potential in recent transdisciplinary work that incorporates linguistic knowledge into AI approaches to provide pathways for expert-in-the-loop and to move beyond expert agnostic AI-based methods for more robust and comprehensive deepfake detection.</description>

Abstract: This study focuses on Intelligent Fault Diagnosis (IFD) in rotating machinery utilizing a single microphone and a data-driven methodology, effectively diagnosing 42 classes of fault types and severities. The research leverages sound data from the imbalanced MaFaulDa dataset, aiming to strike a balance between high performance and low resource consumption. The testing phase encompassed a variety of configurations, including sampling, quantization, signal normalization, silence removal, Wiener filtering, data scaling, windowing, augmentation, and classifier tuning using XGBoost. Through the analysis of time, frequency, mel-frequency, and statistical features, we achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.54% and an F-Beta score of 99.52% with just 6 boosting trees at an 8 kHz, 8-bit configuration. Moreover, when utilizing only MFCCs along with their first- and second-order deltas, we recorded an accuracy of 97.83% and an F-Beta score of 97.67%. Lastly, by implementing a greedy wrapper approach, we obtained a remarkable accuracy of 96.82% and an F-Beta score of 98.86% using 50 selected features, nearly all of which were first- and second-order deltas of the MFCCs.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Volume Rendering for Neural Impulse Response Fields</title>

Abstract: Realistic audio synthesis that captures accurate acoustic phenomena is essential for creating immersive experiences in virtual and augmented reality. Synthesizing the sound received at any position relies on the estimation of impulse response (IR), which characterizes how sound propagates in one scene along different paths before arriving at the listener's position. In this paper, we present Acoustic Volume Rendering (AVR), a novel approach that adapts volume rendering techniques to model acoustic impulse responses. While volume rendering has been successful in modeling radiance fields for images and neural scene representations, IRs present unique challenges as time-series signals. To address these challenges, we introduce frequency-domain volume rendering and use spherical integration to fit the IR measurements. Our method constructs an impulse response field that inherently encodes wave propagation principles and achieves state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing impulse responses for novel poses. Experiments show that AVR surpasses current leading methods by a substantial margin. Additionally, we develop an acoustic simulation platform, AcoustiX, which provides more accurate and realistic IR simulations than existing simulators. Code for AVR and AcoustiX are available at https://zitonglan.github.io/avr.</description>

      <title>Wavehax: Aliasing-Free Neural Waveform Synthesis Based on 2D Convolution and Harmonic Prior for Reliable Complex Spectrogram Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural vocoders often struggle with aliasing in latent feature spaces, caused by time-domain nonlinear operations and resampling layers. Aliasing folds high-frequency components into the low-frequency range, making aliased and original frequency components indistinguishable and introducing two practical issues. First, aliasing complicates the waveform generation process, as the subsequent layers must address these aliasing effects, increasing the computational complexity. Second, it limits extrapolation performance, particularly in handling high fundamental frequencies, which degrades the perceptual quality of generated speech waveforms. This paper demonstrates that 1) time-domain nonlinear operations inevitably introduce aliasing but provide a strong inductive bias for harmonic generation, and 2) time-frequency-domain processing can achieve aliasing-free waveform synthesis but lacks the inductive bias for effective harmonic generation. Building on this insight, we propose Wavehax, an aliasing-free neural WAVEform generator that integrates 2D convolution and a HArmonic prior for reliable Complex Spectrogram estimation. Experimental results show that Wavehax achieves speech quality comparable to existing high-fidelity neural vocoders and exhibits exceptional robustness in scenarios requiring high fundamental frequency extrapolation, where aliasing effects become typically severe. Moreover, Wavehax requires less than 5% of the multiply-accumulate operations and model parameters compared to HiFi-GAN V1, while achieving over four times faster CPU inference speed.</description>

      <title>Electroencephalogram-based Multi-class Decoding of Attended Speakers' Direction with Audio Spatial Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding the directional focus of an attended speaker from listeners' electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is essential for developing brain-computer interfaces to improve the quality of life for individuals with hearing impairment. Previous works have concentrated on binary directional focus decoding, i.e., determining whether the attended speaker is on the left or right side of the listener. However, a more precise decoding of the exact direction of the attended speaker is necessary for effective speech processing. Additionally, audio spatial information has not been effectively leveraged, resulting in suboptimal decoding results. In this paper, we observe that, on our recently presented dataset with 15-class directional focus, models relying exclusively on EEG inputs exhibits significantly lower accuracy when decoding the directional focus in both leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-trial-out scenarios. By integrating audio spatial spectra with EEG features, the decoding accuracy can be effectively improved. We employ the CNN, LSM-CNN, and EEG-Deformer models to decode the directional focus from listeners' EEG signals with the auxiliary audio spatial spectra. The proposed Sp-Aux-Deformer model achieves notable 15-class decoding accuracies of 57.48% and 61.83% in leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-trial-out scenarios, respectively.</description>

      <title>Mamba-based Decoder-Only Approach with Bidirectional Speech Modeling for Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selective state space models (SSMs) represented by Mamba have demonstrated their computational efficiency and promising outcomes in various tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR). Mamba has been applied to ASR task with the attention-based encoder-decoder framework, where the cross-attention mechanism between encoder and decoder remains. This paper explores the capability of Mamba as the decoder-only architecture in ASR task. Our MAmba-based DEcoder-ONly approach (MADEON) consists of a single decoder that takes speech tokens as a condition and predicts text tokens in an autoregressive manner. To enhance MADEON, we further propose speech prefixing that performs bidirectional processing on speech tokens, which enriches the contextual information in the hidden states. Our experiments show that MADEON significantly outperforms a non-selective SSM. The combination of speech prefixing and the recently proposed Mamba-2 yields comparable performance to Transformer-based models on large datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This technical report presents our initial attempt to build a spoken large language model (LLM) for Taiwanese Mandarin, specifically tailored to enable real-time, speech-to-speech interaction in multi-turn conversations. Our end-to-end model incorporates a decoder-only transformer architecture and aims to achieve seamless interaction while preserving the conversational flow, including full-duplex capabilities allowing simultaneous speaking and listening. The paper also details the training process, including data preparation with synthesized dialogues and adjustments for real-time interaction. We also developed a platform to evaluate conversational fluency and response coherence in multi-turn dialogues. We hope the release of the report can contribute to the future development of spoken LLMs in Taiwanese Mandarin.</description>

      <title>NatureLM-audio: an Audio-Language Foundation Model for Bioacoustics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) prompted with text and audio represent the state of the art in various auditory tasks, including speech, music, and general audio, showing emergent abilities on unseen tasks. However, these capabilities have yet to be fully demonstrated in bioacoustics tasks, such as detecting animal vocalizations in large recordings, classifying rare and endangered species, and labeling context and behavior - tasks that are crucial for conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and the study of animal behavior. In this work, we present NatureLM-audio, the first audio-language foundation model specifically designed for bioacoustics. Our carefully curated training dataset comprises text-audio pairs spanning a diverse range of bioacoustics, speech, and music data, designed to address the challenges posed by limited annotated datasets in the field. We demonstrate successful transfer of learned representations from music and speech to bioacoustics, and our model shows promising generalization to unseen taxa and tasks. Importantly, we test NatureLM-audio on a novel benchmark (BEANS-Zero) and it sets the new state of the art (SotA) on several bioacoustics tasks, including zero-shot classification of unseen species. To advance bioacoustics research, we also open-source the code for generating training and benchmark data, as well as for training the model.</description>

      <title>Learning Disentangled Speech Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disentangled representation learning in speech processing has lagged behind other domains, largely due to the lack of datasets with annotated generative factors for robust evaluation. To address this, we propose SynSpeech, a novel large-scale synthetic speech dataset specifically designed to enable research on disentangled speech representations. SynSpeech includes controlled variations in speaker identity, spoken text, and speaking style, with three dataset versions to support experimentation at different levels of complexity.
  In this study, we present a comprehensive framework to evaluate disentangled representation learning techniques, applying both linear probing and established supervised disentanglement metrics to assess the modularity, compactness, and explicitness of the representations learned by a state-of-the-art model. Using the RAVE model as a test case, we find that SynSpeech facilitates benchmarking across a range of factors, achieving promising disentanglement of simpler features like gender and speaking style, while highlighting challenges in isolating complex attributes like speaker identity. This benchmark dataset and evaluation framework fills a critical gap, supporting the development of more robust and interpretable speech representation learning methods.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models for Audio Restoration</title>

Abstract: With the development of audio playback devices and fast data transmission, the demand for high sound quality is rising for both entertainment and communications. In this quest for better sound quality, challenges emerge from distortions and interferences originating at the recording side or caused by an imperfect transmission pipeline. To address this problem, audio restoration methods aim to recover clean sound signals from the corrupted input data. We present here audio restoration algorithms based on diffusion models, with a focus on speech enhancement and music restoration tasks. Traditional approaches, often grounded in handcrafted rules and statistical heuristics, have shaped our understanding of audio signals. In the past decades, there has been a notable shift towards data-driven methods that exploit the modeling capabilities of DNNs. Deep generative models, and among them diffusion models, have emerged as powerful techniques for learning complex data distributions. However, relying solely on DNN-based learning approaches carries the risk of reducing interpretability, particularly when employing end-to-end models. Nonetheless, data-driven approaches allow more flexibility in comparison to statistical model-based frameworks, whose performance depends on distributional and statistical assumptions that can be difficult to guarantee. Here, we aim to show that diffusion models can combine the best of both worlds and offer the opportunity to design audio restoration algorithms with a good degree of interpretability and a remarkable performance in terms of sound quality. We explain the diffusion formalism and its application to the conditional generation of clean audio signals. We believe that diffusion models open an exciting field of research with the potential to spawn new audio restoration algorithms that are natural-sounding and remain robust in difficult acoustic situations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the systems developed by the SJTU X-LANCE team for LIMMITS 2023 Challenge, and we mainly focus on the winning system on naturalness for track 1. The aim of this challenge is to build a multi-speaker multi-lingual text-to-speech (TTS) system for Marathi, Hindi and Telugu. Each of the languages has a male and a female speaker in the given dataset. In track 1, only 5 hours data from each speaker can be selected to train the TTS model. Our system is based on the recently proposed VQTTS that utilizes VQ acoustic feature rather than mel-spectrogram. We introduce additional speaker embeddings and language embeddings to VQTTS for controlling the speaker and language information. In the cross-lingual evaluations where we need to synthesize speech in a cross-lingual speaker's voice, we provide a native speaker's embedding to the acoustic model and the target speaker's embedding to the vocoder. In the subjective MOS listening test on naturalness, our system achieves 4.77 which ranks first.</description>

      <title>Delayed Memory Unit: Modelling Temporal Dependency Through Delay Gate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely recognized for their proficiency in modeling temporal dependencies, making them highly prevalent in sequential data processing applications. Nevertheless, vanilla RNNs are confronted with the well-known issue of gradient vanishing and exploding, posing a significant challenge for learning and establishing long-range dependencies. Additionally, gated RNNs tend to be over-parameterized, resulting in poor computational efficiency and network generalization. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Delayed Memory Unit (DMU). The DMU incorporates a delay line structure along with delay gates into vanilla RNN, thereby enhancing temporal interaction and facilitating temporal credit assignment. Specifically, the DMU is designed to directly distribute the input information to the optimal time instant in the future, rather than aggregating and redistributing it over time through intricate network dynamics. Our proposed DMU demonstrates superior temporal modeling capabilities across a broad range of sequential modeling tasks, utilizing considerably fewer parameters than other state-of-the-art gated RNN models in applications such as speech recognition, radar gesture recognition, ECG waveform segmentation, and permuted sequential image classification.</description>

      <title>EnchantDance: Unveiling the Potential of Music-Driven Dance Movement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of music-driven dance generation involves creating coherent dance movements that correspond to the given music. While existing methods can produce physically plausible dances, they often struggle to generalize to out-of-set data. The challenge arises from three aspects: 1) the high diversity of dance movements and significant differences in the distribution of music modalities, which make it difficult to generate music-aligned dance movements. 2) the lack of a large-scale music-dance dataset, which hinders the generation of generalized dance movements from music. 3) The protracted nature of dance movements poses a challenge to the maintenance of a consistent dance style. In this work, we introduce the EnchantDance framework, a state-of-the-art method for dance generation. Due to the redundancy of the original dance sequence along the time axis, EnchantDance first constructs a strong dance latent space and then trains a dance diffusion model on the dance latent space. To address the data gap, we construct a large-scale music-dance dataset, ChoreoSpectrum3D Dataset, which includes four dance genres and has a total duration of 70.32 hours, making it the largest reported music-dance dataset to date. To enhance consistency between music genre and dance style, we pre-train a music genre prediction network using transfer learning and incorporate music genre as extra conditional information in the training of the dance diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on dance quality, diversity, and consistency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) models trained on audio data may have the potential to rapidly perform clinical tasks, enhancing medical decision-making and potentially improving outcomes through early detection. Existing technologies depend on limited datasets collected with expensive recording equipment in high-income countries, which challenges deployment in resource-constrained, high-volume settings where audio data may have a profound impact on health equity. This report introduces a novel data type and a corresponding collection system that captures health data through guided questions using only a mobile/web application. The app facilitates the collection of an audio electronic health record (Voice EHR) which may contain complex biomarkers of health from conventional voice/respiratory features, speech patterns, and spoken language with semantic meaning and longitudinal context, potentially compensating for the typical limitations of unimodal clinical datasets. This report presents the application used for data collection, initial experiments on data quality, and case studies which demonstrate the potential of voice EHR to advance the scalability/diversity of audio AI.</description>

      <title>Music Proofreading with RefinPaint: Where and How to Modify Compositions given Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive generative transformers are key in music generation, producing coherent compositions but facing challenges in human-machine collaboration. We propose RefinPaint, an iterative technique that improves the sampling process. It does this by identifying the weaker music elements using a feedback model, which then informs the choices for resampling by an inpainting model. This dual-focus methodology not only facilitates the machine's ability to improve its automatic inpainting generation through repeated cycles but also offers a valuable tool for humans seeking to refine their compositions with automatic proofreading. Experimental results suggest RefinPaint's effectiveness in inpainting and proofreading tasks, demonstrating its value for refining music created by both machines and humans. This approach not only facilitates creativity but also aids amateur composers in improving their work.</description>

      <title>Transducer Consistency Regularization for Speech to Text Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07491</link>

Abstract: Consistency regularization is a commonly used practice to encourage the model to generate consistent representation from distorted input features and improve model generalization. It shows significant improvement on various speech applications that are optimized with cross entropy criterion. However, it is not straightforward to apply consistency regularization for the transducer-based approaches, which are widely adopted for speech applications due to the competitive performance and streaming characteristic. The main challenge is from the vast alignment space of the transducer optimization criterion and not all the alignments within the space contribute to the model optimization equally. In this study, we present Transducer Consistency Regularization (TCR), a consistency regularization method for transducer models. We apply distortions such as spec augmentation and dropout to create different data views and minimize the distribution difference. We utilize occupational probabilities to give different weights on transducer output distributions, thus only alignments close to oracle alignments would contribute to the model learning. Our experiments show the proposed method is superior to other consistency regularization implementations and could effectively reduce word error rate (WER) by 4.3\% relatively comparing with a strong baseline on the \textsc{Librispeech} dataset.</description>

      <title>Fish-Speech: Leveraging Large Language Models for Advanced Multilingual Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems face ongoing challenges in processing complex linguistic features, handling polyphonic expressions, and producing natural-sounding multilingual speech - capabilities that are crucial for future AI applications. In this paper, we present Fish-Speech, a novel framework that implements a serial fast-slow Dual Autoregressive (Dual-AR) architecture to enhance the stability of Grouped Finite Scalar Vector Quantization (GFSQ) in sequence generation tasks. This architecture improves codebook processing efficiency while maintaining high-fidelity outputs, making it particularly effective for AI interactions and voice cloning.
  Fish-Speech leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for linguistic feature extraction, eliminating the need for traditional grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion and thereby streamlining the synthesis pipeline and enhancing multilingual support. Additionally, we developed FF-GAN through GFSQ to achieve superior compression ratios and near 100\% codebook utilization.
  Our approach addresses key limitations of current TTS systems while providing a foundation for more sophisticated, context-aware speech synthesis. Experimental results show that Fish-Speech significantly outperforms baseline models in handling complex linguistic scenarios and voice cloning tasks, demonstrating its potential to advance TTS technology in AI applications. The implementation is open source at \href{https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-speech}{https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-speech}.</description>
