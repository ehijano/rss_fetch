      <title>Time Reversal Symmetry Breaking and {\it Fragile Magnetic Superconductors}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Roughly twenty reports (as of 2025) of time-reversal-symmetry breaking (TRSB) states in low critical temperature (T$_c$) superconducting (SC), otherwise conventional Fermi liquid, metals have emerged primarily from muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) data. The detected fields, inferred from the current interpretation of depolarization data, are similar in magnitude and not far above the lower limit of detection, corresponding to magnetizations of no more than 10$^{-3}$ $\mu_B$/atom. These materials comprise a new class of {\it fragile magnetic superconductors} modeled as triplet pairing. The measured SC state properties, excepting only the fields detected below T$_c$, are representative of low T$_c$ singlet BCS SCs, not showing unusual coherence lengths or critical fields. While it is recognized that the muon does affect the sample by displacing nearby atoms and impacting magnetic interaction parameters, the measurement process, changing the system from sample $\rightarrow$ sample+$\mu^+$ thereby breaking TRS, may deserve further scrutiny. This overview provides a survey of the environment of the muon, from the normal state to the superfluid state, where the induced supercurrent and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov gap states provide coupling of the muon moment to the superfluid. The unusual topological superconductor LaNiGa$_2$, currently modeled as non-unitary triplet, is used as a case study. Supposing that the prevailing $\mu$SR inference of a small spontaneous field within the bulk of theSC obtains, the current picture of (possibly non-unitary) triplet pairing is discussed and an attractive alternative for LaNiGa$_2$ is noted.</description>

      <title>Introduction to High-Temperature Superconductivity for Solid State Chemists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity is one of the most amazing properties that metallic conductors exhibit. Electrical resistance is completely eliminated below the critical temperature (Tc), which is the most important parameter in superconductivity. Since the discovery of copper oxide superconductors 39 years ago, many solid state chemists have made significant contributions to the field by discovering new compounds and producing high-quality samples for physical measurements. However, superconductivity research remains challenging for most solid state chemists because it requires knowledge of complicated solid state physics. This manuscript aims to provide a simple, intuitive introduction to superconductivity using only fundamental physics concepts that solid state chemists are familiar with. The author investigates a wide range of materials and classifies them according to the superconductivity mechanisms that may drive them. Specifically focusing on a series of copper oxide superconductors with the highest Tc at ambient conditions, the remarkable material dependence of Tc and the underlying, unconventional superconductivity mechanism that leads to the high Tc are thoroughly examined. Although our understanding of cuprate superconductivity is still fragmented, the author believes that once the branches and leaves are removed, the story will be fairly simple, similar to the phonon-based superconductivity mechanism revealed by the BCS theory. Furthermore, potential strategies for raising the Tc of cuprates and other superconductors are discussed. The author hopes that this article will pique interest in superconductors in young solid state chemists and encourage them to pursue the discovery of still unknown and unexplored room-temperature superconductors in the future.</description>

      <title>Limits of Thermal Conductance Quantization in Chiral Topological Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate thermal and non-local electrical transport in four-terminal Josephson junctions formed by a normal region coupled to two transverse chiral superconducting leads, supporting phases characterized by Chern numbers ${\cal C}=0,\,1$\,and\,2. We identify the conditions under which a single chiral Majorana mode (${\cal C}=1$) produces a robust half-quantized thermal conductance, while non-local electrical conductance remains strongly suppressed by particle-hole symmetry. Thermal conductance quantization occurs near a superconducting phase difference $\pi$, but only in the low-doping regime of the central region and in the intermediate- to long-junction limits. At finite Zeeman fields, the thermal response broadly follows the topology of the isolated superconducting leads for the $C=1$ phase while, in the ${\cal C}=2$ phase, the thermal conductance generally deviates from quantization, depending on the momentum-space location of the Majorana modes. Our results establish clear criteria for probing chiral Majorana modes in Josephson junctions and highlight the essential role of momentum-space structure, finite-size geometry, and sample parameters in thermal transport.</description>

      <title>Quantitative imaging of Abrikosov vortices by scanning quantum magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding vortex matter in type-II superconductors is central to controlling dissipation and flux pinning in superconducting materials and devices. Here, we use cryogenic scanning nitrogen vacancy magnetometry (NVM) to image Abrikosov vortices in the cuprate superconductors BSCCO-2212 and YBCO under controlled field-cooled conditions. Measurements, which are performed using continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (cw-ODMR) in a closed-cycle cryostat, yield quantitative magnetic-field maps with nanoscale spatial resolution. In BSCCO-2212 at 71 K, we resolve a well-ordered triangular vortex lattice, whose symmetry and spacing are confirmed through 2D Fourier analysis and are consistent with flux quantization. YBCO thin films imaged at 3 K exhibit a more disordered vortex arrangement reflecting stronger pinning, while maintaining quantitative agreement between measured vortex density and the applied magnetic field. These results render our cryogenic scanning NVM a reliable quantitative tool for real-space studies of vortices in high-$T_c$ superconductors, in particular since such a remarkable magnetic resolution has been achieved within relatively short acquisition times of 2 to 4 h.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering spin triplet states in unconventional magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider unconventional magnets with and without spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity and demonstrate the emergence of spin triplet states due to light drives. In particular, we find that a high-frequency linearly polarized light drive induces a spin-triplet density in $d$-wave altermagnets which does not exist in the static regime and can directly reveal the strength of the altermagnetic field. In this high-frequency regime, we also show that linearly polarized light enables the formation of odd-frequency spin-triplet superconducting correlations possessing $d$-wave and $s$-wave parities, which can be controlled by the light drive and accessed by measuring the spin density. Moreover, for low-frequency linearly and circularly polarized light drives, we obtain that the types of superconducting correlations are broadened due to the presence of Floquet bands, enabling spin-triplet pairs in $d$- and $p$-wave unconventional magnets, which are absent in the undriven phase.</description>

      <title>Reaching the intrinsic performance limits of superconducting strip photon detectors up to 0.1 mm wide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-photon detection underpins a wide range of emerging photonic technologies, from quantum information processing and secure communications to photon-starved biomedical imaging. Among the available detector technologies, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) combine high detection efficiency, low noise, and excellent timing resolution, making them a leading platform for photon-counting applications. However, despite decades of materials and fabrication research, detector performance has never been shown to match theoretical performance expectations. Here, we demonstrate for the first time in situ tuning of a detector from its typical, suboptimal operation, to a regime limited only by material quality, allowing the device to reach its intrinsic performance limit. Our approach is based on current-biased superconducting "rails" placed on either side of the detector that redistribute current across its width to achieve its peak performance. This technique not only reduces the dark count rate by ten orders of magnitude, but also enables future detectors to overcome the Pearl limit for device width, paving the way for arbitrarily large detectors. We show operation at this intrinsic performance limit for devices up to 0.1 mm wide, and also demonstrate near-unity internal detection efficiency (IDE) at a wavelength of 4um for a 20um-wide detector--a factor of 20 wider than the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>Nonhermitian topological zero modes at smooth domain walls: Exact solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bulk-boundary correspondence predicts the existence of boundary modes localized at the edges of topologically nontrivial systems. The wavefunctions of hermitian boundary modes can be obtained as the eigenmodes of a modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation. The bulk-boundary correspondence has also been extended to nonhermitian systems, which describe physical phenomena such as gain and loss in open and non-equilibrium systems. Nonhermitian energy spectra can be complex-valued and exhibit point gaps or line gaps in the complex plane, whether the gaps can be continuously deformed into points or lines, respectively. Specifically, line-gapped nonhermitian systems can be continuously deformed into hermitian gapped spectra. Here, we find the analytical form of the wavefunctions of nonhermitian boundary modes with zero energy localized at smooth domain boundaries between topologically distinct phases by solving the generalized Jackiw-Rebbi equation in the nonhermitian regime. Moreover, we unveil a universal relation between the scalar fields and the decay rate and oscillation wavelength of the boundary modes. This relation quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in nonhermitian line-gapped systems through physical quantities that are experimentally measurable. Furthermore, this relation is not affected by the specific spatial variations of the scalar fields. These results offer new insights into the localization properties of boundary modes in nonhermitian and topologically nontrivial states of matter.</description>

      <title>Lectures on insulating and conducting quantum spin liquids</title>

Abstract: Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the suggestion of P. W. Anderson, there were early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations:
  (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and
  (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_\Delta$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)).
  These notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to ultracold atom experiments on the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor. The ALM also leads to a wavefunction for the FL* state of the Hubbard model, which agrees with ultracold atom observations.</description>
