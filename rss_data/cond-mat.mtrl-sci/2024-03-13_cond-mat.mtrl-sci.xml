      <title>doped: Python toolkit for robust and repeatable charged defect supercell calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects are a universal feature of crystalline solids, dictating the key properties and performance of many functional materials. Given their crucial importance yet inherent difficulty in measuring experimentally, computational methods (such as DFT and ML/classical force-fields) are widely used to predict defect behaviour at the atomic level and the resultant impact on macroscopic properties. Here we report `doped`, a Python package for the generation, pre-/post-processing and analysis of defect supercell calculations. `doped` has been built to implement the defect simulation workflow in an efficient, user-friendly yet powerful and fully-flexible manner, with the goal of providing a robust general-purpose platform for conducting reproducible calculations of solid-state defect properties.</description>

      <title>X-ray induced grain structure dynamics in Bi2Se3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain rotation in crystals often results in coarsening or refinement of the grains that modify the mechanical and thermal properties of materials. While many studies have explored how externally applied stress and temperature drive grain structure dynamics in nano-polycrystalline materials, the analogous studies on colossal grains have been limited, especially in the absence of external force. In this work, we used X-ray free electron laser pulses to irradiate single-crystalline bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) and observed grain boundary formation and subsequent grain rotation in response to the X-ray radiation. Our observations with simultaneous X-ray diffraction and transmission X-ray microscopy demonstrate how intense X-ray radiation can rapidly change grain morphologies of initially single-crystalline material.</description>

      <title>Ferrimagnetic Heusler tunnel junctions with fast spin-transfer torque switching enabled by low magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic random access memory that uses magnetic tunnel junction memory cells is a high performance, non-volatile memory technology that goes beyond traditional charge-based memories. Today its speed is limited by the high magnetization of the memory storage layer. Here we show that fast and highly reliable switching is possible using a very low magnetization ferrimagnetic Heusler alloy, Mn3Ge. Moreover, the tunneling magnetoresistance is the highest yet achieved for a ferrimagnetic material at ambient temperature. Furthermore, the devices were prepared on technologically relevant amorphous substrates using a novel combination of a nitride seed layer and a chemical templating layer. These results show a clear path to the lowering of switching currents using ferrimagnetic Heusler materials and, therefore, to the scaling of high performance magnetic random access memories beyond those nodes possible with ferromagnetic devices.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the AMOEBA force field for simulating metal halide perovskites in the solid state and in solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we compare existing non-polarizable force fields developed to study the solid or solution phases of hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskites with the AMOEBA polarizable force field. The aim is to test whether more computationally expensive polarizable force fields like AMOEBA offer better transferability between solution and solid phases, with the ultimate goal being the study of crystal nucleation, growth and other interfacial phenomena involving these ionic compounds. In the context of hybrid perovskites, AMOEBA force field parameters already exist for several elements in solution and we decided to leave them unchanged and to only parameterize the missing ones (Pb\textsuperscript{2+} and CH\textsubscript{3}NH\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{+} ions) in order to maximise transferability and avoid over-fitting to the specific examples studied here. Overall, we find that AMOEBA yields accurate hydration free energies (within 5\%) for typical ionic species while showing the correct ordering of stability for the different crystal polymorphs of CsPbI\textsubscript{3} and CH\textsubscript{3}NH\textsubscript{3}PbI\textsubscript{3}. While the existing parameters do not accurately reproduce all transition temperatures and lattice parameters, AMOEBA offers better transferability between solution and solid states than existing non-polarizable force fields.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall effect in a van der Waals ferromagnet CrI3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CrI3 is a prototypical van der Waals ferromagnet with a magnetic honeycomb lattice. Previous inelastic neutron scattering studies have suggested topological nature of its magnetic excitations with a magnon gap at the Dirac points, which are anticipated to give rise to magnon thermal Hall effect. Here we report thermal transport properties of CrI3 and show that the long-sought thermal Hall signal anticipated for topological magnons is fairly small. In contrast, we find that CrI3 exhibits an appreciable anomalous thermal Hall signal at lower temperature which may arise from magnon-phonon hybridization or magnon-phonon scattering. These findings are anticipated to stimulate further neutron scattering studies on CrI3 single crystal, which can shed light not only on the intrinsic nature of magnetic excitations but also on the magnon-phonon interaction.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in typical $Pca2_1$ ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While ferroelectric hafnia ($\mathrm{HfO_2}$) has become a technically important material for microelectronics, the physical origin of its ferroelectricity remains poorly understood. The tetragonal $P4_2/nmc$ phase is commonly assigned as its paraelectric mother phase, but it has no soft mode at the Brillouin zone center. In this work, we propose that the paraelectric-ferroelectric transition in hafnia-like $Pca2_1$ ferroelectric family can be described by a $Pcca$-$Pca2_1$ transition, where the $Pcca$ mother phase will evolve into either the $Pca2_1$ ferroelectric phase or the centrosymmetric $P2_1/c$ monoclinic phase, depending on the strain conditions. The $Pcca$ phase is directly linked to both phases in the context of continuous phase transition. Hafnia is regarded as a special case of this family, in that it has accidental atomic degeneracy because all anions are oxygen. The theory is also correlated to the seven-coordination theory that explains the ferroelectricity in hafnia from a chemical perspective. In addition, the strain conditions to promote the ferroelectric phase in hafnia is discussed.</description>

      <title>The effect of cation-disorder on lithium transport in halide superionic conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the chloride-based Li-ion solid electrolytes, Li$_2$ZrCl$_6$ (LZC) have emerged as potential candidates due to their affordability, moisture stability, and high ionic conductivity. LZC synthesized by solid-state heating exhibits limited Li-ion conductivity while the mechanochemical ball-milled material is more conductive. In this computational study, we integrate thermodynamic modeling, using cluster-expansion Monte Carlo, and kinetic modeling, using molecular dynamics, to investigate whether cation disorder can be achieved in LZC, and how it affects Li-ion transport. Our results indicate that fast Li-ion conductivity is induced by the activation of Li/vacancy disorder, which itself depends on the degree of Zr disorder. We find that the very high-temperature scale at which equilibrium Zr-disorder can form precludes any equilibrium synthesis processes for achieving fast Li-ion conductivity, rationalizing why only non-equilibrium synthesis methods, such as ball milling leads to good conductivity. We identify as the critical mechanism the lack of Li/vacancy disorder near room temperature when Zr is well-ordered. Our simulations further show that the Li/vacancy order-disorder transition temperature is lowered by Zr disorder, which is necessary for creating high Li diffusivity at room temperature. The insights obtained from this study raise a challenge for the large-scale production of these materials and the potential for the long-term stability of their properties.</description>

      <title>Capturing electronic correlations in electron-phonon interactions in molecular systems with the GW approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-phonon interactions are of great importance to a variety of physical phenomena, and their accurate description is an important goal for first-principles calculations. Isolated examples of materials and molecular systems have emerged where electron-phonon coupling is enhanced over density functional theory (DFT) when using the Green's-function-based ab initio GW method, which provides a more accurate description of electronic correlations. It is however unclear how general this enhancement is, and how employing high-end quantum chemistry methods, which further improve the description of electronic correlations, might further alter electron-phonon interactions over GW or DFT. Here, we address these questions by computing the renormalization of the highest occupied molecular orbital energies of Thiel's set of organic molecules by harmonic vibrations using DFT, GW and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster calculations. We find that GW can increase the magnitude of the electron-phonon coupling across this set of molecules by an average factor of 1.1-1.8 compared to DFT, while equation-of-motion coupled-cluster leads to an increase of 1.4-2. The electron-phonon coupling predicted with the ab initio GW method is generally in much closer agreement to coupled cluster values compared to DFT, establishing GW as an accurate way of computing electron-phonon phenomena in molecules and beyond at a much lower computational cost than higher-end quantum chemistry techniques.</description>

      <title>Geometric and electronic properties of two kinds of CrO2 magnetic monolayers: D3d and D2h phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the high magnetic coupling strength between the Cr elements, the bulk phase CrO2 is one of several ferromagnetic oxides known to have the highest Curie temperature. When the dimensionality of the material is reduced from 3D to 2D, the 2D CrO2 system material is expected to maintain a high Curie temperature. In this work, we predict two new phases of CrO2 monolayer (D3d and D2h) by using first-principles calculations. We have found that the Curie temperature of 2D CrO2 is much lower than that of its bulk phase, but still remains as high as 191K, which is comparable to that of Fe2Cr2Ge6. In addition, 1L D3d-CrO2 is in the ferromagnetic state, while 1L D2h-CrO2 is in the antiferromagnetic state. Also, the different geometric structure affects its electrical properties: the 1L D3d-CrO2 is a half-metal while 1L D2h-CrO2 is a semiconductor. Our studies have shown that there is a wealth of electrical and magnetic properties in CrO2.</description>

      <title>Unraveling many-body effects in ZnO: Combined study using momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy and first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the dielectric response of ZnO using a combination of low-loss momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and first-principles calculations at several levels of theory, from the independent particle and the random phase approximation with different variants of density functional theory (DFT), including hybrid and DFT$+U$ schemes; to the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). We use a method based on the $f$-sum rule to obtain the momentum-resolved experimental loss function and absorption spectra from EELS measurements. We characterize the main features in the direct and inverse dielectric functions of ZnO and their dispersion, associating them to single-particle features in the electronic band structure, while highlighting the important role of many-body effects such as plasmons and excitons. We discuss different signatures of the high anisotropy in the response function of ZnO, including the symmetry of the excitonic wave-functions.</description>

      <title>Theoretical limits of magnetic detection of structural surface defects at the nanometer scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study on the magnetic signals of structural surface defects like cracks or indents combined with rough surfaces or subsurface inclusions of soft ferromagnetic metals like body-centered cubic Fe or amorphous CoFeB. We discuss limits of early detection of small surface defects on the basis of calculated magnetic stray fields few tens of nm above the surface. The considered surface imperfections have extensions of a few nm which correspond to low multiples of the magnetic exchange lengths of Fe or CoFeB. The detection of such small inhomogeneities requires that the sensor is about as close to the surface as the size of the inhomogeneity is. Furthermore, the step width of a scanning sensor must be of the same size as well. Both these requirements may be fulfilled for instance by scanning microscopy with diamond nitrogen-vacancy-center quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Study of Physical Characteristics of the New Half-Heusler Alloy BaHgSn by DFT Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the physical characteristics of the half-Heusler BaHgSn molecule, we used theoretical calculations within the Density Functional Theory (DFT) framework utilizing the LSDA+mBJ technique in this study. Using the optimal lattice parameters, we discover that half-Heusler BaHgSn exhibits a Dirac semimetal behavior with a band gap of 0.1 eV. Thomas Charpin's numerical first-principles calculation approach was applied to determine the elastic constants of hexagonal BaHgSn alloys. The material's optical characteristics verified its prospective use in infrared-visible devices. According to a thermo-electric properties analysis, at 20x10^18 {\Omega}-1.m-1.s-1, the electrical conductivity reaches its maximum after increasing gradually up to 500 K. Compared to other compounds, these results indicate that BaHgSn has potential for use in opto-electronic and thermo-electric devices.</description>

      <title>Highly confined epsilon-near-zero- and surface-phonon polaritons in SrTiO3 membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies have suggested that transition metal perovskite oxide membranes can enable surface phonon polaritons in the infrared range with low loss and much stronger subwavelength confinement than bulk crystals. Such modes, however, have not been experimentally observed so far. Here, using a combination of far-field Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and near-field synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy (SINS) imaging, we study the phonon-polaritons in a 100 nm thick freestanding crystalline membrane of SrTiO3 transferred on metallic and dielectric substrates. We observe a symmetric-antisymmetric mode splitting giving rise to epsilon-near-zero and Berreman modes as well as highly confined (by a factor of 10) propagating phonon polaritons, both of which result from the deep-subwavelength thickness of the membranes. Theoretical modeling based on the analytical finite-dipole model and numerical finite-difference methods fully corroborate the experimental results. Our work reveals the potential of oxide membranes as a promising platform for infrared photonics and polaritonics.</description>

      <title>Empirical Band-Gap Correction for LDA-Derived Atomic Effective Pseudopotentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic effective pseudopotentials enable atomistic calculations at the level of accuracy of density functional theory for semiconductor nanostructures with up to fifty thousand atoms. Since they are directly derived from ab-initio calculations performed in the local density approximation (LDA), they inherit the typical underestimated band gaps and effective masses. We propose an empirical correction based on the modification of the non-local part of the pseudopotential and demonstrate good performance for bulk binary materials (InP, ZnS, HgTe, GaAs) and quantum dots (InP, CdSe, GaAs) with diameters ranging from 1.0 nm to 4.45 nm. Additionally, we provide a simple analytic expression to obtain accurate quasiparticle and optical band gaps for InP, CdSe, and GaAs QDs, from standard LDA calculation.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous mapping of magnetic and atomic structure for direct visualization of nanoscale magnetoelastic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving a correlative measurement of both magnetic and atomic structures at the nanoscale is imperative to understand the fundamental magnetism of matters and for fostering the development of new magnetic nanomaterials. Conventional microscopy methods fall short in providing the two information simultaneously. Here, we develop a new approach to simultaneously map the magnetic field and atomic structure at the nanoscale using Lorentz 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (Ltz-4D-STEM). This method enables precise measurement of the characteristic atomic and magnetic structures across an extensive field of view, a critical aspect for investigating real-world ferromagnetic materials. It offers a comprehensive visualization and statistical evaluation of the different structural information at a pixel-by-pixel correlation. The new method allows to directly visualize the magnetoelastic coupling and the resulting complex magnetization arrangement as well as the competition between magnetoelastic and magnetostatic energy. This approach opens new avenues for in-depth studying the structure-property correlation of nanoscale magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Patching-based Deep Learning model for the Inpainting of Bragg Coherent Diffraction patterns affected by detectors' gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a deep learning algorithm for the inpainting of Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI) patterns affected by detector gaps. These regions of missing intensity can compromise the accuracy of reconstruction algorithms, inducing artifacts in the final result. It is thus desirable to restore the intensity in these regions in order to ensure more reliable reconstructions. The key aspect of our method lies in the choice of training the neural network with cropped sections of both experimental diffraction data and simulated data and subsequently patching the predictions generated by the model along the gap, thus completing the full diffraction peak. This provides us with more experimental training data and allows for a faster model training due to the limited size, while the neural network can be applied to arbitrarily larger BCDI datasets. Moreover, our method not only broadens the scope of application but also ensures the preservation of data integrity and reliability in the face of challenging experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Integration for Dynamically Unstable Systems Using Interatomic Force Constants without Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an efficient and accurate, general-purpose first-principles blueprint for calculating anharmonic vibrational free energy and predicting structural phase transition temperatures of solids. Thermodynamic integration is performed without molecular dynamics using only interatomic force constants to model analogues of the true potential and generate their thermal ensembles. By replacing \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) with statistical sampling of ensemble configurations and trading density-functional theory (DFT) energy calculations on each configuration for a set of matrix operations, our approach enables a faster thermodynamic integration by 4 orders of magnitude over the traditional route via AIMD. Experimental phase transition temperatures of a variety of strongly anharmonic materials with dynamical instabilities including shape-memory alloys are recovered to largely within 25% error. Such a combination of speed and accuracy enables the method to be deployed at a large-scale for predictive mapping of phase transition temperatures.</description>

      <title>Are Magnons just the van der Waals interaction in Disguise?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MBD model of the van der Waals interaction is extended to also consider magnetic interactions, and it is demonstrated how this can be made to reproduce the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. It is found that this leads to a weak coupling between the charge dipole waves that are the basis for the electric-only van der Waals interaction and the spin-dipole waves (magnons) of the Heisenberg model. By applying the same level of theory to both simultaneously we demonstrate that magnons and charge-dipole waves may both be considered to be a basis for the fluctuating part of the many-body electron density.</description>

      <title>Driving non-trivial quantum phases in conventional semiconductors with intense excitonic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inducing novel quantum phases and topologies in materials using intense light fields is a key objective of modern condensed matter physics, but nonetheless faces significant experimental challenges. Alternately, theory predicts that in the dense limit, excitons - collective excitations composed of Coulomb-bound electron-hole pairs - could also drive exotic quantum phenomena. However, the direct observation of these phenomena requires the resolution of electronic structure in momentum space in the presence of excitons, which became possible only recently. Here, using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of an atomically thin semiconductor in the presence of a high-density of resonantly and coherently photoexcited excitons, we observe the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) excitonic state - analogous to the Cooper pairs of superconductivity. We see the valence band transform from a conventional paraboloid into a Mexican-hat like Bogoliubov dispersion - a hallmark of the excitonic insulator phase; and we observe the recently predicted giant exciton-driven Floquet effects. Our work realizes the promise that intense bosonic fields, other than photons, can also drive novel quantum phenomena and phases in materials.</description>

      <title>Interface Design Beyond Epitaxy: Oxide Heterostructures Comprising Symmetry-forbidden Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epitaxial growth of thin-film heterostructures is generally considered the most successful procedure to obtain interfaces of excellent structural and electronic quality between three-dimensional materials. However, these interfaces can only join material systems with crystal lattices of matching symmetries and lattice constants. We present a novel category of interfaces, the fabrication of which is membrane-based and does not require epitaxial growth. These interfaces therefore overcome limitations imposed by epitaxy. Leveraging the additional degrees of freedom gained, we demonstrate atomically clean interfaces between three-fold symmetric sapphire and four-fold symmetric SrTiO3. Atomic-resolution imaging reveals structurally well-defined interfaces with a novel moir\'e-type reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a M\"obius strip comprising of two antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains. To satisfy the boundary condition, magnon excitations feature linear polarization of the N\'eel vector devoid of chirality, forming two non-degenerate branches of modes that can neither be smoothly connected to nor be decomposed by the circularly-polarized magnons of opposite chirality commonly found in antiferromagnets. Only one branch supports standing-wave formation on the M\"obius strip while the other does not, owing to its spectral shift incurred by the boundary condition. Our findings unravel the profound impact of topology-induced symmetry breaking on magnons.</description>

      <title>Synergy between Spin and Orbital Angular Momenta on a M\"obius Strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin and orbital angular momenta are fundamental physical characteristics described by polarization and spatial degrees of freedom, respectively. Polarization is a feature of vector fields while spatial phase gradient determines the orbital angular momentum ubiquitous to any scalar field. Common wisdom treats these two degrees of freedom as distinct and independent principles to manipulate wave propagations. Here, we demonstrate their synergy. This is achieved by introducing two orthogonal $p$-orbitals as eigenbases, whose spatial modal features are exploited to generate orbital angular momenta and the associated orbital orientations provide means to simultaneously manipulate polarizations. Through periodic modulation and directional coupling, we realize a full cyclic evolution of the synchronized and synergized spin-orbital angular momenta. Remarkably, this evolution acquires a nontrivial geometric phase, leading to its representation on a M\"obius strip. Experimentally, an acoustic cavity array is designed, whose dipole resonances precisely mimic the $p$-orbitals. The acoustic waves, uniquely, see the pressure (scalar) field as a spatial feature and carry an intrinsic polarization defined by the velocity (vector) field, serving as an ideal platform to observe the synergy of spin and orbital angular momenta. Based on such a property, we further showcase a spin-orbital-Hall effect, highlighting the intricate locking of handedness, directionality, spin density and spatial mode profile. Our study unveils a fundamental connection between spin and orbital angular momenta, promising avenues for novel applications in information coding and high-capacity communications.</description>

      <title>Intense and Stable Blue Light Emission from CsPbBr$_3$/Cs$_4$PbBr$_6$ Heterostructures Embedded in Transparent Nanoporous Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals are attractive for light emitting devices both as electroluminescent and color converting materials, since they combine intense and narrow emissions with good charge injection and transport properties. However, most perovskite nanocrystals shine at green and red wavelengths, the observation of intense and stable blue emission still being a challenging target. In this work, we report a method to attain intense and enduring blue emission (470-480 nm), with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 40%, originated from very small CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals (diameter&lt;3nm) formed by controllably exposing Cs$_4$PbBr$_6$ to humidity. This process is mediated by the void network of a mesoporous transparent scaffold in which the zero-dimensional (0D) Cs$_4$PbBr$_6$ lattice is embedded, which allows the fine control over water adsorption and condensation that determines the optimization of the synthetic procedure and, eventually, the nanocrystal size. By temperature dependent photoemission analysis of samples with different [CsPbBr$_3$]/[Cs$_4$PbBr$_6$] volume ratios, we show that the bright blue emission observed results from the efficient charge transfer to the CsPbBr$_3$ inclusions from the Cs$_4$PbBr$_6$ host. Our approach provides a means to attain highly efficient transparent blue light emitting films that complete the palette offered by perovskite nanocrystals for lighting and display applications.</description>

      <title>Amplified linear and nonlinear chiral sensing assisted by anapole modes in hybrid metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between chiral molecules and circularly polarized light is largely influenced by the local optical chirality density. This interaction prompts a substantial demand of the design of nanophotonic platforms capable of enhancing such effects across large and accessible volumes. Such a magnification requires nanostructures to provide high electric and magnetic field enhancements while keeping the phase relation of circular light. Dielectric nanostructures, particularly those able to support resonances, are uniquely suited for this task due to their capacity for high electric and magnetic field enhancements. On the other hand, efficient third harmonic generation calls for strong electric field resonances within dielectric materials, a feature often boosted by incorporating plasmonic materials into hybrid systems. In this numerical study, we propose a coupled silicon disk-gold ring system that can exploit the anapole-induced field confinement to provide a broadband magnified circular dichroism under realistic conditions, reaching values up to a 5-fold enhancement. We also demonstrate that this structure can be employed as an efficient third harmonic generator which, when integrated with chiral media, enables a 10-fold enhancement in circular dichroism. Furthermore, we numerically show that pulsed illumination at intensities up to 10 GW/cm2 does not induce temperature increments that could potentially damage the samples. These findings suggest that this system can be a promising and versatile approach towards ultrasensitive background-free chiral sensing.</description>

      <title>Towards the superlubricity of polymer-steel interfaces with ionic liquids and carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frictional losses are responsible for significant energy waste in many practical applications, and superlubricity with a coefficient of friction lower than 0.01 is the goal of tribologists. In this paper, metal-on-polymer contact was analysed and close to superlubricity conditions for this material configuration were explored. A new lubricant has been proposed hinge on the phosphorus-based ionic liquid and carbon nanotubes as thickeners. Additionally, carbon nanotube mesh was doped with copper nanoparticles that allowed for the close to superlubricity state in a mild steel/polymer contact configuration under low normal load conditions. The adsorption of phosphorus onto metallic and polymer surfaces has been reported in EDS analysis. The formulation of the new lubricant allowed for stable dispersion with a carbon nanotube content as low as 0.1% wt. The carbon nanotubes and Cu nanoparticles have been analysed using TEM and SEM imaging. A tribological test in a block-on-ring system has been carried out. The wear of material, topography, and surface free energy have been analysed along with SEM/EDS images to explore the underlying mechanisms of friction and wear.</description>

      <title>Sub-100-fs formation of dark excitons in monolayer WS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductors based on transition metal dichalcogenides are promising for electronics and optoelectronics applications owing to their properties governed by strongly-bound bright and dark excitons. Momentum-forbidden dark excitons have recently received attention as better alternatives to bright excitons for long-range transport. However, accessing the dynamics of dark excitons is challenging experimentally. The most direct, but very complicated, experiment is transient angle-resolved photoemission electron spectroscopy: sub-100-fs formation of K-$\Lambda$-excitons in monolayer WS$_2$ has been identified previously taking advantage of momentum resolution of detected signals [1]. Here, we use a simpler setting of transient photoemission electron microscopy (with spatial resolution of 75 nm), which is inherently sensitive to dark K-$\Lambda$ excitons in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenide and has exceptionally high temporal resolution of 13 fs. We are able to directly observe intervalley scattering (dark-exciton formation) in monolayer WS$_2$ with scattering rates in the range of 14-50 fs followed by picosecond-scale dynamics mediated by defects.</description>

      <title>Room temperature charge density wave in a tetragonal polymorph of Gd2Os3Si5 and study of its origin in the R2T3X5 (R = Rare earth, T = transition metal, X = Si, Ge) series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW) systems are proposed to exhibit application potential for electronic and optoelectronic devices. Therefore, identifying new materials that exhibit a CDW state at room temperature is crucial for the development of CDW-based devices. Here, we present a non-layered tetragonal polymorph of Gd2Os3Si5, which exhibits a CDW state at room temperature. Gd2Os3Si5 crystallizes in the U2Mn3Si5-type tetragonal crystal structure with the space group P4/mnc. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction (SXRD) analysis shows that Gd2Os3Si5 possesses an incommensurately modulated structure with modulation wave vector q = (0.53, 0, 0), while the modulation reduces the symmetry to orthorhombic Cccm({\sigma}00)0s0. This differs in contrast to isostructural Sm2Ru3Ge5, where the modulated phase has been reported to possess the superspace symmetry Pm({\alpha} 0 {\gamma})0. However, reinvestigation of Sm2Ru3Ge5 suggests that its modulated crystal structure can alternatively be described by Cccm({\sigma}00)0s0, with modulations similar to Gd2Os3Si5. The magnetic susceptibility, \c{hi}(T), exhibits a maximum at low temperatures that indicates an antiferromagnetic transition at TN = 5.5 K. The \c{hi}(T) furthermore shows an anomaly at around 345 K, suggesting a CDW transition at TCDW = 345 K, that corroborates the result from high-temperature SXRD measurements. Interestingly, R2T3X5 compounds are known to crystallize either in the tetragonal Sc2Fe3Si5 type structure or in the orthorhombic U2Co3Si5 structure type. Not all of the compounds in the R2T3X5 series undergo CDW phase transitions. We find that R2T3X5 compounds will exhibit a CDW transition, if the condition : 0.526 &lt; c/sqrt(ab) &lt; 0.543 is satisfied. We suggest the wave vector-dependent electron-phonon coupling to be the dominant mechanism of CDW formation in the tetragonal polymorph of Gd2Os3Si5.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic ordering and glassy nature in NASICON type NaFe$_2$PO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate crystal structure and magnetic properties including spin relaxation and magnetocaloric effect in NASICON type NaFe$_2$PO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_2$ sample. The Rietveld refinement of x-ray and neutron diffraction patterns show a rhombohedral crystal structure with the R$\bar{3}$c space group. The core-level spectra confirm the desired oxidation state of constituent elements. The {\it dc}--magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) behavior in zero field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) modes show the ordering temperature $\approx$50~K. Interestingly, the analysis of temperature dependent neutron diffraction patterns reveal an A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure with the ordered moment of 3.8 $\mu_{B}$/Fe$^{3+}$ at 5~K, and a magnetostriction below $T_{\rm N}=$ 50~K. Further, the peak position in the {\it ac}--$\chi$ is found to be invariant with the excitation frequency supporting the notion of dominating AFM transition. Also, the unsaturated isothermal magnetization curve supports the AFM ordering of the moments; however, the observed coercivity suggests the presence of weak ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at 5~K. On the other hand, a clear bifurcation between ZFC and FC curves of {\it dc}--$\chi$ and the observed decrease in peak height of {\it ac}--$\chi$ with frequency suggest for the complex magnetic interactions. The spin relaxation behavior in thermo-remanent magnetization and aging measurements indicate the glassy states at 5~K. Moreover, the Arrott plots and magnetocaloric analysis reveal the AFM--FM interactions in the sample at lower temperatures.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Nonequilibrium Response of FeRh Thin Films using Time-Domain Thermoreflectance (TDTR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-Domain Thermoreflectance (TDTR) characterization of FeRh throughout its first-order antiferromagnetic (AF) to ferromagnetic (FM) transition shows that the transient reflectance, $\Delta$R(t)/R, strongly depends on the magnetic order of the sample. Using TDTR, which uses optical pulses to induce small temperature excursions, we have found that the $\Delta$R(t)/R of the AF phase exhibits a large negative response, while the response of the FM phase is positive. This magnetic phase sensitivity has allowed us to study the transient response of both the AF and FM phase to the pump pulse excitation and the mixed phase of the material. These results are significant since the ultrafast properties of antiferromagnetic materials and mixed antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic materials are difficult to detect using other conventional techniques.We have found that the AF phase exhibits a strong subpicosecond signal not observed in the FM phase. The magnetic phase dependence of the sign of $\Delta$R(t)/R is qualitatively explained using the results of ab-initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Using the two-temperature model, we found that the change in the thermalization time across the transition is caused by differences in both the electronic heat capacity and the electron-phonon coupling factor of the AF and FM phases. The electron-phonon coupling constant in the AF phase is also determined using the two-temperature model conducted using the NTMpy code package. For the FM phase, we provide boundaries for the magnitude of the electron-phonon coupling factor for the FM phase. These results indicate that TDTR can be used to study the transient properties of magnetic materials that are otherwise challenging to probe.</description>

      <title>The discovery of three-dimensional Van Hove singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arising from the extreme/saddle point in electronic bands, Van Hove singularity (VHS) manifests divergent density of states (DOS) and induces various new states of matter such as unconventional superconductivity. VHS is believed to exist in one and two dimensions, but rarely found in three dimension (3D). Here, we report the discovery of 3D VHS in a topological magnet EuCd2As2 by magneto-infrared spectroscopy. External magnetic fields effectively control the exchange interaction in EuCd2As2, and shift 3D Weyl bands continuously, leading to the modification of Fermi velocity and energy dispersion. Above the critical field, the 3D VHS forms and is evidenced by the abrupt emergence of inter-band transitions, which can be quantitatively described by the minimal model of Weyl semimetals. Three additional optical transitions are further predicted theoretically and verified in magneto-near-infrared spectra. Our results pave the way to exploring VHS in 3D systems and uncovering the coordination between electronic correlation and the topological phase.</description>

Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit great promise for CO2 capture. However, finding the best performing materials poses computational and experimental grand challenges in view of the vast chemical space of potential building blocks. Here, we introduce GHP-MOFassemble, a generative artificial intelligence (AI), high performance framework for the rational and accelerated design of MOFs with high CO2 adsorption capacity and synthesizable linkers. GHP-MOFassemble generates novel linkers, assembled with one of three pre-selected metal nodes (Cu paddlewheel, Zn paddlewheel, Zn tetramer) into MOFs in a primitive cubic topology. GHP-MOFassemble screens and validates AI-generated MOFs for uniqueness, synthesizability, structural validity, uses molecular dynamics simulations to study their stability and chemical consistency, and crystal graph neural networks and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations to quantify their CO2 adsorption capacities. We present the top six AI-generated MOFs with CO2 capacities greater than 2 $m mol/g$, i.e., higher than 96.9% of structures in the hypothetical MOF dataset.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Thomas-Fermi Potential for Three-Dimensional Condensed Matter Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We proposed a formally exact, probabilistic method to assess the validity of the Thomas-Fermi potential for three-dimensional condensed matter systems where electron dynamics is constrained to the Fermi surface. Our method, which relies on accurate solutions of the radial Schr\"{o}dinger equation, yields the probability density function for momentum transfer. This allows for the computation of its expectation values, which can be compared with unity to confirm the validity of the Thomas-Fermi approximation. We applied this method to three {\it n}-type direct-gap III-V model semiconductors (GaAs, InAs, InSb) and found that the Thomas-Fermi approximation is certainly valid at high electron densities. In these cases, the probability density function exhibits the same profile, irrespective of the material under scrutiny. Furthermore, we show that this approximation can lead to serious errors in the computation of observables when applied to GaAs at zero temperature for most electron densities under scrutiny.</description>

      <title>A new quantum hydrodynamic description of ferroelectricity in spiral magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03610v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strong coupling between magnetism and ferroelectricity was found in rare earth manganites, where the electric polarization could be induced by special magnetic ordering. There is no theoretical model that would allow us to study the static and dynamic properties of electric polarization in strongly correlated magnetic dielectrics. In the presented research, we have taken the main step towards the construction of such a fundamental model, and made a direct connection between the microscopic Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky theory and Mostovoy's phenomenological model for magnetically induced polarization. A novel description of the ferroelectricity of spin origin is proposed within the framework of the many-particle quantum hydrodynamics method. It is applied to the study of cells of magnetic ions, where the electric dipole moment is proportional to the vector product of spins. Our approach is based on the many-particle Pauli equation, where the influence of an external magnetic field is considered. We define the electric dipole moment operator of the ion cell and introduce the macroscopic polarization as the quantum mechanical average of that operator. We formulate a model for the description of nonequilibrium polarization and derive a new polarization evolution equation. The polarization switching in ferroelectric magnets with the spiral spin-density-wave state is considered, and we demonstrate that the proposed model yields known results and can predict novel effects. The dynamic magnetoelectric effect can be investigated by employing this novel equation to study the evolution of polarization.</description>

      <title>Native point defects in HgCdTe infrared detector material: Identifying deep centers from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the native point defects in the long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) detector material Hg$_{0.75}$Cd$_{0.25}$Te using a dielectric-dependent hybrid density functional combined with spin-orbit coupling. Characterizing these point defects is essential as they are responsible for intrinsic doping and nonradiative recombination centers in the detector material. The dielectric-dependent hybrid functional allows for an accurate description of the band gap ($E_g$) for Hg$_{1-x}$Cd$_{x}$Te (MCT) over the entire compositional range, a level of accuracy challenging with standard hybrid functionals. Our comprehensive examination of the native point defects confirms that cation vacancies $V_\text{Hg(Cd)}$ are the primary sources of $p$-type conductivity in the LWIR material given their low defect formation energies and the presence of a shallow acceptor level ($-$/0) near the valence-band maximum (VBM). In addition to the shallow acceptor level, the cation vacancies exhibit a deep charge transition level (2$-$/$-$) situated near the midgap, characteristic of nonradiative recombination centers. Our results indicate that Hg interstitial could also be a deep center in the LWIR MCT through a metastable configuration under the Hg-rich growth conditions. While an isolated Te antisite does not show deep levels, the formation of $V_\text{Hg}$-Te$_\text{Hg}$ defect complex introduces a deep acceptor level within the band gap.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Vitrimeric Polymers by Molecular Dynamics and Generative Modeling</title>

Abstract: Vitrimer is a new class of sustainable polymers with the ability of self-healing through rearrangement of dynamic covalent adaptive networks. However, a limited choice of constituent molecules restricts their property space, prohibiting full realization of their potential applications. Through a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning (ML), particularly a novel graph variational autoencoder (VAE) model, we establish a method for generating novel vitrimers and guide their inverse design based on desired glass transition temperature (Tg). We build the first vitrimer dataset of one million and calculate Tg on 8,424 of them by high-throughput MD simulations calibrated by a Gaussian process model. The proposed VAE employs dual graph encoders and a latent dimension overlapping scheme which allows for individual representation of multi-component vitrimers. By constructing a continuous latent space containing necessary information of vitrimers, we demonstrate high accuracy and efficiency of our framework in discovering novel vitrimers with desirable Tg beyond the training regime. The proposed vitrimers with reasonable synthesizability cover a wide range of Tg and broaden the potential widespread usage of vitrimeric materials.</description>

      <title>Robust Dipolar Layers between Organic Semiconductors and Silver for Energy-Level Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interface between a metal electrode and an organic semiconductor (OS) layer has a defining role in the properties of the resulting device. To obtain a desired performance, interlayers are introduced to modify the adhesion and growth of OS and enhance the efficiency of charge transport through the interface. However, the employed interlayers face common challenges, including a lack of electric dipoles to tune the mutual position of energy levels, being too thick for efficient electronic transport, or being prone to intermixing with subsequently deposited OS layers. Here, we show that monolayers of 1,3,5-tris(4 carboxyphenyl)benzene (BTB) with fully deprotonated carboxyl groups on silver substrates form a compact layer resistant to intermixing while mediating energy level alignment and showing a large insensitivity to substrate termination. Employing a combination of surface-sensitive techniques, i.e., low-energy electron microscopy and diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy, we have comprehensively characterized the compact layer and proven its robustness against mixing with the subsequently deposited organic semiconductor layer. DFT calculations show that the robustness arises from a strong interaction of carboxylate groups with the Ag surface, and thus, the BTB in the first layer is energetically favored. Synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy shows that this layer displays considerable electrical dipoles that can be utilized for work function engineering and electronic alignment of molecular frontier orbitals with respect to the substrate Fermi level. Our work thus provides a widely applicable molecular interlayer and general insights necessary for engineering of charge injection layers for efficient organic electronics.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional Multiferroic Semiconductor WOI3: Unconventional Anisotropic d^1 Rule and Bulk Photovoltaic Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pursuit of multiferroic magnetoelectrics, combining simultaneous ferroelectric and magnetic orders, remains a central focus in condensed matter physics. Here we report the centrosymmetric, one-dimensional (1D) antiferromagnetic WOI$_3$ undergoes a strain-induced ferroelectric distortion. The paraelectric-ferroelectric transition is originated from the unconventional anisotropic $d^1$ mechanism, where an unpaired d electron of each W$^{5+}$ ion contributes to magnetic orders. Employing a Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we predict an antiferromagnetic spin configuration as the paraelectric ground state, transitioning to a ferroelectric phase with noncollinear spin arrangement under uniaxial strain. The ferroelectric polarization and noncollinear spin arrangement can be manipulated by varying the applied strain. While the energy barriers for switching ferroelectric polarizations with magnetic orders are on the order of a few dozen of meV, the shift current bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) exhibits remarkable differences, providing a precise and valuable tool for experimentally probing the interplay of ferroelectric and magnetic orders in 1D WOI$_3$.</description>

Abstract: Nanopowder consolidation under high strain rate shock compression is a potential method for synthesizing and processing bulk nanomaterials. A thorough investigation of the shock deformation of powder materials is of great engineering significance. Here we combine nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations and X-ray diffraction (XRD) simulation methods to investigate the deformation twinning and pore compaction in shock-compressed np-Mg. Significant anisotropy and strong dependence on crystallographic orientation are presented during shock-induced deformation twinning. During the shock stage, three typical types of twins were firstly induced, namely {11-21} twin (T1), {11-22} twin (T2) and {10-12} twin (T3). Most of them were generated in grains with a larger angle between the impact direction and the c-axis of the lattice. With the increase in strain rate, the types and quantities of twins continued to enrich, but they did not occur when the strain rate was too high. We also discussed the deformation mechanisms of the three types of twins and found that the coupling of slip and shuffle dominated twin deformation. In addition, void filling occurred due to the interaction of twinning and other plastic deformations, leading to the densification of np-Mg. During the release stage, an interesting reverse change was observed, where the twins produced by the impact receded, and twins were produced in grains that were previously difficult to produce.</description>

      <title>Effects of the growth kinetics on solute diffusion in porous films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.11376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the development of porous materials with improved transport properties, a key missing ingredient is to determine the relations between growth kinetics, structure, and transport parameters. Here, we address these relations by studying solute diffusion through three-dimensional porous films produced by simple deposition models with controlled thickness and porosity. We simulate growing films with competitive aggregation rules that incorporate lateral aggregation (relative rate proportional to $p$), which leads to pore formation, and surface relaxation ($1-p$) that favors compaction. By connecting a solute source at the basis and a drain at the top outer surface of the films, we extract the effective diffusion coefficients from steady-state simulations. We find that for a given film thickness, the larger the $p$, the larger the effective porosity and diffusivity, but the smaller the tortuosity. Keeping constant growth conditions (i.e., same $p$), the increase of thickness always leads to an increase of effective porosity, but a nontrivial behavior in the diffusivity occurs: for $p\leq 0.7$, the diffusion coefficient is larger in thicker films; this is accompanied by a decrease of the tortuosity with the thickness, thus indicating that growth continuously improves pore structure for diffusion. Microscopically, such a result is associated with narrower distributions of local solute currents at higher points of films. Particularly for $p\geq 0.9$, in which film porosity is $\sim 0.65-0.7$, the tortuosity is between $1.3$ and $2$, increases with the thickness, and has maximal changes near $25\%$. Pairs of values of porosity and tortuosity that we obtain here, for the thickest films, agree with those experimentally measured in some porous electrodes. Noteworthy, the increase of film thickness is generally favorable for diffusion in their pores, and exceptions have small losses in tortuosity.</description>

      <title>Quenched pair breaking by interlayer correlations as a key to superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with $T_\mathrm{c} \simeq 80~\mathrm{K}$ under high pressure opens up a new route to high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity. This material realizes a bilayer square lattice model featuring a strong interlayer hybridization unlike many unconventional superconductors. A key question in this regard concerns how electronic correlations driven by the interlayer hybridization affect the low-energy electronic structure and the concomitant superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate using a cluster dynamical mean-field theory that the interlayer electronic correlations (IECs) induce a Lifshitz transition resulting in a change of Fermi surface topology. By solving an appropriate gap equation, we further show that the dominant pairing instability (intraorbital $s$-wave/interorbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave, or $s \pm$-wave in a bonding-antibonding basis) is enhanced by the IECs. The underlying mechanism is the quenching of a strong ferromagnetic channel, resulting from the Lifshitz transition driven by the IECs. Based on this picture, we provide a possible reason of why superconductivity emerges only under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Charge Density Wave Ordering in NdNiO$_2$: Effects of Multiorbital Nonlocal Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate collective electronic fluctuations and, in particular, the possibility of the charge density wave ordering in an infinite-layer NdNiO$_2$. We perform advanced many-body calculations for the ab-initio three-orbital model by taking into account local correlation effects, non-local charge and magnetic fluctuations, and the electron-phonon coupling. We find that in the considered material, electronic correlations are strongly orbital- and momentum-dependent. Notably, the charge density wave and magnetic instabilities originate from distinct orbitals. In particular, we show that the correlation effects lead to the momentum-dependent hybridization between different orbitals, resulting in the splitting and shifting of the flat part of the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ band. This strong renormalization of the electronic spectral function drives the charge density wave instability that is related to the intraband Ni-$d_{z^2}$ correlations. Instead, the magnetic instability stems from the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, which remains half-filled through the redistribution of the electronic density between different bands even upon hole doping. Consequently, the strength of the magnetic fluctuations remains nearly unchanged for the considered doping levels. We argue that this renormalization is not inherent to the stoichiometric case but can be induced by hole doping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A detailed study of the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of a garnet compound Mn$_{3}$Cr$_{2}$Ge$_{3}$O$_{12}$ is carried out using x-ray diffraction, magnetization, heat capacity, and neutron diffraction measurements as well as \textit{ab initio} band-structure calculations. This compound manifests two successive magnetic transitions at $T_{\rm N1} \simeq 4.5$ K and $T_{\rm N2} \simeq 2.7$ K. Neutron powder diffraction experiments reveal that these two transitions correspond to the collinear and non-collinear antiferromagnetic ordering of the nonfrustrated Cr$^{3+}$ and frustrated Mn$^{2+}$ sublattices, respectively. The interactions within each of the Cr and Mn sublattices are antiferromagnetic, while the inter-sublattice interactions are ferromagnetic. The $H-T$ phase diagram is quite complex and displays multiple phases under magnetic field, which can be attributed to the frustrated nature of the spin lattice. Mn$_{3}$Cr$_{2}$Ge$_{3}$O$_{12}$ shows a large magnetocaloric effect with a maximum value of isothermal entropy change $\Delta S_{\rm m} \simeq -23$ J/kg-K and adiabatic temperature change $\Delta T_{\rm ad} \simeq 9$ K for a field change of 7 T. Further, a large value of the relative cooling power ($RCP \simeq 360$ J/kg) demonstrates the promise of using this compound in magnetic refrigeration.</description>
