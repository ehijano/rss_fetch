      <title>Counting points on Hessenberg Varieties over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a counting formula in terms of modified Hall-Littlewood polynomials and the chromatic quasisymmetric function for the number of points on an arbitrary Hessenberg variety over a finite field. As a consequence, we express the Poincar\'e polynomials of complex Hessenberg varieties in terms of a Hall scalar product involving the symmetric functions above. We use these results to give a new proof of a combinatorial formula for the modified Hall-Littlewood polynomials.</description>

      <title>A sharp upper bound on the spectral radius of $\theta(1,3,3)$-free graphs with given size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $F$-free if $G$ does not contain $F$ as a subgraph. Let $\rho(G)$ be the spectral radius of a graph $G$. Let $\theta(1,p,q)$ denote the theta graph, which is obtained by connecting two distinct vertices with three internally disjoint paths with lengths $1, p, q$, where $p\leq q$. Let $S_{n,k}$ denote the graph obtained by joining every vertex of $K_{k}$ to $n-k$ isolated vertices and $S_{n,k}^{-}$ denote the graph obtained from $S_{n,k}$ by deleting an edge incident to a vertex of degree $k$, respectively. In this paper, we show that if $\rho(G)\geq\rho(S_{\frac{m+4}{2},2}^{-})$ for a graph $G$ with even size $m\geq 92$, then $G$ contains a $\theta(1,3,3)$ unless $G\cong S_{\frac{m+4}{2},2}^{-}$.</description>

      <title>The Double Almost-Riordan Arrays and Their Sequence Characterization, Compression, and Total Positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define double almost-Riordan arrays and find that the set of all double almost-Riordan arrays forms a group, called the double almost-Riordan group. We also obtain the sequence characteristics of double almost-Riordan arrays and give the production matrices for double almost-Riordan arrays. We define the compression of double almost-Riordan arrays and present their sequence characterization. Finally we give a characteristic for the total positivity of double Riordan arrays, by using which we discuss the total positivity for several double almost-Riordan arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the obstructions to the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property of $A$-paths in unoriented group-labelled graphs. As a result, we prove that for every finite abelian group $\Gamma$ and for every subset $\Lambda$ of $\Gamma$, the family of $\Gamma$-labelled $A$-paths whose lengths are in $\Lambda$ satisfies the half-integral Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property. Moreover, we give a characterization of such $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda\subseteq\Gamma$ for which the same family of $A$-paths satisfies the full Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property.</description>

      <title>Packing sets under finite groups via algebraic incidence structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a subset in $\mathbb{F}_p^2$ and $S$ be a subset in the special linear group $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ or the $1$-dimensional Heisenberg linear group $\mathbb{H}_1(\mathbb{F}_p)$. We define $S(E):= \bigcup_{\theta \in S} \theta (E)$. In this paper, we provide optimal conditions on $S$ and $E$ such that the set $S(E)$ covers a positive proportion of all elements in the plane $\mathbb{F}_p$. When the sizes of $S$ and $E$ are small, we prove structural theorems that guarantee that $|S(E)|\gg |E|^{1+\epsilon}$ for some $\epsilon&gt;0$. The main ingredients in our proofs are novel results on algebraic incidence-type structures associated with the groups, in which energy estimates play a crucial role. The higher-dimensional version will also be discussed in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every odd prime power $q$, a family of pairwise nonisomorphic normal arc-transitive divisible design Cayley digraphs with isomorphic neighborhood designs over a Heisenberg group of order $q^3$ is constructed. It is proved that these digraphs are not distinguished by the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm and have the Weisfeiler-Leman dimension $3$.</description>

      <title>On the Wiener-like root-indices of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine roots of graph polynomials where those roots can be considered as structural graph measures. More precisely, we prove analytical results for the roots of certain modified graph polynomials and also discuss numerical results. As polynomials, we use, e.g., the Hosoya, the Schultz, and the Gutman polynomial which belong to an interesting family of degree-distance-based graph polynomials; they constitute so-called counting polynomials with non-negative integers as coefficients and the roots of their modified versions have been used to characterize the topology of graphs. Our results can be applied for the quantitative characterization of graphs. Besides analytical results, we also investigate other properties of those measures such as their degeneracy which is an undesired aspect of graph measures. It turns out that the measures representing roots of graph polynomials possess high discrimination power on exhaustively generated trees, which outperforms standard versions of these indices. Furthermore, a new measure is introduced that allows us to compare different topological indices in terms of structure sensitivity and abruptness.</description>

      <title>State transfer in discrete-time quantum walks via projected transition matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider state transfer in quantum walks by using combinatorial methods. We generalize perfect state transfer in two-reflection discrete-time quantum walks to a notion that we call peak state transfer; we define peak state transfer as the highest state transfer that could be achieved between an initial and a target state under unitary evolution, even when perfect state transfer is unattainable. We give a characterization of peak state transfer that is easy to apply and that allows us to fully characterize peak state transfer in the arc-reversal (Grover) walk on various families of graphs, including strongly regular graphs and incidence graphs of block designs (starting at a point). In addition, we provide many examples of peak state transfer, including an infinite family where the amount of peak state transfer goes to $1$ as the number of vertices grows. We further demonstrate that peak state transfer properties extend to infinite families of graphs generated by vertex blow-ups, and we characterize periodicity in the vertex-face walk on toroidal grids. In our analysis, we make extensive use of the spectral decomposition of a matrix that is obtained by projecting the transition matrix down onto a subspace. Though we are motivated by a problem in quantum computing, we identify several open problems that are purely combinatorial, arising from the spectral conditions required for peak state transfer in discrete-time quantum walks.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of Terry and Wolf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows that the $\mathrm{VC}_2$-dimension of a subset of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ known as the 'quadratic Green-Sanders example' is at least 3 and at most 501. The upper bound confirms a conjecture of Terry and Wolf, who introduced this set in their recent work concerning strengthenings of the higher-order arithmetic regularity lemma under certain model-theoretic tameness assumptions. Additionally, the paper presents a simplified proof that the (linear) Green-Sanders example, which has its roots in Ramsey theory, has $\mathrm{VC}$-dimension at most 3.</description>

      <title>S-packing edge-colorings of subcubic outerplanar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a sequence $S = (s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k)$ of non-decreasing positive integers, an $S$-packing edge-coloring (S-coloring) of a graph $G$ is a partition of $E(G)$ into $E_1, E_2, \ldots, E_k$ such that the distance between each pair of distinct edges $e_1,e_2 \in E_i$, $1 \le i \le k$, is at least $s_i + 1$. In particular, a $(1^{\ell},2^k)$-coloring is a partition of $E(G)$ into $\ell$ matchings and $k$ induced matchings, and it can be viewed as intermediate colorings between proper and strong edge-colorings. Hocquard, Lajou, and Lu\v{z}ar conjectured that every subcubic planar graph has a $(1,2^6)$-coloring and a $(1^2,2^3)$-coloring.
  In this paper, we confirm the conjecture of Hocquard, Lajou, and Lu\v{z}ar for subcubic outerplanar graphs by showing every subcubic outerplanar graph has a $(1,2^5)$-coloring and a $(1^2,2^3)$-coloring. Our results are best possible since we found subcubic outerplanar graphs with no $(1,2^4)$-coloring and no $(1^2,2^2)$-coloring respectively. Furthermore, we explore the question "What is the largest positive integer $k_1$ and $k_2$ such that every subcubic outerplanar graph is $(1,2^4,k_1)$-colorable and $(1^2,2^2,k_2)$-colorable?". We prove $3 \le k_1 \le 6$ and $3 \le k_2 \le 4$. We also consider the question "What is the largest positive integer $k_1'$ and $k_2'$ such that every $2$-connected subcubic outerplanar graph is $(1,2^3,k_1')$-colorable and $(1^2,2^2,k_2')$-colorable?". We prove $k_1' = 2$ and $3 \le k_2' \le 11$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work concerns a construction of pattern-avoiding inversion sequences from right to left, called a generating tree growing on the left. We first apply this construction to inversion sequences avoiding 201 and 210, resulting in a new way of computing their generating function. We then use a slightly modified construction to compute the generating function of inversion sequences avoiding 010 and 102, which was only conjectured before.</description>

Abstract: Pfender \textit{[J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 2007]} provided a one-line proof for a variant of the Delsarte-Goethals-Seidel-Kabatianskii-Levenshtein upper bound for spherical codes, which offers an upper bound for the celebrated (Newton-Gregory) kissing number problem. Motivated by this proof, we introduce the notion of codes in pointed metric spaces (in particular on Banach spaces) and derive a nonlinear (functional) Delsarte-Goethals-Seidel-Kabatianskii-Levenshtein-Pfender upper bound for spherical codes. We also introduce nonlinear (functional) Kissing Number Problem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if $ T $ is a semi-special tree that is not special, then there exists a graph $ G $, formed as an inflation of a sparse $ T $-graph, such that for any special tree $ S $, $ G $ is not a subdivision of an inflation of an sparse $ S $-graph. Furthermore $G$ has an end of uncountable degree that has no ray graph. This result provides a consistent negative answer to a problem posed by Stefan Geschke et al. in 2023. Additionally, we introduce and explore a property that generalizes Halin's grid theorem, extending it to ends of degree $ \aleph_1 $, which was originally established for ends of countable degree.</description>

      <title>Difference Methods for Double Change Covering Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A \textbf{double-change covering design} (DCCD) is a $v$-set $V$ and an ordered list $\mathcal{L}$ of $b$ blocks of size $k$ where every pair from $V$ must occur in at least one block and each pair of consecutive blocks differs by exactly two elements. It is \textbf{minimal} if it has the fewest block possible and \textbf{circular} when the first and last blocks also differ by two elements. We give a recursive construction that uses 1-factorizations and expansion sets to construct a DCCD($v+\frac{v+k-2}{k-2},k,b+\frac{v}{k-2}\frac{v+k-2}{2k-4}$) from a DCCD($v,k,b$). We construct circular DCCD($2k-2,k,k-1$) and circular DCCD($2k-3,k,k-2$) from single change covering designs and determine minimal DCCD when $v=2k-2$. We use difference methods to construct five infinite families of minimal circular DCCD($c(4k-6)+1,k,c^2(4k-6)+c$) when $c\leq 5$ for any $k\geq 3$. The recursive construction is then used to build twelve additional minimal DCCD from members of these infinite families. Finally the difference method is used to construct a minimal circular DCCD(61,4,366).</description>

      <title>A Persistence-Driven Edit Distance for Graphs with Abstract Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we define a novel edit distance for graphs considered with some weights on the edges. The metric is driven by the idea of considering graphs as topological summaries in the context of persistence and topological data analysis. Several examples related to persistent sets are presented. In case the graphs are trees, the metric can be computed with a dynamical binary linear programming approach. This framework is applied and further studied in other works focused on merge trees, where the problems of stability and merge trees estimation are also assessed.</description>

      <title>A note on monotonicity in Maker-Breaker graph colouring games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Maker-Breaker vertex colouring game, first publicised by Gardner in 1981, Maker and Breaker alternately colour vertices of a graph using a fixed palette, maintaining a proper colouring at all times. Maker aims to colour the whole graph, and Breaker aims to make some vertex impossible to colour. We are interested in the following question, first asked by Zhu in 1999: if Maker wins with $k$ colours available, must they also win with $k+1$? This question has remained open, attracting significant attention and being reposed for many similar games. While we cannot resolve this problem for the vertex colouring game, we can answer it in the affirmative for the game of arboricity, resolving a question of Bartnicki, Grytczuk, and Kierstead from 2008. We then consider how one might approach the question of monotonicity for the vertex colouring game, and work with a related game in which the vertices must be coloured in a prescribed order. We demonstrate that this `ordered vertex colouring game' does not have the above monotonicity property, and discuss the implications of this fact to the unordered game. Finally, we provide counterexamples to two open problems concerning a connected version of the graph colouring game.</description>

      <title>DP-Coloring of Graphs from Random Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DP-coloring (also called correspondence coloring) of graphs is a generalization of list coloring that has been widely studied since its introduction by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Postle in $2015$. Intuitively, DP-coloring generalizes list coloring by allowing the colors that are identified as the same to vary from edge to edge. Formally, DP-coloring of a graph $G$ is equivalent to an independent transversal in an auxiliary structure called a DP-cover of $G$. In this paper, we introduce the notion of random DP-covers and study the behavior of DP-coloring from such random covers. We prove a series of results about the probability that a graph is or is not DP-colorable from a random cover. These results support the following threshold behavior on random $k$-fold DP-covers as $\rho\to\infty$ where $\rho$ is the maximum density of a graph: graphs are non-DP-colorable with high probability when $k$ is sufficiently smaller than $\rho/\ln\rho$, and graphs are DP-colorable with high probability when $k$ is sufficiently larger than $\rho/\ln\rho$. Our results depend on $\rho$ growing fast enough and imply a sharp threshold for dense enough graphs. For sparser graphs, we analyze DP-colorability in terms of degeneracy. We also prove fractional DP-coloring analogs to these results.</description>

      <title>On graphs with maximum difference between game chromatic number and chromatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the vertex colouring game on a graph $G$, Maker and Breaker alternately colour vertices of $G$ from a palette of $k$ colours, with no two adjacent vertices allowed the same colour. Maker seeks to colour the whole graph while Breaker seeks to make some vertex impossible to colour. The game chromatic number of $G$, $\chi_g(G)$, is the minimal number $k$ of colours for which Maker has a winning strategy for the vertex colouring game. Matsumoto proved in 2019 that $\chi_g(G)-\chi(G)\leq\lfloor n/2\rfloor - 1$, and conjectured that the only equality cases are some graphs of small order and the Tur\'{a}n graph $T(2r,r)$ (i.e. $K_{2r}$ minus a perfect matching). We resolve this conjecture in the affirmative by considering a modification of the vertex colouring game wherein Breaker may remove a vertex instead of colouring it. Matsumoto further asked whether a similar result could be proved for the vertex marking game, and we provide an example to show that no such nontrivial result can exist.</description>

      <title>Signed Mahonian Polynomials on Derangements in Classical Weyl Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polynomial of the major index ${\rm maj}_W (\sigma)$ over the subset $T$ of the Coxeter group $W$ is called the Mahonian polynomial over $T$, where ${\rm maj}_W (\sigma)$ is a Mahonian statistic of an element $\sigma \in T$, whereas the polynomial of the major index ${\rm maj}_W (\sigma)$ with the sign $(-1)^{\ell_W(\sigma)}$ over the subset $T$ is referred to as the signed Mahonian polynomial over $T$, where ${\ell_W(\sigma)}$ is the length of $\sigma \in T$. Gessel, Wachs, and Chow established the formulas for the Mahonian polynomials over the sets of derangements in the symmetric group $S_n$ and the hyperoctahedral group $B_n$. By extending Wachs' approach and employing a refinement of Stanley's shuffle theorem established in our recent paper, we derive the formula for the Mahonian polynomials over the set of derangements in the even-signed permutation group $D_n$. This completes a picture which is now known for all the classical Weyl groups. Gessel-Simion, Adin-Gessel-Roichman, and Biagioli previously established formulas for the signed Mahonian polynomials over the classical Weyl groups. Building upon their formulas, we derive the formulas for the signed Mahonian polynomials over the set of derangements in classical Weyl groups. As applications of the formulas for the (signed) Mahonian polynomials over the sets of derangements in the classical Weyl groups, we obtain enumerative formulas of the number of derangements in classical Weyl groups with even lengths.</description>

      <title>Hereditary Graph Product Structure Theory and Induced Subgraphs of Strong Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16789v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the celebrated Planar Product Structure Theorem by Dujmovic et al, and also related graph product structure results, can be formulated with the induced subgraph containment relation. Precisely, we prove that if a graph G is a subgraph of the strong product of a graph Q of bounded maximum degree (such as a path) and a graph M of bounded tree-width, then G is an induced subgraph of the strong product of Q and a graph M' of bounded tree-width being at most exponential in the maximum degree of Q and the tree-width of M. In the course of proving this result, we introduce and study H-clique-width, a new single structural measure that captures a hereditary analogue of the traditional product structure (where, informally, the strong product has one factor from the graph class H and one factor of bounded clique-width).</description>

      <title>Shift-invariant functions and almost liftings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate shift-invariant vectorial Boolean functions on $n$ bits that are induced from Boolean functions on $k$ bits, for $k\leq n$. We consider such functions that are not necessarily permutations, but are, in some sense, almost bijective, and their cryptographic properties. In this context, we define an almost lifting as a Boolean function for which there is an upper bound on the number of collisions of its induced functions that does not depend on $n$. We show that if a Boolean function with diameter $k$ is an almost lifting, then the maximum number of collisions of its induced functions is $2^{k-1}$ for any $n$. Moreover, we search for functions in the class of almost liftings that have good cryptographic properties and for which the non-bijectivity does not cause major security weaknesses. These functions generalize the well-known map $\chi$ used in the Keccak hash function.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Polynomials and Hypergraph Generating Functions via Heaps of Pieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a classical result due to Jacobi in algebraic combinatorics that the generating function of closed walks at a vertex $u$ in a graph $G$ is determined by the rational function \[ \frac{\phi_{G-u}(t)}{\phi_G(t)} \] where $\phi_G(t)$ is the characteristic polynomial of $G$. In this paper, we show that the corresponding rational function for a hypergraph is also a generating function for some combinatorial objects in the hypergraph.
  We make use of the Heaps of Pieces framework, developed by Viennot, demonstrating its use on graphs, digraphs, and multigraphs before using it on hypergraphs. In the case of a graph $G$, the pieces are cycles and the concurrence relation is sharing a vertex. The pyramids with maximal piece containing a vertex $u \in V(G)$ are in one-to-one correspondence with closed walks at $u$. In the case of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, connected "infragraphs" can be defined as the set of pieces, with the same concurrence relation: sharing a vertex. Our main results are established by analyzing multivariate resultants of polynomial systems associated to adjacency hypermatrices.</description>

      <title>Ramsey Number Counterexample Checking and One Vertex Extension Linearly Related to $s$ and $t$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ramsey number $R(s,t)$ is the smallest integer $n$ such that all graphs of size $n$ contain a clique of size $s$ or an independent set of size $t$. $\mathcal{R}(s,t,n)$ is the set of all counterexample graphs without this property for a given $n$. We prove that if a graph $G_{n+1}$ of size $n+1$ has $\max\{s,t\}+1$ subgraphs in $\mathcal{R}(s,t,n)$, then $G_{n+1}$ is in $\mathcal{R}(s,t,n+1)$. Based on this, we introduce algorithms for one-vertex extension and counterexample checking with runtime linearly bound by $s$ and $t$. We prove the utility of these algorithms by verifying $\mathcal{R}(4,6,36)$ and $\mathcal{R}(5,5,43)$ are empty given current sets $\mathcal{R}(4,6,35)$ and $\mathcal{R}(5,5,42)$.</description>

      <title>Six Candidates Suffice to Win a Voter Majority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cornerstone of social choice theory is Condorcet's paradox which says that in an election where $n$ voters rank $m$ candidates it is possible that, no matter which candidate is declared the winner, a majority of voters would have preferred an alternative candidate. Instead, can we always choose a small committee of winning candidates that is preferred to any alternative candidate by a majority of voters?
  Elkind, Lang, and Saffidine raised this question and called such a committee a Condorcet winning set. They showed that winning sets of size $2$ may not exist, but sets of size logarithmic in the number of candidates always do. In this work, we show that Condorcet winning sets of size $6$ always exist, regardless of the number of candidates or the number of voters. More generally, we show that if $\frac{\alpha}{1 - \ln \alpha} \geq \frac{2}{k + 1}$, then there always exists a committee of size $k$ such that less than an $\alpha$ fraction of the voters prefer an alternate candidate. These are the first nontrivial positive results that apply for all $k \geq 2$.
  Our proof uses the probabilistic method and the minimax theorem, inspired by recent work on approximately stable committee selection. We construct a distribution over committees that performs sufficiently well (when compared against any candidate on any small subset of the voters) so that this distribution must contain a committee with the desired property in its support.</description>

      <title>A characterization of graphs $G$ with $m_G(\lambda)= 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple connected graph. If every pendant path in $G$ is at least $P_s$, we denote that $G\in \mathbb{G}_s$. For $G \in \mathbb{G}_s$, let $Q_s(G)$ be the set of vertices in $G$ that are distance $s$ from the pendant vertex, and let $|Q_s(G)| = q_s(G)$. For $G \in \mathbb{G}_s$, Li et al. (2024) proved that when $\lambda$ is not an eigenvalue of $P_s$ and $G$ is neither a cycle nor a starlike tree $T_k$, it holds that $m_G(\lambda) \leq 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$ and characterized the extremal graphs when $G$ is a tree. In this article, we characterize the extremal graphs for which $m_G(\lambda) = 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$ when $G \in \mathbb{G}_{s}$ and $\lambda\notin \sigma(P_s)$. Furthermore, we extend some of the results of Li et al. using star sets.</description>
