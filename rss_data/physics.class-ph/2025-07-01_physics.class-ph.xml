      <title>Projective Transformations for Regularized Central Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called "projective decomposition". The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred canonical coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse square and inverse cubic radial forces (or any superposition thereof) on any finite-dimensional Euclidean space. From these solutions, a new set of orbit elements for Kepler-Coulomb dynamics is derived, along with their variational equations for arbitrary perturbations (singularity-free in all cases besides rectilinear motion). Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem, incorporating the J_2 gravitational perturbation.</description>

      <title>On inertial forces (indirect terms) in problems with a central body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational systems in astrophysics often comprise a body -- the primary -- that far outweights the others, and which is taken as the centre of the reference frame. A fictitious acceleration, also known as the indirect term, must therefore be added to all other bodies in the system to compensate for the absence of motion of the primary. In this paper, we first stress that there is not one indirect term but as many indirect terms as there are bodies in the system that exert a gravitational pull on the primary. For instance, in the case of a protoplanetary disc with two planets, there are three indirect terms: one arising from the whole disc, and one per planet. We also highlight that the direct and indirect gravitational accelerations should be treated in a balanced way: the indirect term from one body should be applied to the other bodies in the system that feel its direct gravitational acceleration, and only to them. We point to situations where one of those terms is usually neglected however, which may lead to spurious results. These ideas are developed here for star-disc-planets interactions, for which we propose a recipe for the force to be applied onto a migrating planet, but they can easily be generalized to other astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Remarks on classical pseudo-electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical studies as the conservation laws and the radiation fields are investigated in the pseudo-electrodynamics. We explore the action symmetry under infinitesimal transformations to obtain the energy-momentum, the Belinfante-Rosenfeld, and the general angular momentum tensors for this nonlocal planar electrodynamics. Through the results such as the retarded potentials and fields generated by a point particle in an arbitrary motion, we study the radiation of an electric dipole and it radiated power in 1+2 dimensions. In addition, we propose a way to introduce magnetic monopoles in pseudo-electrodynamics, in which the solutions and conservation laws are also presented.</description>

      <title>Engineering spectro-temporal light states with physics-embedded deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency synthesis and spectro-temporal control of optical wave packets are central to ultrafast science, with supercontinuum (SC) generation standing as one remarkable example. Through passive manipulation, femtosecond (fs) pulses from nJ-level lasers can be transformed into octave-spanning spectra, supporting few-cycle pulse outputs when coupled with external pulse compressors. While strategies such as machine learning have been applied to control the SC's central wavelength and bandwidth, their success has been limited by the nonlinearities and strong sensitivity to measurement noise. Here, we propose and demonstrate how a physics-embedded convolutional neural network (P-CNN) that embeds spectro-temporal correlations can circumvent such challenges, resulting in faster convergence and reduced noise sensitivity. This innovative approach enables on-demand control over spectro-temporal features of SC, achieving few-cycle pulse shaping without external compressors. This approach heralds a new era of arbitrary spectro-temporal light state engineering, with implications for ultrafast photonics, photonic neuromorphic computation, and AI-driven optical systems.</description>

      <title>The emergence of the relativistic Lagrangian from the non-relativistic multiplicative Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multiplicative Lagrangian and Hamiltonian introduce an additional parameter that, despite its variation, results in identical equations of motion as those derived from the standard Lagrangian. This intriguing property becomes even more striking in the case of a free particle. By manipulating the parameter and integrating out, the statistical average of the multiplicative Lagrangian and Hamiltonian naturally arises. Astonishingly, from this statistical viewpoint, the relativistic Lagrangian and Hamiltonian emerge with remarkable elegance. On the action level, this formalism unveils a deeper connection: the spacetime of Einstein's theory reveals itself from a statistical perspective through the action associated with the multiplicative Lagrangian. This suggests that the multiplicative Lagrangian/Hamiltonian framework offers a profound and beautiful foundation, one that reveals the underlying unity between classical and relativistic descriptions in a way that transcends traditional formulations. In essence, the multiplicative approach introduces a richer and more intricate structure to our understanding of physics, bridging the gap between different theoretical realms through a statistical perspective.</description>
