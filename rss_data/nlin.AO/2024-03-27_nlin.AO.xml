      <title>A framework to identify supercritical and subcritical Turing bifurcations: Case study of a system sustaining cubic and quadratic autocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on an autocatalytic reaction-diffusion model and carry out multiple scale weakly nonlinear analysis. A cubic and a quadratic autocatalytic reaction system is analysed. We develop a framework to identify the critical surfaces in parameter space across which the nature of the Turing bifurcation changes from supercritical to subcritical. These are verified by direct numerical simulations of the system. Using weakly nonlinear analysis, we derive equations up to the fifth order that governs the amplitude of the spatial patterns. The limit point of the bifurcating solution is captured accurately by extending the analysis to the fifth order for the case of subcritical bifurcation. The numerical solutions are in good agreement with the predictions of the weakly nonlinear analysis for supercritical bifurcations. We show that when multiple steady states arise Turing patterns can coexist with another spatially uniform steady states. Furthermore, we show that our framework can be extended to get different patterns like squares and hexagons in a two-dimensional domain. We show that the shape of Turing patterns is influenced by the domain size. This shows that the geometry can influence the kind of patterns formed in natural systems. This study will aid the experimentalist identify operating conditions where Turing patterns can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Natural-artificial hybrid swarm: Cyborg-insect group navigation in unknown obstructed soft terrain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating multi-robot systems in complex terrains has always been a challenging task. This is due to the inherent limitations of traditional robots in collision avoidance, adaptation to unknown environments, and sustained energy efficiency. In order to overcome these limitations, this research proposes a solution by integrating living insects with miniature electronic controllers to enable robotic-like programmable control, and proposing a novel control algorithm for swarming. Although these creatures, called cyborg insects, have the ability to instinctively avoid collisions with neighbors and obstacles while adapting to complex terrains, there is a lack of literature on the control of multi-cyborg systems. This research gap is due to the difficulty in coordinating the movements of a cyborg system under the presence of insects' inherent individual variability in their reactions to control input. In response to this issue, we propose a novel swarm navigation algorithm addressing these challenges. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through an experimental validation in which a cyborg swarm was successfully navigated through an unknown sandy field with obstacles and hills. This research contributes to the domain of swarm robotics and showcases the potential of integrating biological organisms with robotics and control theory to create more intelligent autonomous systems with real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Evolution beats random chance: Performance-dependent network evolution for enhanced computational capacity</title>

Abstract: The quest to understand structure-function relationships in networks across scientific disciplines has intensified. However, the optimal network architecture remains elusive, particularly for complex information processing. Therefore, we investigate how optimal and specific network structures form to efficiently solve distinct tasks using a novel framework of performance-dependent network evolution, leveraging reservoir computing principles. Our study demonstrates that task-specific minimal network structures obtained through this framework consistently outperform networks generated by alternative growth strategies and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random networks. Evolved networks exhibit unexpected sparsity and adhere to scaling laws in node-density space while showcasing a distinctive asymmetry in input and information readout nodes distribution. Consequently, we propose a heuristic for quantifying task complexity from performance-dependently evolved networks, offering valuable insights into the evolutionary dynamics of network structure-function relationships. Our findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of process-specific network evolution but also shed light on the design and optimization of complex information processing mechanisms, notably in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Pairing-induced motion of source and inert particles driven by surface tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.11753v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally and theoretically investigate systems with a pair of source and inert particles that interacts through the concentration field. The experimental system comprises a camphor disk as the source particle and a metal washer as the inert particle. Both are floated on a red aqueous solution at various concentrations, where the glycerol modifies the viscosity of the aqueous phase. The particles form a pair owing to the attractive lateral capillary force. As the camphor disk spreads surface-active molecules at the aqueous surface, the camphor disk and metal washer move together, driven by the surface tension gradient. The washer is situated in the front of the camphor disk, keeping the distance constant during their motion, which we call a pairing-induced motion. The pairing-induced motion exhibited a transition between circular and straight motions as the glycerol concentration in the aqueous phase changed. Numerical calculations using a model that considers forces caused by the surface tension gradient and lateral capillary interaction reproduced the observed transition in the pairing-induced motion. Moreover, this transition agrees with the result of the linear stability analysis on the reduced dynamical system obtained by the expansion with respect to the particle velocity. Our results reveal that the effect of the particle velocity cannot be overlooked to describe the interaction through the concentration field.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Limits of Empirical Finance: Causal Reductionism and Self-Reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16570</link>

Abstract: The clarion call for causal reduction in the study of capital markets is intensifying. However, in self-referencing and open systems such as capital markets, the idea of unidirectional causation (if applicable) may be limiting at best, and unstable or fallacious at worst. In this research, we critically assess the use of scientific deduction and causal inference within the study of empirical finance and econometrics. We then demonstrate the idea of competing causal chains using a toy model adapted from ecological predator/prey relationships. From this, we develop the alternative view that the study of empirical finance, and the risks contained therein, may be better appreciated once we admit that our current arsenal of quantitative finance tools may be limited to ex post causal inference under popular assumptions. Where these assumptions are challenged, for example in a recognizable reflexive context, the prescription of unidirectional causation proves deeply problematic.</description>

      <title>The Nature of the Action Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that our recently developed theory of electric field wave propagation in anisotropic and inhomogeneous brain tissues, which has been shown to explain a broad range of observed coherent synchronous brain electrical processes, also explains the spiking behavior of single neurons, thus bridging the gap between the fundamental element of brain electrical activity (the neuron) and large-scale coherent synchronous electrical activity.
  Our analysis indicates that the membrane interface of the axonal cellular system can be mathematically described by a nonlinear system with several small parameters. This allows for the rigorous derivation of an accurate yet simpler nonlinear model following the formal small parameter expansion. The resulting action potential model exhibits a smooth, continuous transition from the linear wave oscillatory regime to the nonlinear spiking regime, as well as a critical transition to a non-oscillatory regime. These transitions occur with changes in the criticality parameter and include several different bifurcation types, representative of the various experimentally detected neuron types.
  This new theory overcomes the limitations of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, such as the inability to explain extracellular spiking, efficient brain synchronization, saltatory conduction along myelinated axons, and a variety of other observed coherent macroscopic brain electrical phenomena. We also show that the standard cable axon theory can be recovered by our approach, using the very crude assumptions of piece-wise homogeneity and isotropy. However, the diffusion process described by the cable equation is not capable of supporting action potential propagation across a wide range of experimentally reported axon parameters.</description>

      <title>Consensus formation in quality-sensitive interdependent agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of a collective decision-making model inspired by honeybee behavior. This model integrates individual exploration for option discovery and social interactions for information sharing, while also considering option qualities. Our assessment of the decision process outcome employs standard consensus metrics and investigates its correlation with convergence time, revealing common trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Furthermore, we investigate fluctuations arising from finite-size effects. In scenarios with strong interdependence, we identify an absorbing phase transition and scrutinize its key features, including critical fluctuations in finite spatial systems. We find that fluctuations play a significant role in the collective decision-making process, particularly when options have similar qualities. Our findings are especially relevant for finite adaptive systems, as they provide insights into navigating decision-making scenarios with similar options more effectively. Finally, we show that this model also fulfills Weber's Law of perception, aligning with previous analyses of collective-decision problems in their adherence to different psychophysical laws.</description>
