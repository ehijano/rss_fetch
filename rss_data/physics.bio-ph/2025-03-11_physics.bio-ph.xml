      <title>Exploring physiological structure and composition in bacteria with high-resolution quantitative EUV ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Table-top extreme ultraviolet (EUV) microscopy offers unique opportunities for label-free high resolution imaging of biological sample with micrometer-scale penetration depth and strong elemental contrast. In this work, we further advanced a state-of-the-art EUV ptychographic microscope and applied it to systematic studies of the structure and composition of two prokaryotic model bacteria, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. For the first time, a unique combination of quantitative amplitude and phase imaging with high precision and a record-sub-50 nm resolution has been achieved, which unveils the ultrastructure and composition of the bacteria at a nanometer scale. This capability allows for the clear distinction of two different bacterial types, despite their similar size and shape. Furthermore, B. subtilis and its endospores are examined, enabling visualization of their distinct morphology and composition as well as detailed observations of various stages of sporulation. We further visualized the impact of the antibiotic monazomycin on B. subtilis for the first time, revealing its disruptive effects on cellular structures and compositional alterations. This work demonstrates that EUV ptychography, with a straightforward, label-free sample preparation, can serve as a powerful, quantitative imaging modality with a unique sensitivity to chemical information at the nanoscale, advancing biomedical studies e.g. toward developing novel antimicrobial strategies.</description>

      <title>Cell mechanics, environmental geometry, and cell polarity control cell-cell collision outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between crawling cells, which are essential for many biological processes, can be quantified by measuring cell-cell collisions. Conventionally, experiments of cell-cell collisions are conducted on two-dimensional flat substrates, where colliding cells repolarize and move away upon contact with one another in "contact inhibition of locomotion" (CIL). Inspired by recent experiments that show cells on suspended nanofibers have qualitatively different CIL behaviors than those on flat substrates, we develop a phase field model of cell motility and two-cell collisions in fiber geometries. Our model includes cell-cell and cell-fiber adhesion, and a simple positive feedback mechanism of cell polarity. We focus on cell collisions on two parallel fibers, finding that larger cell deformability (lower membrane tension), larger positive feedback of polarization, and larger fiber spacing promote more occurrences of cells walking past one another. We can capture this behavior using a simple linear stability analysis on the cell-cell interface upon collision.</description>

      <title>Feedback controlled microengine powered by motor protein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a template for realization of a novel microengine which is able to harness and convert the activity driven movement of individual motor protein into work output of the system. This engine comprises of a micron size bead-motor protein complex that is subject to a time-varying, feedback controlled optical potential, and a driving force due to the action of the motor protein which stochastically binds, walks and unbinds to an underlying microtubule filament. Using a Stochastic thermodynamics framework and theoretical modeling of bead-motor transport in a harmonic optical trap potential, we obtain the engine characteristics, e.g., work output per cycle, power generated, efficiency and the probability distribution function of the work output as a function of motor parameters and optical trap stiffness. The proposed engine is a work-to-work converter. Remarkably, the performance of this engine can vastly supersede the performance of other microengines that have been realized so far for feasible biological parameter range for kinesin-1 and kinesin-3 motor proteins. In particular, the work output per cycle is ~ (10-15) k_b T while the power output is (5-8) k_b T s^{-1}. Furthermore, we find that even with time delay in feedback protocol, the performance of the engine remains robust as long as the delay time is much smaller than the Brownian relaxation time of the micron size bead. Indeed such low delay time in feedback in the optical trap setup can easily be achieved with current Infrared (IR) lasers and optical trap sensor. The average work output and power output of the engine, exhibits interesting non-monotonic dependence on motor velocity and optical trap stiffness. As such this motor protein driven microengine can be a promising potential prototype for fabricating an actual microdevice engine which can have practical utility.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of tetracycline photocatalytic degradation using NiFe2O4/CeO2/GO nanocomposite for environmental remediation: In silico molecular docking, Antibacterial performance, degradation pathways, and DFT calculations</title>

Abstract: Graphene-based nanostructures with distinct structural and physicochemical characteristics may be able to photodegrade antibiotics effectively. Herein, this study reports the successful synthesis of NiFe2O4/CeO2/GO nanocomposite (NC) by anchoring NiFe2O4/CeO2 to the surface of GO (Graphene oxide). All state-of-the-art characterization techniques investigated the nanostructure, crystallinity, phonon modes, chemical composition analysis, elemental composition, surface area, magnetic properties, and optical band gap. Hydrothermal approach assisted NiFe2O4/CeO2/GO catalyst showed better charge carrier separation and prompted the tetracycline (TC-HCl) photocatalytic degradation under visible light. Following 90 minutes of exposure to visible light, NiFe2O4/CeO2/GO nanocomposite demonstrated superior photocatalytic activity, with a TC-HCl degradation rate of 95%. Reasonable mechanisms of tetracycline degradation were proposed where the OH and O played a leading role based on identified intermediates. Moreover, tetracycline photodegradation intermediates and the optimal pathway were identified using LC-MS spectrometry. This study also performed Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations for the prepared materials to validate the experimental data. In vitro, antibacterial studies were consistent with the molecular docking investigations of the NiFe2O4/CeO2/GO nanocomposite against DNA gyrase and FabI from Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus). Lastly, the outcomes revealed a new potential for NiFe2O4/CeO2/GO nanocomposite for improved photocatalytic performance, making it a promising photocatalyst for wastewater treatment.</description>

      <title>Quantum-like cognition and decision making in the light of quantum measurement theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the class of quantum measurements that matches the applications of quantum theory to cognition (and decision making) - quantum-like modeling. Projective measurements describe the canonical measurements of the basic observables of quantum physics. However, the combinations of the basic cognitive effects, such as the question order and response replicability effects, cannot be described by projective measurements. We motivate the use of the special class of quantum measurements, namely {\it sharp repeatable non-projective measurements} - ${\cal SR\bar{P}}. $ This class is practically unused in quantum physics. Thus, physics and cognition explore different parts of quantum measurement theory. Quantum-like modeling isn't automatic borrowing of the quantum formalism. Exploring the class ${\cal SR\bar{P}}$ highlights the role of {\it noncommutativity of the state update maps generated by measurement back action.} Thus, ``non-classicality'' in quantum physics as well as quantum-like modeling for cognition is based on two different types of noncommutativity, of operators (observables) and instruments (state update maps): {\it observable-noncommutativity} vs. {\it state update-noncommutativity}. We speculate that distinguishing quantum-like properties of the cognitive effects are the expressions of the latter, or possibly both.</description>

      <title>Spin-Dependent Amyloid Self-Assembly on Magnetic Substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein aggregation into insoluble amyloid-like fibrils is implicated in a wide range of diseases and understanding its nucleation process is a key for mechanistic insights and advancing therapeutics. The electronic charge of the amyloidogenic monomers significantly influences their self-assembly process. However, the impact of electron spin interactions between monomers on amyloid nucleation has not been considered yet. Here, we studied amyloid formation on magnetic substrates using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), fluorescence microscopy, and Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) Spectroscopy. We observed a preferred magnetization orientation of the ferromagnetic layer for fibril formation, leading to twice as many and significantly longer fibrils (up to 20 times) compared to the opposite magnetization orientation. This preference is related to monomer chirality. Additionally, fibril structure varied with substrate magnetization orientation. Our findings suggest a transient spin polarization in monomers during self-assembly, driven by the Chiral Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect. These effects are consistent for various molecule length scales, from A-beta polypeptide to dipeptides and single amino acids, indicating a fundamental spin-based dependence on biomolecular aggregation that could be applied in novel therapeutic interventions targeted for amyloid-related diseases.</description>

      <title>UniGenX: Unified Generation of Sequence and Structure with Autoregressive Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unified generation of sequence and structure for scientific data (e.g., materials, molecules, proteins) is a critical task. Existing approaches primarily rely on either autoregressive sequence models or diffusion models, each offering distinct advantages and facing notable limitations. Autoregressive models, such as GPT, Llama, and Phi-4, have demonstrated remarkable success in natural language generation and have been extended to multimodal tasks (e.g., image, video, and audio) using advanced encoders like VQ-VAE to represent complex modalities as discrete sequences. However, their direct application to scientific domains is challenging due to the high precision requirements and the diverse nature of scientific data. On the other hand, diffusion models excel at generating high-dimensional scientific data, such as protein, molecule, and material structures, with remarkable accuracy. Yet, their inability to effectively model sequences limits their potential as general-purpose multimodal foundation models. To address these challenges, we propose UniGenX, a unified framework that combines autoregressive next-token prediction with conditional diffusion models. This integration leverages the strengths of autoregressive models to ease the training of conditional diffusion models, while diffusion-based generative heads enhance the precision of autoregressive predictions. We validate the effectiveness of UniGenX on material and small molecule generation tasks, achieving a significant leap in state-of-the-art performance for material crystal structure prediction and establishing new state-of-the-art results for small molecule structure prediction, de novo design, and conditional generation. Notably, UniGenX demonstrates significant improvements, especially in handling long sequences for complex structures, showcasing its efficacy as a versatile tool for scientific data generation.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Learning in Spiking Neural Networks with Astrocyte-Like Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional artificial neural networks take inspiration from biological networks, using layers of neuron-like nodes to pass information for processing. More realistic models include spiking in the neural network, capturing the electrical characteristics more closely. However, a large proportion of brain cells are of the glial cell type, in particular astrocytes which have been suggested to play a role in performing computations. Here, we introduce a modified spiking neural network model with added astrocyte-like units in a neural network and asses their impact on learning. We implement the network as a liquid state machine and task the network with performing a chaotic time-series prediction task. We varied the number and ratio of neuron-like and astrocyte-like units in the network to examine the latter units effect on learning. We show that the combination of neurons and astrocytes together, as opposed to neural- and astrocyte-only networks, are critical for driving learning. Interestingly, we found that the highest learning rate was achieved when the ratio between astrocyte-like and neuron-like units was roughly 2 to 1, mirroring some estimates of the ratio of biological astrocytes to neurons. Our results demonstrate that incorporating astrocyte-like units which represent information across longer timescales can alter the learning rates of neural networks, and the proportion of astrocytes to neurons should be tuned appropriately to a given task.</description>

      <title>Photometric Decision-Making During the Dawn Choruses of Cicadas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first quantitative study of the onset of dawn choruses of cicadas in several natural habitats. A time-frequency analysis of the acoustical signals is used to define an order parameter for the development of collective singing. The ensemble of recordings reveals that the chorus onset times accurately track the changing sunrise times over the course of many weeks, occurring within civil twilight at a solar elevation of -$3.8^\circ \pm 0.2^\circ$. Despite day-to-day variations in the amplitude of fully developed choruses, the order parameter data collapse to a common sigmoidal curve when scaled by those amplitudes and shifted by the onset time, revealing a characteristic rise time of ~60 s for a chorus to reach saturation amplitude. The results are used to obtain the cumulative distribution function of singing as a function of ground illumination, from which is obtained a generalized susceptibility which exhibits a narrow peak with a half-width of $\sim\! 12\%$. The variance of the order parameter exhibits a similar peak, suggesting that a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem holds for this system. A model of decision-making under ramps of a control parameter is developed and can achieve a quantitative match to the data. It suggest that sharpness of the susceptibility peak reflects cooperative decision-making arising from acoustic communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: VTX is an open-source molecular visualization software designed to overcome the scaling limitations of existing real-time molecular visualization software when handling massive molecular datasets. VTX employs a meshless molecular graphics engine utilizing impostor-based techniques and adaptive level-of-detail (LOD) rendering. This approach significantly reduces memory usage and enables real-time visualization and manipulation of large molecular systems. Performance benchmarks against VMD, PyMOL, and ChimeraX using a 114-million-bead Martini minimal whole-cell model demonstrate VTX's efficiency, maintaining consistent frame rates even under interactive manipulation on standard computer hardware. VTX incorporates features such as screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO) for enhanced depth perception and free-fly navigation for intuitive exploration of large molecular systems. VTX is open-source and free for non commercial use. Binaries for Windows and Ubuntu Linux are available at \href{http://vtx.drugdesign.fr}{http://vtx.drugdesign.fr}. VTX source code is available at \href{https://github.com/VTX-Molecular-Visualization}{https://github.com/VTX-Molecular-Visualization}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular sorting in biological membranes is essential for proper cellular function. It also plays a crucial role in the budding of enveloped viruses from host cells. We recently proposed that this process is driven by phase separation, where the formation and growth of sorting domains depend primarily on direct intermolecular interactions. In addition to these, Casimir-like forces -- arising from entropic effects in fluctuating membranes -- may also play a significant role in the molecular distillation process. Here, using a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we explore how Casimir-like forces between rigid membrane inclusions contribute to sorting, particularly in the biologically relevant regime where direct intermolecular interactions are weak. Our results show that these forces enhance molecular distillation by reducing the critical radius for the formation of new sorting domains and facilitating the capture of molecules within these domains. We identify the relative rigidity of the membrane and supermolecular domains as a key parameter controlling molecular sorting efficiency, offering new insights into the physical principles underlying molecular sorting in biological systems.</description>

      <title>The geometric nature of homeostatic stress in biological growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Morphogenesis, the process of growth and shape formation in biological tissues, is driven by complex interactions between mechanical, biochemical, and genetic factors. Traditional models of biological growth often rely on the concept of homeostatic Eshelby stress, which defines an ideal target state for the growing body. Any local deviation from this state triggers growth and remodelling, aimed at restoring balance between mechanical forces and biological adaptation. Despite its relevance in the biomechanical context, the nature of homeostatic stress remains elusive, with its value and spatial distribution often chosen arbitrarily, lacking a clear biological interpretation or understanding of its connection to the lower scales of the tissue. To bring clarity on the nature of homeostatic stress, we shift the focus from Eshelby stress to growth incompatibility, a measure of geometric frustration in the tissue that is the primary source of residual stresses in the developing body. Incompatibility, measured by the Ricci tensor of the growth metric at the continuous level, can be potentially regulated at the cell level through connections with the surrounding cells, making it a more meaningful concept than homeostatic stress. In this geometric perspective, achieving a homeostatic state corresponds to the establishment of a physiological level of frustration in the body, a process leading to the generation and maintenance of the mechanical stresses that are crucial to tissue functionality. In this work we present a formulation of biological growth that penalises deviations from a desired state of incompatibility, similar to the way the Einstein-Hilbert action operates in General Relativity. The proposed framework offers a clear and physically grounded approach that elucidates the regulation of size and shape, while providing a means to link cellular and tissue scales in biological systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active matter concerns many-body systems comprised of living or self-driven agents that collectively exhibit macroscopic phenomena distinct from conventional passive matter. Using Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory, we develop a novel hydrodynamic framework for thermal active matter that accounts for energy balance, local temperature variations, and the ensuing stochastic effects. By modelling active matter as a driven open system, we show that the source of active contributions to hydrodynamics, violations of fluctuation-dissipation theorems, and detailed balance is rooted in the breaking of time-translation symmetry due to the presence of fuel consumption and an external environmental bath. In addition, our framework allows for non-equilibrium steady states that produce entropy, with a well-defined notion of steady-state temperature. We use our framework of active hydrodynamics to develop effective field theory actions for active superfluids and active nematics that offer a first-principle derivation of various active transport coefficients and feature activity-induced phase transitions. We also show how to incorporate temperature, energy and noise in fluctuating hydrodynamics for active matter. Our work suggests a broader perspective on active matter that can leave an imprint across scales.</description>

Abstract: We employ deep reinforcement learning methods to investigate shortest-time navigation strategies for smart active Brownian particles (microagents), which self-propel through a rotating potential barrier in a static, viscous, fluid background. The microagent's motion begins at a specified origin and terminates at a designated destination. The potential barrier is modeled as a localized, repulsive Gaussian potential with finite support, whose peak location rotates at a given angular velocity about a fixed center within the plane of motion. We use the Advantage Actor-Critic approach to train microagents for their origin-to-destination navigation through the barrier. By employing this approach, we demonstrate that the rotating potential (as opposed to a static one) enables size-based sorting and separation of the microagents. In other words, microagents of different radii arrive at the destination at sufficiently well-separated average times, facilitating their sorting. The efficiency of particle sorting is quantified by introducing specific separation measures. We also demonstrate how training the microagents in a noisy background, as opposed to a noise-free one, can improve the precision of their size-based sorting. Our findings suggest promising avenues for future research on smart active particles equipped with deep reinforcement learning to navigate complex environments, particularly in microscale applications.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emergence of run-and-tumble-like dynamics in coupled self-propelled robots: experiment and theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the motility behaviour of microorganisms, we introduce a highly tunable, robotic system self-actuating into the run-and-tumble (RT)-like motion. It comprises two disk-shaped, centimeter-scale programmable robots individually programmed to perform overdamped active Brownian (AB) motion and connected by a rigid rod. The rod is attached to pivot points located on off-centered, mirror-symmetric points on each robot, allowing for its free rotation at both ends. We show that the collective dynamics of this system execute RT-like motion with characteristic sharp tumble events and exponentially distributed run times, similar to those observed in microorganisms. We further quantify emerging dynamics in terms of tumbling frequency and tune it over a wide range of experimental parameters. We also develop a theoretical model that reproduces our experimental results and elucidates the underlying physical mechanisms governing the rich phase behavior of RT motion. Together, these results highlight the importance of our robotic platform in offering valuable insights into the mechanism of motility characteristics in microorganisms.</description>
