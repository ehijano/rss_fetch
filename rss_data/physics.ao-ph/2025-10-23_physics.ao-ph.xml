      <title>A Reduced-Dimensional Model for the Interhemispheric Geostrophic Meridional Overturning Circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Global Overturning Circulation (GOC) is a key component of the climate system, transporting heat, carbon, and salt throughout the global ocean. Previous reduced-dimensional models have sought to represent this three-dimensional circulation but often neglected three key observational features: (1) the meridional overturning circulation is in geostrophic balance below the Ekman layer, (2) diapycnal mixing is strongly enhanced near ocean boundaries, and (3) upwelling is partly driven by adiabatic dynamics in the Southern Ocean. Building on Callies and Marotzke (2012), we develop a reduced model that consistently incorporates all three by simulating temperature in latitude-depth space along the eastern and western boundaries of a semi-enclosed basin connected in the south to a zonally periodic re-entrant channel. The model clarifies how zonal temperature differences in the basin arise and are maintained through adiabatic and diffusive processes, giving rise to the geostrophic GOC. It also provides a transparent framework for understanding how geostrophic currents cross the equator to form the interhemispheric overturning, and how boundary-intensified mixing and Southern Ocean winds regulate polar downwelling rates. The reduced model shows good agreement with both a three-dimensional ocean model and theoretical scaling laws for stratification and overturning strength. Owing to its simplicity, it is well suited for long integrations exploring the GOC response under extreme forcing scenarios and offers a useful framework for testing eddy and mixing parameterizations.</description>

      <title>Exciting Standing Rossby Waves in the Large Rotating Annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laboratory experiments with rotating tanks remain the premier physical analogue for atmospheric dynamics. Often, the equipment involved is engineered to be sufficiently versatile and modular so as to be able to accommodate experiments that explore a wide range of atmospheric processes. The exercise of initially configuring the apparatus then involves running experiments that sweep through parameter space to identify the specific dynamical regimes of interest. This process is typically considered part of the development and testing phase of a given project, and these initial experiments are generally left unreported; while many of these test experiments may not be directly relevant to the project at hand, they may be useful for other applications or scientific communities. Here we report on a series of 93 different laboratory experiments run with the intention of identifying suitable experimental configurations that excite and sustain standing Rossby waves.</description>

      <title>Wind Variability and Its Effect on Transmission Line Capacity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of wind velocity averaging on Dynamic Thermal Rating (DTR) calculations. It is based on a high-temporal-resolution (1 second) wind measurements obtained from a transmission line in Slovenia, Europe. Wind speed and direction variability are analysed, and two averaging methods, namely vector averaging, where velocity is averaged as vector, and hybrid averaging, where speed is averaged as scalar, are employed. DTR calculations are performed on both high-resolution data and averaged data (5 minute averaging window). It is demonstrated that averaging has a significant effect on both Nusselt number and ampacity, and the effect exhibits a strong angular dependency on the relative angle of the wind to the line. Therefore, two limit cases are studied: in the case of parallel wind, averaged data underestimates the ampacity, and there is a significant amount of cases where the underestimation is larger than 10 %. In the case of perpendicular wind, the two averaging methods affect the results in different ways, but both result in a substantial amount of cases where ampacity is overestimated, potentially leading to unsafe operation. The main takeaway of the study is that averaging wind velocity has a significant impact on DTR results, and special emphasis should be given to the averaging method, as different methods affect the results in different ways.</description>

      <title>Causal Feedback Discovery using Convergence Cross Mapping on Sea Ice Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09001v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying causal relationships in climate systems remains challenging due to nonlinear, coupled dynamics that limit the effectiveness of linear and stochastic causal discovery approaches. This study benchmarks Convergence Cross Mapping (CCM) against Granger causality, PCMCI, and VarLiNGAM using both synthetic datasets with ground truth causal links and 41 years of Arctic climate data (1979--2021). Unlike stochastic models that rely on autoregressive residual dependence, CCM leverages Takens' state-space reconstruction and delay-embedding to reconstruct attractor manifolds from time series. Cross mapping between reconstructed manifolds exploits deterministic signatures of causation, enabling the detection of weak and bidirectional causal links that linear models fail to resolve. Results demonstrate that CCM achieves higher specificity and fewer false positives on synthetic benchmarks, while maintaining robustness under observational noise and limited sample lengths. On Arctic data, CCM reveals significant causal interactions between sea ice extent and atmospheric variables like specific humidity, longwave radiation, and surface temperature with a $p$-value of $0.009$, supporting ice-albedo feedbacks and moisture-radiation couplings central to Arctic amplification. In contrast, stochastic approaches miss these nonlinear dependencies or infer spurious causal relations. This work establishes CCM as a robust causal inference tool for nonlinear climate dynamics and provides the first systematic benchmarking framework for method selection in climate research.</description>
