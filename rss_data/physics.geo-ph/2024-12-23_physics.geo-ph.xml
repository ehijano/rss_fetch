      <title>Ground Motion Characteristics of Cascading Earthquakes in a Multiscale Fracture Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault zones exhibit geometrical complexity and are often surrounded by multiscale fracture networks within their damage zones, influencing rupture dynamics and near-field ground motions. We investigate the ground-motion characteristics of cascading ruptures across damage zone fracture networks of moderate-sized earthquakes using high-resolution 3D dynamic rupture simulations. Our models feature a listric fault surrounded by over 800 fractures, emulating a major fault and its associated damage zone. We analyze three cases: a cascading rupture propagating within the fracture network, a non-cascading main-fault rupture with off-fault fracture slip, and a main-fault rupture without a fracture network. Cascading ruptures within the fracture network produce distinct ground-motion signatures with high-frequency content, arising from simultaneous slip of multiple fractures and parts of the main fault, resembling source coda-wave-like signatures. This case shows elevated near-field characteristic frequency (fc) and stress drop, approximately an order of magnitude higher than the estimation directly on the fault of the dynamic rupture simulation. The inferred fc of the modeled vertical components reflects the complexity of the radiation pattern and rupture directivity of cascading earthquakes. We show that this is consistent with observations of strong azimuthal dependence of corner frequency in the 2009-2016 Central Apennines, Italy, earthquake sequence. Simulated ground motions from cascading ruptures also show pronounced azimuthal variations in peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity, and pseudo-spectral acceleration, with average PGA nearly double that of the non-cascading cases. Such outcomes emphasize the critical role of fault-zone complexity in affecting rupture dynamics and seismic radiation and have important implications for physics-based seismic hazard assessment.</description>

      <title>Fluid flow channeling and mass transport with discontinuous porosity distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flow of fluids within porous rocks is an important process with numerous applications in Earth sciences. Modeling the compaction-driven fluid flow requires the solution of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations that account for the fluid flow and the solid deformation within the porous medium. Despite the nonlinear relation of porosity and permeability that is commonly encountered, natural data show evidence of channelized fluid flow in rocks that have an overall layered structure. Layers of different rock types routinely have discontinuous hydraulic and mechanical properties. We present numerical results obtained by a novel space-time method which can handle discontinuous initial porosity (and permeability) distributions. The space-time method enables a straightforward coupling to models of mass transport for trace elements. Our results show the influence of different kinds of layering in the development of fluid-rich channels and mass transport.</description>

      <title>Sims: An Interactive Tool for Geospatial Matching and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acquiring, processing, and visualizing geospatial data requires significant computing resources, especially for large spatio-temporal domains. This challenge hinders the rapid discovery of predictive features, which is essential for advancing geospatial modeling. To address this, we developed Similarity Search (Sims), a no-code web tool that allows users to perform clustering and similarity search over defined regions of interest using Google Earth Engine as a backend. Sims is designed to complement existing modeling tools by focusing on feature exploration rather than model creation. We demonstrate the utility of Sims through a case study analyzing simulated maize yield data in Rwanda, where we evaluate how different combinations of soil, weather, and agronomic features affect the clustering of yield response zones. Sims is open source and available at https://github.com/microsoft/Sims</description>
