      <title>Speed and shape of population fronts with density-dependent diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate travelling wave solutions in reaction-diffusion models of animal range expansion in the case that population diffusion is density-dependent. We find that the speed of the selected wave depends critically on the strength of diffusion at low density. For sufficiently large low-density diffusion, the wave propagates at a speed predicted by a simple linear analysis. For small or zero low-density diffusion, the linear analysis is not sufficient, but a variational approach yields exact or approximate expressions for the speed and shape of population fronts.</description>

      <title>Sticky extinction states and the egalitarian transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abundance fluctuations caused by environmental stochasticity are proportional to population size. Therefore, populations that reach low density tend to remain in this state and can increase only due to rare sequences of favorable years. This stickiness can affect the composition of a community, as many species become trapped in an almost permanent state of rarity. Here, we present a solution for the species abundance distribution in scenarios where environmental stochasticity is the dominant mechanism. We show that in the absence of processes that impose a lower bound on abundances (such as immigration), the community is dominated, at equilibrium, by a single species. In the presence of immigration, the community undergoes a transition from an egalitarian state, under weak stochasticity, to a very skewed abundance distribution when stochasticity is strong.</description>

      <title>Stability of a Delayed Predator-Prey Model for Puma Concolor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a mathematical model that describes the relationship between the Puma concolor and its prey using delay differential equations, a Holling type III functional response, logistic growth for the prey, and a Ricker-type function to model intraspecific competition of the pumas. For positive equilibrium, conditions guaranteeing absolute stability are established, based on the delay value and model parameters. The analysis demonstrates the existence of a unique maximal solution for the proposed model, which remains non-negative for nonnegative initial conditions and is well-defined for all $t$ greater than zero. Furthermore, numerical simulations with different parameter values were performed to investigate the effects of systematically removing a percentage of predators or prey. Numerical simulations attempt to exemplify and put into practice the theorems proved in this article.</description>

      <title>A general mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of heterogeneous stem cell regeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.11448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stem cell heterogeneity is essential for the homeostasis in tissue development. This paper established a general formulation for understanding the dynamics of stem cell regeneration with cell heterogeneity and random transitions of epigenetic states. The model generalizes the classical G0 cell cycle model, and incorporates the epigenetic states of stem cells that are represented by a continuous multidimensional variable and the kinetic rates of cell behaviors, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, that are dependent on their epigenetic states. Moreover, the random transition of epigenetic states is represented by an inheritance probability that can be described as a conditional beta distribution. This model can be extended to investigate gene mutation-induced tumor development. The proposed formula is a generalized formula that helps us to understand various dynamic processes of stem cell regeneration, including tissue development, degeneration, and abnormal growth.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analysis of a Coupled SIS Bi-Virus Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11414v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper deals with the setting where two viruses (say virus 1 and virus 2) coexist in a population, and they are not necessarily mutually exclusive, in the sense that infection due to one virus does not preclude the possibility of simultaneous infection due to the other. We develop a coupled bi-virus susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model from a 4n-state Markov chain model, where n is the number of agents (i.e., individuals or subpopulation) in the population. We identify a sufficient condition for both viruses to eventually die out, and a sufficient condition for the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium of each virus. We establish a sufficient condition and multiple necessary conditions for local exponential convergence to the boundary equilibrium (i.e., one virus persists, the other one dies out) of each virus. Under mild assumptions on the healing rate, we show that there cannot exist a coexisting equilibrium where for each node there is a nonzero fraction infected only by virus 1; a nonzero fraction infected only by virus 2; but no fraction that is infected by both viruses 1 and 2. Likewise, assuming that healing rates are strictly positive, a coexisting equilibrium where for each node there is a nonzero fraction infected by both viruses 1 and 2, but no fraction is infected only by virus 1 (resp. virus 2) does not exist. Further, we provide a necessary condition for the existence of certain other kinds of coexisting equilibria. We show that, unlike the competitive bivirus model, the coupled bivirus model is not monotone. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical findings using an extensive set of in-depth simulations.</description>

      <title>The Origin and Evolution of Information Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04374v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge when describing the origin of life is to explain "how instructional information control systems emerge naturally and spontaneously from mere molecular dynamics". So far, no one has clarified how information control emerged ab initio and how primitive control mechanisms in life might have evolved, becoming increasingly refined. Based on recent experimental results showing that chemical computation does not require the presence of life-related chemistry, we elucidate the origin and early evolution of information handling by chemical automata, from information processing (computation) to information storage (memory) and information transmission (communication) and later digital messengers, covering at the same time its syntactic, semantic and pragmatic flavors. In contrast to other theories that assume the existence of initial complex structures, our representation starts from trivial self-replicators whose interaction leads to the arising of more powerful molecular machines. By describing precisely the primordial transitions in chemistry-based computation, our framework is capable of explaining the above-mentioned gaps and can be translated to other models of computation, which allow us to explore biological phenomena at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Being compatible with the free energy principle, we have developed a computational enactivist theoretical framework that could be able to describe from the origin of life to high-level cognition, as if it were a purely constructivist narrative. At the end of our manuscript, we propose some ways to extend our ideas, including experimental validation of our theory (both in vitro and in silico).</description>
