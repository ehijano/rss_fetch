      <title>Molecular-Size Control of Properties of Therapeutic Nano-Paper Allows for Selective Drug Storage in Small Doses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel concept of nano-scaled interwoven templates for drug delivery with alternating hydro- and lipophilicity properties is introduced. They are built from cellulose and peptide hydrogel in tandem, and characterized by a nano-stacked interwoven design, thus enabling for tuning the lipophilicity in the mesh nano-domains in which drug candidates of complementary lipophilicities can be embedded. This allows for low-dose-controlled consumption and therapeutic applications. Time-resolved and in-situ grazing incidence X-ray scattering studies confirm the design of the therapeutic nano-paper and create conditions suitable for the drug storage of complementary properties. The molecular design has the potential of a locally controlled, site-specific drug release on a beyond-nanomolar scale. Generalized, the design may contribute to facile developments of personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>The-Bodega: A Matlab Toolbox for Biologically Dynamic Microbubble Simulations on Realistic Hemodynamic Microvascular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The-Bodega is a Matlab-based toolbox for simulating ground-truth datasets for Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM)-a super resolution imaging technique that resolves microvessels by systematically tracking microbubbles flowing through the microvasculature. The-Bodega enables open-source simulation of stochastic microbubble dynamics through anatomically complex vascular graphs and features a quasi-automated pipeline for generating ground-truth ultrasound data from simple vascular inputs. It incorporates sequential Monte Carlo simulations augmented with Poiseuille flow distributions and dynamic pulsatile flow. A key novelty of our framework is its flexibility to accommodate arbitrary vascular architectures and benchmark common ULM algorithms, such as Fourier Ring Correlation and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) spatiotemporal filtering, on realistic hemodynamic digital phantoms. The-Bodega supports consistent microbubble-to-ultrasound simulations across domains ranging from mouse brains to human hearts and automatically leverages available CPU/GPU parallelization to improve computational efficiency. We demonstrate its versatility in applications including image quality assessment, motion artifact analysis, and the simulation of novel ULM modalities, such as capillary imaging, myocardial reconstruction under beating heart motion, and simulating neurovascular evoked responses.</description>

      <title>In Vivo Wideband MR Elastography for Assessing Age-Related Viscoelastic Changes of the Human Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) provides maps of brain biomechanics and is highly sensitive to alterations associated with aging and neurodegenerative disease. Most implementations use a single frequency or a narrow frequency band, limiting analysis of frequency-dependent viscoelastic parameters. We developed a dual-actuator wideband MRE (5-50 Hz) protocol and acquired wavefields at 13 frequencies in 24 healthy adults (young: 23-39 years; old: 50-63 years). Shear wave speed (SWS) maps were generated as a proxy for stiffness, and SWS dispersion was modeled with Newtonian, Kelvin-Voigt, and power-law models. Full brain SWS declines with age, most strongly at lower frequencies (5-16 Hz: -0.24%/year; p=0.019) compared with mid (20-35 Hz: -0.12%/year; p=0.030) and high frequencies (40-50 Hz: -0.10%/year; p=0.165). Power-law baseline SWS was higher in younger than in older adults (0.14$\pm$0.01 m/s vs 0.12$\pm$0.0035 m/s; p=0.018), and viscosity was also higher (Newtonian model: 7.43$\pm$0.35 vs 6.85$\pm$0.37 Pa$\cdot$s; p=0.003; Kelvin-Voigt: 7.99$\pm$0.36 vs. 7.40$\pm$0.45 Pa$\cdot$s; p=0.007). Regionally, white matter and cortical gray matter showed similar age-related declines in power-law SWS and viscosity. In deep gray matter the power-law exponent unusually increased with age (0.0010/year; p=0.036), indicating a transition toward softer, fluid-like tissue properties in that region. Wideband MRE with viscoelastic modeling resolved frequency-dependent and regional aging signatures. Sensitivity was greatest at low frequencies, highlighting this range as promising for detecting microstructural alterations in aging and neurodegeneration.</description>

      <title>An Iterative LLM Framework for SIBT utilizing RAG-based Adaptive Weight Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seed implant brachytherapy (SIBT) is an effective cancer treatment modality; however, clinical planning often relies on manual adjustment of objective function weights, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal results. This study proposes an adaptive weight optimization framework for SIBT planning, driven by large language models (LLMs). A locally deployed DeepSeek-R1 LLM is integrated with an automatic planning algorithm in an iterative loop. Starting with fixed weights, the LLM evaluates plan quality and recommends new weights in the next iteration. This process continues until convergence criteria are met, after which the LLM conducts a comprehensive evaluation to identify the optimal plan. A clinical knowledge base, constructed and queried via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enhances the model's domain-specific reasoning. The proposed method was validated on 23 patient cases, showing that the LLM-assisted approach produces plans that are comparable to or exceeding clinically approved and fixed-weight plans, in terms of dose homogeneity for the clinical target volume (CTV) and sparing of organs at risk (OARs). The study demonstrates the potential use of LLMs in SIBT planning automation.</description>

      <title>A parallel algorithm for generating Pareto-optimal radiosurgery treatment plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using inverse planning tools to create radiotherapy treatment plans is an iterative process, where clinical trade-offs are explored by changing the relative importance of different objectives and rerunning the optimizer until a desirable plan is found. We seek to optimize hundreds of radiosurgery treatment plans, corresponding to different weightings of objectives, fast enough to incorporate interactive Pareto navigation of clinical trade-offs into the clinical workflow. We apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to the linear-program formulation of the optimization problem used in Lightning. We implement both a CPU and a GPU version of ADMM in Matlab and compare them to Matlab's built-in, single-threaded dual-simplex solver. The ADMM implementation is adapted to the optimization procedure used in the clinical software, with a bespoke algorithm for maximizing overlap between low-dose points for different objective weights. The method is evaluated on a test dataset consisting of 20 cases from three different indications, with between one and nine targets and total target volumes ranging from 0.66 to 52 cm3, yielding speedups of 1.6-97 and 54-1500 times on CPU and GPU, respectively, compared to simplex. Plan quality was evaluated by rerunning the ADMM optimization 20 times, each with a different random seed, for each test case and for nine objective weightings per case. The resulting clinical metrics closely mimicked those obtained when rerunning the simplex solver, verifying the validity of the method. In conclusion, we show how ADMM can be adapted for radiosurgery plan optimization, allowing hundreds of high-quality Gamma Knife treatment plans to be created in under two minutes on a single GPU, also for very large cases.</description>

      <title>Low-Cost and Detunable Wireless Resonator Glasses for Enhanced Eye MRI with Concurrent High-Quality Whole Brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a wearable wireless resonator glasses design that enhances eye MRI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) without compromising whole-brain image quality at 7 T.
  Methods: The device integrates two detunable LC loop resonators into a lightweight, 3D-printed frame positioned near the eyes. The resonators passively couple to a standard 2Tx/32Rx head coil without hardware modifications. Bench tests assessed tuning, isolation, and detuning performance. B1$^+$ maps were measured in a head/shoulder phantom, and SNR maps were obtained in both phantom and in vivo experiments.
  Results: Bench measurements confirmed accurate tuning, strong inter-element isolation, and effective passive detuning. Phantom B1$^+$ mapping showed negligible differences between configurations with and without the resonators. Phantom and in vivo imaging demonstrated up to about a 3-fold SNR gain in the eye region, with no measurable SNR loss in the brain.
  Conclusion: The wireless resonator glasses provide a low-cost, easy-to-use solution that improves ocular SNR while preserving whole-brain image quality, enabling both dedicated eye MRI and simultaneous eye-brain imaging at ultrahigh field.</description>
