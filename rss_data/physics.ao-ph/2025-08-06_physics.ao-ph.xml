      <title>Operational convection-permitting COSMO/ICON ensemble predictions at observation sites (CIENS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the CIENS dataset, which contains ensemble weather forecasts from the operational convection-permitting numerical weather prediction model of the German Weather Service. It comprises forecasts for 55 meteorological variables mapped to the locations of synoptic stations, as well as additional spatially aggregated forecasts from surrounding grid points, available for a subset of these variables. Forecasts are available at hourly lead times from 0 to 21 hours for two daily model runs initialized at 00 and 12 UTC, covering the period from December 2010 to June 2023. Additionally, the dataset provides station observations for six key variables at 170 locations across Germany: pressure, temperature, hourly precipitation accumulation, wind speed, wind direction, and wind gusts. Since the forecast are mapped to the observed locations, the data is delivered in a convenient format for analysis. The CIENS dataset complements the growing collection of benchmark datasets for weather and climate modeling. A key distinguishing feature is its long temporal extent, which encompasses multiple updates to the underlying numerical weather prediction model and thus supports investigations into how forecasting methods can account for such changes. In addition to detailing the design and contents of the CIENS dataset, we outline potential applications in ensemble post-processing, forecast verification, and related research areas. A use case focused on ensemble post-processing illustrates the benefits of incorporating the rich set of available model predictors into machine learning-based forecasting models.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric stability sets maximum moist heat and convection in the midlatitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05351v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme near-surface moist heat and severe convective storms are among the leading causes of weather-related damages worldwide. Here, we show that episodes of extreme moist heat and severe convection frequently co-occur across midlatitude land regions, and develop a theoretical framework that links their maximum potential intensities to preexisting low-level energy inversions. By accounting for the stored-energy nature of midlatitude severe convection, where moist heat and atmospheric instability accumulate before convection initiates, our work advances the understanding of convective constraints on extreme heat events. The theory identifies low-level inversions as a critical factor shaping compound extreme heat and convective weather risks, and offers a pathway for improving the modeling and future projection of these events.</description>

      <title>The Ceiling Height of Wildland Fire Plumes in Sheared Boundary Layer Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radar observations from a prescribed fire experiment reveal a large-scale, billow-like vorticity pair associated with the plume head at the onset of plume bending. The bending confines the ceiling height of the plume, delaying its smoke dispersion and increasing fire spotting risks. This study aims to investigate the onset of plume bending in a sheared crossflow and stratified atmospheric conditions, providing insights into smoke dispersion and fire behavior. Large Eddy Simulations (LES) using the Cloud Model 1 (CM1) are conducted to simulate the observed development of plume structure and its associated dynamical fields, with particular focus on the plume head and its evolution from initial plume development under different fire intensities and atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) conditions. A scaling analysis of plume ceiling height is proposed based on a modified Byram's convective number that accounts for sheared crossflow. The proposed scaling agrees well with the LES results, highlighting the critical roles of shear and stratification in controlling plume dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mj\"olnir: A Deep Learning Parametrization Framework for Global Lightning Flash Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI-based weather forecasting models, such as FourCastNet, Pangu-Weather, and GraphCast, have demonstrated the remarkable ability of deep learning to emulate complex atmospheric dynamics. Building on this momentum, we propose Mj\"olnir, a novel deep learning-based framework for global lightning flash density parameterization. Trained on ERA5 atmospheric predictors and World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) observations at a daily temporal resolution and 1 degree spatial resolution, Mj\"olnir captures the nonlinear mapping between large-scale environmental conditions and lightning activity. The model architecture is based on the InceptionNeXt backbone with SENet, and a multi-task learning strategy to simultaneously predict lightning occurrence and magnitude. Extensive evaluations yield that Mollnir accurately reproduces the global distribution, seasonal variability, and regional characteristics of lightning activity, achieving a global Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 for annual mean fields. These results suggest that Mj\"olnir serves not only as an effective data-driven global lightning parameterization but also as a promising AI-based scheme for next-generation Earth system models (AI-ESMs).</description>

      <title>AtmosMJ: Revisiting Gating Mechanism for AI Weather Forecasting Beyond the Year Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge. Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion (GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days. In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally efficient long-range weather prediction.</description>
