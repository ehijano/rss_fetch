      <title>Gravitational Wave Phase Shifts in Eccentric Black Hole Mergers as a Probe of Dynamical Formation Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify for the first time the gravitational wave (GW) phase shift appearing in the waveform of eccentric binary black hole (BBH) mergers formed dynamically in three-body systems. For this, we have developed a novel numerical method where we construct a reference binary, by evolving the post-Newtonian (PN) evolution equations backwards from a point near merger without the inclusion of the third object, that can be compared to the real binary that evolves under the influence from the third BH. From this we quantify how the interplay between dynamical tides, PN-effects, and the time-dependent Doppler shift of the eccentric GW source results in unique observable GW phase shifts that can be mapped to the gravitational dynamics taking place at formation. We further find a new analytical expression for the GW phase shift, which surprisingly has a universal functional form that only depends on the time-evolving BBH eccentricity. The normalization scales with the BH masses and initial separation, which can be linked to the underlying astrophysical environment. GW phase shifts from a chaotic 3-body BH scattering taking place in a cluster, and from a BBH inspiraling in a disk migration trap near a super-massive BH, are also shown for illustration. When current and future GW detectors start to observe eccentric GW sources with high enough signal-to-noise-ratio, we propose this to be among the only ways of directly probing the dynamical origin of individual BBH mergers using GWs alone.</description>

      <title>Fast Methods for Computing Photometric Variability of Eccentric Binaries: Boosting, Lensing, and Variable Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze accretion-rate time series for equal-mass binaries in co-planar gaseous disks spanning a continuous range of orbital eccentricities up to 0.8, for both prograde and retrograde systems. The dominant variability timescales match that of previous investigations; the binary orbital period is dominant for prograde binaries with $e \gtrsim 0.1$, with a 5 times longer "lump" period taking over for $e\lesssim 0.1$. This lump period fades and drops from 5 times to 4.5 times the binary period as $e$ approaches 0.1, where it vanishes. For retrograde orbits, the binary orbital period dominates at $e \lesssim 0.55$ and is accompanied by a 2 times longer-timescale periodicity at higher eccentricities. The shape of the accretion-rate time series varies with binary eccentricity. For prograde systems, the orientation of an eccentric disk causes periodic trading of accretion between the binary components in a ratio that we report as a function of binary eccentricity. We present a publicly available tool, binlite, that can rapidly ($\lesssim 0.01$~sec) generate templates for the accretion-rate time series, onto either binary component, for choice of binary eccentricity below 0.8. As an example use-case, we build lightcurve models where the accretion rate through the circumbinary disk and onto each binary component sets contributions to the emitted specific flux. We combine these rest-frame, accretion-variability lightcurves with observer-dependent Doppler boosting and binary self-lensing. This allows a flexible approach to generating lightcurves over a wide range of binary and observer parameter space. We envision binlite as the access point to a living database that will be updated with state-of-the-art hydrodynamical calculations as they advance.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Rare Eclipsing Be/X-ray Binary System, Swift J010902.6-723710 = SXP 182</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the discovery of Swift J010902.6-723710, a rare eclipsing Be/X-ray Binary system by the Swift SMC Survey (S-CUBED). Swift J010902.6-723710 was discovered via weekly S-CUBED monitoring observations when it was observed to enter a state of X-ray outburst on 10 October 2023. X-ray emission was found to be modulated by a 182s period. Optical spectroscopy is used to confirm the presence of a highly-inclined circumstellar disk surrounding a B0-0.5Ve optical companion. Historical UV and IR photometry are then used to identify strong eclipse-like features re-occurring in both light curves with a 60.623 day period, which is adopted as the orbital period of the system. Eclipsing behavior is found to be the result of a large accretion disk surrounding the neutron star. Eclipses are produced when the disk passes in front of the OBe companion, blocking light from both the stellar surface and circumstellar disk. This is only the third Be/X-ray Binary to have confirmed eclipses. We note that this rare behavior provides an important opportunity to constrain the physical parameters of a Be/X-ray Binary with greater accuracy than is possible in non-eclipsing systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial template is important to study the nearby supernova remnant (SNR). For SNR G332.5-5.6, we report a gaussian disk with radius of about 1.06 degrees to be a potential good spatial model in the gamma-ray band. Employing this new gaussian disk, its GeV lightcurve shows a significant variability of about 7 sigma. The $\gamma$-ray observations of this SNR could be explained well either by a leptonic model or a hadronic model, in which a flat spectrum for the ejected electrons/protons.</description>

      <title>Flares during Eclipses of High Mass X-ray Binary Systems Vela X-1, 4U 1700-37, and LMC X-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In eclipsing X-ray binary systems, the direct X-ray emission is blocked by the companion star during the eclipse. We observe only reprocessed emission that contains clues about the environment of the compact object and its chemical composition, ionization levels, etc. We have found flares in some X-ray binaries during their eclipses. The study of eclipse flares provides additional clues regarding the size of the reprocessing region and helps distinguish between different components of the X-ray spectrum observed during the eclipse. In the archival data, we searched for flares during eclipses of high-mass X-ray binaries and found flares in three sources: Vela X-1, LMC X-4, and 4U 1700-37. Comparing spectral properties of the eclipse flare and non-flare data, we found changes in the power-law photon index in all three sources and multiple emission lines in Vela X-1 and 4U 1700-37. The fluxes of prominent emission lines showed a similar increase as the overall X-ray flux during the eclipse flare, suggesting the lines originate in the binary environment and not in the interstellar medium. We also observed a soft excess in 4U 1700-37 that remains unchanged during both eclipse flare and non-flare states. Our analysis suggests that this emission originates from the extremely thin shell of the stellar wind surrounding the photosphere of its companion star. The detection of short (100-200 seconds) count-rate doubling timescale in 4U 1700-37 and LMC X-4 indicates that the eclipse reprocessing occurs in a region larger than, but comparable to the size of the companion star.</description>

      <title>Possible GeV gamma-ray emission from the pulsar wind nebula in CTA 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a detection of GeV $\gamma$-ray emission potentially originating from the pulsar wind nebula in CTA 1 by analyzing about 15 yr of Fermi Large Area Telescope data. By selecting an energy range from 50 GeV to 1 TeV to remove contamination from the $\gamma$-ray pulsar PSR J0007+7303, we have discovered an extended $\gamma$-ray source with a TS value of $\sim$ 44.94 in the region of CTA 1. The obtained flux is measured to be 6.71 $\pm$ 2.60 $\times$ $10^{-12}$ erg $\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ with a spectral index of 1.61 $\pm$ 0.36, which allows for a smooth connection with the flux in the TeV band. CTA 1 is also considered to be associated with 1LHAASO J0007+7303u, which is an Ultra-High-Energy source listed in the recently published catalog of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory. We assume that the radiation originates from the pulsar wind nebula and that its multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution can be explained well with a time-dependent one-zone model.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Jet Power from Broadband SED modeling of Mkn 501 for different particle distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the broadband spectral energy distribution of the high energy peaked (HBL) blazar Mkn 501 using $\textit{Swift}$-XRT/UVOT, NuSTAR and $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT observations taken between 2013 and 2022. The spectra were fitted with a one-zone leptonic model using synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission from different particle energy distributions such as a broken power-law, log-parabola, as well as distributions expected when the diffusion or the acceleration time scale are energy dependent. The jet power estimated for a broken power-law distribution was $ \sim 10^{47} (10^{44})$ erg s$^{-1}$ for a minimum electron energy $\gamma_\text{min} \sim 10 (10^3)$. However, for electron energy distributions with intrinsic curvature (such as the log-parabola form), the jet power is significantly lower at a few times $ 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ which is a few percent of the Eddington luminosity of a $10^7$ M$_\odot$ black hole, suggesting that the jet may be powered by accretion processes. We discuss the implications of these results.</description>

      <title>The energy-dependent gamma-ray light curves and spectra of the Vela pulsar in the dissipative magnetospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the pulsar energy-dependent $\gamma$-ray light curves and spectra from curvature radiation in the dissipative magnetospheres. The dissipative magnetospheres with the combined force-free (FFE) and Aristotelian (AE) are computed by a pseudo-spectral method with the high-resolution simulation in the rotating coordinate system, which produces a near force-free field structure with the dissipative region only near the equatorial current sheet outside the light cylinder (LC). We use the test particle trajectory method to compute the energy-dependent $\gamma$-ray light curves, phase-average and phase-resolved spectra by including both the accelerating electric field and radiation reaction. The predicted energy-dependent $\gamma$-ray light curves and spectra are then compared with those of the Vela pulsar observed by Fermi. Our results can generally reproduce the observed trends of the energy-dependent $\gamma$-ray light curves and spectra for the Vela pulsar.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the recent advances in the pulsar high-energy $\gamma$-ray observation and the electrodynamics of the pulsar magnetospheres from the early vacuum model to the recent plasma-filled models by the numerical simulations. The numerical simulations have made the significant progresses toward the self-consistent modeling of the plasma-filled magnetosphere by including the particle acceleration and radiation. The current numerical simulations confirm a near force-free magnetosphere with the particle acceleration in the separatrix near the light cylinder and the current sheet outside the light cylinder, which can provide a good match to the recent high-energy $\gamma$-ray observations. The modeling of the combined multi-wavelength light curves, spectra, and polarization are expected to provide a stronger constrain on the geometry of the magnetic field lines, the location of the particle acceleration and the emission region, and the emission mechanism in the pulsar magnetospheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the multiwavelength radiation properties of the light curves and energy spectra in the dissipative magnetospheres of pulsars. The dissipative magnetospheres are simulated by the pseudo-spectral method with the combined force-free and Aristotelian electrodynamics, which can produce self-consistent accelerating electric fields mainly distributed in the equatorial current sheet outside the light cylinder. The multiwavelength light curves and spectra are computed by using the multiple emission mechanisms of both the primary particles accelerated by the accelerating electric fields in the equatorial current sheet and the secondary pairs with an assumed distribution spectrum. We then compare the predicted multiwavelength light curves and spectra with the observed data from the Crab, Vela, and Geminga pulsars. Our modeling results can systematically well reproduce the observed trends of the multiwavelength light curves and the spectra for these three pulsars.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Photon Mass with Ultra-Wide Bandwidth Pulsar Timing Data and De-dispersed Pulses of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the concept of a massive photon has been an important area in astronomy and physics. If photons have mass, their propagation in non-vacuum space would be affected by both the non-zero mass $m_{\gamma}$ and the presence of a plasma medium. This would lead to a delay time proportional to $m_{\gamma}^2\nu^{-4}$, which deviates from the classical dispersion relation (proportional to $\nu^{-2}$). For the first time, we have derived the dispersion relation of a photon with a non-zero mass propagating in plasma. To reduce the impact of variations in the dispersion measure (DM), we employed the high-precision timing data to constrain the upper bound of the photon mass. Specifically, the DM/time of arrival (TOA) uncertainties derived from ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) observations conducted by the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) are used. The de-dispersed pulses from fast radio bursts (FRBs) with minimal scattering effects are also used to constrain the upper bound of photon mass. The stringent limit on the photon mass is determined by uncertainties of the TOA of pulsars, with an optimum value of $9.52\times 10^{-46} \, \rm kg \,\,(5.34 \times 10^{-10}\, \rm eV/c^2$). In the future, it is essential to investigate the photon mass, as pulsar timing data are collected by PTA and UWB receivers, or FRBs with wide-band spectra are detected by UWB receivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility to observe neutrinos emitted from a failed core collapse Supernova in the various experiments at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. We show that the veto regions of dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments can be used as a network of small detectors to measure Supernova neutrinos. In addition we show that this network can measure very precisely the moment of black hole formation, which can be then used in the nearby VIRGO detector and future Einstein Telescope to look for the gravitational wave counterpart to the neutrino signal.</description>

      <title>Injection spectra of different species of cosmic rays from AMS-02, ACE-CRIS and Voyager-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise measurements of energy spectra of different cosmic ray species were obtained in recent years, by particularly the AMS-02 experiment on the International Space Station. It has been shown that apparent differences exist in different groups of the primary cosmic rays. However, it is not straightforward to conclude that the source spectra of different particle groups are different since they will experience different propagation processes (e.g., energy losses and fragmentations) either. In this work, we study the injection spectra of different nuclear species using the measurements from Voyager-1 outside the solar system, and ACR-CRIS and AMS-02 on top of atmosphere, in a physical framework of cosmic ray transportation. Two types of injection spectra are assumed, the broken power-law and the non-parametric spline interpolation form. The non-parametric form fits the data better than the broken power-law form, implying that potential structures beyond the constrained spectral shape of broken power-law may exist. For different nuclei the injection spectra are overall similar in shape but do show some differences among each other. For the non-parametric spectral form, the helium injection spectrum is the softest at low energies and the hardest at high energies. For both spectral shapes, the low-energy injection spectrum of neon is the hardest among all these species, and the carbon and oxygen spectra have more prominent bumps in 1-10 GV in the R2dN/dR presentation. Such differences suggest the existence of differences in the sources or acceleration processes of various nuclei of cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Performance of SK-Gd's Upgraded Real-time Supernova Monitoring System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among multi-messenger observations of the next galactic core-collapse supernova, Super-Kamiokande (SK) plays a critical role in detecting the emitted supernova neutrinos, determining the direction to the supernova (SN), and notifying the astronomical community of these observations in advance of the optical signal. On 2022, SK has increased the gadolinium dissolved in its water target (SK-Gd) and has achieved a Gd concentration of 0.033%, resulting in enhanced neutron detection capability, which in turn enables more accurate determination of the supernova direction. Accordingly, SK-Gd's real-time supernova monitoring system (Abe te al. 2016b) has been upgraded. SK_SN Notice, a warning system that works together with this monitoring system, was released on December 13, 2021, and is available through GCN Notices (Barthelmy et al. 2000). When the monitoring system detects an SN-like burst of events, SK_SN Notice will automatically distribute an alarm with the reconstructed direction to the supernova candidate within a few minutes. In this paper, we present a systematic study of SK-Gd's response to a simulated galactic SN. Assuming a supernova situated at 10 kpc, neutrino fluxes from six supernova models are used to characterize SK-Gd's pointing accuracy using the same tools as the online monitoring system. The pointing accuracy is found to vary from 3-7$^\circ$ depending on the models. However, if the supernova is closer than 10 kpc, SK_SN Notice can issue an alarm with three-degree accuracy, which will benefit follow-up observations by optical telescopes with large fields of view.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Roche problem for stars in precessing orbits around a spinning black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruptions of stars on the equatorial plane orbiting Kerr black holes have been widely studied. However thus far, there have been fewer studies of stars in inclined precessing orbits around a Kerr black hole. In this paper, by using tensor virial equations, we show the presence of possible resonances in these systems for typical physical parameters of black hole-neutron star binaries in close orbits or of a white dwarf/an ordinary star orbiting a supermassive black hole. This suggests the presence of a new instability before the tidal disruption limit is encountered in such systems.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Column Density Variability in a Sample of Local Compton-Thin AGN II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the multi-epoch analysis of 13 variable, nearby (z&lt;0.1), Compton-thin (22&lt;logN_H&lt;24) active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected from the 105-month BAT catalog. Analyzing all available archival soft and hard X-ray observations, we investigate the line-of-sight hydrogen column density (N_H) variability on timescales ranging from a few days to approximately 20 years. Each source is analyzed by simultaneously modeling the data with three physical torus models, providing tight constraints on torus properties, including the covering factor, the cloud dispersion, and the torus average hydrogen column density (N_H,av). For each epoch, we measure the N_H and categorize the source as `N_H Variable', `Non-variable in N_H', or `Undetermined' based on the degree of variability. Our final sample includes 27 variable, Compton-thin AGN after implementing another 14 AGN analyzed in our previous work. We find that all sources require either flux or N_H variability. We classify 37% of them as `N_H Variable', 44% as `Non-variable in N_H', and 19% as `Undetermined'. Noticeably, there is no discernible difference between geometrical and intrinsic properties among the three variability classes, suggesting no intrinsic differences between the N_H-variable and non-variable sources. We measure the median variation in N_H between any observation pair of the same source to be 25% with respect to the lowest N_H measure in the pair. Furthermore, 48% of the analyzed sources require the inclusion of a Compton-thick reflector in the spectral fitting. Among these, the 30% exhibits recorded 22 GHz water megamaser emission, suggesting a potential shared nature between the two structures.</description>

      <title>Investigating model dependencies for obscured Active Galactic Nuclei: a case study of NGC 3982</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray spectroscopy of heavily obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) offers a unique opportunity to study the circum-nuclear environment of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, individual models describing the obscurer have unique parameter spaces that give distinct parameter posterior distributions when fit to the same data. To assess the impact of model-specific parameter dependencies, we present a case study of the nearby heavily obscured low-luminosity AGN NGC 3982, which has a variety of column density estimations reported in the literature. We fit the same broadband XMM-Newton + NuSTAR spectra of the source with five unique obscuration models and generate posterior parameter distributions for each. By using global parameter exploration, we traverse the full prior-defined parameter space to accurately reproduce complex posterior shapes and inter-parameter degeneracies. The unique model posteriors for the line-of-sight column density are broadly consistent, predicting Compton-thick $N_{\rm H}$ $&gt;1.5\times10^{24}\rm cm^{-2}$ at the 3$\sigma$ confidence level. The posterior median intrinsic X-ray luminosity in the 2-10 keV band however was found to differ substantially, with values in the range log $L_{ 2-10\,{\rm keV}}$ergs$^{-1}$ = 40.9-42.1 for the individual models. We additionally show that the posterior distributions for each model occupy unique regions of their respective multi-dimensional parameters spaces, and how such differences can propagate into the inferred properties of the central engine. We conclude by showcasing the improvement in parameter inference attainable with the High Energy X-ray Probe (HEX-P) with a uniquely broad simultaneous and high-sensitivity bandpass of 0.2-80 keV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic bubble walls from cosmological phase transitions (PT) necessarily accumulate expanding shells of particles. We systematically characterize shell properties, and identify and calculate the processes that prevent them from free streaming: phase-space saturation effects, out-of-equilibrium $2\to2$ and $3\to2$ shell-shell and shell-bath interactions, and shell interactions with bubble walls. We find that shells do not free stream in scenarios widely studied in the literature, where standard predictions will need to be reevaluated, including those of bubble wall velocities, gravitational waves (GW) and particle production. Our results support the use of bulk-flow GW predictions in all regions where shells free stream, irrespectively of whether or not the latent heat is mostly converted in the scalar field gradient.</description>

      <title>A VLBI Software Correlator for Fast Radio Transients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One major goal in fast radio burst science is to detect fast radio bursts (FRBs) over a wide field of view without sacrificing the angular resolution required to pinpoint them to their host galaxies. Wide-field detection and localization capabilities have already been demonstrated using connected-element interferometry; the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project will push this further using widefield cylindrical telescopes as widefield outriggers for very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). This paper describes an offline VLBI software correlator written in Python for the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project. It includes features well-suited to modern widefield instruments like multibeaming/multiple phase center correlation, pulse gating including coherent dedispersion, and a novel correlation algorithm based on the quadratic estimator formalism. This algorithm mitigates sensitivity loss which arises in instruments where the windowing and channelization is done outside the VLBI correlator at each station, which accounts for a 30 percent sensitivity drop away from the phase center. Our correlation algorithm recovers this sensitivity on both simulated and real data. As an end to end check of our software, we have written a preliminary pipeline for VLBI calibration and single-pulse localization, which we use in Lanman et al. (2024) to verify the astrometric accuracy of the CHIME/FRB Outriggers array.</description>

      <title>Stability of hypermassive neutron stars with realistic rotation and entropy profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers produce massive, hot, rapidly differentially rotating neutron star remnants; electromagnetic and gravitational wave signals associated with the subsequent evolution depend on the stability of these remnants. Stability of relativistic stars has previously been studied for uniform rotation and for a class of differential rotation with monotonic angular velocity profiles. Stability of those equilibria to axisymmetric perturbations was found to respect a turning point criterion: along a constant angular momentum sequence, the onset of unstable stars is found at maximum density less than but close to the density of maximum mass. In this paper, we test this turning point criterion for non-monotonic angular velocity profiles and non-isentropic entropy profiles, both chosen to more realistically model post-merger equilibria. Stability is assessed by evolving perturbed equilibria in 2D using the Spectral Einstein Code. We present tests of the code's new capability for axisymmetric metric evolution. We confirm the turning point theorem and determine the region of our rotation law parameter space that provides highest maximum mass for a given angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Search for radio halos in starburst galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starburst galaxies are undergoing intense episodes of star formation. In these galaxies, gas is ejected into the surrounding environment through winds created by the effect of hot stars and supernova explosions. When interacting with the intergalactic medium, these winds can produce strong shocks capable of accelerating cosmic rays. The radiation from these cosmic rays mainly occurs in radio and gamma rays. The radio halo can be characterized using the scale height. We searched for the presence of radio halos in a sample of edge-on starburst galaxies gathered from the MeerKAT 1.28 GHz Atlas of Southern Sources in the IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample. We selected a sample of 25 edge-on galaxies from the original sample and modeled their disk and halo contributions. We have detected and characterized 11 radio halos, seven of which are reported here for the first time. We found that the halo scale heights increase linearly with the radio diameters and this relation does not depend on the star formation rate. All galaxies in our sample follow the radio-infrared relation with a q parameter value of $2.5\pm0.1$. The dependence of the halo luminosity on the star formation rate and the infrared luminosity supports the hypothesis that the radio halos are the result of synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electrons and points toward the fact that the star formation activity plays a crucial role in halo creation. The average scale height of 1 kpc implies a dynamical range of 4 Myr, several orders of magnitude greater than the synchrotron losses for electrons of 10 TeV. This suggests that some process must exist to reaccelerate cosmic rays in the halo if gamma-ray emission of a leptonic origin is detected from the halo. According to the relation between the radio and gamma-ray luminosities, we found that NGC 4666 is a potential gamma-ray source for future observations.</description>

      <title>Dark Branes for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a setup for the origin of dark matter based on spacetime with a warped extra dimension and three branes: the Planck brane, the TeV brane, at a (few) TeV scale $\rho_T$, and a dark brane, at a (sub)-GeV scale $\rho_1\lesssim 100$ GeV $\ll\rho_T$. The Standard Model is localized in the TeV brane, thus solving the Higgs hierarchy problem, while the dark matter $\chi$, a Dirac fermion with mass $m_\chi&lt;\rho_1$, is localized in the dark brane. The radion, with mass $m_r&lt;m_\chi$, interacts strongly ($\sim m_\chi/\rho_1\sim\mathcal O(1)$) with dark matter and very weakly ($\sim m_{f}\rho_1/\rho_T^2\ll 1$) with the Standard Model matter $f$. The generic conflict between the bounds on its detection signatures and its proper relic abundance is avoided as dark matter annihilation is $p$-wave suppressed. The former is determined by its very weak interactions with the SM and the latter by its much stronger annihilation into radions. Therefore, there is a vast range in the Dark Matter's parameter space where the correct relic abundance is achieved consistently with the existing bounds. Moreover, for the dark brane with $\rho_1\lesssim 10$ GeV, a confinement/deconfinement first order phase transition, where the radion condensates, produces a stochastic gravitational waves background at the nanoHz frequencies, which can be identified with the signal detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments. In the PTA window, for $0.15 \textrm{ GeV}\lesssim m_\chi\lesssim 0.5$ GeV the relic abundance is reproduced and all constraints are satisfied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational Waves (GWs) provide a unique way to explore our Universe. The ongoing ground-based detectors, e.g., LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, and the upcoming next-generation detectors, e.g., Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, as well as the future space-borne GW antennas, e.g., LISA, TianQin, and TaiJi, cover a wide range of GW frequencies {from $\sim 10^{-4}\;\rm Hz$ to $\sim 10^3\;\rm Hz$} and almost all types of compact objects in close orbits serve as the potential target sources for these GW detectors. The synergistic multi-band GW and EM observations would allow us to study fundamental physics from stars to cosmology. {The formation of stellar GW sources has been extensively explored in recent years, and progress on physical processes in binary interaction has been made as well. Furthermore, some studies have shown that the progress in binary evolution may significantly affect the properties of the stellar GW sources.}</description>

      <title>Evidence of a Past Merger of the Galactic Center Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) residing in the centers of most galaxies remains a mystery. Various growth models, such as accretion and hierarchical mergers, have been proposed to explain the existence and cosmological evolution of these SMBHs, but no direct observational evidence is available to test these models. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) offered direct imaging of nearby SMBHs, in particular, the one at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy named Sgr~A*. Measurements suggest that the Sgr~A* BH spins rapidly with significant spin axis misalignment relative to the angular momentum of the Galactic plane. Through investigating various SMBH growth models, here we show that the spin properties of Sgr~A* provides strong evidence of a past SMBH merger. Inspired by the merger between the Milky Way and Gaia-Enceladus, which has a 4:1 mass ratio as inferred from Gaia data, we have discovered that a 4:1 major merger of SMBH with a binary angular momentum inclination angle of 15-45 degrees with respect to the line of sight (LOS), can successfully replicate the measured spin properties of Sgr A*. This merger event in our galaxy provides observational support for the theory of hierarchical BH mergers in the formation and growth of SMBHs. The inferred merger rate, consistent with theoretical predictions, suggests a promising detection rate of SMBH mergers for space-borne gravitational wave detectors expected to operate in 2030s.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Searches for Evolutionary Orbital Period Changes in WR+OB Binaries: the Case of WR 127 (Hen 3-1772)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim at searching for secular evolution of the orbital period in the short-period binary system WR 127 (WN3b+O9.5V, $P = 9.555^d$). We performed new low-resolution spectroscopic observations of WR 127 on 2.5-m CMO SAI telescope to construct the radial velocity curves of the components suggesting the component masses $M_\mathrm{WR}\sin^3(i) = 11.8\pm1.4$ $M_{\odot}$, $M_\mathrm{O}\sin^3(i)=17.2\pm1.4$ $M_{\odot}$. The comparison with archival radial velocity curves enabled us to calculate the $(O-C)$ plot with accuracy sufficient to search for the orbital period change in WR 127. We report on the reliable detection of a secular increase in the orbital period of WR 127 at a rate of $\dot{P} = 0.83\pm0.14~\mbox{s~yr}^{-1}$ corresponding to the dynamical mass-loss rate from the WR star $\dot{M}_\mathrm{WR} = (2.6\pm0.5)\times 10^{-5}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The mass-loss rate from WR stars in three WR+OB binaries (WR 127, CX Cep and V444 Cyg) as inferred from spectroscopic and photometric measurements suggests a preliminary empirical correlation between the WR star mass and the dynamical mass-loss rate $\dot M_\mathrm{WR}\sim M_\mathrm{WR}^{1.8}$. This relation is important for the understanding of the evolution of massive close binaries with WR stars -- precursors of gravitational-wave binary merging events with neutron stars and black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute departures in the black hole thermodynamics induced by either geometric or topological corrections to general relativity. Specifically, we analyze the spherically symmetric spacetime solutions of two modified gravity scenarios with Lagrangians $\mathcal{L}\sim R^{1+\epsilon}$ and $\mathcal{L}\sim R+\epsilon\, \mathcal{G}^2$, where $\mathcal{G}$ is the Euler density in four dimensions, while $ 0&lt;\epsilon\ll 1$ measures the perturbation around the Hilbert-Einstein action. Accordingly, we find the expressions of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by the Penrose formula, and the black hole temperature and horizon of the obtained solutions. We then investigate the heat capacities in terms of the free parameters of the theories under study. In doing so, we show that healing the problem of negative heat capacities can be possible under particular choices of the free constants, albeit with limitations on the masses allowed for the black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>QED Effects on Kerr-Newman Black Hole Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating first-order QED effects, we explore the shadows of Kerr-Newman black holes with a magnetic charge through the numerical backward ray-tracing method. Our investigation accounts for both the direct influence of the electromagnetic field on light rays and the distortion of the background spacetime metric due to QED corrections. We notice that the area of the shadow increases with the QED effect, mainly due to the fact that the photons move more slowly in the effective medium and become easier to be trapped by the black hole.</description>

      <title>Changing-Look AGNs -- I. Tracking the transition on the main sequence of quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.10056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a series of preparing and analyzing spectral and other properties for a database of already discovered Changing-Look active galactic nuclei (CL AGNs). Here, we focus on the spectral fitting and analysis of broad emission lines in a sample of 93 CL AGNs collected from the literature with existing SDSS/BOSS/eBOSS spectroscopy where the H$\beta$ emission line profile does not completely disappear in any epochs. Additionally, we have gathered older/newer spectral epochs from all the available SDSS data releases to make the database more complete. We use PyQSOFit and perform a homogeneous spectral decomposition of all of our SDSS spectra and tabulate the AGN continuum and emission line properties per epoch per source, chronologically. This further allows us to categorize the sources in our sample as \textit{Turn-On} or \textit{Turn-Off} and subsequently check for repeated occurrences of such phases. We then estimate the black hole mass (M$_{\rm BH}$) and the Eddington ratio (L$_{\rm bol}$/L$_{\rm Edd}$) per epoch per source where the required parameters are available and well-estimated. We realize the movement of the source in the M$_{\rm BH}$ versus L$_{\rm bol}$/L$_{\rm Edd}$ plane allowing us to check for systematic changes in the source's fundamental properties. We then track their transition along the optical plane of the Eigenvector 1 (EV1) schema and categorize sources that either stay within the same Population (A or B) or make an inter-population movement as a function of spectral epoch. We also test the Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta$) of a subset of our sample of CL AGNs as a function of time and AGN luminosity.</description>

      <title>Using Pulsar Parameter Drifts to Detect Sub-Nanohertz Gravitational Waves</title>

Abstract: Gravitational waves with frequencies below 1~nHz are notoriously difficult to detect. With periods exceeding current experimental lifetimes, they induce slow drifts in observables rather than periodic correlations. Observables with well-known intrinsic contributions provide a means to probe this regime. In this work, we demonstrate the viability of using observed pulsar timing parameters to discover such "ultralow" frequency gravitational waves, presenting two complementary observables for which the systematic shift induced by ultralow-frequency gravitational waves can be extracted. Using existing data for these parameters, we search the ultralow frequency regime for continuous-wave signals, finding a sensitivity near the expected prediction from inspirals of supermassive black holes. We do not see an excess in the data, setting a limit on the strain of $ 1.3 \times 10 ^{ - 12} $ at $ 450~{\rm pHz} $ with a sensitivity dropping approximately quadratically with frequency until $ 10~{\rm pHz}$. Our search method opens a new frequency range for gravitational wave detection and has profound implications for astrophysics, cosmology, and particle physics.</description>

      <title>Application of Deep Learning Methods for Distinguishing Gamma-Ray Bursts from Fermi/GBM TTE Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00370v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To investigate GRBs in depth, it is crucial to develop an effective method for identifying GRBs accurately. Current criteria, e.g., onboard blind search, ground blind search, and target search, are limited by manually set thresholds and perhaps miss GRBs, especially for sub-threshold events. We propose a novel approach that utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to distinguish GRBs and non-GRBs directly. We structured three CNN models, plain-CNN, ResNet, and ResNet-CBAM, and endeavored to exercise fusing strategy models. Count maps of NaI detectors onboard Fermi/GBM were employed as the input samples of datasets and models were implemented to evaluate their performance on different time scale data. The ResNet-CBAM model trained on 64 ms dataset achieves high accuracy overall, which includes residual and attention mechanism modules. The visualization methods of Grad-CAM and t-SNE explicitly displayed that the optimal model focuses on the key features of GRBs precisely. The model was applied to analyze one-year data, accurately identifying approximately 98% of GRBs listed in the Fermi burst catalog, 8 out of 9 sub-threshold GRBs, and 5 GRBs triggered by other satellites, which demonstrated the deep learning methods could effectively distinguish GRBs from observational data. Besides, thousands of unknown candidates were retrieved and compared with the bursts of SGR J1935+2154 for instance, which exemplified the potential scientific value of these candidates indeed. Detailed studies on integrating our model into real-time analysis pipelines thus may improve their accuracy of inspection, and provide valuable guidance for rapid follow-up observations of multi-band telescopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The duration of the gravitational waves (GW) induced orbital decay is often the bottleneck of the evolutionary phases going from star formation to a merger. We show here that kicks imparted to the newly born compact object during the second collapse generically result in a GW merger times distribution behaving like $dN/d\log t \propto t^{2/7}$ at short durations, leading to ultrafast mergers. Namely, a non-negligible fraction of neutron star binaries, formed in this way, will merge on a time scale as short as 10 Myr, and a small fraction will merge even on a time scale less than 10 kyr. The results can be applied to different types of compact binaries. We discuss here the implications for binary neutron star mergers. These include: unique short GRBs, eccentric and misaligned mergers, r-process enrichment in the very early Universe and in highly star-forming regions and possible radio precursors. Interestingly we conclude that among the few hundred short GRBs detected so far a few must have formed via this ultrafast channel.</description>

      <title>Pulsar-wind-nebula-powered Galactic center X-ray filament G0.13-0.11: Proof of the synchrotron nature by IXPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of X-ray polarization from the X-ray-bright filament. G0.13-0.11 in the Galactic center (GC) region. This filament features a bright, hard X-ray source that is most plausibly a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and an extended and structured diffuse component. Combining the polarization signal from IXPE with the imaging/spectroscopic data from Chandra, we find that X-ray emission of G0.13-0.11 is highly polarized PD=$57(\pm18)$% in the 3-6 keV band, while the polarization angle is PA=$21^\circ(\pm9^\circ)$. This high degree of polarization proves the synchrotron origin of the X-ray emission from G0.13-0.11. In turn, the measured polarization angle implies that the X-ray emission is polarized approximately perpendicular to a sequence of nonthermal radio filaments that may be part of the GC Radio Arc. The magnetic field on the order of $100\,{\rm\mu G}$ appears to be preferentially ordered along the filaments. The above field strength is the fiducial value that makes our model self-consistent, while the other conclusions are largely model independent.</description>

      <title>ASASSN-18ap: A Dusty Tidal Disruption Event Candidate with an Early Bump in the Light Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-examined the classification of the optical transient ASASSN-18ap, which was initially identified as a supernova (SNe) upon its discovery. Based on newly emerged phenomena, such as a delayed luminous infrared outburst and the emergence of luminous coronal emission lines, we suggest that ASASSN-18ap is more likely a tidal disruption event (TDE) in a dusty environment, rather than a supernova. The total energy in the infrared outburst is $\rm 3.1\times10^{51}$ erg, which is an order of magnitude higher than the total energy in the optical-to-ultraviolet range, indicating a large dust extinction, an extra-EUV component, or anisotropic continuum emission. A bumpy feature appeared in the optical light curve at the start of brightening, which was reported in a couple of TDEs very recently. This early bump may have been overlooked in the past due to the lack of sufficient sampling of the light curves of most TDEs during their ascending phase, and it could provide insight into the origin of optical emission.</description>

      <title>A magnetar giant flare in the nearby starburst galaxy M82</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Giant flares, short explosive events releasing up to 10$^{47}$ erg of energy in the gamma-ray band in less than one second, are the most spectacular manifestation of magnetars, young neutron stars powered by a very strong magnetic field, 10$^{14-15}$ G in the magnetosphere and possibly higher in the star interior. The rate of occurrence of these rare flares is poorly constrained, as only three have been seen from three different magnetars in the Milky Way and in the Large Magellanic Cloud in about 50 years since the beginning of gamma-ray astronomy. This sample can be enlarged by the discovery of extragalactic events, since for a fraction of a second giant flares reach peak luminosities above 10$^{46}$ erg/s, which makes them visible by current instruments up to a few tens of Mpc. However, at these distances they appear similar to, and difficult to distinguish from, regular short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The latter are much more energetic events, 10$^{50-53}$ erg, produced by compact binary mergers and originating at much larger distances. Indeed, only a few short GRBs have been proposed, with different levels of confidence, as magnetar giant flare candidates in nearby galaxies. Here we report the discovery of a short GRB positionally coincident with the central region of the starburst galaxy M82. Its spectral and timing properties, together with the limits on its X-ray and optical counterparts obtained a few hours after the event and the lack of an associated gravitational wave signal, qualify with high confidence this event as a giant flare from a magnetar in M82.</description>

      <title>X-ray diagnostics of Cassiopeia A's "Green Monster": evidence for dense shocked circumstellar plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent survey of the core-collapse supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (CasA) with the MIRI instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) revealed a large structure in the interior region, referred to as the "Green Monster". Although its location suggests that it is an ejecta structure, the infrared properties of the "Green Monster" hint at a circumstellar medium (CSM) origin. In this companion paper to the JWST Cas A paper, we investigate the filamentary X-ray structures associated with the "Green Monster" using Chandra X-ray Observatory data. We extracted spectra along the "Green Monster" as well as from shocked CSM regions. Both the extracted spectra and a principal component analysis show that the "Green Monster" emission properties are similar to those of the shocked CSM. The spectra are well-fit by a model consisting of a combination of a non- equilibrium-ionization model and a power-law component, modified by Galactic absorption. All the "Green Monster" spectra show a blueshift corresponding to a radial velocity of around -2300 km/s, suggesting that the structure is on the near side of Cas A. The ionization age is around $n_{e}t = 1.5 \times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}s. This translates into a pre-shock density of ~12 cm$^{-3}$, higher than previous estimates of the unshocked CSM. The relatively high net and relatively low radial velocity suggest that this structure has a relatively high density compared to other shocked CSM plasma. This analysis provides yet another piece of evidence that the CSM around Cas A's progenitor was not that of a smooth steady wind profile.</description>

      <title>Neural Simulation-Based Inference of the Neutron Star Equation of State directly from Telescope Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to study strongly interacting matter under extreme density conditions. The intricacies of matter inside neutron stars and their equation of state are not directly visible, but determine bulk properties, such as mass and radius, which affect the star's thermal X-ray emissions. However, the telescope spectra of these emissions are also affected by the stellar distance, hydrogen column, and effective surface temperature, which are not always well-constrained. Uncertainties on these nuisance parameters must be accounted for when making a robust estimation of the equation of state. In this study, we develop a novel methodology that, for the first time, can infer the full posterior distribution of both the equation of state and nuisance parameters directly from telescope observations. This method relies on the use of neural likelihood estimation, in which normalizing flows use samples of simulated telescope data to learn the likelihood of the neutron star spectra as a function of these parameters, coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to efficiently sample from the corresponding posterior distribution. Our approach surpasses the accuracy of previous methods, improves the interpretability of the results by providing access to the full posterior distribution, and naturally scales to a growing number of neutron star observations expected in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Contribution of Population III Stars to Merging Binary Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large number of mergers of binary black holes (BHs) have been discovered by gravitational wave observations since the first detection of gravitational waves 2015. Binary BH mergers are the loudest events in the universe, however their origin(s) have been under debate. There have been many suggestions for merging binary BHs. Isolated binary stars are one of the most promising origins. We have investigated the evolution of isolated binary stars ranging from zero metallicity (Population III stars or Pop III stars) to the solar metallicity by means of so-called rapid binary population synthesis simulation. We have found that binary BHs formed from isolated binary stars reproduce the redshift evolution of the merger rate density and the distribution of primary BH masses and mass ratios inferred by Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 3 (GWTC-3). Pop III stars have a crucial role in forming merging binary BHs in so-called the pair instability mass gap. Note that we choose the conventional prescription of pair instability mass loss, based on the standard $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate. Finally, we have shown the redshift evolution of the rate density of pair instability supernovae, and have predicted that a few pair instability supernovae would be discovered in the next few years. The discoveries would validate our results of merging binary BHs.</description>

      <title>Symmetry energy and neutron star properties constrained by chiral effective field theory calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nuclear symmetry energy and neutron star properties using a Bayesian analysis based on constraints from different chiral effective field theory calculations using new energy density functionals that allow for large variations at high densities. Constraints at high densities are included from observations of GW170817 and from NICER. In particular, we show that both NICER analyses lead to very similar posterior results for the symmetry energy and neutron star properties when folded into our equation-of-state framework. Using the posteriors, we provide results for the symmetry energy and the slope parameter, as well as for the proton fraction, the speed of sound, and the central density in neutron stars. Moreover, we explore correlations of neutron star radii with the pressure and the speed of sound in neutron stars. Our 95\% credibility ranges for the symmetry energy $S_v$, the slope parameter $L$, and the radius of a 1.4$\msun$ neutron star, $R_{1.4}$, are $S_v=(30.6\text{--}33.9)$\,MeV, $L=(43.7\text{--}70.0)$\,MeV, and $R_{1.4}=(11.6\text{--}13.2)$\,km. Our analysis for the proton fraction shows that larger and/or heavier neutron stars are more likely to cool rapidly via the direct Urca process. Within our equation-of-state framework a maximum mass of neutron stars $M_{\rm max}&gt;2.1\msun$ indicates that the speed of sound needs to exceed the conformal limit.</description>

      <title>Influences of tilted thin accretion disks on the observational appearance of hairy black holes in Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on the observational appearance of black holes, both in general relativity and modified gravity, has been in full swing since the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration announced photos of M87$^{*}$ and Sagittarius A$^{*}$. Nevertheless, limited attention has been given to the impact of tilted accretion disks on black hole images. This paper investigates the $230$ GHz images of non-rotating hairy black holes illuminated by tilted, thin accretion disks in Horndeski gravity with the aid of a ray tracing method. The results indicate that reducing the scalar hair parameter effectively diminishes image luminosity and extends both the critical curve and the inner shadow. This trend facilitates the differentiation between hairy black holes and Schwarzschild black holes, especially in certain parameter spaces where the current Event Horizon Telescope array is capable of capturing such variations. Furthermore, we observe that the inclination of the tilted accretion disk can mimic the observation angle, consequently affecting image brightness and the morphology of the inner shadow. In specific parameter spaces, alterations in the tilt or position of the accretion disk can lead to a drift in the light spot within the images of hairy black holes. This finding may establish a potential correlation between the precession of the tilted accretion disk and image features. Additionally, through an examination of images depicting hairy black holes surrounded by two thin accretion disks, we report the obscuring effect of the accretion environment on the inner shadow of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of solar microflares in accelerating electrons when rooted in a sunspot</title>

Abstract: We investigate two microflares of GOES classes A9 and C1 (after background subtraction) observed by STIX onboard Solar Orbiter with exceptionally strong nonthermal emission. We complement the hard X-ray imaging and spectral analysis by STIX with co-temporal observations in the (E)UV and visual range by AIA and HMI, in order to investigate what makes these microflares so sufficient in high-energy particle acceleration. We performed case studies of two microflares observed by STIX on October 11, 2021 and November 10, 2022 that showed unusually hard microflare X-ray spectra with power-law indices of the electron flux distributions delta = 2.98 and delta = 4.08 during their nonthermal peaks and photon energies up to 76 keV and 50 keV respectively. For both events under study, we found that one footpoint is located within a sunspot covering areas with mean magnetic flux densities in excess of 1500 G, suggesting that the hard electron spectra are caused by the strong magnetic fields in which the flare loops are rooted. In addition, we revisited the unusually hard RHESSI microflare initially published by Hannah et al. (2008b) and found that in this event also one flare kernel was located within a sunspot, which corroborates the result from the two hard STIX microflares under study. We conclude that the characteristics of the strong photospheric magnetic fields inside sunspot umbrae and penumbrae where the flare loops are rooted play an important role in the generation of exceptionally hard X-ray spectra in these microflares.</description>

      <title>Solar Energetic Particle Charge States and Abundances with Nonthermal Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important aspect of solar energetic particle (SEP) events is their source populations. Elemental abundance enhancements of impulsive SEP events, originating in presumed coronal reconnection episodes, can be fitted to steep power laws of A/Q, where A and Q are the atomic mass and ionic charge. Since thermal electron energies are enhanced and nonthermal electron distributions arise in the reconnection process, we might expect that ionic charge states Q would be increased through ionization interactions with those electron populations during the acceleration process. The temperature estimated from the SEPs corresponds to the charge state during the acceleration process, while the actual charge state measured in situ may be modified as the SEPs pass through the corona. We examine whether the temperature estimation from the A/Q would differ with various kappa values in a kappa function representing high-energy tail deviating from a Maxwellian velocity distribution. We find that the differences in the A/Q between a Maxwellian and an extreme kappa distribution are about 10-30%. We fit power-law enhancement of element abundances as a function of their A/Q with various kappa values. Then, we find that the derived source region temperature is not significantly affected by whether or not the electron velocity distribution deviates from a Maxwellian, i.e., thermal, distribution. Assuming that electrons are heated in the acceleration region, the agreement of the SEP charge state during acceleration with typical active region temperatures suggests that SEPs are accelerated and leave the acceleration region in a shorter time than the ionization time scale.</description>

      <title>VODKA-JWST: A 3.8 kpc dual quasar at cosmic noon in a powerful starburst galaxy with JWST/MIRI IFU</title>

Abstract: Dual quasars, two active supermassive black holes at galactic scales, represent crucial objects for studying the impact of galaxy mergers and quasar activity on the star formation rate (SFR) within their host galaxies, particularly at cosmic noon when SFR peaks. We present JWST/MIRI mid-infrared integral field spectroscopy of J074922.96+225511.7, a dual quasar with a projected separation of 3.8 kilo-parsec at a redshift $z$ of 2.17. We detect spatially extended [Fe II] 5.34$\rm \mu$m and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 3.3$\mu$m emissions from the star formation activity in its host galaxy. We derive the SFR of 10$^{3.0\pm0.2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ using PAH 3.3$\mu$m, which is five times higher than that derived from the cutoff luminosity of the infrared luminosity function for galaxies at $z\sim2$. While the SFR of J0749+2255 agrees with that of star-forming galaxies of comparable stellar mass at the same redshifts, its molecular gas content falls short of expectations based on the molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt law. This discrepancy may result from molecular gas depletion due to the longer elevated stage of star formation, even after the molecular gas reservoir is depleted. We do not observe any quasar-driven outflow that impacts PAH and [Fe II] in the host galaxy based on the spatially resolved maps. From the expected flux in PAH-based star formation, the [Fe II] line likely originates from the star-forming regions in the host galaxy. Our study highlights the stardust nature of J0749+2255, indicating a potential connection between the dual quasar phase and intense star formation activities.</description>
