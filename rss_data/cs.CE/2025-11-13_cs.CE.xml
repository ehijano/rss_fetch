      <title>Fourier Neural Operators for Structural Dynamics Models: Challenges, Limitations and Advantages of Using a Spectrogram Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as promising surrogates for partial differential equation solvers. In this work, we extensively tested FNOs on a variety of systems with non-linear and non-stationary properties, using a wide range of forcing functions to isolate failure mechanisms. FNOs stand out in modeling linear systems, regardless of complexity, while achieving near-perfect energy preservation and accurate spectral representation for linear dynamics. However, they fail on non-linear systems, where the failure manifests as artificial energy dissipation and manipulated frequency content. This limitation persists regardless of training dataset size, and we discuss the root cause through discretization error analysis. Comparison with LSTM as the baseline shows FNOs are superior for both linear and non-linear systems, independent of the training dataset size. We develop a spectrogram-based loss function that combines time-domain Mean Squared Error (MSE) with frequency-domain magnitude and phase errors, addressing the low-frequency bias of FNOs. This frequency-aware training eliminates artificial dissipation in linear systems and enhances the energy ratios of non-linear systems. The IEA 15MW turbine model validates our findings. Despite hundreds of degrees of freedom, FNO predictions remain accurate because the turbine behaves in a predominantly linear regime. Our findings establish that system non-linearity, rather than dimensionality or complexity, determines the success of FNO. These results provide clear guidelines for practitioners and challenge assumptions about FNOs' universality.</description>

      <title>Learning to Control PDEs with Differentiable Predictive Control and Time-Integrated Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an end-to-end learning to control framework for partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach integrates Time-Integrated Deep Operator Networks (TI-DeepONets) as differentiable PDE surrogate models within the Differentiable Predictive Control (DPC)-a self-supervised learning framework for constrained neural control policies. The TI-DeepONet architecture learns temporal derivatives and couples them with numerical integrators, thus preserving the temporal causality of infinite-dimensional PDEs while reducing error accumulation in long-horizon predictions. Within DPC, we leverage automatic differentiation to compute policy gradients by backpropagating the expectations of optimal control loss through the learned TI-DeepONet, enabling efficient offline optimization of neural policies without the need for online optimization or supervisory controllers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method learns feasible parametric policies across diverse PDE systems, including the heat, the nonlinear Burgers', and the reaction-diffusion equations. The learned policies achieve target tracking, constraint satisfaction, and curvature minimization objectives, while generalizing across distributions of initial conditions and problem parameters. These results highlight the promise of combining operator learning with DPC for scalable, model-based self-supervised learning in PDE-constrained optimal control.</description>

      <title>CENIC: Convex Error-controlled Numerical Integration for Contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art robotics simulators operate in discrete time. This requires users to choose a time step, which is both critical and challenging: large steps can produce non-physical artifacts, while small steps force the simulation to run slowly. Continuous-time error-controlled integration avoids such issues by automatically adjusting the time step to achieve a desired accuracy. But existing error-controlled integrators struggle with the stiff dynamics of contact, and cannot meet the speed and scalability requirements of modern robotics workflows. We introduce CENIC, a new continuous-time integrator that brings together recent advances in convex time-stepping and error-controlled integration, inheriting benefits from both continuous integration and discrete time-stepping. CENIC runs at fast real-time rates comparable to discrete-time robotics simulators like MuJoCo, Drake and Isaac Sim, while also providing guarantees on accuracy and convergence.</description>

      <title>A coupled finite element-virtual element method for thermomechanical analysis of electronic packaging structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a finite element and virtual element (FE-VE) coupled method for thermomechanical analysis in electronic packaging structures. The approach partitions computational domains strategically, employing FEM for regular geometries to maximize computational efficiency and VEM for complex shapes to enhance geometric flexibility. Interface compatibility is maintained through coincident nodal correspondence, ensuring solution continuity across domain boundaries while reducing meshing complexity and computational overhead. Validation through electronic packaging applications demonstrates reasonable agreement with reference solutions and acceptable convergence characteristics across varying mesh densities. The method effectively captures thermal distributions and stress concentrations in multi-material systems, establishing a practical computational framework for electronic packaging analysis involving complex geometries.

      <title>Ray-trax: Fast, Time-Dependent, and Differentiable Ray Tracing for On-the-fly Radiative Transfer in Turbulent Astrophysical Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative transfer is a key bottleneck in computational astrophysics: it is nonlocal, stiff, and tightly coupled to hydrodynamics. We introduce Ray-trax, a GPU-oriented, fully differentiable 3D ray tracer written in JAX that solves the time-dependent emission--absorption problem and runs directly on turbulent gas fields produced by hydrodynamic simulations. The method favors the widely used on-the-fly emission--absorption approximation, which is state of the art in many production hydro codes when scattering is isotropic. Ray-trax vectorizes across rays and sources, supports arbitrarily many frequency bins without architectural changes, and exposes end-to-end gradients, making it straightforward to couple with differentiable hydro solvers while preserving differentiability. We validate against analytical solutions, demonstrate propagation in turbulent media, and perform a simple inverse problem via gradient-based optimization. In practice, the memory footprint scales as $\mathcal{O}(N_{\text{src}}\,N_{\text{cells}})$ while remaining highly efficient on accelerators.</description>

      <title>TeVAE: A Variational Autoencoder Approach for Discrete Online Anomaly Detection in Variable-state Multivariate Time-series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As attention to recorded data grows in the realm of automotive testing and manual evaluation reaches its limits, there is a growing need for automatic online anomaly detection. This real-world data is complex in many ways and requires the modelling of testee behaviour. To address this, we propose a temporal variational autoencoder (TeVAE) that can detect anomalies with minimal false positives when trained on unlabelled data. Our approach also avoids the bypass phenomenon and introduces a new method to remap individual windows to a continuous time series. Furthermore, we propose metrics to evaluate the detection delay and root-cause capability of our approach and present results from experiments on a real-world industrial data set. When properly configured, TeVAE flags anomalies only 6% of the time wrongly and detects 65% of anomalies present. It also has the potential to perform well with a smaller training and validation subset but requires a more sophisticated threshold estimation method.</description>

      <title>Kodezi Chronos: A Debugging-First Language Model for Repository-Scale Code Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation and software automation but remain constrained by inference-time context and lack structured reasoning over code, leaving debugging largely unsolved. While Claude 4.5 Sonnet and Claude 4.1 Opus exceed 70% on code synthesis benchmarks, they achieve under 15% on real debugging tasks. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a language model purpose-built for debugging that integrates Adaptive Graph-Guided Retrieval to traverse codebases up to 10 million lines, Persistent Debug Memory trained on over 15 million sessions, and a seven-layer fix-test-refine architecture. On 5,000 real-world scenarios, Chronos achieves 67.3% fix accuracy compared to 14.2% and 13.8% for Claude 4.1 Opus and GPT-4.1, respectively. On SWE-bench Lite, Chronos reaches a state-of-the-art 80.33% resolution rate (241 of 300), outperforming the next best system by 20 points and achieving repository-specific highs of 96.1% on Sympy and 90.4% on Django. Chronos reduces debugging time by 40% and iterations by 65%, resolving complex multi-file and cross-repository bugs. It remains limited on hardware-dependent and dynamic language errors. Chronos will be available in Kodezi OS in Q4 2025 and via API in Q1 2026.</description>
