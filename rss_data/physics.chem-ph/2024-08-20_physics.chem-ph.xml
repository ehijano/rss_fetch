      <title>Isotope-Selective Strong Field Ionization of Semi-Heavy Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-heavy water (HOD) is one of the simplest molecules in which the bonds are labelled by isotope. We demonstrate that a pair of intense few-femtosecond infrared laser pulses can be used to selectively tunnel ionize along one of the two bonds. The first pulse doubly ionizes HOD, inducing rapid bond stretching and unbending. Femtoseconds later, the second pulse arrives and further ionization is selectively enhanced along the OH bond. These conclusions arise from 3D time-resolved measurements of H$^+$, D$^+$, and O$^+$ momenta following triple ionization.</description>

      <title>All-Electron Molecular Tunnel Ionization Based on the Weak-Field Asymptotic Theory in the Integral Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunnel ionization (TI) underlies many important ultrafast processes, such as high-harmonic generation and strong-field ionization. Among the existing theories for TI, many-electron weak-field asymptotic theory (ME-WFAT) is by design capable of accurately treating many-electron effects in TI. An earlier version of ME-WFAT relied on an accurate representation of the asymptotic tail of the orbitals, which hindered its implementation in Gaussian-basis-set-based quantum chemistry programs. In this work, we reformulate ME-WFAT in the integral representation, which makes the quality of the asymptotic tail much less critical, hence greatly facilitating its implementation in standard quantum chemistry packages. The integral reformulation introduced here is therefore much more robust when applied to molecules with arbitrary geometry. We present several case studies, among which is the CO molecule where some earlier theories disagree with experiments. Here, we find that ME-WFAT produces the largest ionization probability when the field points from C to O, as experiments suggest. An attractive feature of ME-WFAT is that it can be used with various types of multi-electron methods whether of density functional [Phys. Rev. A 106, 052211 (2022)] or multiconfiguration types, which facilitates tunnel ionization calculation in systems exhibiting a strong multireference character, such as transition-metal-containing molecules.</description>

      <title>Towards a correct description of initial electronic coherence in nonadiabatic dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent improvement in experimental capabilities for interrogating and controlling molecular systems with ultrafast coherent light sources calls for the development of theoretical approaches that can accurately and efficiently treat electronic coherence. However, the most popular and practical nonadiabatic molecular dynamics techniques, Tully's fewest-switches surface hopping and Ehrenfest mean-field dynamics, are unable to describe the dynamics proceeding from an initial electronic coherence. While such issues are not encountered with the analogous coupled-trajectory algorithms or numerically exact quantum dynamics methods, applying such methods necessarily comes with a higher computational cost. Here we show that a correct description of initial electronic coherence can indeed be achieved using methods that are based on an ensemble of independent trajectories. The key is the introduction of an initial sampling over the electronic phase space and the use of the correct observable measures, both of which are naturally achieved when working within the semiclassical mapping framework.</description>

      <title>Does basis set superposition error significantly affect post-CCSD(T) corrections?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the title question for both a subset of the W4-11 total atomization energies benchmark, and for the A24x8 noncovalent interactions benchmark. Overall, counterpoise corrections to post-CCSD(T) contributions are about two orders of magnitude less important than those to the CCSD(T) interaction energy. Counterpoise corrections for connected quadruple substitutions (Q) are negligible, and $(Q)_\Lambda - (Q)$ or $T_4 - (Q)$ especially so. In contrast, for atomization energies, the $T_3-(T)$ CP correction can reach about 0.05 \kcalmol~for small basis sets like cc-pVDZ, thought it rapidly tapers off with cc-pVTZ and especially aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. It is reduced to insignificance by the extrapolation of $T_3-(T)$ applied in both W4 and HEAT thermochemistry protocols.</description>

      <title>Orbital Energies Are Chemical Potentials in Ground-State Density Functional Theory and Excited-State $\Delta$SCF Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the general chemical potential theorem: the noninteracting one-electron orbital energies in DFT ground states and $\Delta$SCF excited states are corresponding chemical potentials of electron addition or removal, from an $N$-particle ground or excited state to an $(N\pm1)$-particle ground or excited state. This greatly extends the previous ground state results. Combining with the recently developed exact linear conditions for fractional charges in excited states, where the slopes of the linear lines are defined as the excited-state chemical potentials, our result establish the physical meaning of orbital energies as approximation to the corresponding excited-state ionization potentials and electron affinities, for both ground and excited states of a molecule or a bulk system. To examine the quality of this approximation we demonstrate numerically significant delocalization error in commonly used functionals and excellent agreement in functionals correcting the delocalization error.</description>

      <title>Exact Statistics of Helical Wormlike Chains with Twist-Bend Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a solution for the Green's function for the general case of a helical wormlike chain with twist-bend coupling, and demonstrate the applicability of our solution for evaluating general structural and mechanical chain properties. We find that twist-bend coupling renormalizes the persistence length and the force-extension curves relative to worm-like chains. Analysis of intrinsically twisted polymers shows that incorporation of twist-bend coupling results in the oscillatory behavior in principal tangent correlations that are observed in some studies of synthetic polymers. The exact nature of our solution provides a framework to evaluate the role of twist-bend coupling on polymer properties and motivates the reinterpretation of existing bio-polymer experimental data.</description>

      <title>Mono-exponential Current Attenuation with Distance across 16 nm Thick Bacteriorhodopsin Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable ability of natural proteins to conduct electricity in the dry state over long distances remains largely inexplicable despite intensive research. In some cases, a (weakly) exponential length-attenuation, as in off-resonant tunneling transport, extends to thicknesses even beyond 10 nm. This report deals with such charge transport characteristics observed in self-assembled multilayers of the protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR). About 7.5 nm to 15.5 nm thick bR layers were prepared on conductive titanium nitride (TiN) substrates using aminohexylphosphonic acid and poly-diallyl-dimethylammonium electrostatic linkers. Using conical EGaIn top contacts, an intriguing, mono-exponential conductance attenuation as a function of the bR layer thickness with a small attenuation coefficient $\beta \approx 0.8 \space {\rm nm}^{-1}$ is measured at zero bias. Variable-temperature measurements using evaporated Ti/Au top contacts yield effective energy barriers of about 100 meV from fitting the data to tunneling, hopping, and carrier cascade transport models. The observed temperature-dependence is assigned to the protein-electrode interfaces. The transport length and temperature dependence of the current densities are consistent with tunneling through the protein-protein and protein-electrode interfaces, respectively. Importantly, our results call for new theoretical approaches to find the microscopic mechanism behind the remarkably efficient, long-range electron transport within bR.</description>

      <title>Understanding and mitigating noise in molecular quantum linear response for spectroscopic properties on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The promise of quantum computing to circumvent the exponential scaling of quantum chemistry has sparked a race to develop chemistry algorithms for quantum architecture. However, most works neglect the quantum-inherent shot noise, let alone the effect of current noisy devices. Here, we present a comprehensive study of quantum linear response (qLR) theory obtaining spectroscopic properties on simulated fault-tolerant quantum computers and present-day near-term quantum hardware. This work introduces novel metrics to analyze and predict the origins of noise in the quantum algorithm, proposes an Ansatz-based error mitigation technique, and highlights the significant impact of Pauli saving in reducing measurement costs and noise. Our hardware results using up to cc-pVTZ basis set serve as proof-of-principle for obtaining absorption spectra on quantum hardware in a general approach with the accuracy of classical multi-configurational methods. Importantly, our results exemplify that substantial improvements in hardware error rates and measurement speed are necessary to lift quantum computational chemistry from proof-of-concept to an actual impact in the field.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Molecular Property Prediction: A Survey of Single and Multimodal Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular Property Prediction (MPP) plays a pivotal role across diverse domains, spanning drug discovery, material science, and environmental chemistry. Fueled by the exponential growth of chemical data and the evolution of artificial intelligence, recent years have witnessed remarkable strides in MPP. However, the multifaceted nature of molecular data, such as molecular structures, SMILES notation, and molecular images, continues to pose a fundamental challenge in its effective representation. To address this, representation learning techniques are instrumental as they acquire informative and interpretable representations of molecular data. This article explores recent AI/-based approaches in MPP, focusing on both single and multiple modality representation techniques. It provides an overview of various molecule representations and encoding schemes, categorizes MPP methods by their use of modalities, and outlines datasets and tools available for feature generation. The article also analyzes the performance of recent methods and suggests future research directions to advance the field of MPP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unitary transformations play a fundamental role in many-body physics, and except for special cases, they are not expressible in closed form. We present closed-form expressions for unitary transformations generated by a single fermionic operator for Hermitian and anti-Hermitian generators. We demonstrate the usefulness of these expressions in formal analyses of unitary transformations and numerical applications involving block-diagonalization and Heisenberg dynamics. This work paves the way for new analytical treatments of unitary transformations and numerical many-body methods for fermions.</description>

      <title>Instruction-Based Molecular Graph Generation with Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in computational chemistry have increasingly focused on synthesizing molecules based on textual instructions. Integrating graph generation with these instructions is complex, leading most current methods to use molecular sequences with pre-trained large language models. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel framework, named $\textbf{UTGDiff (Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model)}$, which utilizes language models for discrete graph diffusion to generate molecular graphs from instructions. UTGDiff features a unified text-graph transformer as the denoising network, derived from pre-trained language models and minimally modified to process graph data through attention bias. Our experimental results demonstrate that UTGDiff consistently outperforms sequence-based baselines in tasks involving instruction-based molecule generation and editing, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters given an equivalent level of pretraining corpus. Our code is availble at https://github.com/ran1812/UTGDiff.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The participation of oxygen or other anionic species in redox activities in cathode materials for lithium and sodium-ion battery systems is known to play a role in governing the useful capacity of these batteries. Directly probing anionic redox mechanisms is not possible, rather the computational analysis by density functional theory poses the main approach towards gleaning insights into anionic redox activity and harnessing these effects to maximize capacity in future electrode materials. Here we showcase material systems exhibiting this mechanism of ion insertion and removal, and present the key computational considerations in studying anionic redox activities in battery materials. Aided by new computationally derived understandings of the role of anionic redox in emerging battery materials, increasingly greater levels of useable capacities can be extracted through informed materials design.</description>

      <title>Molecular Graph Representation Learning Integrating Large Language Models with Domain-specific Small Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial foundation for drug discovery. In recent years, pre-trained deep learning models have been widely applied to this task. Some approaches that incorporate prior biological domain knowledge into the pre-training framework have achieved impressive results. However, these methods heavily rely on biochemical experts, and retrieving and summarizing vast amounts of domain knowledge literature is both time-consuming and expensive. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in understanding and efficiently providing general knowledge. Nevertheless, they occasionally exhibit hallucinations and lack precision in generating domain-specific knowledge. Conversely, Domain-specific Small Models (DSMs) possess rich domain knowledge and can accurately calculate molecular domain-related metrics. However, due to their limited model size and singular functionality, they lack the breadth of knowledge necessary for comprehensive representation learning. To leverage the advantages of both approaches in molecular property prediction, we propose a novel Molecular Graph representation learning framework that integrates Large language models and Domain-specific small models (MolGraph-LarDo). Technically, we design a two-stage prompt strategy where DSMs are introduced to calibrate the knowledge provided by LLMs, enhancing the accuracy of domain-specific information and thus enabling LLMs to generate more precise textual descriptions for molecular samples. Subsequently, we employ a multi-modal alignment method to coordinate various modalities, including molecular graphs and their corresponding descriptive texts, to guide the pre-training of molecular representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the elEmBERT model for chemical classification tasks. It is based on deep learning techniques, such as a multilayer encoder architecture. We demonstrate the opportunities offered by our approach on sets of organic, inorganic and crystalline compounds. In particular, we developed and tested the model using the Matbench and Moleculenet benchmarks, which include crystal properties and drug design-related benchmarks. We also conduct an analysis of vector representations of chemical compounds, shedding light on the underlying patterns in structural data. Our model exhibits exceptional predictive capabilities and proves universally applicable to molecular and material datasets. For instance, on the Tox21 dataset, we achieved an average precision of 96%, surpassing the previously best result by 10%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conductivity of concentrated salt solutions has posed a real puzzle for theories of electrolytes. Despite a quantitative understanding of highly dilute solutions, an analytical theory for concentrated ones remains a challenge almost a century, although a number of parameters and effects incorporated into theories increases with time. Here we show that the conductivity of univalent salt solutions can be perfectly interpreted using an extremely simple model that relies just on a mean-field description of electrostatic effects and on an adapted for salt ions classical approach to calculating colloid electrophoresis. We derive a compact equation, which predicts that the ratio of conductivity at a finite concentration to that at an infinite dilution is the same for all salt, if it is plotted against a product of the harmonic mean of ion hydrodynamic radii and the square root of concentration. Our equation fits very well the experimental data for inorganic salts up to 3 mol/l.</description>

      <title>Binding Selectivity Analysis from Alchemical Receptor Hopping and Swapping Free Energy Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present receptor hopping and receptor swapping free energy estimation protocols based on the Alchemical Transfer Method (ATM) to model the binding selectivity of a set of ligands to two arbitrary receptors. The receptor hopping protocol, where a ligand is alchemically transferred from one receptor to another in one simulation, directly yields the ligand's binding selectivity free energy for the two receptors, which is the difference between the two individual binding free energies. In the receptor swapping protocol, the first ligand of a pair is transferred from one receptor to another while the second ligand is simultaneously transferred in the opposite direction. The receptor swapping free energy yields the differences in binding selectivity free energies of a set of ligands, which, when combined using a generalized DiffNet algorithm, yield the binding selectivity free energies of the ligands. We test these algorithms on host-guest systems and show that they yield results that agree with experimental data and are consistent with differences in absolute and relative binding free energies obtained by conventional methods. Preliminary applications to the selectivity analysis of molecular fragments binding to the trypsin and thrombin serine protease confirm the potential of the receptor swapping technology in structure-based drug discovery. The novel methodologies presented in this work are a first step toward streamlined and computationally efficient protocols for ligand selectivity optimization across protein receptors with potentially low sequence identity.</description>

      <title>More than just smoke and mirrors: Gas-phase polaritons for optical control of chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gas-phase molecules are a promising platform through which to elucidate the mechanisms of action and scope of polaritons for optical control of chemistry. Polaritons arise from the strong coupling of a dipole-allowed molecular transition with the photonic mode of an optical cavity. There is mounting evidence of modified reactivity under polaritonic conditions; however, the complex condensed-phase environment of most experimental demonstrations impedes mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon. While the gas phase was the playground of early efforts in atomic cavity quantum electrodynamics, we have only recently demonstrated the formation of molecular polaritons under these conditions. Studying the reactivity of isolated gas-phase molecules under strong coupling would eliminate solvent interactions and enable quantum state resolution of reaction progress. In this Perspective, we contextualize recent gas-phase efforts in the field of polariton chemistry and offer a practical guide for experiment design moving forward.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for an Efficient Normalizing Flow-Based Solution to the Electronic Schrodinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central problem in quantum mechanics involves solving the Electronic Schrodinger Equation for a molecule or material. The Variational Monte Carlo approach to this problem approximates a particular variational objective via sampling, and then optimizes this approximated objective over a chosen parameterized family of wavefunctions, known as the ansatz. Recently neural networks have been used as the ansatz, with accompanying success. However, sampling from such wavefunctions has required the use of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, which is inherently inefficient. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem via an ansatz which is cheap to sample from, yet satisfies the requisite quantum mechanical properties. We prove that a normalizing flow using the following two essential ingredients satisfies our requirements: (a) a base distribution which is constructed from Determinantal Point Processes; (b) flow layers which are equivariant to a particular subgroup of the permutation group. We then show how to construct both continuous and discrete normalizing flows which satisfy the requisite equivariance. We further demonstrate the manner in which the non-smooth nature ("cusps") of the wavefunction may be captured, and how the framework may be generalized to provide induction across multiple molecules. The resulting theoretical framework entails an efficient approach to solving the Electronic Schrodinger Equation.</description>

      <title>Observation of sequential three-body dissociation of camphor molecule -- a native frame approach</title>

Abstract: The three-body dissociation dynamics of the dicationic camphor molecule (C$_{10}$H$_{16}$O$^{2+}$) resulting from Auger decay are investigated using soft X-ray synchrotron radiation. A photoelectron-photoion-photoion coincidence (PEPIPICO) method, a combination of a velocity map imaging (VMI) spectrometer and a time-of-flight (ToF) spectrometer is employed to measure the 3D momenta of ions detected in coincidence. The ion mass spectra and the ion-ion coincidence map at photon energies of 287.9 eV (below the C 1s ionization potential) and 292.4 eV (above the C 1s ionization potential for skeletal carbon) reveal that fragmentation depends on the final dicationic state rather than the initial excitation. Using the native frame method, three new fragmentation channels are discussed; (1) CH$_2$CO$^+$ + C$_7$H$_{11}^+$ + CH$_3$, (2) CH$_3^+$ + C$_7$H$_{11}^+$ + CH$_2$CO, and (3) C$_2$H$_5^+$ + C$_6$H$_9^+$ + CH$_2$CO. The dominating nature of sequential decay with deferred charge separation is clearly evidenced in all three channels. The results are discussed based on the experimental angular distributions and momenta distributions, corroborated by geometry optimization of the ground, monocationic, and dicationic camphor molecule.</description>

      <title>A General and Transferable Local Hybrid Functional from First Principles</title>

Abstract: Density functional theory has become the workhorse of quantum physics, chemistry, and materials science. Within these fields, a broad range of applications needs to be covered. These applications range from solids to molecular systems, from organic to inorganic chemistry, or even from electrons to other fermions such as protons or muons. This is emphasized by the plethora of density functional approximations that have been developed for various cases. In this work, a new local hybrid exchange-correlation density functional is constructed from first principles, promoting generality and transferability. We show that constraint satisfaction can be achieved even for admixtures with full exact exchange, without sacrificing accuracy. The performance of the new functional for electronic structure theory is assessed for thermochemical properties, excitation energies, M\"ossbauer isomer shifts, NMR spin-spin coupling constants, NMR shieldings and shifts, magnetizabilities, EPR hyperfine coupling constants, and EPR g-tensors. The new density functional shows a robust performance throughout all tests and is numerically robust only requiring small grids for converged results. Additionally, the functional can be easily generalized to arbitrary fermions as shown for electron-proton correlation energies. Therefore, we outline that density functionals generated in this way are general purpose tools for quantum mechanical studies.</description>

      <title>Fractional Charges, Linear Conditions and Chemical Potentials for Excited States in $\Delta SCF$ Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To describe excited states, the electron density alone being insufficient, we use the noninteracting reference density matrix $\gamma_{s}({\bf x},{\bf x}')$ based on the recently established foundation for the $\Delta SCF$ theory, in which ground and excited state energies and densities are obtained from the minimum and stationary solutions of the same functional. We now extend the theory to fractional charges. Based on the exact properties of degeneracy and size consistency, we show that the exact energy functional for fractional charges, expressed as a linear combination of the $\gamma_{s}$ of an $N-$electron and that of an $\left(N+1\right)-$electron excited state, is a straight line interpolating the energies at integers. We introduce the concepts of excited-state chemical potentials to describe the slopes of these linear lines. Numerical calculations reveal the excited-state delocalization error with common approximate functionals but good performance of corrected functionals on the proven linear conditions.</description>

      <title>Lead Free Perovskites</title>

Abstract: One of the most viable renewable energies is solar power because of its versatility, reliability, and abundance. In the market, a majority of the solar panels are made from silicon wafers. These solar panels have an efficiency of 26.4 percent and can last more than 25 years. The perovskite solar cell is a relatively new type of solar technology that has a similar maximum efficiency and much cheaper costs, the only downside is that it is less stable and the most efficient type uses lead. The name perovskite refers to the crystal structure with an ABX3 formula of the perovskite layer of the cell. All materials possess a property called a band gap. The smaller the band gap the more conductive the material, but this does not necessarily mean that the smaller the band gap the better the solar cell. The Shockley-Queisser limit provides the optimal band gap in terms of efficiency for a single junction solar cell which is 1.34 eV for single junction cells. This research focuses on tuning the band gap of lead-free perovskites through B-site cation replacement. Through this investigation, the optical band gaps of tin and lead perovskites were re-established. However, the copper-based perovskite disagrees with existing DFT calculations. Additionally, the mixed tin and copper perovskite in this experiment contradicts the intuitive prediction.</description>

      <title>LipidBERT: A Lipid Language Model Pre-trained on METiS de novo Lipid Library</title>

Abstract: In this study, we generate and maintain a database of 10 million virtual lipids through METiS's in-house de novo lipid generation algorithms and lipid virtual screening techniques. These virtual lipids serve as a corpus for pre-training, lipid representation learning, and downstream task knowledge transfer, culminating in state-of-the-art LNP property prediction performance. We propose LipidBERT, a BERT-like model pre-trained with the Masked Language Model (MLM) and various secondary tasks. Additionally, we compare the performance of embeddings generated by LipidBERT and PhatGPT, our GPT-like lipid generation model, on downstream tasks. The proposed bilingual LipidBERT model operates in two languages: the language of ionizable lipid pre-training, using in-house dry-lab lipid structures, and the language of LNP fine-tuning, utilizing in-house LNP wet-lab data. This dual capability positions LipidBERT as a key AI-based filter for future screening tasks, including new versions of METiS de novo lipid libraries and, more importantly, candidates for in vivo testing for orgran-targeting LNPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of the capability of a pre-trained language model on virtual lipids and its effectiveness in downstream tasks using web-lab data. This work showcases the clever utilization of METiS's in-house de novo lipid library as well as the power of dry-wet lab integration.</description>
