      <title>Almost everywhere convergence of a wavelet-type Malmquist-Takenaka series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Malmquist-Takenaka (MT) system is a complete orthonormal system in $H^2(\mathbf{T})$ generated by an arbitrary sequence of points $a_n$ in the unit disk with $\sum_n (1-|a_n|) = \infty$. The point $a_n$ is responsible for multiplying the $n$th and subsequent terms of the system by a M\"obius transform taking $a_n$ to $0$. One can recover the classical trigonometric system, its perturbations or conformal transformations, as particular examples of the MT system. However, many interesting choices of the sequence $a_n$, the MT system is less understood. In this paper, we consider a wavelet-type MT system and prove its almost everywhere convergence in $H^2(\mathbf{T})$.</description>

      <title>A Hilbert-Schmidt integral operator and the Weil distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a positive operator is given. It is shown that the product of this positive operator and the convolution operator is a trace class Hilbert-Schmidt integral operator and has nonnegative eigenvalues. A formula is given for the trace of this product operator. It seems that this product operator is the closest trace class integral operator which has nonnegative eigenvalues and is related to the Weil distribution. A relation is given between the trace of the product operator and the Weil distribution.</description>

      <title>On the dimension of k-medial axis for arbitrary closed set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the k-medial axis of an arbitrary closed set in Rn is n-k+1-rectifiable (and hence of dimension at most n-k+1). This result gives a first stratification for medial axis of any closed set, which has been widely studied and used in pure and applied mathematics. This also answers a question proposed by Erdos[4], and leads to more further interesting investigations (see the end of the article).</description>

      <title>Sliding stability and uniqueness for the set YXY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is dedicated to discuss the sliding stability and the uniqueness property for the 2-dimensional minimal cone YXY in R4. This problem is motivated by the classification of singularities for Almgren minimal sets, a model for Plateau's problem in the setting of sets. Minimal cones are blow up limits of Almgren minimal sets, thus the list of all minimal cones gives all possible types of singularities that can occur for minimal sets.
  As proved in [16], when several 2-dimensional Almgren (resp. topological) minimal cones are Almgren (resp. topological) sliding stable, and Almgren (resp. topological) unique, the almost orthogonal union of them stays minimal. Hence if several minimal cones admit sliding stability and uniqueness properties, then we can use their almost orthogonal unions to generate new families of minimal cones. One then naturally ask which minimal cones admit these two properties.
  Among all the known 2-dimensional minimal cones, YXY is the only one whose stability and uniqueness properties were left unsolved.
  We give affirmative answers to this problem for the stability and uniqueness properties for YXY in this paper: we prove that the set YXY is both Almgren sliding stable, and Almgren unique; for the topological case, we prove its topological sliding stability and topological uniqueness for the coefficient group Z2. This result, along with the results in [16, 18, 17], allows us to use all the known 2-dimensional minimal cones to generate new 2-dimensional minimal cones by taking almost orthogonal unions.</description>

      <title>On the Almgren minimality of the product of a paired calibrated set with a calibrated set of codimension 1 with singularities, and new Almgren minimal cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the product of a paired calibrated set and a set of codimension 1 calibrated by a coflat calibration with small singularity set is Almgren minimal. This is motivated by the attempt to classify all possible singularities for Almgren minimal sets--Plateau's problem in the setting of sets. In particular, a direct application of the above result leads to various types of new singularities for Almgren minimal sets, e.g. the product of any paired calibrated cone (such as the cone over the $d-2$ skeleton of the unit cube in $\R^d, d\ge 4$) with homogeneous area minimizing hypercones (such as the Simons cone).</description>

Abstract: We give the integral representation of box-$(n_1,\ldots, n_d)$-convex fun\-ctions, which are a generalization of Popoviciu's $n$-convex and box-$(m,n)$-convex functions. Based on this integral representation, we obtain the Ra\c{s}a, Jensen and Hermite-Hadamard inequalities for these functions. We extend the results obtained by S. G. Gal, C. P. Niculescu, B. Gavrea, I. Gavrea, A. Komisarski, T. Rajba and T. Popoviciu.</description>

Abstract: We study real univariate polynomials with non-zero coefficients and with all roots real, out of which exactly two positive. The sequence of coefficients of such a polynomial begins with $m$ positive coefficients followed by $n$ negative followed by $q$ positive coefficients. We consider the sequence of moduli of their roots on the positive real half-axis; all moduli are supposed distinct. We mark in this sequence the positions of the moduli of the two positive roots. For $m=n=2$, $n=q=2$ and $m=q=2$, we give the exhaustive answer to the question which the positions of the two moduli of positive roots can be.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into classical multiple orthogonal polynomials with an arbitrary number of weights, including Jacobi-Pi\~neiro, Laguerre of both first and second kinds, as well as multiple orthogonal Hermite polynomials. Novel explicit expressions for nearest-neighbor recurrence coefficients, as well as the step line case, are provided for all these polynomial families. Furthermore, new explicit expressions for type I multiple orthogonal polynomials are derived for Laguerre of the second kind and also for multiple Hermite polynomials.</description>

      <title>Banded totally positive matrices and normality for mixed multiple orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper serves as an introduction to banded totally positive matrices, exploring various characterizations and associated properties. A significant result within is the demonstration that the collection of such matrices forms a semigroup, notably including a subset permitting positive bidiagonal factorization. Moreover, the paper applies this concept to investigate step line normality concerning the degrees of associated recursion polynomials. It presents a spectral Favard theorem, ensuring the existence of measures, thereby guaranteeing that these recursion polynomials represent mixed multiple orthogonal polynomials that maintain normality on the step line indices.</description>

      <title>A characterization of compactness via bilinear $T1$ theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a bilinear $T1$ theorem to characterize the weighted compactness of bilinear Calder\'{o}n--Zygmund operators. Let $T$ be a bilinear operator associated with a standard bilinear Calder\'{o}n--Zygmund kernel. We demonstrate that $T$ can be extended to a compact bilinear operator from $L^{p_1}(w_1^{p_1}) \times L^{p_2}(w_2^{p_2})$ to $L^p(w^p)$ for all exponents $\frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{p_1} + \frac{1}{p_2}$ with $1&lt;p_1, p_2&lt; \infty$ and for all weights $(w_1, w_2) \in A_{(p_1, p_2)}$ if and only if the following conditions hold: (i) $T$ is associated with a compact bilinear Calder\'{o}n--Zygmund kernel, (ii) $T$ satisfies the weak compactness property, and (iii) $T(1,1), T^{*1}(1,1), T^{*2}(1,1) \in \mathrm{CMO}(\mathbb{R}^n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new class of vector fields enabling the integration of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is introduced. These vector fields are not, in general, Lie point symmetries. The results are based on a relation between 2-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and the integrability of first-order ODEs, which was established in a previous work of the authors. An integration procedure is provided, together with several examples to illustrate it. A connection between integrating factors of first-order ODEs and Schr\"odinger-type equations is highlighted.</description>

Abstract: Given a linear ordinary differential operator T with polynomial coefficients, we study the class of closed subsets of the complex plane such that T sends any polynomial (resp. any polynomial of degree exceeding a given positive integer) with all roots in a given subset to a polynomial with all roots in the same subset or to 0. Below we discuss some general properties of such invariant subsets as well as the problem of existence of the minimal under inclusion invariant subset.</description>

      <title>Curvature and sharp growth rates of log-quasimodes on compact manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain new optimal estimates for the $L^2(M)\to L^q(M)$, $q\in (2,q_c]$, $q_c=2(n+1)/(n-1)$, operator norms of spectral projection operators associated with spectral windows $[\lambda,\lambda+\delta(\lambda)]$, with $\delta(\lambda)=O((\log\lambda)^{-1})$ on compact Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ of dimension $n\ge2$ all of whose sectional curvatures are nonpositive or negative. We show that these two different types of estimates are saturated on flat manifolds or manifolds all of whose sectional curvatures are negative. This allows us to classify compact space forms in terms of the size of $L^q$-norms of quasimodes for each Lebesgue exponent $q\in (2,q_c]$, even though it is impossible to distinguish between ones of negative or zero curvature sectional curvature for any $q&gt;q_c$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the upper bounds for the $L^2$-norms of $L^1$-normalized quasimodes that we obtained in [9] are always sharp on any compact space form. This allows us to characterize compact manifolds of constant sectional curvature using the decay rates of lower bounds of $L^1$-norms of $L^2$-normalized log-quasimodes fully resolving a problem initiated by the second author and Zelditch [15]. We are also able to characterize such manifolds by the concentration of quasimodes near periodic geodesics as measured by $L^2$-norms over thin geodesic tubes.</description>

Abstract: We discuss problems that relate curvature and concentration properties of eigenfunctions and quasimodes on compact boundaryless Riemannian manifolds. These include new sharp $L^q$-estimates, $q\in (2,q_c]$, $q_c=2(n+1)/(n-1)$, of log-quasimodes that characterize compact connected space forms in terms of the growth rate of $L^q$-norms of such quasimode for these relatively small Lebesgue exponents $q$.
  No such characterization is possible for any exponent $q&gt; q_c$.</description>

Abstract: Let $I(b,d,k)$ be the subseries of the harmonic series keeping only those denominators having exactly $k$ occurrences of the digit $d$ in base $b$. We prove the existence of an asymptotic development to all orders in descending powers of $b$, for $d$ and $k$ fixed, of $I(b,d,k)-b \log(b)$ or rather, if $k=0$ and $d&gt;0$, of $I(b,d,0)- (b\log(b) - b\log(1+1/d))$. We give explicitly, according to cases, the first four or first five terms. The coefficients of these developments involve the values of the Riemann zeta function at positive integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop lower bounds for the energy of configurations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ periodic with respect to a lattice. In certain cases, the construction of sharp bounds can be formulated as a finite dimensional, multivariate polynomial interpolation problem. We use this framework to show a scaling of the equitriangular lattice $A_2$ is universally optimal among all configurations of the form $\omega_4+ A_2$ where $\omega_4$ is a 4-point configuration in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Likewise, we show a scaling and rotation of $A_2$ is universally optimal among all configurations of the form $\omega_6+L$ where $\omega_6$ is a 6-point configuration in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $L=\mathbb{Z} \times \sqrt{3} \mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>New closed forms for a dilogarithmic integral, related integrals, and series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a new closed form for the generalized integral $$\int_0^1 \frac{\mathrm{Li}_2(z) \ln(1+az)}{z}\, \mathrm{d}z,$$ where $a \in \mathbb{C} \setminus(-\infty, -1)$ and $\mathrm{Li}_2(z)$ is the dilogarithm function. This extension is achieved by leveraging our established findings in conjunction with V\u{a}lean's results. Furthermore, we provide explicit closed forms for associated integrals, prove a transformation formula for double infinite series, expressing them as the sum of the square of an infinite series and another infinite series. We utilize this relationship to derive a novel closed form for the generalized series $$\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{ \zeta\left(m, \frac{rk-s}{r}\right) }{(rk-s)^m},$$ for $\Re(m) &gt; 1$, $r, s \in \mathbb{C}$, where $r \neq 0$, $rk \neq s$, for any positive integer $k$, and $\zeta(s, z)$ denotes the Hurwitz zeta function. Utilizing Hermite's integral representation for $\zeta(s, z)$, we derive a generalized integral series from this series.</description>

      <title>Quantized collision invariants on the sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00433v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a measurable function $g:\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\to\mathbb{R}$, with $d\geq 3$, satisfies the functional relation \begin{equation*} g(\omega)+g(\omega_*)=g(\omega')+g(\omega_*'), \end{equation*} for all admissible $\omega,\omega_*,\omega',\omega_*'\in\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ in the sense that \begin{equation*} \omega+\omega_*=\omega'+\omega_*', \end{equation*} if and only if it can be written as \begin{equation*} g(\omega)=A+B\cdot\omega, \end{equation*} for some constants $A\in \mathbb{R}$ and $B\in\mathbb{R}^d$.
  Such functions form a family of quantized collision invariants which play a fundamental role in the study of hydrodynamic regimes of the Boltzmann--Fermi--Dirac equation near Fermionic condensates, i.e., at low temperatures. In particular, they characterize the elastic collisional dynamics of Fermions near a statistical equilibrium where quantum effects are predominant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the consequence of two Lip$(\gamma)$ functions, in the sense of Stein, being close throughout a subset of their domain. A particular consequence of our results is the following. Given $K_0 &gt; \varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $\gamma &gt; \eta &gt; 0$ there is a constant $\delta = \delta(\gamma,\eta,\varepsilon,K_0) &gt; 0$ for which the following is true. Let $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be closed and $f , h : \Sigma \to \mathbb{R}$ be Lip$(\gamma)$ functions whose Lip$(\gamma)$ norms are both bounded above by $K_0$. Suppose $B \subset \Sigma$ is closed and that $f$ and $h$ coincide throughout $B$. Then over the set of points in $\Sigma$ whose distance to $B$ is at most $\delta$ we have that the Lip$(\eta)$ norm of the difference $f-h$ is bounded above by $\varepsilon$. More generally, we establish that this phenomenon remains valid in a less restrictive Banach space setting under the weaker hypothesis that the two Lip$(\gamma)$ functions $f$ and $h$ are only close in a pointwise sense throughout the closed subset $B$. We require only that the subset $\Sigma$ be closed; in particular, the case that $\Sigma$ is finite is covered by our results. The restriction that $\eta &lt; \gamma$ is sharp in the sense that our result is false for $\eta := \gamma$.</description>

      <title>Coefficientwise Hankel-total positivity of the row-generating polynomials for the output matrices of certain production matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03793</link>

Abstract: Total positivity of matrices is deeply studied and plays an important role in various branches of mathematics. The aim of this paper is to study the criteria for coefficientwise Hankel-total positivity of the row-generating polynomials of generalized $m$-Jacobi-Rogers triangles and their applications.
  Using the theory of production matrices, we present the criteria for coefficientwise Hankel-total positivity of the row-generating polynomials of the output matrices of certain production matrices. In particular, we gain a criterion for coefficientwise Hankel-total positivity of the row-generating polynomial sequence of the generalized $m$-Jacobi-Rogers triangle. This immediately implies that the corresponding generalized $m$-Jacobi-Rogers triangular convolution preserves the Stieltjes moment property of sequences and its zeroth column sequence is coefficientwise Hankel-totally positive and log-convex of higher order in all the indeterminates. In consequence, for $m=1$, we immediately obtain some results on Hankel-total positivity for the Catalan-Stieltjes matrices. In particular, we in a unified manner apply our results to some combinatorial triangles or polynomials including the generalized Jacobi Stirling triangle, a generalized elliptic polynomial, a refined Stirling cycle polynomial and a refined Eulerian polynomial. For the general $m$, combining our criterion and a function satisfying an autonomous differential equation, we present different criteria for coefficientwise Hankel-total positivity of the row-generating polynomial sequence of exponential Rirodan arrays. In addition, we also derive some results for coefficientwise Hankel-total positivity in terms of compositional functions and $m$-branched Stieltjes-type continued fractions. We apply our results to many combinatorial polynomials and solve some conjcetures proposed by Sokal.</description>

      <title>Improved spectral projection estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.17266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain new improved spectral projection estimates on manifolds of non-positive curvature, including sharp ones for relatively large spectral windows for general tori. Our results are stronger than those in an earlier work of the first and third authors [6], and the arguments have been greatly simplified. We more directly make use of pointwise estimates that are implicit in the work of Berard [2] and avoid the use of weak-type spaces that were used in the previous works [6] and [22]. We also simplify and strengthen the bilinear arguments by exploiting the use of microlocal $L^2\to L^{q_c}$ Kakeya-Nikodym estimates and avoiding the of $L^2\to L^2$ ones as in earlier results. This allows us to prove new results for manifolds of negative curvature and some new sharp estimates for tori. We also have new and improved techniques in two dimensions for general manifolds of non-positive curvature.</description>

      <title>Properties of some elliptic Hill's potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13830v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Hill's differential equation with potential expressed by elliptic functions which arises in some problems of physics and mathematics. Analytical method can be applied to study the local properties of the potential in asymptotic regions of the parameter space. The locations of the saddle points of the potential are determined, the locations of turning points can be determined too when they are close to a saddle point. Combined with the quadratic differential associated with the differential equation, these local data give a qualitative explanation for the asymptotic eigensolutions obtained recently. A relevant topic is about the generalisation of Floquet theorem for ODE with doubly-periodic elliptic function coefficient which bears some new features compared to the case of ODE with real valued singly-periodic coefficient. Beyond the local asymptotic regions, global properties of the elliptic potential are studied using numerical method.</description>

      <title>Total positivity of some polynomial matrices that enumerate labeled trees and forests. II. Rooted labeled trees and partial functional digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study three combinatorial models for the lower-triangular matrix with entries $t_{n,k} = \binom{n}{k} n^{n-k}$: two involving rooted trees on the vertex set $[n+1]$, and one involving partial functional digraphs on the vertex set $[n]$. We show that this matrix is totally positive and that the sequence of its row-generating polynomials is coefficientwise Hankel-totally positive. We then generalize to polynomials $t_{n,k}(y,z)$ that count improper and proper edges, and further to polynomials $t_{n,k}(y,\mathbf{\phi})$ in infinitely many indeterminates that give a weight $y$ to each improper edge and a weight $m! \, \phi_m$ for each vertex with $m$ proper children. We show that if the weight sequence $\mathbf{\phi}$ is Toeplitz-totally positive, then the two foregoing total-positivity results continue to hold. Our proofs use production matrices and exponential Riordan arrays.</description>

      <title>On a degenerate second order traffic model: existence of discrete evolutions, deterministic many-particle limit and first order approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a new microscopic second order Follow-the-Leader type scheme to describe traffic flows. The main novelty of this model consists in multiplying the second order term by a nonlinear function of the global density, with the intent of considering the attentiveness of the drivers in dependence of the amount of congestion. Such term makes the system highly degenerate; indeed, coherently with the modellistic viewpoint, we allow for the nonlinearity to vanish as soon as consecutive vehicles are very close to each other. We first show existence of solutions to the degenerate discrete system. We then perform a rigorous discrete-to-continuum limit, as the number of vehicles grows larger and larger, by making use of suitable piece-wise constant approximations of the relevant macroscopic variables. The resulting continuum system turns out to be described by a degenerate pressure-less Euler-type equation, and we discuss how this could be considered an alternative to the groundbreaking Aw-Rascle-Zhang traffic model. Finally, we study the singular limit to first order dynamics in the spirit of a vanishing-inertia argument. This eventually validates the use of first order macroscopic models with nonlinear mobility to describe a congested traffic stream.</description>

      <title>Maximal weak Orlicz types and the strong maximal on von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{E}_n: \mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{M}_n$ and $\mathbf{E}_m: \mathcal{N} \to \mathcal{N}_m$ be two sequences of conditional expectations on finite von Neumann algebras. The optimal weak Orlicz type of the associated strong maximal operator $\mathcal{E} = (\mathbf{E}_n\otimes \mathbf{E}_m)_{n,m}$ is not yet known. In a recent work of Jose Conde and the two first-named authors, it was show that $\mathcal{E}$ has weak type $(\Phi, \Phi)$ for a family of functions including $\Phi(t) = t \, \log^{2+\varepsilon} t$, for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. In this article, we prove that the weak Orlicz type of $\mathcal{E}$ cannot be lowered below $L \log^2 L$, meaning that if $\mathcal{E}$ is of weak type $(\Phi, \Phi)$, then $\Phi(s) \not\in o(s \, \log^2 s)$. Our proof is based on interpolation. Namely, we use recent techniques of Cadilhac/Ricard to formulate a Marcinkiewicz type theorem for maximal weak Orlicz types. Then, we show that a weak Orlicz type lower than $L \log^2 L$ would imply a $p$-operator constant for $\mathcal{E}$ smaller than the known optimum as $p \to 1^{+}$.</description>
