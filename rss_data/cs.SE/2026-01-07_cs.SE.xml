      <title>ProSoftArena: Benchmarking Hierarchical Capabilities of Multimodal Agents in Professional Software Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal agents are making rapid progress on general computer-use tasks, yet existing benchmarks remain largely confined to browsers and basic desktop applications, falling short in professional software workflows that dominate real-world scientific and industrial practice. To close this gap, we introduce ProSoftArena, a benchmark and platform specifically for evaluating multimodal agents in professional software environments. We establish the first capability hierarchy tailored to agent use of professional software and construct a benchmark of 436 realistic work and research tasks spanning 6 disciplines and 13 core professional applications. To ensure reliable and reproducible assessment, we build an executable real-computer environment with an execution-based evaluation framework and uniquely incorporate a human-in-the-loop evaluation paradigm. Extensive experiments show that even the best-performing agent attains only a 24.4\% success rate on L2 tasks and completely fails on L3 multi-software workflow. In-depth analysis further provides valuable insights for addressing current agent limitations and more effective design principles, paving the way to build more capable agents in professional software settings.

      <title>The Vibe-Check Protocol: Quantifying Cognitive Offloading in AI Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering education has driven the emergence of ``Vibe Coding,'' a paradigm where developers articulate high-level intent through natural language and delegate implementation to AI agents. While proponents argue this approach modernizes pedagogy by emphasizing conceptual design over syntactic memorization, accumulating empirical evidence raises concerns regarding skill retention and deep conceptual understanding. This paper proposes a theoretical framework to investigate the research question: \textit{Is Vibe Coding a better way to learn software engineering?} We posit a divergence in student outcomes between those leveraging AI for acceleration versus those using it for cognitive offloading. To evaluate these educational trade-offs, we propose the \textbf{Vibe-Check Protocol (VCP)}, a systematic benchmarking framework incorporating three quantitative metrics: the \textit{Cold Start Refactor} ($M_{CSR}$) for modeling skill decay; \textit{Hallucination Trap Detection} ($M_{HT}$) based on signal detection theory to evaluate error identification; and the \textit{Explainability Gap} ($E_{gap}$) for quantifying the divergence between code complexity and conceptual comprehension. Through controlled comparisons, VCP aims to provide a quantitative basis for educators to determine the optimal pedagogical boundary: identifying contexts where Vibe Coding fosters genuine mastery and contexts where it introduces hidden technical debt and superficial competence.</description>

      <title>Talks that Builds: Exploring Communication factors for the Success of Emerging Professional in Product Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper recognizes that most organizational communication study focuses on established professionals aged above 27 with more than five years of experience. In contrast, this study examines product teams with younger emerging professionals aged 18-27 and explores which factors influence their success. While some established factors still apply, others become less relevant, and new ones such as curiosity, locational proximity, documentation, access to resources were identified in the study. Overall, this study fills a gap in the literature on how these newer factors shape team productivity and project outcomes based on the success rate of the product the team developed.</description>

      <title>WebCoderBench: Benchmarking Web Application Generation with Comprehensive and Interpretable Evaluation Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web applications (web apps) have become a key arena for large language models (LLMs) to demonstrate their code generation capabilities and commercial potential. However, building a benchmark for LLM-generated web apps remains challenging due to the need for real-world user requirements, generalizable evaluation metrics without relying on ground-truth implementations or test cases, and interpretable evaluation results. To address these challenges, we introduce WebCoderBench, the first real-world-collected, generalizable, and interpretable benchmark for web app generation. WebCoderBench comprises 1,572 real user requirements, covering diverse modalities and expression styles that reflect realistic user intentions. WebCoderBench provides 24 fine-grained evaluation metrics across 9 perspectives, combining rule-based and LLM-as-a-judge paradigm for fully automated, objective, and general evaluation. Moreover, WebCoderBench adopts human-preference-aligned weights over metrics to yield interpretable overall scores. Experiments across 12 representative LLMs and 2 LLM-based agents show that there exists no dominant model across all evaluation metrics, offering an opportunity for LLM developers to optimize their models in a targeted manner for a more powerful version.</description>

      <title>Focus on What Matters: Fisher-Guided Adaptive Multimodal Fusion for Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software vulnerability detection is a critical task for securing software systems and can be formulated as a binary classification problem: given a code snippet, determine whether it contains a vulnerability. Existing multimodal approaches typically fuse Natural Code Sequence (NCS) representations from pretrained language models with Code Property Graph (CPG) representations from graph neural networks, often under the implicit assumption that adding a modality necessarily yields extra information. In practice, sequence and graph representations can be redundant, and fluctuations in the quality of the graph modality can dilute the discriminative signal of the dominant modality. To address this, we propose TaCCS-DFA, a framework that introduces Fisher information as a geometric measure of how sensitive feature directions are to the classification decision, enabling task-oriented complementary fusion. TaCCS-DFA online estimates a low-rank principal Fisher subspace and restricts cross-modal attention to task-sensitive directions, thereby retrieving structural features from CPG that complement the sequence modality; meanwhile, an adaptive gating mechanism dynamically adjusts the contribution of the graph modality for each sample to suppress noise propagation. Our analysis shows that, under an isotropic perturbation assumption, the proposed mechanism admits a tighter risk bound than conventional full-spectrum attention. Experiments on BigVul, Devign, and ReVeal show that TaCCS-DFA achieves strong performance across multiple backbones. With CodeT5 as the backbone, TaCCS-DFA reaches an F1 score of 87.80\% on the highly imbalanced BigVul dataset, improving over a strong baseline Vul-LMGNNs by 6.3 percentage points while maintaining low calibration error and computational overhead.</description>

      <title>The Rise of Agentic Testing: Multi-Agent Systems for Robust Software Quality Assurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software testing has progressed toward intelligent automation, yet current AI-based test generators still suffer from static, single-shot outputs that frequently produce invalid, redundant, or non-executable tests due to the lack of execution aware feedback. This paper introduces an agentic multi-model testing framework a closed-loop, self-correcting system in which a Test Generation Agent, an Execution and Analysis Agent, and a Review and Optimization Agent collaboratively generate, execute, analyze, and refine tests until convergence. By using sandboxed execution, detailed failure reporting, and iterative regeneration or patching of failing tests, the framework autonomously improves test quality and expands coverage. Integrated into a CI/CD-compatible pipeline, it leverages reinforcement signals from coverage metrics and execution outcomes to guide refinement. Empirical evaluations on microservice based applications show up to a 60% reduction in invalid tests, 30% coverage improvement, and significantly reduced human effort compared to single-model baselines demonstrating that multi-agent, feedback-driven loops can evolve software testing into an autonomous, continuously learning quality assurance ecosystem for self-healing, high-reliability codebases.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Debugging Skills with AI-Powered Assistance: A Real-Time Tool for Debugging Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Debugging is a crucial skill in programming education and software development, yet it is often overlooked in CS curricula. To address this, we introduce an AI-powered debugging assistant integrated into an IDE. It offers real-time support by analyzing code, suggesting breakpoints, and providing contextual hints. Using RAG with LLMs, program slicing, and custom heuristics, it enhances efficiency by minimizing LLM calls and improving accuracy. A three-level evaluation - technical analysis, UX study, and classroom tests - highlights its potential for teaching debugging.</description>

      <title>Green LLM Techniques in Action: How Effective Are Existing Techniques for Improving the Energy Efficiency of LLM-Based Applications in Industry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about their substantial energy consumption, especially when deployed at industry scale. While several techniques have been proposed to address this, limited empirical evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of applying them to LLM-based industry applications. To fill this gap, we analyzed a chatbot application in an industrial context at Schuberg Philis, a Dutch IT services company. We then selected four techniques, namely Small and Large Model Collaboration, Prompt Optimization, Quantization, and Batching, applied them to the application in eight variations, and then conducted experiments to study their impact on energy consumption, accuracy, and response time compared to the unoptimized baseline.
  Our results show that several techniques, such as Prompt Optimization and 2-bit Quantization, managed to reduce energy use significantly, sometimes by up to 90%. However, these techniques especially impacted accuracy negatively, to a degree that is not acceptable in practice. The only technique that achieved significant and strong energy reductions without harming the other qualities substantially was Small and Large Model Collaboration via Nvidia's Prompt Task and Complexity Classifier (NPCC) with prompt complexity thresholds. This highlights that reducing the energy consumption of LLM-based applications is not difficult in practice. However, improving their energy efficiency, i.e., reducing energy use without harming other qualities, remains challenging. Our study provides practical insights to move towards this goal.</description>

      <title>On the Effectiveness of Proposed Techniques to Reduce Energy Consumption in RAG Systems: A Controlled Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising energy demands of machine learning (ML), e.g., implemented in popular variants like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, have raised significant concerns about their environmental sustainability. While previous research has proposed green tactics for ML-enabled systems, their empirical evaluation within RAG systems remains largely unexplored. This study presents a controlled experiment investigating five practical techniques aimed at reducing energy consumption in RAG systems. Using a production-like RAG system developed at our collaboration partner, the Software Improvement Group, we evaluated the impact of these techniques on energy consumption, latency, and accuracy.
  Through a total of 9 configurations spanning over 200 hours of trials using the CRAG dataset, we reveal that techniques such as increasing similarity retrieval thresholds, reducing embedding sizes, applying vector indexing, and using a BM25S reranker can significantly reduce energy usage, up to 60% in some cases. However, several techniques also led to unacceptable accuracy decreases, e.g., by up to 30% for the indexing strategies. Notably, finding an optimal retrieval threshold and reducing embedding size substantially reduced energy consumption and latency with no loss in accuracy, making these two techniques truly energy-efficient. We present the first comprehensive, empirical study on energy-efficient design techniques for RAG systems, providing guidance for developers and researchers aiming to build sustainable RAG applications.</description>

      <title>PerspectiveCoach: Exploring LLMs for Developer Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite growing awareness of ethical challenges in software development, practitioners still lack structured tools that help them critically engage with the lived experiences of marginalized users. This paper presents PerspectiveCoach, a large language model (LLM)-powered conversational tool designed to guide developers through structured perspective-taking exercises and deepen critical reflection on how software design decisions affect marginalized communities. Through a controlled study with 18 front-end developers (balanced by sex), who interacted with the tool using a real case of online gender-based harassment, we examine how PerspectiveCoach supports ethical reasoning and engagement with user perspectives. Qualitative analysis revealed increased self-awareness, broadened perspectives, and more nuanced ethical articulation, while a complementary human-human study contextualized these findings. Text similarity analyses demonstrated that participants in the human-PerspectiveCoach study improved the fidelity of their restatements over multiple attempts, capturing both surface-level and semantic aspects of user concerns. However, human-PerspectiveCoach's restatements had a lower baseline than the human-human conversations, highlighting contextual differences in impersonal and interpersonal perspective-taking. Across the study, participants rated the tool highly for usability and relevance. This work contributes an exploratory design for LLM-powered end-user perspective-taking that supports critical, ethical self-reflection and offers empirical insights (i.e., enhancing adaptivity, centering plurality) into how such tools can help practitioners build more inclusive and socially responsive technologies.</description>

      <title>Compressed code: the hidden effects of quantization and distillation on programming tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional code generation capabilities, yet their token-level mechanisms remain underexplored, particularly in compressed models. Through systematic analysis of programming language token representations, we characterize how programming languages are encoded in LLM tokenizers by analyzing their vocabulary distribution and keyword coverage patterns. We introduce a novel cold-start probability analysis method that provides insights into model behavior without requiring explicit prompts. Additionally, we present a comprehensive evaluation of how different model optimization techniques - including quantization, distillation, model scaling, and task-specific fine-tuning - affect token-level representations and code generation quality. Our experiments, supported by comprehensive probability distribution analysis and evaluation metrics, reveal critical insights into token-level behavior and provide empirically-validated guidelines for maintaining code generation quality under various optimization constraints. These findings advance both theoretical understanding of LLM code generation and practical implementation of optimized models in production environments.</description>

      <title>TAAF: A Trace Abstraction and Analysis Framework Synergizing Knowledge Graphs and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Execution traces are a critical source of information for understanding, debugging, and optimizing complex software systems. However, traces from OS kernels or large-scale applications like Chrome or MySQL are massive and difficult to analyze. Existing tools rely on predefined analyses, and custom insights often require writing domain-specific scripts, which is an error-prone and time-consuming task. This paper introduces TAAF (Trace Abstraction and Analysis Framework), a novel approach that combines time-indexing, knowledge graphs (KGs), and large language models (LLMs) to transform raw trace data into actionable insights. TAAF constructs a time-indexed KG from trace events to capture relationships among entities such as threads, CPUs, and system resources. An LLM then interprets query-specific subgraphs to answer natural-language questions, reducing the need for manual inspection and deep system expertise. To evaluate TAAF, we introduce TraceQA-100, a benchmark of 100 questions grounded in real kernel traces. Experiments across three LLMs and multiple temporal settings show that TAAF improves answer accuracy by up to 31.2%, particularly in multi-hop and causal reasoning tasks. We further analyze where graph-grounded reasoning helps and where limitations remain, offering a foundation for next-generation trace analysis tools.</description>

      <title>Enterprise Identity Integration for AI-Assisted Developer Services: Architecture, Implementation, and Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-assisted developer services are increasingly embedded in modern IDEs, yet enterprises must ensure these tools operate within existing identity, access control, and governance requirements. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI assistants to retrieve structured internal context, but its specification provides only a minimal authorization model and lacks guidance on integrating enterprise SSO. This article presents a practical architecture that incorporates OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) into MCP-enabled developer environments. It describes how IDE extensions obtain and present tokens, how MCP servers validate them through an identity provider, and how scopes and claims can enforce least-privilege access. A prototype implementation using Visual Studio Code, a Python-based MCP server, and an OIDC-compliant IdP demonstrates feasibility. A case study evaluates authentication latency, token-validation overhead, operational considerations, and AI-specific risks. The approach provides a deployable pattern for organizations adopting AI-assisted developer tools while maintaining identity assurance and auditability.</description>

      <title>Agentic Memory Enhanced Recursive Reasoning for Root Cause Localization in Microservices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As contemporary microservice systems become increasingly popular and complex-often comprising hundreds or even thousands of fine-grained, interdependent subsystems-they are experiencing more frequent failures. Ensuring system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While many traditional graph-based and deep learning approaches have been explored for this task, they often rely heavily on pre-defined schemas that struggle to adapt to evolving operational contexts. Consequently, a number of LLM-based methods have recently been proposed. However, these methods still face two major limitations: shallow, symptom-centric reasoning that undermines accuracy, and a lack of cross-alert reuse that leads to redundant reasoning and high latency. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of how Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) localize the root causes of failures, drawing insights from professionals across multiple organizations. Our investigation reveals that expert root cause analysis exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion, and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce AMER-RCL, an agentic memory enhanced recursive reasoning framework for root cause localization in microservices. AMER-RCL employs the Recursive Reasoning RCL engine, a multi-agent framework that performs recursive reasoning on each alert to progressively refine candidate causes, while Agentic Memory incrementally accumulates and reuses reasoning from prior alerts within a time window to reduce redundant exploration and lower inference latency. Experimental results demonstrate that AMER-RCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both localization accuracy and inference efficiency.</description>

      <title>Hypothesize-Then-Verify: Speculative Root Cause Analysis for Microservices with Pathwise Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microservice systems have become the backbone of cloud-native enterprise applications due to their resource elasticity, loosely coupled architecture, and lightweight deployment. Yet, the intrinsic complexity and dynamic runtime interactions of such systems inevitably give rise to anomalies. Ensuring system reliability therefore hinges on effective root cause analysis (RCA), which entails not only localizing the source of anomalies but also characterizing the underlying failures in a timely and interpretable manner. Recent advances in intelligent RCA techniques, particularly those powered by large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated promising capabilities, as LLMs reduce reliance on handcrafted features while offering cross-platform adaptability, task generalization, and flexibility. However, existing LLM-based methods still suffer from two critical limitations: (a) limited exploration diversity, which undermines accuracy, and (b) heavy dependence on large-scale LLMs, which results in slow inference. To overcome these challenges, we propose SpecRCA, a speculative root cause analysis framework for microservices that adopts a \textit{hypothesize-then-verify} paradigm. SpecRCA first leverages a hypothesis drafting module to rapidly generate candidate root causes, and then employs a parallel root cause verifier to efficiently validate them. Preliminary experiments on the AIOps 2022 dataset demonstrate that SpecRCA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches, highlighting its potential as a practical solution for scalable and interpretable RCA in complex microservice environments.</description>

      <title>CodeMEM: AST-Guided Adaptive Memory for Repository-Level Iterative Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) substantially enhance developer productivity in repository-level code generation through interactive collaboration. However, as interactions progress, repository context must be continuously preserved and updated to integrate newly validated information. Meanwhile, the expanding session history increases cognitive burden, often leading to forgetting and the reintroduction of previously resolved errors. Existing memory management approaches show promise but remain limited by natural language-centric representations. To overcome these limitations, we propose CodeMEM, an AST-guided dynamic memory management system tailored for repository-level iterative code generation. Specifically, CodeMEM introduces the Code Context Memory component that dynamically maintains and updates repository context through AST-guided LLM operations, along with the Code Session Memory that constructs a code-centric representation of interaction history and explicitly detects and mitigates forgetting through AST-based analysis. Experimental results on the instruction-following benchmark CodeIF-Bench and the code generation benchmark CoderEval demonstrate that CodeMEM achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving instruction following by 12.2% for the current turn and 11.5% for the session level, and reducing interaction rounds by 2-3, while maintaining competitive inference latency and token efficiency.</description>

      <title>Few-shot learning for security bug report identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security bug reports require prompt identification to minimize the window of vulnerability in software systems. Traditional machine learning (ML) techniques for classifying bug reports to identify security bug reports rely heavily on large amounts of labeled data. However, datasets for security bug reports are often scarce in practice, leading to poor model performance and limited applicability in real-world settings. In this study, we propose a few-shot learning-based technique to effectively identify security bug reports using limited labeled data. We employ SetFit, a state-of-the-art few-shot learning framework that combines sentence transformers with contrastive learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The model is trained on a small labeled dataset of bug reports and is evaluated on its ability to classify these reports as either security-related or non-security-related. Our approach achieves an AUC of 0.865, at best, outperforming traditional ML techniques (baselines) for all of the evaluated datasets. This highlights the potential of SetFit to effectively identify security bug reports. SetFit-based few-shot learning offers a promising alternative to traditional ML techniques to identify security bug reports. The approach enables efficient model development with minimal annotation effort, making it highly suitable for scenarios where labeled data is scarce.</description>

      <title>A Dataset of Low-Rated Applications from the Amazon Appstore for User Feedback Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In todays digital landscape, end-user feedback plays a crucial role in the evolution of software applications, particularly in addressing issues that hinder user experience. While much research has focused on high-rated applications, low-rated applications often remain unexplored, despite their potential to reveal valuable insights. This study introduces a novel dataset curated from 64 low-rated applications sourced from the Amazon Software Appstore (ASA), containing 79,821 user reviews. The dataset is designed to capture the most frequent issues identified by users, which are critical for improving software quality. To further enhance the dataset utility, a subset of 6000 reviews was manually annotated to classify them into six district issue categories: user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), functionality and features, compatibility and device specificity, performance and stability, customer support and responsiveness, and security and privacy issues. This annotated dataset is a valuable resource for developing machine learning-based approaches aiming to automate the classification of user feedback into various issue types. Making both the annotated and raw datasets publicly available provides researchers and developers with a crucial tool to understand common issues in low-rated apps and inform software improvements. The comprehensive analysis and availability of this dataset lay the groundwork for data-derived solutions to improve software quality based on user feedback. Additionally, the dataset can provide opportunities for software vendors and researchers to explore various software evolution-related activities, including frequently missing features, sarcasm, and associated emotions, which will help better understand the reasons for comparatively low app ratings.</description>

      <title>NavAI: A Generalizable LLM Framework for Navigation Tasks in Virtual Reality Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigation is one of the fundamental tasks for automated exploration in Virtual Reality (VR). Existing technologies primarily focus on path optimization in 360-degree image datasets and 3D simulators, which cannot be directly applied to immersive VR environments. To address this gap, we present NavAI, a generalizable large language model (LLM)-based navigation framework that supports both basic actions and complex goal-directed tasks across diverse VR applications. We evaluate NavAI in three distinct VR environments through goal-oriented and exploratory tasks. Results show that it achieves high accuracy, with an 89% success rate in goal-oriented tasks. Our analysis also highlights current limitations of relying entirely on LLMs, particularly in scenarios that require dynamic goal assessment. Finally, we discuss the limitations observed during the experiments and offer insights for future research directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High enrollment in STEM-related degree programs has created increasing demand for scalable tutoring support, as universities experience a shortage of qualified instructors and teaching assistants (TAs). To address this challenge, LeafTutor, an AI tutoring agent powered by large language models (LLMs), was developed to provide step-by-step guidance for students. LeafTutor was evaluated through real programming assignments. The results indicate that the system can deliver step-by-step programming guidance comparable to human tutors. This work demonstrates the potential of LLM-driven tutoring solutions to enhance and personalize learning in STEM education.

      <description>arXiv:2601.03249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This volume contains the post-proceedings of the Sixteenth International Workshop on Graph Computation Models (GCM 2025). The workshops took place in Koblenz, Germany on June 10 as part of STAF (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations).  
  Graphs are common mathematical structures that are visual and intuitive. They constitute a natural and seamless way for system modeling in science, engineering, and beyond, including computer science, biology, and business process modeling. Graph computation models constitute a class of very high-level models where graphs are first-class citizens. The aim of the International GCM Workshop series is to bring together researchers interested in all aspects of computation models based on graphs and graph transformation. It promotes the cross-fertilizing exchange of ideas and experiences among senior and young researchers from the different communities interested in the foundations, applications, and implementations of graph computation models and related areas. </description>

      <title>A Survey on Failure Analysis and Fault Injection in AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to its integration into various areas, especially with Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly enhancing capabilities in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). However, the complexity of AI systems has also exposed their vulnerabilities, necessitating robust methods for failure analysis (FA) and fault injection (FI) to ensure resilience and reliability. Despite the importance of these techniques, there lacks a comprehensive review of FA and FI methodologies in AI systems. This study fills this gap by presenting a detailed survey of existing FA and FI approaches across six layers of AI systems. We systematically analyze 160 papers and repositories to answer three research questions including (1) what are the prevalent failures in AI systems, (2) what types of faults can current FI tools simulate, (3) what gaps exist between the simulated faults and real-world failures. Our findings reveal a taxonomy of AI system failures, assess the capabilities of existing FI tools, and highlight discrepancies between real-world and simulated failures. Moreover, this survey contributes to the field by providing a framework for fault diagnosis, evaluating the state-of-the-art in FI, and identifying areas for improvement in FI techniques to enhance the resilience of AI systems.</description>

      <title>EvoGPT: Leveraging LLM-Driven Seed Diversity to Improve Search-Based Test Suite Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) is a well-established approach for automated unit test generation, yet it often suffers from premature convergence and limited diversity in the generated test suites. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative technique for unit test generation. We present EvoGPT, a hybrid test generation system that integrates LLM-based test generation with SBST-based test suite optimization. EvoGPT uses LLMs to generate an initial population of test suites, and uses an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to further optimize this test suite population. A distinguishing feature of EvoGPT is its explicit enforcement of diversity, achieved through the use of multiple temperatures and prompt instructions during test generation. In addition, each LLM-generated test is refined using a generation-repair loop and coverage-guided assertion generation. To address evolutionary plateaus, EvoGPT also detects stagnation during search and injects additional LLM-generated tests aimed at previously uncovered branches. Here too diversity is enforced using multiple temperatures and prompt instructions. We evaluate EvoGPT on Defects4J, a standard benchmark for test generation. The results show that EvoGPT achieves, on average, a 10\% improvement in both code coverage and mutation score metrics compared to TestART, an LLM-only baseline; and EvoSuite, a standard SBST baseline. An ablation study indicates that explicitly enforcing diversity both at initialization and during the search is key to effectively leveraging LLMs for automated unit test generation.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Design-Aware Context in Large Language Models for Code Comment Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comments are very useful to the flow of code development. With the increasing commonality of code, novice coders have been creating a significant amount of codebases. Due to lack of commenting standards, their comments are often useless, and increase the time taken to further maintain codes. This study intends to find the usefulness of large language models (LLMs) in these cases to generate potentially better comments. This study focuses on the feasibility of design documents as a context for the LLMs to generate more useful comments, as design documents are often used by maintainers to understand code when comments do not suffice.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Garden of Forking Paths in Empirical Software Engineering Research: A Multiverse Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In empirical software engineering (SE) research, researchers have considerable freedom to decide how to process data, what operationalizations to use, and which statistical model to fit. Gelman and Loken refer to this freedom as leading to a "garden of forking paths". Although this freedom is often seen as an advantage, it also poses a threat to robustness and replicability: variations in analytical decisions, even when justifiable, can lead to divergent conclusions.
  To better understand this risk, we conducted a so-called multiverse analysis on a published empirical SE paper. The paper we picked is a Mining Software Repositories study, as MSR studies commonly use non-trivial statistical models to analyze post-hoc, observational data. In the study, we identified nine pivotal analytical decisions-each with at least one equally defensible alternative and systematically reran all the 3,072 resulting analysis pipelines on the original dataset. Interestingly, only 6 of these universes (&lt;0.2%) reproduced the published results; the overwhelming majority produced qualitatively different, and sometimes even opposite, findings.
  This case study of a data analytical method commonly applied to empirical software engineering data reveals how methodological choices can exert a more profound influence on outcomes than is often acknowledged. We therefore advocate that SE researchers complement standard reporting with robustness checks across plausible analysis variants or, at least, explicitly justify each analytical decision. We propose a structured classification model to help classify and improve justification for methodological choices. Secondly, we show how the multiverse analysis is a practical tool in the methodological arsenal of SE researchers, one that can help produce more reliable, reproducible science.</description>

      <title>Pro2Guard: Proactive Runtime Enforcement of LLM Agent Safety via Probabilistic Model Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents demonstrate strong autonomy, but their stochastic behavior introduces unpredictable safety risks. Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as AgentSpec, are reactive, intervening only when unsafe behavior is imminent or has occurred, lacking foresight for long-horizon dependencies. To overcome these limitations, we present a proactive runtime enforcement framework for LLM agents. The framework abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it predicts the probability of leading to undesired behaviors and intervenes before violations occur when the estimated risk exceeds a user-defined threshold. Designed to provide PAC-correctness guarantee, the framework achieves statistically reliable enforcement of agent safety. We evaluate the framework across two safety-critical domains: autonomous vehicles and embodied agents. It proactively enforces safety and maintains high task performance, outperforming existing methods.</description>
