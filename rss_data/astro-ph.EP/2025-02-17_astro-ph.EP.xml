      <title>Habitable Zone and Atmosphere Retention Distance (HaZARD) Stellar-evolution-dependent loss models of secondary atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major open question in exoplanet research is whether secondary atmospheres are rare around Earth-sized rocky exoplanets. In this work we determine the distance at which an Earth-sized planet orbiting a variety of stellar hosts could retain a CO2- or N2-dominated atmosphere and compare this atmospheric retention distance (ARD) with that of the liquid-water HZ. We combined planetary atmosphere models with stellar evolution models. The atmospheric models produced by the thermochemical Kompot code allowed us to calculate the Jeans escape rates for different stellar masses, rotation rates, and ages. These loss rates allowed us to determine the closest distance a planet is likely to retain a CO2- or N2-dominated atmosphere. Using stellar rotation evolution models, we modelled how these retention distances evolve as the X-ray and ultraviolet activity of the star evolves. We find that the overlap of the HZ and the ARD occurs earlier around slowly rotating stars. Additionally, we find that HZ planets orbiting stars with masses under 0.4 M_\odot are unlikely to retain any atmosphere, due to the lower spin-down rate of these fully convective stars. We also show that the initial rotation rate of the star can impact the likelihood of a planet retaining an atmosphere, as an initially fast-rotating star maintains high levels of short-wavelength irradiance for much longer. The orbits of all Earth-like rocky exoplanets observed by JWST in cycles 1 and 2, including HZ planets, fall outside the ARD. Our results will have implications for future target selections of small exoplanet observing programmes with JWST or future instruments such as the Ariel space mission.</description>

      <title>The fall of asteroid 2024 XA$_1$ and the location of possible meteorites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroid 2024 XA$_1$ was discovered on 3 December 2024 at 05:54 UTC by the Bok telescope in Kitt Peak, Arizona, and impacted Earth about 10 hours later over a remote area of the Sakha Republic (Russia). The estimated size of the object was about one meter, and the atmospheric entry produced a bright fireball that was captured by a webcam and several eyewitnesses. The first impact alert was issued at 07:50 UTC by the Meerkat Asteroid Guard of the European Space Agency, which triggered subsequent follow-up observations that confirmed both the object to be real and the occurrence of the impact with Earth. Here we present the operations and results from the NEO Coordination Centre (NEOCC) upon the impact event. Because the entry likely dropped meteorites on the ground, we also estimate the possible strewn fields for future meteorite search campaigns.</description>

      <title>ExoMiner++ on TESS with Transfer Learning from Kepler: Transit Classification and Vetting Catalog for 2-min Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ExoMiner++, an enhanced deep learning model that builds on the success of ExoMiner to improve transit signal classification in 2-minute TESS data. ExoMiner++ incorporates additional diagnostic inputs, including periodogram, flux trend, difference image, unfolded flux, and spacecraft attitude control data, all of which are crucial for effectively distinguishing transit signals from more challenging sources of false positives. To further enhance performance, we leverage transfer learning from high-quality labeled data from the Kepler space telescope, mitigating the impact of TESS's noisier and more ambiguous labels. ExoMiner++ achieves high accuracy across various classification and ranking metrics, significantly narrowing the search space for follow-up investigations to confirm new planets. To serve the exoplanet community, we introduce new TESS catalogs containing ExoMiner++ classifications and confidence scores for each transit signal. Among the 147,568 unlabeled TCEs, ExoMiner++ identifies 7,330 as planet candidates, with the remainder classified as false positives. These 7,330 planet candidates correspond to 1,868 existing TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs), 69 Community TESS Objects of Interest (CTOIs), and 50 newly introduced CTOIs. 1,797 out of the 2,506 TOIs previously labeled as planet candidates in ExoFOP are classified as planet candidates by ExoMiner++. This reduction in plausible candidates combined with the excellent ranking quality of ExoMiner++ allows the follow-up efforts to be focused on the most likely candidates, increasing the overall planet yield.</description>

      <title>Surface dynamics and geophysical environment of asteroid (3200) Phaethon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. (3200) Phaethon is a ~5-km-diameter near-Earth asteroid with a small perihelion distance of 0.14 au and is the parent body of the Geminids. JAXA's DESTINY+ mission will fly by Phaethon in the near future. Aims. We aim to support the pre-flight planning for the DESTINY+ mission by performing a geophysical analysis on Phaethon's surface and near-surface environment utilizing the latest shape model from numerous observations. Methods. We employed the soft-sphere discrete element method code PKDGRAV to construct a "mascon" model of Phaethon and determine its gravity. We then computed the geopotential on Phaethon and derived various physical quantities related to its surface and near-surface dynamics. Results. We calculated geophysical quantities for the surface, including surface acceleration and slope. To assess whether surface objects could be launched off the surface, we computed the escape speed, return speed, Jacobi speed, and the location and stability of equilibrium points around Phaethon, and conducted a simple dynamical simulation of launched particles. Conclusions. Our results suggest that a large depression feature in the northern hemisphere could harbor exposed subsurface material and the freshest material on Phaethon. We propose that this depression be considered a key area for observation by the DESTINY+ mission</description>

      <title>Cl+ and HCl+ in Reaction with H2 and Isotopologues: A Glance into H Abstraction and Indirect Exchange at Astrophysical Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrochemical models of interstellar clouds, the sites of stars, and planet formation require information about spin-state chemistry to allow quantitative comparison with spectroscopic observations. In particular, it is important to know if full scrambling or H abstraction (also known as proton hopping) takes place in ion-neutral reactions. The reaction of Cl+ and HCl+ with H2 and isotopologues has been studied at cryogenic temperatures between 20 and 180 K using a 22 pole radio frequency ion trap. Isotopic exchange processes are used to probe the reaction mechanism of the HCl+ + H2 reaction. The results are compared with previous measurements and theoretical predictions. The rate coefficients for the Cl+ + H2 and HCl+ + H2 reactions are found to be constant in the range of temperatures studied, except for the DCl+ + D2 reaction, where a weak negative temperature dependence is observed, and reactions with D2 are found to be significantly slower than the Langevin rate. No isotopic exchange reactions are observed to occur for the H2Cl+ ion. The analysis of the products of the HCl+ + H2 isotopic system clearly indicates that the reaction proceeds via simple hydrogen atom abstraction.</description>

      <title>A primordial radius valley as a consequence of planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radius distribution of close-in planets has been observed to have a bimodal distribution with a dearth of planets around ~1.5-2.0 $R_\oplus$ commonly referred to as the ''radius valley''. The origin of the valley is normally attributed to mass-loss process such as photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. Recent work, however, has suggested that the radius valley may instead arise as a consequence of gas accretion by low-mass planets. In this work we therefore aim to investigate the formation of a primordial radius valley from the formation of planet cores through pebble accretion up until the dissipation of the protoplanetary disc and subsequent contraction of accreted atmospheres. The goal of this work is to explore the conditions for forming a primordial radius valley from first principles of planet formation theory, rather than attempting to explain the detailed structure of the observed valley. We use an analytical model with minimal assumptions to estimate the contraction rate of atmospheres and, indeed, find the formation of a primordial radius valley. The planets smaller than the valley did not reach the pebble isolation mass, which is required for the planets to cool down sufficiently to be able to accrete a significant amount of gas. We also estimate the slopes of the radius gap as a function of orbital period for the intrinsic population as well as for planets with orbital periods &lt;100 days. For the intrinsic population, the radius gap follows the pebble isolation mass and increases with increasing orbital period, while for close-in planets the direction of the slope reverses and decreases with increasing orbital period. We find that planets smaller than the radius valley are predominantly rocky while the population of planets larger than the valley consists of a mixture of rocky and water-rich planets.</description>

      <title>Detection of a peculiar noise type in the TESS "fast" light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the detection of a peculiar high-frequency noise component in the 20 second cadence SAP (Simple Aperture Photometry) light curve of TESS (Transiting Exoplanets Survey Satellite). This effect (labeled as blue noise) may be attributed to the pointing instability (also known as satellite jiiter) of the satellite. We present a common technique used in the mitigation of the jitter, by decorrelating against the subpixel position of the photo-center of the point spread function of the star. We also show that a simple linear or polynomial technique may not yield satisfactory corrections, as the behavior or attitude of the noise properties may change considerably throughout the light curve.</description>

      <title>Analysis of 42 years of Cosmic Ray Measurements by the Neutron Monitor at Lomnick\'y st\'it Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correlation and physical interconnection between space weather indices and cosmic ray flux has been well-established with extensive literature on the topic. Our investigation is centered on the relationships among the solar radio flux, geomagnetic field activity, and cosmic ray flux, as observed by the Neutron Monitor at the Lomnick\'y \v{s}t\'it Observatory in Slovakia. We processed the raw neutron monitor data, generating the first publicly accessible dataset spanning 42 years. The curated continuous data are available in .csv format in hourly resolution from December 1981 to July 2023 and in minute resolution from January 2001 to July 2023 (Institute of Experimental Physics SAS, 2024). Validation of this processed data was accomplished by identifying distinctive events within the dataset. As part of the selection of events for case studies, we report the discovery of TGE-s visible in the data. Applying the Pearson method for statistical analysis, we quantified the linear correlation of the datasets. Additionally, a prediction power score was computed to reveal potential non-linear relationships. Our findings demonstrate a significant anti-correlation between cosmic ray and solar radio flux with a correlation coefficient of -0.74, coupled with a positive correlation concerning geomagnetic field strength. We also found that the neutron monitor measurements correlate better with a delay of 7-21 hours applied to the geomagnetic field strength data. The correlation between these datasets is further improved when inspecting periods of extreme solar events only. Lastly, the computed prediction power score of 0.22 for neutron flux in the context of geomagnetic field strength presents exciting possibilities for developing real-time geomagnetic storm prediction models based on cosmic ray measurements.</description>

      <title>The Pandora SmallSat: A Low-Cost, High Impact Mission to Study Exoplanets and Their Host Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pandora SmallSat is a NASA flight project aimed at studying the atmospheres of exoplanets -- planets orbiting stars outside our Solar System. Pandora will provide the first dataset of simultaneous, multiband (visible and NIR), long-baseline observations of exoplanets and their host stars. Pandora is an ambitious project that will fly a 0.44 m telescope in a small form factor. To achieve the scientific goals, the mission requires a departure from the traditional cost-schedule paradigm of half-meter-class observatories. Pandora achieves this by leveraging existing capabilities that necessitate minimal engineering development, disruptive and agile management, trusted partnerships with vendors, and strong support from the lead institutions. The Pandora team has developed a suite of high-fidelity parameterized simulation and modeling tools to estimate the performance of both imaging channels. This has enabled a unique bottom-up approach to deriving trades and system requirements. Pandora is a partnership between NASA and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The project completed its Critical Design Review in October 2023 and is slated for launch into Sun-synchronous, low-Earth orbit in Fall 2025.</description>

      <title>Structure of gaps induced by retrograde satellites embedded in accretion discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using 2D simulations, we investigate how a non-accreting satellite on a fixed retrograde circular orbit affects the structure of the accretion disc in which it is embedded. We vary the satellite-to-primary mass ratio $q$, the disc viscosity $\nu$, and the inner boundary conditions. A viscous criterion for gap opening is derived, which is broadly consistent with the simulations. We find a scaling relation of the gap depth with $q$ and $\nu$. Unlike the prograde case, the satellite is located at the gap's inner edge, resulting in a surface density at the satellite's orbital radius up to $20$ times higher than at the gap's minimum. As the viscosity decreases, the gap depth increases, while the radial shift of the gap and the satellite's orbital radius decreases. Gap-opening satellites may drive radial motions in the disc, producing eccentric gaps. Positioned at the gap edge, satellites experience a rapidly fluctuating environment. Migrating satellites can develop orbital eccentricities comparable to the disc's aspect ratio. In a 3D simulation with $q=0.01$, the flow velocity exhibits a notorious vertical component in the gap's inner edge. A comparison between 2D and 3D simulations reveals a slight radial offset in gap position, resulting in a lower surface density at the perturber's orbital radius in the 3D simulation.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional dynamical evolution of cloud particle microphysics in sub-stellar atmospheres I. Description and exploring Y-dwarf atmospheric variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding of cloud microphysics and the evolution of cloud structures in sub-stellar atmospheres remains a key challenge in the JWST era. The abundance of new JWST data necessitates models that are suitable for coupling with large-scale simulations, such as general circulation models (GCMs), in order to fully understand and assess the complex feedback effects of clouds on the atmosphere, and their influence on observed spectral and variability characteristics. We aim to develop a 2-moment, time-dependent bulk microphysical cloud model that is suitable for GCMs of sub-stellar atmospheres. We derive a set of moment equations for the particle mass distribution and develop a microphysical cloud model employing a 2-moment approach. We include homogeneous nucleation, condensation, and collisional microphysical processes that evolve the moments of a particle size distribution in time. We couple our new 2-moment scheme with the Exo-FMS GCM to simulate the evolution of KCl clouds for a WISE 0359-54 Y-dwarf parameter regime, and examine the effect of cloud opacity on the atmospheric characteristics. Our results show a global KCl cloud structure, with a patchy coverage at higher latitudes, as well as an equatorial belt region that shows increased particle sizes and variations in longitude. Patchy regions are long lived, being present over many rotations of the brown dwarf. Our synthetic spectra conform well with JWST observations of WISE 0359-54, but more cloud opacity is required to dampen the spectral features at wavelengths below ~7um. Our GCM shows periodic and sub-rotational variability on the order of 0.5-1% in the Spitzer [3.6] and [4.5] micron bands, lower than that observed on other Y-dwarf objects.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Extended CO$_2$ Cross Sections on Temperate Anoxic Planet Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our interpretation of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheric spectra will always be limited by the accuracy of the data we use as input in our forward and retrieval models. Ultraviolet molecular absorption cross sections are one category of these essential model inputs; however, they are often poorly characterized at the longest wavelengths relevant to photo-dissociation. Photolysis reactions dominate the chemical kinetics of temperate terrestrial planet atmospheres. One molecule of particular importance is CO$_2$, which is likely present in all terrestrial planet atmospheres. The photolysis of CO$_2$ can introduce CO and O, as well as shield tropospheric water vapor from undergoing photolysis. This is important because H$_2$O photolysis produces OH, which serves as a major reactive sink to many atmospheric trace gases. Here, we construct CO$_2$ cross-section prescriptions at 195K and 300K extrapolated beyond 200 nm from measured cross sections. We compare results from the implementation of these new cross sections to the most commonly used CO$_2$ prescriptions for temperate, terrestrial planets with Archean-like atmospheres. We generally find that the observational consequences of CO$_2$ dissociation beyond 200 nm is minimal so long as our least conservative (highest opacity) prescription can be ruled out. Moreover, implementing our recommended extended CO$_2$ cross sections does not substantially alter previous results showing the consequential photochemical impact of extended H$_2$O cross sections.</description>
