      <title>Short-period pulsating hot-subdwarf stars observed by TESS II. Northern ecliptic hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of a continuation of our Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) search for short-period pulsations in compact stellar objects observed during Years 2 and 4 of the TESS mission that targeted the northern ecliptic hemisphere. For many of the targets, we exploit unpublished spectroscopic data to confirm or determine the object's spectral classification. From the TESS photometry, we identify 50 short-period hot-subdwarf pulsators, including 35 sdB and 15 sdOB stars. The sample contains 26 pulsators not known before the TESS mission. Nine stars show signals at both low and high frequencies, and are therefore ``hybrid'' pulsators. For each pulsator, we report the list of prewhitened frequencies and we show amplitude spectra calculated from the TESS data. We attempt to identify possible multiplets caused by stellar rotation, and we report five candidates with rotation periods between 11 and 46d. Having the search for p-mode pulsating hot subdwarfs in TESS Sectors 1 - 60 done, we discuss the completeness of the study, as well as instability strip and the evolutionary status of the stars we found. We also compare the distribution of pulsation periods as a function of effective temperature and surface gravity with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>The TESS SPOC FFI Target Sample Explored with Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TESS mission has provided the community with high-precision times series photometry for $\sim$2.8 million stars across the entire sky via the Full Frame Image (FFI) light curves produced by the TESS Science Processing Operations Centre (SPOC). This set of light curves is an extremely valuable resource for the discovery of transiting exoplanets and other stellar science. However, due to the sample selection, this set of light curves does not constitute a magnitude limited sample. In order to understand the effects of this sample selection, we use Gaia DR2 and DR3 to study the properties of the stars in the TESS-SPOC FFI light curve set, with the aim of providing vital context for further research using the sample. We report on the properties of the TESS-SPOC FFI Targets in Sectors 1 - 55 (covering Cycles 1 - 4). We cross-match the TESS-SPOC FFI Targets with the Gaia DR2 and DR3 catalogues of all targets brighter than Gaia magnitude 14 to understand the effects of sample selection on the overall stellar properties. This includes Gaia magnitude, parallax, radius, temperature, non-single star flags, luminosity, radial velocity and stellar surface gravity. In total, there are $\sim$16.7 million Gaia targets brighter than G=14, which when cross-matched with the TESS-SPOC FFI Targets leaves $\sim$2.75 million. We investigate the binarity of each TESS-SPOC FFI Target and calculate the radius detection limit from two detected TESS transits which could be detected around each target. Finally, we create a comprehensive main sequence TESS-SPOC FFI Target sample which can be utilised in future studies.</description>

      <title>The relationships among solar flare impulsiveness, energy release, and ribbon development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the impulsiveness index, a new classification system for solar flares using the SDO/EVE 304 {\AA} Sun-as-a-star light curves. Impulsiveness classifies events based on the duration and intensity of the initial high-energy deposition of energy into the chromosphere. In stellar flare U-band light curves, Kowalski et al. (2013) found that impulsiveness is related to quantities such as a proxy for the Balmer jump ratio. However, the lack of direct spatial resolution in stellar flares limits our ability to explain this phenomenon. We calculate impulsiveness for 1368 solar flares between 04/2010 and 05/2014. We divide events into categories of low, mid, and high impulsiveness. We find, in a sample of 480 flares, that events with high maximum reconnection rate tend to also have high impulsiveness. For six case studies, we compare impulsiveness to magnetic shear, ribbon evolution, and energy release. We find that the end of the 304 {\AA} light curve rise phase in these case studies corresponds to the cessation of PIL-parallel ribbon motion, while PIL-perpendicular motion persists afterward in most cases. The measured guide field ratio for low and mid-impulsiveness case study flares decreases about an order of magnitude during the impulsive flare phase. Finally, we find that, in four of the six case studies, flares with higher, more persistent shear tend to have low impulsiveness. Our study suggests that impulsiveness may be related to other properties of the impulsive phase, though more work is needed to verify this relationship and apply our findings to stellar flare physics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Standing and Reflected Slow-mode Waves in Flaring Coronal Loops: A Parametric Study Using 2.5D MHD Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of reflected propagating and standing slow-mode waves in hot flaring coronal loops have spurred our investigation into their underlying excitation and damping mechanisms. To understand these processes, we conduct 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations using an arcade active region model that includes a hot and dense loop. Our simulations allow for in-depth parametric investigations complementing and expanding our previous 3D MHD modeling results. We excite these waves in two distinct models as motivated by observations from the SDO/AIA. Model 1 incorporates classical compressive viscosity coefficient, while Model 2 adopts a 10-times enhanced viscosity coefficient. We find that: (1) Our 2.5D MHD simulations reinforce previous conclusions derived from 1D and 3D MHD models that significantly enhanced viscosity is crucial for the rapid excitation of standing slow waves with damping times consistent with observations by Wang et al. (2015). (2) We uncover that nonlinearity in Model 1 delays the conversion of a reflected propagating wave into a standing wave. In contrast, Model 2 exhibits a much weak influence of nonlinearity. (3) Our results reveal that the transverse temperature structure holds more influence on wave behavior than the density structure. In Model 1, increased loop temperature contrast significantly enhances wave trapping within the structure, mitigating the impact of temperature-dependent viscous damping. Conversely, in Model 2, the impact of temperature structure on wave behavior weakens in comparison to the effect of viscosity. (4) Model 1 displays evident nonlinear coupling to the fast and kink magnetoacoustic waves and pronounced wave leakage into the corona. However, analyzing three observed wave events by SDO/AIA aligns with Model 2 predictions, providing further support for the substantial viscosity increase.</description>

      <title>Precise Time-Domain Asteroseismology and a Revised Target List for TESS Solar-Like Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TESS mission has provided a wealth of asteroseismic data for solar-like oscillators. However, these data are subject to varying cadences, large gaps, and unequal sampling, which complicates analysis in the frequency domain. One solution is to model the oscillations in the time domain by treating them as stochastically damped simple harmonic oscillators through a linear combination of Gaussian Process kernels. We demonstrate this method on the well-studied subgiant star nu Indi and a sample of Kepler red giant stars observed by TESS, finding that the time domain model achieves an almost two-fold increase in accuracy for measuring {\nu}max compared to typical frequency domain methods. To apply the method to new detections, we use stellar parameters from Gaia DR3 and the TESS input catalog to calculate revised asteroseismic detection probabilities for all TESS input catalog targets with T&lt;12 mag and a predicted {\nu}max&gt;240{\mu}Hz. We also provide a software tool to calculate detection probabilities for any target of interest. Using the updated detection probabilities we show that time-domain asteroseismology is sensitive enough to recover marginal detections, which may explain the current small number of frequency-based detections of TESS oscillations compared to pre-flight expectations.</description>

      <title>Forecasting SEP Events During Solar Cycles 23 and 24 Using Interpretable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction of the Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events garner increasing interest as space missions extend beyond Earth's protective magnetosphere. These events, which are, in most cases, products of magnetic reconnection-driven processes during solar flares or fast coronal-mass-ejection-driven shock waves, pose significant radiation hazards to aviation, space-based electronics, and particularly, space exploration. In this work, we utilize the recently developed dataset that combines the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager's (SDO/HMI) Space weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Michelson Doppler Imager's (SoHO/MDI) Space Weather MDI Active Region Patches (SMARP). We employ a suite of machine learning strategies, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and regression models, to evaluate the predictive potential of this new data product for a forecast of post-solar flare SEP events. Our study indicates that despite the augmented volume of data, the prediction accuracy reaches 0.7 +- 0.1, which aligns with but does not exceed these published benchmarks. A linear SVM model with training and testing configurations that mimic an operational setting (positive-negative imbalance) reveals a slight increase (+ 0.04 +- 0.05) in the accuracy of a 14-hour SEP forecast compared to previous studies. This outcome emphasizes the imperative for more sophisticated, physics-informed models to better understand the underlying processes leading to SEP events.</description>

      <title>CSS_J154915.7+375506: A low-mass-ratio marginal contact binary system with a hierarchical third body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We presented the multi-filter light curves of CSS_J154915.7+375506 inaugurally, which were observed by the 1.5 m AZT-22 telescope at Maidanak Astronomical Observatory. A low-resolution spectrum obtained by LAMOST reveals it is an A-type close binary. By analyzing the BVRI total-eclipse light curves, we are able to derive a reliable photometric solution for this system, which indicates that CSS_J154915.7+375506 is an extremely low-mass-ratio (q=0.138) marginal contact binary system. The location in the HR diagram shows that its secondary component with a much smaller mass is the more evolved one, indicating the mass ratio reversal occurred. The present secondary component had transferred a significant amount of mass to the present primary one. By the combination of a total of 20 times of minimum, we investigated its O-C curve. A periodic oscillation and a possible period decrease have been detected. As the period decreases, the system will evolve towards the contact phase. This makes CSS\_J154915.7+375506 a valuable case to study the formation scenario of contact binaries through mass reversal. The periodic oscillation suggested a third body with a minimal mass of $0.91\,M_{\odot}$, which is larger than that of the less massive component in the central binary. This implies that the secondary body was not replaced by the third body during early stellar interactions, indicating that it is a fossil system and retains its original dynamical information.</description>

      <title>Ne22 distillation and the cooling sequence of the old metal-rich open cluster NGC 6791</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Monte Carlo plasma simulations to study in crystallizing carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs) the phase separation of Ne22 (the most abundant metal after carbon and oxygen) have shown that, under the right conditions, a distillation process that transports Ne22 toward the WD centre is efficient and releases a considerable amount of gravitational energy that can lead to cooling delays of up to several Gyr. Here we present the first CO WD stellar evolution models that self-consistently include the effect of neon distillation, and cover the full range of CO WD masses, for a progenitor metallicity twice-solar appropriate for the old open cluster NGC 6791. The old age (about 8.5 Gyr) and high metallicity of this cluster -- hence the high neon content (about 3% by mass) in the cores of its WDs -- maximize the effect of neon distillation in the models to be compared with the observed cooling sequence. We discuss the effect of distillation on the internal chemical stratification and cooling time of the models, confirming that distillation causes cooling delays up to several Gyr, that depend in a non-monotonic way on the mass. We also show how our models produce luminosity functions (LFs) that can match the faint end of the observed WD LF in NGC 6791, for ages consistent with the range determined from a sample of cluster's eclipsing binary stars, and the main sequence turn-off. Without the inclusion of distillation the theoretical WD cooling sequences reach too faint magnitudes compared to the observations. We also propose James Webb Space Telescope observations that can independently demonstrate the efficiency of neon distillation in the interiors of NGC 6791 WDs, and help resolve the current uncertainty on the treatment of the electron conduction opacities for the hydrogen-helium envelope of the WD models.</description>

      <title>On Cepheid distances in the $H_0$ measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids were the first stellar standard candles and have played a crucial role for astronomical distance measurements ever since the discovery of the Leavitt law (period-luminosity relation). Enormous improvements in distance accuracy have been achieved since Hertzsprung's first application of Leavitt's law to measure the distance to the Small Magellanic Cloud in 1913, notably in very recent years thanks to a large data set of highly accurate space astrometry from the ESA mission Gaia. Complemented by homogeneous space photometry, Cepheids enable the most accurate distance estimates to galaxies hosting type-Ia supernovae up to approximately 70 Mpc distant. Here, I review the history of Cepheid distance measurements, open questions on the side of stellar astrophysics, and recent studies seeking to quantify and mitigate systematics with a view to further improve the accuracy on the Hubble constant. For example, the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope will enhance precision due to 4x lower sensitivity to source blending in crowded regions and greater sensitivity in dust-insensitive infrared bands. Future 30m-class telescopes could in principle further improve Cepheid distance measurements towards the Hubble flow, if technical challenges related to a continuously evolving instrument can be overcome.</description>

      <title>Radio outburst from a massive (proto)star. III. Unveiling the bipolarity of the radio jet from S255IR NIRS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report new Very Large Array high-resolution observations of the radio jet from the outbursting high-mass star S255IR~NIRS3. The images at 6, 10, and 22.2 GHz confirm the existence of a new lobe emerging to the SW and expanding at a mean speed of ~285 km/s, about half as fast as the NE lobe. The new data allow us to reproduce both the morphology and the continuum spectrum of the two lobes with the model already adopted in our previous studies. We conclude that in all likelihood both lobes are powered by the same accretion outburst. We also find that the jet is currently fading down, recollimating, and recombining.</description>

      <title>New theoretical study of potassium perturbed by He and a comparison to laboratory spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on our new calculations of unified line profiles of K perturbed by He using ab initio potential data for the conditions prevailing in cool substellar brown dwarfs and hot dense planetary atmospheres with temperatures from $T_\mathrm{eff}$=500~$\ \mathrm{K}$ to 3000~$\ \mathrm{K}$. For such objects with atmospheres of H$_2$ and He, conventional laboratory absorption spectroscopy can be used to examine the line wings and test the line shape theories and molecular potentials. We find that an analytical Lorentzian profile is useful for a few cm$^{-1}$ from the line center, but not in the line wings, where the radiative transfer is a consequence of the K-He radiative collisions that are sensitive to the interaction potentials.
  Tables of the K--He absorption coefficients of the resonance lines allow accurate model atmospheres and synthetic spectra. For this purpose, we present new opacities from comprehensive line shape theory incorporating accurate ab initio potentials. Use of these new tables for the modeling of emergent spectra will be an improvement over previous line shape approximations based on incomplete or inaccurate potentials. We also present Lorentzian impact parameters obtained in the semi-classical and quantum theory for the K $4s-4p$ resonance line centered at 0.77~$\mu$m specifically for the line core regime.</description>

      <title>Tight stellar binaries favour active longitudes at sub- and anti-stellar points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar binaries are ubiquitous in the galaxy and a laboratory for astrophysical effects. We use TESS to study photometric modulations in the lightcurves of 162 unequal mass eclipsing binaries from the EBLM (Eclipsing Binary Low Mass) survey, comprising F/G/K primaries and M-dwarf secondaries. We detect modulations on 81 eclipsing binaries. We catalog the rotation rates of the primary star in 69 binaries and discover 17 ellipsoidal variables. In a large portion (at least $\sim 51\%$) of our sample, we detect photometric modulations consistent with two over-densities of spots on the primary star that are roughly $180^{\circ}$ apart. We show that these so-called active longitudes are preferentially at the sub- and anti-stellar points on the primary star. Physically, this means that the spots on the primary star preferentially face directly towards and away from the secondary star.</description>

      <title>Impact of $\alpha$ enhancement on the asteroseismic age determination of field stars. Application to the APO-K2 catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the theoretical biases affecting the asteroseismic grid-based estimates of stellar parameters in the presence of a mismatch between the heavy element mixture of observed stars and stellar models. We performed a controlled simulation adopting effective temperature, [Fe/H], average large frequency spacing, and frequency of maximum oscillation power as observational constraints. Synthetic stars were sampled from grids of stellar models computed with different [alpha/Fe] values from 0.0 to 0.4. The mass, radius, and age of these objects were then estimated by adopting a grid of models with a fixed [alpha/Fe] value of 0.0. The experiment was repeated assuming different sets of observational uncertainties. In the reference scenario, we adopted an uncertainty of 1.5% in seismic parameters, 50 K in effective temperature, and 0.05 dex in [Fe/H]. A higher uncertainty in the atmospheric constraints was also adopted in order to explore the impact on the precision of the observations of the estimated stellar parameters. Our simulations showed that estimated parameters are biased up to 3% in mass, 1.5% in radius, and 4% in age when the reference uncertainty scenario was adopted. These values correspond to 45%, 48%, and 16% of the estimated uncertainty in the stellar parameters. These biases in mass and radius disappear when adopting larger observational uncertainties because of the possibility of the fitting algorithm exploring a wider range of possible solutions. However, in this scenario, the age is significantly biased by -8%. Finally, we verified that the stellar mass, radius, and age can be estimated with a high accuracy by adopting a grid with the incorrect value of [alpha/Fe] if the metallicity [Fe/H] of the target is adjusted to match the Z in the fitting grid. In this scenario, the maximum bias in the age was reduced to 1.5%.</description>

      <title>Final Moments II: Observational Properties and Physical Modeling of CSM-Interacting Type II Supernovae</title>

Abstract: We present ultraviolet/optical/near-infrared observations and modeling of Type II supernovae (SNe II) whose early-time ($\delta t &lt; 2$ days) spectra show transient, narrow emission lines from shock ionization of confined ($r &lt; 10^{15}$ cm) circumstellar material (CSM). The observed electron-scattering broadened line profiles (i.e., IIn-like) of HI, He I/II, C III/IV, and N III/IV/V from the CSM persist on a characteristic timescale ($t_{\rm IIn}$) that marks a transition to a lower-density CSM and the emergence of Doppler-broadened features from the fast-moving SN ejecta. Our sample, the largest to date, consists of 39 SNe with early-time IIn-like features in addition to 35 "comparison" SNe with no evidence of early-time IIn-like features, all with ultraviolet observations. The total sample consists of 50 unpublished objects with 474 previously unpublished spectra and 50 multiband light curves, collected primarily through the Young Supernova Experiment and Global Supernova Project collaborations. For all sample objects, we find a significant correlation between peak ultraviolet brightness and both $t_{\rm IIn}$ and the rise time, as well as evidence for enhanced peak luminosities in SNe II with IIn-like features. We quantify mass-loss rates and CSM density for the sample through matching of peak multiband absolute magnitudes, rise times, $t_{\rm IIn}$ and optical SN spectra with a grid of radiation hydrodynamics and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (nLTE) radiative-transfer simulations. For our grid of models, all with the same underlying explosion, there is a trend between the duration of the electron-scattering broadened line profiles and inferred mass-loss rate: $t_{\rm IIn} \approx 3.8[\dot{M}/(0.01 \textrm{M}_{\odot} \textrm{yr}^{-1})]$ days.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the IRDC G351.77-0.53: Gaia DR3 distance, mass distribution, and star formation content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While intensively studied, it remains unclear how the star formation (SF) in Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) compares to that of nearby clouds. We study G351.77-0.53 (henceforth G351), a cluster-forming filamentary IRDC. We begin by characterizing its young stellar object (YSO) content. Based on the average parallax of likely members, we obtain a Gaia distance of $\sim\,2.0\pm0.14$ kpc, resolving the literature distance ambiguity. Using our Herschel-derived N(H$_2$) map, we measure a total gas mass of 10200 M$_{\odot}$ (within 11 pc$^2$) and the average line-mass profile of the entire filament, which we model as $\lambda =~1660 (w/\rm pc )^{0.62}\,\,M_{\odot}\,\rm{pc}^{-1}$. At $w &lt; 0.63$ pc, our $\lambda$ profile is higher and has a steeper power-law index than $\lambda$ profiles extracted in Orion A and most of its substructures. Based on the YSOs inside the filament area, we estimate the SF efficiency (SFE) and SF rate (SFR). We calculate a factor of 5 incompleteness correction for our YSO catalog relative to Spitzer surveys of Orion A. The G351 SFE is $\sim 1.8$ times lower than that of Orion A and lower than the median value for local clouds. We measure SFR and gas masses to estimate the efficiency per free-fall time, $\epsilon _{\rm ff}$. We find that $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ is $\sim$ 1.1 dex below the previously proposed mean local relation, and $\sim\,4.7\times$ below Orion A. These observations indicate that local SF-relations do not capture variations present in the Galaxy. We speculate that cloud youth and/or magnetic fields might account for the G351 inefficiency.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Coronal Mass Ejections Measured In Situ by Parker Solar Probe During 2018-2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a statistical investigation of the radial evolution of 28 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), measured in situ by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft from 2018 October to 2022 August. First, by analyzing the radial distribution of ICME classification based on magnetic hodograms, we find that coherent configurations are more likely to be observed close to the Sun. In contrast, more complex configurations are observed farther out. We also notice that the post-ICME magnetic field is more impacted following an ICME passage at larger heliocentric distances. Second, with a multi-linear robust regression, we derive a slower magnetic ejecta (ME) expansion rate within 1~au compared to previous statistical estimates. Then, investigating the magnetic field fluctuations within ICME sheaths, we see that these fluctuations are strongly coupled to the relative magnetic field strength gradient from the upstream solar wind to the ME. Third, we identify ME expansion as an important factor in forming sheaths. Finally, we determine the distortion parameter (DiP) which is a measure of magnetic field asymmetry in an ME. We discover lower overall asymmetries within MEs. We reveal that even for expanding MEs, the time duration over which an ME is sampled does not correlate with DiP values, indicating that the aging effect is not the sole contributor to the observed ME asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Targeted optimization in small-scale atomic structure calculations: application to Au I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of reliable atomic data can be a severe limitation in astrophysical modelling, in particular of events such as kilonovae that require information on all neutron-capture elements across a wide range of ionization stages. Notably, the presence of non-orthonormalities between electron orbitals representing configurations that are close in energy can introduce significant inaccuracies in computed energies and transition probabilities. Here, we propose an explicit targeted optimization method that can effectively circumvent this concern while retaining an orthonormal orbital basis set. We illustrate this method within the framework of small-scale atomic structure models of Au I, using the GRASP2018 multiconfigurational Dirac-Hartree-Fock atomic structure code. By comparing to conventional optimization schemes we show how a targeted optimization approach improves the energy level positioning and ordering. Targeted optimization also leads to better agreement with experimental data for the strongest E1 transitions. This illustrates how small-scale models can be significantly improved with minor computational costs if orbital non-orthonormalities are considered carefully. These results should prove useful to multi-element atomic structure calculations in, for example, astrophysical opacity applications involving neutron-capture elements.</description>

      <title>Ices on pebbles in protoplanetary discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of solid macroscopic grains (pebbles) in protoplanetary discs is the first step toward planet formation. We aim to study the distribution of pebbles and the chemical composition of their ice mantles in a young protoplanetary disc. We use the two-dimensional hydrodynamical code FEOSAD in the thin-disc approximation, which is designed to model the global evolution of a self-gravitating viscous protoplanetary disc taking into account dust coagulation and fragmentation, thermal balance, and phase transitions and transport of the main volatiles (H$_2$O, CO$_{2}$, CH$_{4}$ and CO), which can reside in the gas, on small dust ($&lt;1$ $\mu$m), on grown dust ($&gt;1$ $\mu$m) and on pebbles. We model the dynamics of the protoplanetary disc from the cloud collapse to the 500 kyr moment. We determine the spatial distribution of pebbles and composition of their ice mantles and estimate the mass of volatiles on pebbles, grown dust and small dust. We show that pebbles form as early as 50 kyr after the disc formation and exist until the end of simulation (500 kyr), providing prerequisites for planet formation. All pebbles formed in the model are covered by icy mantles. Using a model considering accretion and desorption of volatiles onto dust/pebbles, we find that the ice mantles on pebbles consist mainly of H$_2$O and CO$_{2}$, and are carbon-depleted compared to gas and ices on small and grown dust, which contain more CO and CH$_4$. This suggests a possible dominance of oxygen in the composition of planets formed from pebbles under these conditions.</description>

      <title>Search for giant planets in M67 V: a warm Jupiter orbiting the turn-off star S1429</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets orbiting members of open or globular clusters offer a great opportunity to study exoplanet populations systematically as stars within clusters provide a mostly homogeneous sample at least in chemical composition and stellar age. However, even though there have been coordinated efforts to search for exoplanets in stellar clusters, only a small number of planets has been detected. One successful example is the seven-year radial velocity (RV) survey "Search for giant planets in M67" of 88 stars in the open cluster M67 which led to the discovery of five giant planets, including three close-in ($P &lt; 10$ days) hot-Jupiters. In this work, we continue and extend the observation of stars in M67 with the aim to search for additional planets. We conducted spectroscopic observations with the HPF, HARPS, HARPS-North, and SOPHIE spectrographs of 11 stars in M67. Six of our targets showed a variation or long-term trends in their RV during the original survey, while the other five were not observed in the original sample bringing the total number of stars to 93. An analysis of the radial velocities revealed one additional planet around the turn-off point star S1429 and gave solutions for the orbits of stellar companions around S2207 and YBP2018. S1429 b is a warm Jupiter on a likely circular orbit with a period of $77.48_{-0.19}^{+0.18}$ days and a minimum mass $\text{M} \sin i = 1.80 \pm 0.2$ M$_\text{J}$. We update the hot-Jupiter occurrence rate in M67 to include the five new stars, deriving $4.2_{-2.3}^{+4.1} \%$ when considering all stars, and $5.4_{-3.0}^{+5.1} \%$ if binary star systems are removed.</description>

      <title>Polytropic stellar structure in 5$\mathcal{D}$ Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polytropic stars are useful tools to learn about the stellar structure without the complexity of comprehensive stellar models. These models rely on a certain power-law correlation between the star's pressure and density. This paper proposes a polytropic star model to investigate some new features in the context of $5\mathcal{D}$ Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity using the Finch-Skea {\em ansatz} [{\em M. R. Finch and J. E. Skea, Classical and Quantum Gravity 6, 467 (1989)}]. Analytical results are better described by graphical representations of the physical parameters for various values of the coupling parameter $\alpha$. The solution for a specific compact object, EXO 1785 - 248, with radius $\mathfrak{R} = 8.849_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$ km and mass $\mathcal{M} = 1.3 \pm 0.02~\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$, is shown here. We analyze the essential physical attributes of the star, which reveal the influence of the coupling parameter $\alpha$ on the values of substance parameters. Ultimately, we have concluded that our current model is realistic because it satisfies all the physical criteria for an acceptable model.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distance Method in the Near Infrared. I. HST WFC3/IR F110W and F160W Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB)-based distance method in the I band is one of the most efficient and precise techniques for measuring distances to nearby galaxies (D &lt;= 15 Mpc). The TRGB in the near infrared (NIR) is 1 to 2 magnitudes brighter relative to the I band, and has the potential to expand the range over which distance measurements to nearby galaxies are feasible. Using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of 12 fields in 8 nearby galaxies, we determine color-based corrections and zero points of the TRGB in the Wide Field Camera 3 IR (WFC3/IR) F110W and F160W filters. First, we measure TRGB distances in the I band equivalent Advanced Camera System (ACS) F814W filter from resolved stellar populations with the HST. The TRGB in the ACS F814W filter is used for our distance anchor and to place the WFC3/IR magnitudes on an absolute scale. We then determine the color dependence (a proxy for metallicity/age) and zero point of the NIR TRGB from photometry of WFC3/IR fields which overlap with the ACS fields. The new calibration is accurate to ~1% in distance, relative to the F814W TRGB. Validating the accuracy of the calibrations, we find that the distance modulus for each field using the NIR TRGB calibration agrees with the distance modulus of the same fields as determined from the F814W TRGB. This is a JWST preparatory program and the work done here will directly inform our approach to calibrating the TRGB in JWST NIRCam and NIRISS photometric filters.</description>

Abstract: Evolution of massive stars is dominated by interactions within binary systems. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate all forms of interaction in binary systems that may affect the evolution of the components. One of such laboratories is the massive eccentric binary system MACHO$\,$80.7443.1718 (ExtEV). We examine whether the light variability of the ExtEV can be explained by a wind-wind collision (WWC) binary system model. We conducted an analysis of broadband multi-color photometry of ExtEV, time-series space photometry from TESS, ground-based Johnson $UBV$ photometry, and time-series spectroscopy. We fitted an analytical model of light variations to the TESS light curve of ExtEV. We rule out the possibility of the presence of a disk around the primary component. We also argue that the non-linear wave-breaking scenario may not be consistent with the observations of ExtEV. We refine the orbital parameters of ExtEV and find evidence for the presence of a tertiary component. Using evolutionary models we demonstrate that the primary component's mass is between 25 and 45$\,$M$_\odot$. We successfully reproduce light curve of ExtEV with our model, showing that the dominant processes shaping its light curve are atmospheric eclipse and light scattered in the WWC cone. We also estimate the primary's mass-loss rate due to stellar wind for $4.5\cdot 10^{-5}\,$M$_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. We conclude that ExtEV is not an extreme eccentric ellipsoidal variable, but an exceptional WWC binary system. The mass loss rate we derived exceeds theoretical predictions by up to two orders of magnitude. This implies that the wind is likely enhanced by tidal interactions, rotation, and possibly also tidally excited oscillations. ExtEV represents a rare evolutionary phase of a binary system that may help to understand the role of a companion-driven enhanced mass loss in the evolution of massive binary systems.</description>

      <title>On the maximum black hole mass at solar metallicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high metallicity environments the mass that black holes (BHs) can reach just after core-collapse widely depends on how much mass their progenitor stars lose via winds. On one hand new theoretical and observational insights suggest that early-stage winds should be weaker than what many canonical models prescribe. On the other hand the proximity to the Eddington limit should affect the formation of optically thick envelopes already during the earliest stages of stars with initial masses $M_{\rm ZAMS}\gtrsim 100$ M$_\odot$, hence resulting in higher mass-loss rates during the main sequence. We use the evolutionary codes MESA and Genec to calculate a suite of tracks for massive stars at solar metallicity Z$_\odot=0.014$ which incorporate these changes in our wind mass loss prescription. In our calculations we employ moderate rotation, high overshooting and magnetic angular momentum transport. We find a maximum BH mass $M_{\rm BH, max}=28.3$ M$_\odot$ at Z$_\odot$. The most massive BHs are predicted to form from stars with $M_{\rm ZAMS}\gtrsim 250$ M$_\odot$, with the BH mass directly proportional to its progenitor's $M_{\rm ZAMS}$. We also find in our models that at Z$_\odot$ almost any BH progenitor naturally evolves into a Wolf-Rayet star due to the combined effect of internal mixing and wind mass loss. These results are considerably different from most recent studies regarding the final mass of stars before their collapse into BHs. While we acknowledge the inherent uncertainties in stellar evolution modelling, our study underscores the importance of employing the most up-to-date physics in BH mass predictions.</description>

      <title>Energetic particle activity in AD Leo: Detection of a solar-like type-IV burst</title>

Abstract: AD Leo is a young and active M dwarf with high flaring rates across the X-ray to radio bands. Flares accelerate particles in the outer coronal layers and often impact exospace weather. Wide-band radio dynamic spectra let us explore the evolution of particle acceleration activity across the corona. Identifying the emission features and modelling the mechanisms can provide insights into the possible physical scenarios driving the particle acceleration processes. We performed an 8 h monitoring of AD Leo across the 550 - 850 MHz band using upgraded-Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). A python routine, named VISAD, was built to obtain the visibility averaged wide-band dynamic spectra. Direct imaging was also performed. Based on existing observational results on AD Leo and on solar active region models, radial profiles of electron density and magnetic fields were derived. Applying these models, we explore the possible emission mechanisms and magnetic field structure of the active region. The star displayed high brightness temperature ($\approx 10^{10} - 10^{11}$ K) throughout the observation with nearly 100% left circularly polarised bursts. Post flare phase is characterised by a highly polarised (60 - 80%) solar-like type IV burst confined above 700 MHz.The flare emission favors a Z-mode or a higher harmonic X-mode electron cyclotron maser emission mechanism. The post-flare activity above 700 MHz is consistent with a type-IV radio burst from flare-accelerated particles trapped in magnetic loops, which could be a coronal mass ejection (CME) signature. This is the first solar-like type-IV burst reported on a young active M dwarf belonging to a different age - related activity compared to the Sun. We also find that, a multipole expansion model of the active region magnetic field better accounts for the observed radio emission than a solar-like active region profile.</description>

Abstract: Exoplanets around different types of stars provide a window into the diverse environments in which planets form. This chapter describes the observed relations between exoplanet populations and stellar properties and how they connect to planet formation in protoplanetary disks. Giant planets occur more frequently around more metal-rich and more massive stars. These findings support the core accretion theory of planet formation, in which the cores of giant planets form more rapidly in more solid-rich and more gas-rich protoplanetary disks. Smaller planets, those with sizes roughly between Earth and Neptune, exhibit different scaling relations with stellar properties. These planets orbit stars with a range of metallicities and occur more frequently around lower mass stars, indicating that planet formation takes place in a wide range of environments. Within M dwarfs, both radial velocity and transit surveys show that planets are smaller and located closer to the star when the stellar mass is lower. Additions to the core accretion model, in particular pebble accretion, have shown success in explaining the enhanced planet formation efficiency around low mass stars.</description>

      <title>JASMINE: Near-Infrared Astrometry and Time Series Photometry Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05666</link>

Abstract: Japan Astrometry Satellite Mission for INfrared Exploration (JASMINE) is a planned M-class science space mission by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. JASMINE has two main science goals. One is the Galactic archaeology with Galactic Center Survey, which aims to reveal the Milky Way's central core structure and formation history from Gaia-level (~25 $\mu$as) astrometry in the Near-Infrared (NIR) Hw-band (1.0-1.6 $\mu$m). The other is the Exoplanet Survey, which aims to discover transiting Earth-like exoplanets in the habitable zone from NIR time-series photometry of M dwarfs when the Galactic center is not accessible. We introduce the mission, review many science objectives, and present the instrument concept. JASMINE will be the first dedicated NIR astrometry space mission and provide precise astrometric information of the stars in the Galactic center, taking advantage of the significantly lower extinction in the NIR. The precise astrometry is obtained by taking many short-exposure images. Hence, the JASMINE Galactic center survey data will be valuable for studies of exoplanet transits, asteroseismology, variable stars and microlensing studies, including discovery of (intermediate mass) black holes. We highlight a swath of such potential science, and also describe synergies with other missions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Architectures of S-type Transiting Planets in Binaries I: Target Selection using Hipparcos and Gaia proper motion anomalies</title>

Abstract: The effect of stellar multiplicity on planetary architecture and orbital dynamics provides an important context for exoplanet demographics. We present a volume-limited catalog up to 300 pc of 66 stars hosting planets and planet candidates from Kepler, K2 and TESS with significant Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion anomalies, which indicate the presence of companions. We assess the reliability of each transiting planet candidate using ground-based follow-up observations, and find that the TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) with significant proper motion anomalies show nearly four times more false positives due to Eclipsing Binaries compared to TOIs with marginal proper motion anomalies. In addition, we find tentative evidence that orbital periods of planets orbiting TOIs with significant proper motion anomalies are shorter than those orbiting TOIs without significant proper motion anomalies, consistent with the scenario that stellar companions can truncate planet-forming disks. Furthermore, TOIs with significant proper motion anomalies exhibit lower Gaia differential velocities in comparison to field stars with significant proper motion anomalies, suggesting that planets are more likely to form in binary systems with low-mass substellar companions or stellar companions at wider separation. Finally, we characterize the three-dimensional architecture of LTT 1445 ABC using radial velocities, absolute astrometry from Gaia and Hipparcos, and relative astrometry from imaging. Our analysis reveals that LTT 1445 is a nearly flat system, with a mutual inclination of 2.88 deg between the orbit of BC around A and that of C around B. The coplanarity may explain why multiple planets around LTT 1445 A survive in the dynamically hostile environment of this system.</description>

      <title>The Multi-layer Nature of Molecular Gas toward the Cygnus Region</title>

Abstract: We study the physical properties and 3D distribution of molecular clouds (MCs) toward the Cygnus region using the MWISP CO survey and Gaia DR3 data. Based on Gaussian decomposition and clustering for $\rm ^{13}CO$ lines, over 70% of the fluxes are recovered. With the identification result of $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures, two models are designed to measure the distances of the molecular gas in velocity crowding regions. The distances of more than 200 large $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures are obtained toward the 150 square degree region. Additionally, tens of the identified MC structures coincide well with masers and/or intense mid-IR emission. We find multiple gas layers toward the region: (1) the extensive gas structures composing the Cygnus Rift from 700 pc to 1 kpc across the whole region; (2) the $\sim$ 1.3 kpc gas layer mainly in the Cygnus X South region; and (3) the 1.5 kpc dense filament at the Cygnus X North region and many cometary clouds shaped by Cygnus OB2. We also note that the spatial distribution of YSO candidates is generally consistent with the molecular gas structures. The total molecular mass of the Cygnus region is estimated to be $\sim 2.7\times10^{6}~M_{\odot}$ assuming an X-factor ratio $X_{\rm CO} = 2 \times 10^{20} \rm cm^{-2} (K\cdot km\cdot s^{-1})^{-1}$. The foreground Cygnus Rift contributes $\sim$25% of the molecular mass in the whole region. Our work presents a new 3D view of the MCs distribution toward the Cygnus X region, as well as the exact molecular gas mass distribution in the foreground Cygnus Rift.</description>
