      <title>From empirical brain networks towards modeling music perception -- a perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This perspective article investigates how auditory stimuli influence neural network dynamics using the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model and empirical brain connectivity data. Results show that synchronization is sensitive to both the frequency and amplitude of auditory input, with synchronization enhanced when input frequencies align with the system's intrinsic frequencies. Increased stimulus amplitude broadens the synchronization range governed by a delicate interplay involving the network's topology, the spatial location of the input, and the frequency characteristics of the cortical input signals. This perspective article also reveals that brain activity alternates between synchronized and desynchronized states, reflecting critical dynamics and phase transitions in neural networks. Notably, gamma-band synchronization is crucial for processing music, with coherence peaking in this frequency range. The findings emphasize the role of structural connectivity and network topology in modulating synchronization, providing insights into how music perception engages brain networks. This perspective article offers a computational framework for understanding neural mechanisms in music perception, with potential implications for cognitive neuroscience and music psychology.</description>

      <title>Go Figure: Transparency in neuroscience images preserves context and clarifies interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visualizations are vital for communicating scientific results. Historically, neuroimaging figures have only depicted regions that surpass a given statistical threshold. This practice substantially biases interpretation of the results and subsequent meta-analyses, particularly towards non-reproducibility. Here we advocate for a "transparent thresholding" approach that not only highlights statistically significant regions but also includes subthreshold locations, which provide key experimental context. This balances the dual needs of distilling modeling results and enabling informed interpretations for modern neuroimaging. We present four examples that demonstrate the many benefits of transparent thresholding, including: removing ambiguity, decreasing hypersensitivity to non-physiological features, catching potential artifacts, improving cross-study comparisons, reducing non-reproducibility biases, and clarifying interpretations. We also demonstrate the many software packages that implement transparent thresholding, several of which were added or streamlined recently as part of this work. A point-counterpoint discussion addresses issues with thresholding raised in real conversations with researchers in the field. We hope that by showing how transparent thresholding can drastically improve the interpretation (and reproducibility) of neuroimaging findings, more researchers will adopt this method.</description>

      <title>A stochastic explanation for observed local-to-global foraging states in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abrupt changes in behavior can often be associated with changes in underlying behavioral states. When placed off food, the foraging behavior of C. elegans can be described as a change between an initial local-search behavior characterized by a high rate of reorientations, followed by a global-search behavior characterized by sparse reorientations. This is commonly observed in individual worms, but when numerous worms are characterized, only about half appear to exhibit this behavior. We propose an alternative model that predicts both abrupt and continuous changes to reorientation that does not rely on behavioral states. This model is inspired by molecular dynamics modeling that defines the foraging reorientation rate as a decaying parameter. By stochastically sampling from the probability distribution defined by this rate, both abrupt and gradual changes to reorientation rates can occur, matching experimentally observed results. Crucially, this model does not depend on behavioral states or information accumulation. Even though abrupt behavioral changes do occur, they may not necessarily be indicative of abrupt changes in behavioral states, especially when abrupt changes are not universally observed in the population.</description>
