      <title>Real-Time Reconstruction of Ground Motion During Small Magnitude Earthquakes: A Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a pilot investigation into a novel method for reconstructing real-time ground motion during small magnitude earthquakes (M &lt; 4.5), removing the need for computationally expensive source characterization and simulation processes to assess ground shaking. Small magnitude earthquakes, which occur frequently and can be modeled as point sources, provide ideal conditions for evaluating real-time reconstruction methods. Utilizing sparse observation data, the method applies the Gappy Auto-Encoder (Gappy AE) algorithm for efficient field data reconstruction. This is the first study to apply the Gappy AE algorithm to earthquake ground motion reconstruction. Numerical experiments conducted with SW4 simulations demonstrate the method's accuracy and speed across varying seismic scenarios. The reconstruction performance is further validated using real seismic data from the Berkeley area in California, USA, demonstrating the potential for practical application of real-time earthquake data reconstruction using Gappy AE. As a pilot investigation, it lays the groundwork for future applications to larger and more complex seismic events.</description>

      <title>Quantitative error analysis of back-stripping based models: case study from Po Delta (northern Italy)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical back-stripping procedure is crucial for understanding the geological mechanisms of basin formation or for reconstructing the palaeo-bathymetry in the oceanic regions. However, the importance of errors associated with data acquisition, processing and interpretation is often underestimated. These errors, which can impact the final results, are not part of the computational workflow, although they often affect the model parameters with large uncertainties. In this study, we have qualitatively classified and quantified all the main errors affecting the workflow of the back-stripping technique using linear interpolation and combinatorics. We found that the errors influence different model parameters, some of which have an equiprobability of occurrence, while others are characterized by an intrinsic probability. We applied the proposed method to the Po Delta in northern Italy, historically influenced by anthropogenic and natural subsidence. By studying a 2D geological section characterized by thin Holocene sedimentary successions, we identified 12 sources of error that fall into three basic categories: geometry of the model layers; distribution of lithologies and petrophysical properties; past depositional environments. We then assessed the error ranges and their probability of occurrence. The study shows that the errors can vary significantly from metre- to millimetre-scale, defining the magnitude and distribution of each error source, which is essential for interpreting model results and assessing related uncertainties. It establishes a workflow for future uncertainty management and aims to enhance open-source tools based on the back-stripping procedure.</description>
