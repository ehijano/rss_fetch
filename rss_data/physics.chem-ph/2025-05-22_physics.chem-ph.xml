      <title>Time-dependent density-functional study of intermolecular Coulombic decay for 2a$_1$ ionized water dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A real-space, real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) with Ehrenfest dynamics is used to simulate intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) processes following the ionization of an inner-valence electron. The approach has the advantage of treating both nuclear and electronic motion simultaneously, allowing for the study of electronic excitation, charge transfer, ionization, and nuclear motion. Using this approach, we investigate the decay process for the 2a$_1$ ionized state of the water dimer. For the 2a$_1$ vacancy in the proton donor water molecule, ICD is observed in our simulations. In addition, we have identified a novel dynamical process: at the initial stage, the proton generally undergoes a back-and-forth motion. Subsequently, the system may evolve along two distinct pathways: in one, no proton transfer occurs; in the other, the proton departs again from its original position and ultimately completes the transfer process. In contrast, when the vacancy resides in the proton acceptor water molecule, no proton transfer occurs, and ICD remains the sole decay channel.</description>

      <title>Influences of Uncertainties in Thermodynamic Models on Pareto-optimized Dividing Wall Columns for Ideal Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines the effect of individual and combined uncertainties in thermodynamic models on the performance of simulated, steady-state Pareto-optimized Dividing Wall Columns. It is a follow-up of the previous work analogously treating deviations in process variables. Such deviations and uncertainties that may even be unknown during the design process can significantly influence the separation result. However, other than process variables, uncertainties in thermodynamics are usually not systematically considered during design. For the first time, the effects of uncertain thermodynamic properties on Pareto-optimized DWCs with different numbers of stages and for different mixtures are presented and compared qualitatively and quantitatively. Depending on the number of stages and mixture characteristics, particularly critical properties are identified. On the one hand, this provides information on aspects requiring special attention prior to design, and on the other hand, it also indicates in which section of the DWC a stage supplement might be most beneficial.</description>

      <title>Optimization of fipronil removal via electro-Fenton using a carbon cloth air-diffusion electrode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electro-Fenton (EF) process using a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and a carbon cloth air-diffusion cathode was optimized for efficient fipronil degradation. The system achieved high H2O2 electrogeneration with close to 80% current efficiency operating between 10 and 50 mA cm-2, with hydroxil radicals formed from BDD oxidation and Fenton's reaction that drive pollutant decay. Optimum conditions were found with 0.50 mM Fe2+ catalyst at pH = 3.0 and 30 mA cm-2, yielding almost complete removal for 20 mg L-1 fipronil in 60 min, 85% removal for 10 mg L-1, and a robust performance down to 1 mg L-1, thus reflecting real-world applicability. The system demonstrated excellent reusability and stability over seven consecutive runs. The evolution of final shot-chain linear carboxylic acids like acetic, fumaric, formic, oxalic, and oxamic, and inorganic ions like F-, Cl-, NH4+, was determined. This study highlights the EF process as a highly efficient, energy-balanced, and stable solution for fipronil degradation in water treatment.</description>

      <title>Electro-Fenton treatment of benzophenone-4 solutions: A sustainable approach for its removal using an air-diffusion cathode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports the efficient degradation and mineralization of benzophenone-4 (BP-4), a widely used UV filter associated with endocrine-disrupting effects, via the electro-Fenton process. Key operating parameters including pH, current density, Fe2+ dosage, and initial pollutant concentration were optimized. At pH = 3.0, the best performance was obtained. Under optimum conditions of 20 mA cm-2 and 0.75 mM Fe2+, complete BP-4 degradation was achieved in remarkably short times: 2 min for 1-2.5 mg L-1, 3 min for 5 mg L-1, 4 min for 10 mg L-1, 5 min for 20 mg L-1, and 7 min for 40 mg L-1. Total mineralization was reached for low concentration of 1 mg L-1, varying between 77 and 90% for higher loads up to 40 mg L-1. The reaction followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, with high apparent rate constant of 0.641 min-1 for 40 mg L-1 and lower energy consumption of 0.261 kWh (g TOC)-1. Radical quenching experiments with TBA confirmed that physisorbed BDD(.OH) and homogeneous .OH were the predominant oxidants. Persistent carboxylic acid by-products, in the form of Fe3+ complexes, were the only residues after 180 min of treatment, readily being biodegradable. The process demonstrates high efficiency across a broad range of BP-4 concentrations, offering a viable solution for its removal from contaminated waters.</description>

      <title>Laser cooling Rydberg molecules -- a detailed study of the helium dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The helium dimer in its metastable triplet state is a promising candidate to be the first laser-cooled homonuclear molecule. An ultracold gas of He$_2^*$ would enable a new generation of precision measurements to test quantum electrodynamics for three- and four-electron molecules through Rydberg spectroscopy. Nearly diagonal Franck-Condon factors are obtained because the electron employed for optical cycling occupies a Rydberg orbital that does not take part in the chemical bond. Three possible laser cooling transitions are identified and the spin-rovibronic energy-level structure of the relevant states as well as electronic transition moments, linestrengths, and lifetimes are determined. The production of He$_2^*$ molecules in a supersonic beam is discussed, and a laser slowing scheme to load a magneto-optical trap under such conditions is simulated using a rate equation approach. Various repumping schemes involving one or two upper electronic states are compared to maximize the radiative force. Loss mechanisms such as spin-forbidden transitions, predissociation, and ionization processes are studied and found to not introduce significant challenges for laser cooling and trapping He$_2^*$. The sensitivity of the vibrational levels of He$_2^+$ with respect to the static polarizability of atomic helium is determined and its implications for a new quantum pressure standard are discussed.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the Electronic Configurations of YPc$_2$ on Cu(111): Decoupling Strategies for Molecular Spin Qubits Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among molecular spin qubit candidates, yttrium phthalocyanine double-decker (YPc$_2$) features a diamagnetic metal ion core that stabilizes the molecular structure, while its magnetic properties arise primarily from an unpaired electron (S = 1/2) delocalized over the phthalocyanine (Pc) ligand. Understanding its properties in the proximity of metal electrodes is crucial to assess its potential use in molecular spin qubits architectures. Here, we investigated the morphology and electronic structure of this molecule adsorbed on a metal Cu(111) surface using scanning tunneling microscopy. On that surface, YPc$_2$ adsorbs flat, with isolated molecules showing a preferred orientation along the (111) crystal axes. We observed two different types of self-assembly molecular packing when growing the molecular patches on Cu(111). For YPc$_2$ in direct contact with Cu(111), scanning tunneling spectroscopy revealed a widely separated highest occupied (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO), suggesting the quenching of the unpaired spin. Conversely, when the YPc$_2$ is separated from the substrate by a few-layer thick diamagnetic ZnPc layer, we find the HOMO to split into singly occupied (SOMO) and singly unoccupied molecular orbitals (SUMO). We find that more than 2 layers of ZnPc are needed to avoid intermixing between the two molecules and spin quenching in the YPc$_2$. Density functional theory reveals the spin quenching to be due to the hybridization between YPc$_2$ and Cu(111) states, confirming the importance of using suitable decoupling layers to preserve the unpaired molecular spin. Our results suggest the potential of YPc$_2$/ZnPc heterostructures as a stable and effective molecular spin qubit platform and validates the possibility of integrating this molecular spin qubit candidate in future quantum logic devices.</description>

      <title>Approximations of the Iterative Stockholder Analysis scheme using exponential basis functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce several approximations of the Iterative Stockholder Analysis (ISA) method based on exponential basis functions. These approximations are categorized into linear and non-linear models, referred to as LISA and NLIS, respectively. By particular choices of hyperparameters in the NLIS model, both LISA and the Minimal-Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS) method can be reproduced. Four LISA variants are constructed using systematically generated exponential basis functions derived from the NLIS model applied to atomic systems. The performance of these LISA variants and NLIS models is benchmarked on 15 small molecules, including neutral, anionic, and cationic species. To facilitate comparison, we propose several metrics designed to highlight differences between the methods. Our results demonstrate that LISA, employing Gaussian basis functions derived from the NLIS model on isolated atomic systems, achieves an optimal balance of computational accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, particularly in minimizing the objective function.</description>

      <title>Interactive visualization of large molecular systems with VTX: example with a minimal whole-cell model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: VTX is an open-source molecular visualization software designed to overcome the scaling limitations of existing real-time molecular visualization software when handling massive molecular datasets. VTX employs a meshless molecular graphics engine utilizing impostor-based techniques and adaptive level-of-detail (LOD) rendering. This approach significantly reduces memory usage and enables real-time visualization and manipulation of large molecular systems. Performance benchmarks against VMD, PyMOL, and ChimeraX using a 114-million-bead Martini minimal whole-cell model demonstrate VTX's efficiency, maintaining consistent frame rates even under interactive manipulation on standard computer hardware. VTX incorporates features such as screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO) for enhanced depth perception and free-fly navigation for intuitive exploration of large molecular systems. VTX is open-source and free for non commercial use. Binaries for Windows and Ubuntu Linux are available at http://vtx.drugdesign.fr. VTX source code is available at https://github.com/VTX-Molecular-Visualization.</description>

      <title>Experimental and theoretical investigation on N2 pressure-induced coefficients of the lowest rotational transitions of HCN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first experimental determination of room-temperature N2 pressure broadening, speed dependent broadening, and pressure shift coefficients of the three lowest rotational lines of HCN. The experimental results served to assess the accuracy of a low-cost yet accurate computational strategy, which relies on a simplified characterization of the HCN-N2 interaction potential, and employs a novel approximate method of solving the quantum scattering problem. Building on the validation of this computational approach, the dataset was extended to higher rotational transitions, up to J(HCN)=5-4. For these transitions, we provide the temperature dependence of the pressure broadening coefficient, its speed dependence parameter, and the Dicke narrowing parameter. This new dataset can support and refine the modeling of HCN in both the terrestrial and Titan's atmospheres. This work constitutes an important step towards populating spectroscopic databases with accurate HCN line-shape parameters.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic rules for de novo design of enzymes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enzymes are nano-scale machines that have evolved to drive chemical reactions out of equilibrium in the right place at the right time. Given the complexity and specificity of enzymatic function, bottom-up design of enzymes presents a daunting task that is far more challenging than making passive molecules with specific binding affinities or building nano-scale mechanically active devices. We present a thermodynamically-consistent model for the operation of such a fuelled enzyme, which uses the energy from a favourable reaction to undergo non-equilibrium conformational changes that in turn catalyze a chemical reaction on an attached substrate molecule. We show that enzymatic function can emerge through a bifurcation upon appropriate implementation of momentum conservation on the effective reaction coordinates of the low dimensional description of the enzyme, and thanks to a generically present dissipative coupling. Our results can complement the recently developed strategies for de novo enzyme design based on machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear semiclassical spectroscopy of ultrafast molecular polariton dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16630v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways, which can be used to isolate purely bright state contributions. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to model a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</description>

      <title>Infinite Boundary Terms and Pairwise Interactions: A Unified Framework for Periodic Coulomb Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The introduction of the infinite boundary terms and the pairwise interactions [J. Chem. Theory Comput., 10, 5254, (2014)] enables a physically intuitive approach for deriving electrostatic energy and pressure for both neutral and non-neutral systems under the periodic boundary condition (PBC). For a periodic system consisting of $N$ point charges (with charge $q_j$ located at ${\mathbf r}_j$ where $j=1,2,\cdots N$) and one charge distribution of density $\rho({\mathbf r})$ within a primary cell of volume $V$, the derived electrostatic energy can be expressed as, \[ {\mathcal U} = \sum_{i&lt;j}^N q_iq_j\nu({\mathbf r}_{ij} ) + \sum_{j=1}^N q_j \int_V d{\mathbf r}_0\,\rho({\mathbf r}_0) \nu({\mathbf r}_{0j} ) + \frac{1}{2}\int_V d{\mathbf r}_0 \int_V d{\mathbf r}_1\,\rho({\mathbf r}_0)\rho({\mathbf r}_1) \nu({\mathbf r}_{01}), \] where ${\mathbf r}_{ij}={\mathbf r}_i - {\mathbf r}_j$ is the relative vector and $\nu({\mathbf r})$ represents the effective pairwise interaction under PBC. The charge density $\rho({\mathbf r})$ is free of Delta-function-like divergence throughout the volume but may exhibit discontinuity. This unified formulation directly follows that of the isolated system by replacing the Coulomb interaction $1/\lvert {\mathbf r} \rvert$ or other modified Coulomb interactions with $\nu({\mathbf r})$. For a particular system of one-component plasma with a uniform neutralizing background, the implementation of various pairwise formulations clarifies the contribution of the background and subsequently reveals criteria for designing volume-dependent potentials that preserve the simple relation between energy and pressure.</description>
