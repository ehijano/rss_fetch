      <title>Site-Controlled Purcell-Induced Bright Single Photon Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single photon emitters (SPEs) hosted in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are essential elementary building blocks for enabling future on-chip quantum photonic technologies that operate at room temperature. However, fundamental challenges, such as managing non-radiative decay, competing incoherent processes, as well as engineering difficulties in achieving deterministic placement and scaling of the emitters, limit their full potential. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate large-area arrays of plasmonic nanoresonators for Purcell-induced site-controlled SPEs by engineering emitter-cavity coupling and enhancing radiative emission at room temperature. The plasmonic nanoresonator architecture consists of gold-coated silicon pillars capped with an alumina spacer layer, enabling a 10-fold local field enhancement in the emission band of native hBN defects. Confocal photoluminescence and second-order autocorrelation measurements show bright SPEs with sub-30 meV bandwidth and a saturated emission rate of more than 3.8 million counts per second. We measure a Purcell factor of 4.9, enabling average SPE lifetimes of 480 ps, a five-fold reduction as compared to emission from gold-free devices, along with an overall SPE yield of 21%. Density functional theory calculations further reveal the beneficial role of an alumina spacer between defected hBN and gold, as an insulating layer can mitigate the electronic broadening of emission from defects proximal to gold. Our results offer arrays of bright, heterogeneously integrated quantum light sources, paving the way for robust and scalable quantum information systems.</description>

      <title>High-power femtosecond molecular broadening and the effects of ro-vibrational coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling spectral broadening to higher pulse energies and average powers, respectively, is a critical step in ultrafast science, especially for narrowband Yb based solid state lasers which become the new state of the art. Despite their high nonlinearity, molecular gases as the broadening medium inside hollow core fibers have been limited to 25 W, at best. We demonstrate spectral broadening in nitrogen at ten-fold average powers up to 250W with repetition rates from 25 to 200kHz. The observed ten-fold spectral broadening is stronger compared to the more expensive krypton gas and enables pulse compression from 1.3ps to 120fs. We identified an intuitive explanation for the observed average power scaling based on the density of molecular ro vibrational states of Raman active molecules. To verify this ansatz, spectral broadening limitations in O2 and N2O are experimentally measured and agree well. On these grounds we propose a new perspective on the role, suitability, and limits of stimulated Raman scattering at high average and peak powers. Finally, high harmonic generation is demonstrated at 200 kHz.</description>

      <title>On the Theoretical Analysis of Parametric Amplification of Femtosecond Laser Pulses in Crystals with a Regular Domain Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parametric amplification of ultrashort (femtosecond) laser pulses in crystals with a regular domain structure (RDS) of the 5%Mg : PPLN type has been investigated theoretically. The focus was on the formation of a signal pulse in dependence of the dispersion of the medium and cubic nonlinearity. It is shown that a small deviation of the size of domains from their exact value, determined by the coherent length of nonlinear interaction of optical waves, may increase to a great extent the efficiency of signal-wave generation. The reason is that the phase shifts due to the third-order nonlinearity and dispersion of the medium (as a rule, they affect only the generalized phases of nonlinear wave interaction) may be partially compensated by the influence of the "excess" wave number of nonlinear lattice. The optimal domain sizes, at which the efficiency of signal-wave generation under conditions of self-action and nonstationarity becomes maximum, have been analyzed based on the results obtained.</description>

      <title>Polarimeter optical spectrum analyzer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coherent optical spectrum analyzer is integrated with a rotating quarter wave plate polarimeter. The combined polarimeter optical spectrum analyzer (POSA) allows the extraction of the state of polarization with high spectral resolution. POSA is used in this work to study two optical systems. The first is an optical modulator based on a ferrimagnetic sphere resonator. POSA is employed to explore the underlying magneto-optical mechanism responsible for modulation sideband asymmetry. The second system under study is a cryogenic fiber loop laser, which produces an unequally spaced optical comb. Polarization measurements provide insights on the nonlinear processes responsible for comb creation. Characterizations extracted from POSA data provide guidelines for performance optimization of applications based on these systems under study.</description>

      <title>Design, analysis, and manufacturing of a glass-plastic hybrid minimalist aspheric panoramic annular lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a high-performance glass-plastic hybrid minimalist aspheric panoramic annular lens (ASPAL) to solve several major limitations of the traditional panoramic annular lens (PAL), such as large size, high weight, and complex system. The field of view (FoV) of the ASPAL is 360{\deg}x(35{\deg}~110{\deg}) and the imaging quality is close to the diffraction limit. This large FoV ASPAL is composed of only 4 lenses. Moreover, we establish a physical structure model of PAL using the ray tracing method and study the influence of its physical parameters on compactness ratio. In addition, for the evaluation of local tolerances of annular surfaces, we propose a tolerance analysis method suitable for ASPAL. This analytical method can effectively analyze surface irregularities on annular surfaces and provide clear guidance on manufacturing tolerances for ASPAL. Benefiting from high-precision glass molding and injection molding aspheric lens manufacturing techniques, we finally manufactured 20 ASPALs in small batches. The weight of an ASPAL prototype is only 8.5 g. Our framework provides promising insights for the application of panoramic systems in space and weight-constrained environmental sensing scenarios such as intelligent security, micro-UAVs, and micro-robots.</description>

      <title>Polarization Purity and Dispersion Characteristics of Nested Antiresonant Nodeless Hollow-Core Optical Fiber at Near- and Mid-IR Wavelengths for Quantum Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in quantum communication and sensing require improved optical transmission that ensures excellent state purity and reduced losses. While free-space optical communication is often preferred, its use becomes challenging over long distances due to beam divergence, atmospheric absorption, scattering, and turbulence, among other factors. In the case of polarization encoding, traditional silica-core optical fibers, though commonly used, struggle with maintaining state purity due to stress-induced birefringence. Hollow core fibers, and in particular nested antiresonant fibers (NANF), have recently been shown to possess unparalleled polarization purity with minimal birefringence in the telecom wavelength range using continuous-wave (CW) laser light. Here, we investigate a 1-km NANF designed for wavelengths up to the 2-{\mu}m waveband. Our results show a polarization extinction ratio between ~-30 dB and ~-70 dB across the 1520 to 1620 nm range in CW operation, peaking at ~-60 dB at the 2-{\mu}m design wavelength. Our study also includes the pulsed regime, providing insights beyond previous CW studies, e.g., on the propagation of broadband quantum states of light in NANF at 2 {\mu}m, and corresponding extinction-ratio-limited quantum bit-error rates (QBER) for prepare-measure and entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Our findings highlight the potential of these fibers in emerging applications such as QKD, pointing towards a new standard in optical quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Optical phased array using phase-controlled optical frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed an optical phased array using an optical frequency comb and demonstrated its proof-of-principle. Optical phased arrays have been actively developed in recent years as a technology that can control the wavefront of light without any mechanical devices like phased array radar. Conventional optical phased arrays have been implemented using optical integrated circuits, but it has been difficult to achieve broadband operation with simple control. This is because control and calibration of a large number of phase modulators are required for each wavelength, and the dispersion of the waveguide makes whole bandwidth phase control of ultrashort pulses difficult. In contrast, we have developed a novel optical phased array that realizes wavefront control of ultrashort pulses generated by mode-locked laser by phase control of the comb, using high controllability of the comb and an optical array antenna with free-space optics. This is achieved by simply controlling the ratio of the two radio frequencies of the comb to realize a broadband optical phased array while suppressing environmental fluctuations. Experiments demonstrated broadband optical dot scanning at an optical frequency by forming an optical dot pattern and suppressing the environmental fluctuation by controlling the comb frequency. This innovative optical technology enables direct control of wavefronts by optical frequencies, i.e. controlling transverse modes by longitudinal modes.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous sapphire-supported low-loss photonics platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sapphire is a promising wideband substrate material for visible photonics. It is a common growth substrate for III-nitride light-emitting diodes and laser structures. Doped sapphires are important gain media foundational to the development of titanium-sapphire and ruby lasers. For lasers operating at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, a photonic platform that minimizes loss while maximizing gain material overlap is crucial. Here, we introduce a novel low-loss waveguiding strategy that establishes high-performance integrated photonics on sapphire substrates. This platform achieves a high intrinsic quality factor of 5.6 million near 780 nm and features direct compatibility with a range of solid-state laser gain media.</description>

      <title>Reference-free dual-comb spectroscopy with inbuilt coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a simple system for dual-comb spectroscopy based on two inherently coherent optical frequency combs generated via seeded parametric down-conversion. The inbuilt coherence is established by making the two combs share a common comb line. We show that the inbuilt coherence makes it possible to use a simple numerical post-processing procedure to compensate for small drifts of the dual-comb interferogram arrival-time and phase. This enables long-time coherent averaging of the interferograms.</description>

      <title>Speckle pattern analysis of PVK:rGO composite based memristor device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The memristors are expected to be fundamental devices for neuromorphic systems and switching applications. For example, the device made of a sandwiched layer of poly(N-vinylcarbazole) and reduced graphene composite between asymmetric electrodes (ITO/PVK:rGO/Al) exhibits bistable resistive switching behavior. Depending on the resistance state of the (ON-state or OFF-state) at a constant applied voltage, it may show two different resistivities. The performance of the memristor can be optimized by controlling the doping amount of graphene oxide in the PVK polymer. To assess the performance of the device, when it switches between ON and OFF states, optical characterization approaches are highly promising due to their non-destructive and remote nature. Here, we characterize the memristor device by the use of speckle pattern (SP) analysis. The speckle pattern is the interference of multiple light waves with random relative phases, which is generated via different mechanisms such as scattering from diffusive materials. Therefore, SPs can be used to investigate such samples as they include a huge amount of information to be statistically elaborated. The experimental paradigm includes \textit{in situ} acquisition of SPs of the PVK:rGO in different states followed by statistical post-processing toward examining its conduction mechanism. The variations in these statistical parameters are attributed to the resistance state of the PVK:rGO samples under the applied voltage with regard to the physical switching mechanism of the device. The resistance/conduction state, in turn, depends on the activity and properties of PVK:rGO memristors as well as the additional non-uniformities induced through the variations of density of carriers. The present optical methodology can be potentially served as a bench-top device for characterization purposes of similar devices while they are operating.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Enhancement of Third-order Nonlinearity Measurement in THz Frequency Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article for the first time we applied the eclipse Z-scan technique which is by one order of magnitude more sensitive than the conventional Z-scan technique to measure LiNbO3 crystal nonlinear refractive index in the THz range. The obtained value of LiNbO3 nonlinear refractive index is estimated to be order of 10^-11 cm^2/W which is commensurate with known results. This value correlates with the theoretically calculated nonlinear refractive index coefficient of vibrational nature. The influence of thermal nonlinearity on the experimental results can be neglected, since the estimated temperature induced refractive index change equals to 2.6*10^-5, while addition from optical nonlinearity is 2.9*10^-3. The demonstrated heightened sensitivity of eclipse Z-scan allows to hold promise for the properties evaluation of materials exhibiting lower nonlinear refractive indices, thus expanding its applicability in characterizing diverse nonlinear optical materials.</description>

      <title>Entangled photon pair generation from an epsilon-near-zero metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled photon pair sources are essential for diverse quantum technologies, such as quantum communication, computation, and imaging. Currently, most methods for generating and manipulating entangled photon pairs rely on bulk nonlinear crystals, with some requiring sophisticated engineering. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a 68-nm-thick entangled photon pair source using a plasmonic metasurface strongly coupled to an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) material. By tailoring dual resonances at both pump and emission wavelengths and utilizing the field enhancement induced by the ENZ effect, the photon pair generation efficiency is boosted. The coincidences-to-accidentals ratio of the generated photon pairs reaches 40, well above the limit of classical light radiation. Moreover, the ENZ metasurface platform enables versatile manipulation of the system's anisotropic second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, allowing for direct control over the polarization states of the generated photon pairs. By conducting polarization-resolved second-harmonic generation measurements, we discuss the potential to achieve a polarization-entangled Bell state from the identical ENZ metasurface, based on the quantum-classical correspondence. Our approach opens a new avenue for simultaneously achieving the miniaturization of photon pair sources and quantum state engineering.</description>

      <title>Flexible terahertz metasurface absorbers empowered by bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz absorbers are crucial to the cutting-edge techniques in the next-generation wireless communications, imaging, sensing, and radar stealth, as they fundamentally determine the performance of detectors and cloaking capabilities. It has long been a pressing task to find absorbers with customizable performance that can adapt to various environments with low cost and great flexibility. Here, we demonstrate perfect absorption empowered by bound states in the continuum (BICs) allowing for the tailoring of absorption coefficient, bandwidth, and field of view. The one-port absorbers are interpreted using temporal coupled-mode theory highlighting the dominant role of BICs in the far-field radiation properties. Through a thorough investigation of BICs from the perspective of lattice symmetry, we unravel the radiation features of three BIC modes using both multipolar and topological analysis. The versatile radiation capabilities of BICs provide ample freedom to meet specific requirements of absorbers, including tunable bandwidth, stable performance in a large field of view, and multi-band absorption using a thin and flexible film without extreme geometric demands. Our findings offer a systematic approach to developing optoelectronic devices and demonstrate the significant potential of BICs for optical and photonic applications which will stimulate further studies on terahertz photonics and metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>High-finesse nanofiber Fabry-Per\'{o}t resonator in a portable storage container</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present characterization and storage methods for a high-finesse nanofiber Fabry-Per\'{o}t resonator. Reflection spectroscopy from both ends of the resonator allows for evaluation of the mirror transmittances and optical loss inside the resonator. To maintain the quality of the nanofiber resonator after the fabrication, we have developed a portable storage container. By filling the container with dry, clean nitrogen gas, we can prevent contamination of the nanofiber during storage. This approach allows us to minimize the additional optical loss to less than 0.08% over a week. The portable container facilitates both the fabrication and subsequent experimentation with the resonator in different locations. This flexibility expands the range of applications, including quantum optics, communication, and sensing.</description>

      <title>A compact and open-source microcontroller-based rapid auto-alignment system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maintaining stable and precise alignment of a laser beam is crucial in many optical setups. In this work, we present a microcontroller-based rapid auto-alignment system that detects and corrects for drifts in a laser beam trajectory using a pair of two-dimensional duo-lateral position sensing detectors (PSDs) and a pair of mirror mounts with piezoelectric actuators. We develop hardware and software for interfacing with the PSDs and for controlling the motion of the piezoelectric mirrors mounts. Our auto-alignment strategy -- implemented as a state machine on the microcontroller by a FreeRTOS kernel -- is based on a simple linearized geometrical optical model. We benchmark our system using the standard case of coupling laser light efficiently into the guided mode of a single-mode fiber optic patch cable. We can recover the maximum fiber coupling efficiency in $\sim10$ seconds, even for a laser beam that was misaligned to the point of zero fiber coupling.</description>

Abstract: Surrogate neural network-based partial differential equation (PDE) solvers have the potential to solve PDEs in an accelerated manner, but they are largely limited to systems featuring fixed domain sizes, geometric layouts, and boundary conditions. We propose Specialized Neural Accelerator-Powered Domain Decomposition Methods (SNAP-DDM), a DDM-based approach to PDE solving in which subdomain problems containing arbitrary boundary conditions and geometric parameters are accurately solved using an ensemble of specialized neural operators. We tailor SNAP-DDM to 2D electromagnetics and fluidic flow problems and show how innovations in network architecture and loss function engineering can produce specialized surrogate subdomain solvers with near unity accuracy. We utilize these solvers with standard DDM algorithms to accurately solve freeform electromagnetics and fluids problems featuring a wide range of domain sizes.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping cascaded random matrix models: correlations in permutations of matrix products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory is a useful tool in the study of the physics of multiple scattering systems, often striking a balance between computation speed and physical rigour. Propagation of waves through thick disordered media, as arises in for example optical scattering or electron transport, typically necessitates cascading of multiple random matrices drawn from an underlying ensemble for thin media, greatly increasing computational burden. Here we propose a dual pool based bootstrapping approach to speed up statistical studies of scattering in thick random media. We examine how potential matrix reuse in a pool based approach can impact statistical estimates of population averages. Specifically, we discuss how both bias and additional variance in the sample mean estimator are introduced through bootstrapping. In the diffusive scattering regime, the extra estimator variance is shown to originate from samples in which cascaded transfer matrices are permuted matrix products. Through analysis of the combinatorics and cycle structure of permutations we quantify the resulting correlations. Proofs of several analytic formulae enumerating the frequency with which correlations of different strengths occur are derived. Extension to the ballistic regime is briefly considered.</description>

      <title>Laser wakefield acceleration of ions with a transverse flying focus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extreme electric fields created in high-intensity laser-plasma interactions could generate energetic ions far more compactly than traditional accelerators. Despite this promise, laser-plasma accelerators have remained stagnant at maximum ion energies of 100 MeV/nucleon for the last twenty years. The central challenge is the low charge-to-mass ratio of ions, which has precluded one of the most successful approaches used for electrons: laser wakefield acceleration. Here we show that a laser pulse with a focal spot that moves transverse to the laser propagation direction enables wakefield acceleration of ions to GeV energies in underdense plasma. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that this relativistic-intensity "transverse flying focus" can trap ions in a comoving electrostatic pocket, producing a monoenergetic collimated ion beam. With a peak intensity of $10^{20}\,$W/cm$^2$ and an acceleration distance of $0.44\,$cm, we observe a proton beam with $23.1\,$pC charge, $1.6\,$GeV peak energy, and $3.7\,$% relative energy spread. This approach allows for compact high-repetition-rate production of high-energy ions, highlighting the capability of more generalized spatio-temporal pulse shaping to address open problems in plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Modular plasmonic nanopore for opto-thermal gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state nanopore gating inspired by biological ion channels is gaining increasing traction due to a large range of applications in biosensing and drug delivery. Integration of stimuli-responsive molecules such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) inside nanopores can enable temperature-dependent gating, which so far has only been demonstrated using external heaters. In this work, we combine plasmonic resonators inside the nanopore architecture with PNIPAM to enable optical gating of individual or multiple nanopores with micrometer resolution and a switching speed of few milliseconds by thermo-plasmonics. We achieve a temperature change of 40 kelvin per millisecond and demonstrate the efficacy of this method using nanopore ionic conductivity measurements that enables selective activation of individual nanopores in an array. Moreover, the selective gating of specific nanopores in an array can set distinct ionic conductance levels: low, medium, and high (i.e., 0, 1, and 2), which could be exploited for logical gating with optical signal control. Such selective optical gating in nanopore arrays marks a breakthrough in nanofluidics, as it paves the way towards smart devices that offer multifunctional applications including biosensing, targeted drug delivery, and fluidic mixing.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical effects of photon-phonon antibunching in a multifield driven optomechanical cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonclassical signature of a photon-phonon pair can be tested effectively by violating Cauchy-Schwarz and Bell's inequality, which can arise due to antibunching phenomena in coupled bosonic systems. In this paper, we analyze the measurement criteria imposed on the second-order coherence functions and investigate the quantum correlations leading to the suppression of multi-photon-phonon excitation in a single optomechanical cavity upon driving it with two pumping fields. It is also shown that the Cauchy-Schwarz violation can serve as an ideal precursor to demonstrate stronger tests of locality related to Bell's inequality. We consider weak driving and optomechanical coupling coefficient parameters in the system that enables the unconventional nature of photon (phonon) blockades while operating in the resonance of cavity detuning and mechanical frequency. These findings are valuable for generating sub-Poissonian signals in optimal conditions and have potential applications in hybrid systems for on-demand single photon (phonon) detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms exhibit remarkable sensitivity to electromagnetic fields, making them promising candidates for revolutionizing field sensors. Unlike conventional antennas, they neither disturb the measured field nor necessitate intricate calibration procedures. In this study, we propose a protocol for signal reception near the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band, harnessing the capabilities of warm Rydberg atoms. Our focus lies on exploring various quadrature amplitude modulations and transmission frequencies through heterodyne detection. We offer a comprehensive characterization of our setup, encompassing the atomic response frequency range and attainable electric field amplitudes. Additionally, we delve into analyzing communication errors using Voronoi diagrams, along with evaluating the communication channel capacity across different modulation schemes. Our findings not only lay the groundwork for future wireless communication applications, but also present opportunities to refine protocols in classical communication and field sensing domains.</description>

      <title>Long-range self-hybridized exciton polaritons in two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskites have emerged as platforms for exciton-polaritonic studies at room temperature thanks to their excellent photoluminescence efficiency and synthetic versatility. In this work we find proof of strong exciton-photon coupling in cavities formed by the layered crystals themselves, a phenomenon known as self-hybridization effect. We use multi-layers of high quality Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites in their 2D crystalline form, benefitting from their quantum-well excitonic resonances and the strong Fabry-Perot cavity modes resulting from the total-internal-reflection at their smooth surfaces. Optical spectroscopy reveals bending of the cavity modes typical for exciton-polariton formation, and photoluminescence spectroscopy shows thickness dependent splitting of the excitonic resonance. Strikingly, local optical excitation with energy below the excitonic resonance of the flakes in photoluminescence measurements unveils coupling of light to in-plane polaritonic modes with directed propagation. These exciton-polaritons exhibit high coupling efficiencies and extremely low loss propagation mechanisms which is confirmed by finite difference time domain simulations. We therefore prove that mesoscopic 2D Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites flakes represent an effective but simple system to study the rich physics of exciton-polaritons at room temperature.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate and verify the in-situ addition of a collecting lens for electroluminescence experiments to an existing scanning tunneling microscope. We fabricate a simple clip-on lens that we reversibly attach at the sample plate via regular sample transfer tools to collimate the light emitted from a plasmonic tunneling junction to the viewport ordinarily used for optical access. The proximity of the lens to the tunneling junction allows us to exploit the full numerical aperture which helps us achieve good collection efficiencies, demonstrating the quick turnaround of converting an existing setup with optical access into a practical scanning luminescence microscope. We verify the function of the clip-on lens by measuring the bias dependent plasmon of Au, Ag, and spatial luminescence maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a mathematical theory for Dirac points and interface modes in honeycomb topological photonic structures consisting of impenetrable obstacles. Starting from a honeycomb lattice of obstacles attaining $120^\circ$-rotation symmetry and horizontal reflection symmetry, we apply the boundary integral equation method to show the existence of Dirac points for the first two bands at the vertices of the Brillouin zone. We then study interface modes in a joint honeycomb photonic structure, which consists of two periodic lattices obtained by perturbing the honeycomb one with Dirac points differently. The perturbations break the reflection symmetry of the system, as a result, they annihilate the Dirac points and generate two structures with different topological phases, which mimics the quantum valley Hall effect in topological insulators. We investigate the interface modes that decay exponentially away from the interface of the joint structure in several configurations with different interface geometries, including the zigzag interface, the armchair interface, and the rational interfaces. Using the layer potential technique and asymptotic analysis, we first characterize the band-gap opening for the two perturbed periodic structures and derive the asymptotic expansions of the Bloch modes near the band gap surfaces. By formulating the eigenvalue problem for each joint honeycomb structure using boundary integral equations over the interface and analyzing the characteristic values of the associated boundary integral operators, we prove the existence of interface modes when the perturbation is small.</description>

Abstract: The identification of prospective scenarios for observing quantum vacuum signals in high-intensity laser experiments requires both accurate theoretical predictions and the exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces. Numerical simulations address the first requirement, while optimization provides an efficient solution for the second one. In the present work, we demonstrate the potential of Bayesian optimization in maximizing photonic quantum vacuum signals on the example of two-beam collisions. This allows us to find the optimal waist sizes for beams with elliptic cross sections, and to identify the specific physical process leading to a discernible signal in a coherent harmonic focusing configuration scenario.</description>

Abstract: High-dimensional quantum key distribution (HDQKD) is a promising avenue to address the inherent limitations of basic QKD protocols. However, experimental realizations of HDQKD to date have relied on indeterministic photon sources that limit the achievable key rate. In this paper, we demonstrate a full emulation of a HDQKD system using a single colloidal giant quantum dot (gQD) as a deterministic, compact and room-temperature single-photon source (SPS). We demonstrate a practical protocol by encoding information in a high-dimensional space ($d = 3$) of the orbital angular momentum of the photons. Our experimental configuration incorporates two spatial light modulators for encoding and decoding the spatial information carried by individual photons. Our experimental demonstration establishes the feasibility of utilizing high radiative quantum yield gQDs as practical SPSs for HDQKD. We also demonstrate experimentally secure qudit transmission exceeding one secure bit per photon, thus already beating the traditional d=2 QKD capacity.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that in situ coherent diffractive imaging (CDI), which harnesses the coherent interference between a strong and a weak beam illuminating a static and dynamic structure, can be a very dose-efficient imaging method. At low doses, in situ CDI can achieve higher resolution than perfect lenses with the point spread function as a delta function. Both our numerical simulation and experimental results show that the combination of in situ CDI and ptychography can reduce the dose by two orders of magnitude over ptychography. We expect that computational microscopy based on in situ CDI can be implemented in different imaging modalities with photons and electrons for low-dose imaging of radiation-sensitive materials and biological samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active metasurfaces have recently emerged as compact, lightweight, and efficient platforms for dynamic control of electromagnetic fields and optical responses. However, the complexities associated with their post-fabrication tunability significantly hinder their widespread applications, especially for the mid-infrared range due to material scarcity and design intricacy. Here, we experimentally demonstrate highly dynamic, pixelated modulations of coherent mid-infrared emission based on an electrically programmable plasmonic metasurface integrated with graphene field effect transistors (Gr-FETs). The ultrabroad infrared transparency of graphene allows for free-form control over plasmonic meta-atoms, thus achieving coherent mid-infrared states across a broad range of wavelengths and polarizations. The spatial temperature modulation generated by Gr-FETs is effectively synergized with the emissivity control by the localized surface plasmon polaritons from gold nanoantennas. This integrated temperature-emissivity modulation of metasurfaces is systematically extended to form a pixelated 2D array, envisioning new approaches toward scalable 2D electrical wiring for densely packed, independently controlled pixels.</description>

      <title>Tunable Multimodal Guided Surface Lattice Resonances in Index-Discontinuous Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface lattice resonances (SLRs) in metasurfaces are promising in applications of sub-wavelength devices.Tunable and multimodal SLRs further enhance their appeal for flexible and multi-wavelength light-matter interactions. While multimodal SLRs offer promising properties, their realization often requires sophisticated designs, leading to limited tunability. Furthermore, current high-Q SLR implementations necessitate a homogeneous index in the operational environment, restricting potential applications such as biosensors that are typically operated in an aqueous or air cladding on a substrate. Here we present guided-SLRs (gSLRs) that are easily accessible in index-discontinuous environments, offering multimodal properties and straightforward tunability of resonances wavelengths, mode number, and mode coupling strengths. The gSLRs are achieved by coupling scattered light from metasurface units into a slab waveguide, creating a light ropagating channel in the lattice plane within an index-asymmetric environment. Tailoring the radiation pattern of individual units with guided transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, multimodal resonances in both orthogonal and parallel coupling directions are accomplished. Mode number and mode frequency positions can be easily controlled by adjusting the waveguide configuration, while mode strength is tuned by vertical positions of lattices in the slab. Multimodal gSLRs with strong intensities and tunable ositions extending from visible to near-infrared range are achieved when compose metasurfaces with gold nanoparticle-on-mirror (NPoM) cavities. This easy-to-access, actively tunable and multimodal gSLR in inhomogeneous mediums will advance the realization of ultrathin and ultracompact nano-optical and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>The Quadruplon in a Monolayer Semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.12760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure of matter or materials and interaction or correlations among the constituent elementary particles are the central tasks of all branches of science, from physics, chemistry, to biology. In physics, this ultimate goal has spurred a constant search for high-order correlated entities or composite particles for nearly all states and forms of matter, from elementary particles, nuclei, cold atoms, to condensed matter. So far, such composite particles involving two or three constituent particles have been experimentally identified, such as the Cooper pairs, excitons, and trions in condensed matter physics, or diquarks and mesons in quantum chromodynamics. Although the four-body irreducible entities have long been predicted theoretically in a variety of materials systems alternatively as quadruplons, quadrons, or quartets, the closely related experimental observation so far seems to be restricted to the field of elementary particles (e.g. the recent tetraquark at CERN) only. In this article, we present the first experimental evidence for the existence of a four-body irreducible entity, the quadruplon, involving two electrons and two holes in a monolayer of Molybdenum Ditelluride. Using the optical pump-probe technique, we discovered a series of new spectral features that are distinct from those of trions and bi-excitons. By solving the four-body Bethe-Salpeter equation in conjunction with the cluster expansion approach, we are able to explain these spectral features in terms of the four-body irreducible cluster or the quadruplons. In contrast to a bi-exciton which consists of two weakly bound excitons, a quadruplon consists of two electrons and two holes without the presence of an exciton.</description>

Abstract: We have developed a theory of parametric photon generation in the waveguides coupled to arrays of quantum emitters with temporally modulated resonance frequencies. Such generation can be interpreted as a dynamical Casimir effect. We demonstrate numerically and analytically how the emission directionality and photon-photon correlations can be controlled by the phases of the modulation. The emission spectrum is shown to be strongly dependent on the anharmonicity of the emitter potential. Single- and double-excited state resonances have been identified in the emission spectrum.</description>

      <title>Quantum trapping and rotational self-alignment in triangular Casimir microcavities</title>

Abstract: Casimir torque -- a rotational motion caused by the minimization of the zero-point energy -- is a problem that attracts significant theoretical and experimental interest. Recently, it has been realized using liquid crystal phases and natural anisotropic substrates. However, for natural materials, the torque reaches substantial values only at van der Waals distances of ~10 nm. Here, we employ Casimir self-assembly using templated gold nanostructures of triangular symmetry for the purpose of rotational self-alignment at truly Casimir distances (100 -- 200 nm separation). The joint action of repulsive electrostatic and attractive Casimir potentials leads to the formation of a stable quantum trap, giving rise to a tunable Fabry-Perot microcavity. This cavity self aligns both laterally and rotationally to maximize the overlap area between the templated and floating triangular flakes. The rotational self-alignment is remarkably sensitive to the equilibrium distance between the two triangles as well as their area, which opens possibilities for active control through manipulating the electrostatic screening. Our self-assembled and self-aligned Casimir microcavities could find future use as a versatile and tunable platform for nanophotonic, polaritonic, and optomechanical applications.</description>

      <title>Testing Bell-CHSH Inequalities Using topological Aharonov-Casher and He-McKellar-Wilkens Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of Aharonov-Casher (AC) and He-McKellar-Wilkens (HMW) phases on entangled spin-1/2 quantum systems are investigated. We use linear charge distributions positioned at the center of resulting closed orbits, capitalizing on Mach Zender-type interferometers modified with phase retarders to unveil the topological effects. We analyze how AC-HMW phases influence the Bell angles and maximal violation of Bell-CHSH inequalities (BI) without any classical interaction. We incorporate the spin and path of particles in the interferometers as observables to test noncontextual hidden variable theories against quantum mechanics, leveraging the non-local features of AC-HMW effects. Furthermore, we discuss potential implementations of our scheme in physical systems.</description>

      <title>General protocols for the efficient distillation of indistinguishable photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14217</link>

Abstract: Highly pure and indistinguishable photons are a prerequisite for use in quantum information processing. We introduce protocols for the distillation of indistinguishable photons that offer a significant improvement over previous work, reducing distinguishability error rates by a factor of $n$, with resource requirements scaling linearly in $n$. We present the protocols, based on the discrete Fourier transform, Hadamard (Sylvester) matrices, and more general Fourier transforms on finite abelian groups, then give both analytical and numerical results regarding their performance. We observe that the same symmetry properties governing suppression laws are instrumental in understanding the behavior of these distillation protocols. We also prove that for the $n$-photon discrete Fourier transform, the suppression laws are exactly characterized by the well-known Zero Transmission Law based on permutation symmetry if and only if $n$ is a prime power.</description>

      <title>Correcting directional dark-field x-ray imaging artefacts using position-dependent image deblurring and attenuation removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, a novel x-ray imaging modality has emerged that reveals unresolved sample microstructure via a "dark-field image", which provides complementary information to conventional "bright-field" images, such as attenuation and phase-contrast modalities. This x-ray dark-field signal is produced by unresolved microstructures scattering the x-ray beam resulting in localised image blur. Dark-field retrieval techniques extract this blur to reconstruct a dark-field image. Unfortunately, the presence of non-dark-field blur such as source-size blur or the detector point-spread-function can affect the dark-field retrieval as they also blur the experimental image. In addition, dark-field images can be degraded by the artefacts induced by large intensity gradients from attenuation and propagation-based phase contrast, particularly around sample edges. By measuring any non-dark-field blurring across the image plane and removing it from experimental images, as well as removing attenuation and propagation-based phase contrast, we show that a directional dark-field image can be retrieved with fewer artefacts and more consistent quantitative measures. We present the details of these corrections and provide "before and after" directional dark-field images of samples imaged at a synchrotron source. This paper utilises single-grid directional dark-field imaging, but these corrections have the potential to be broadly applied to other x-ray imaging techniques.</description>

      <title>Configurable Learned Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of advancing holographic display technology, we face a unique yet persistent roadblock: the inflexibility of learned holography in adapting to various hardware configurations. This is due to the variances in the complex optical components and system settings in existing holographic displays. Although the emerging learned approaches have enabled rapid and high-quality hologram generation, any alteration in display hardware still requires a retraining of the model. Our work introduces a configurable learned model that interactively computes 3D holograms from RGB-only 2D images for a variety of holographic displays. The model can be conditioned to predefined hardware parameters of existing holographic displays such as working wavelengths, pixel pitch, propagation distance, and peak brightness without having to retrain. In addition, our model accommodates various hologram types, including conventional single-color and emerging multi-color holograms that simultaneously use multiple color primaries in holographic displays. Notably, we enabled our hologram computations to rely on identifying the correlation between depth estimation and 3D hologram synthesis tasks within the learning domain for the first time in the literature. We employ knowledge distillation via a student-teacher learning strategy to streamline our model for interactive performance. Achieving up to a 2x speed improvement compared to state-of-the-art models while consistently generating high-quality 3D holograms with different hardware configurations.</description>
