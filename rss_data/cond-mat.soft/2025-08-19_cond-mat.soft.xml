      <title>Effect of Magnetic Field on Neutral Bath Containing Charged Brownian Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the Zwanzig-Caldeira-Legget theory generalized to systems under the influence of a static magnetic field, we obtain equations of motion for the Brownian particle (BP) and oscillators constituting the bath in which the BP is embedded. The equations are of the type of a generalized Langevin equation, which accounts for the frictional memory of the system. The BP is assumed to be charged while the bath particles are neutral. They thus do not directly respond to the external field, but their interaction with the BP leads to changes in the bath state. Using the solution of the equations found, we calculate the average bath angular momentum and show that it persists for long times when the system is assumed to reach equilibrium. This indicates a possible violation of the Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem for baths consisting of charged particles. However, this must be confirmed by a substantial generalization of the presented model when the bath particles feel the external field, which affects the memory in the dynamics of the system.</description>

      <title>Collective ballistic motion explains fast aggregation in adhesive active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by motile cells during tissue formation, we identify a mechanism by which active systems of self-aligning adhesive particles undergo ballistic aggregation via a flocking transition. This kinetic regime emerges when the cluster persistence length grows faster with cluster mass than the intercluster distance does. We also characterize and explain the emergence of distinct non-collective kinetic regimes, including long-lived transients relevant to biological systems. Our results provide a unified framework consistent with the broad range of aggregation exponents experimentally observed in cellular systems and uncover physical principles which may enable timely tissue organization</description>

      <title>Granular focused jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the formation of granular focused jets defined as narrow upward ejections of grains triggered by impulsive forces and shaped by kinematic focusing on a concave free surface. The jets were generated from nonfluidized granular beds, in contrast to existing granular Worthington jets that originate from fluidized layers. To elucidate the jet dynamics, we performed experiments in which a test tube partially filled with dry glass beads was dropped onto a flat rigid floor, systematically varying the granular pile height$L_{\rm G}$, drop height $H$, and particle size. The resulting jet formation in granular media was driven by the same kinematic focusing mechanism responsible for jetting in liquids. By conducting parallel experiments using low-viscosity silicone oil under identical conditions, we directly compared the granular and liquid jets. At low pile heights, the granular jet velocity quantitatively agreed with the liquid jet velocity. However, at high pile heights, contrasting trends emerged. Specifically, the granular jet velocity decreased with increasing $L_{\rm G}$, while the liquid jet velocity increased due to cavitation. Discrete element method simulations confirmed that the velocity reduction in granular jets arose from energy dissipation via grain--grain contacts during impact force propagation. These findings highlight common mechanisms and distinctive dissipation behaviors in granular and liquid focused jets.</description>

      <title>Colloidal hydrodynamic interactions in viscoelastic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11948v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of suspended colloidal particles generates fluid disturbances in the surrounding medium that create interparticle interactions. While such colloidal hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) have been extensively studied in viscous Newtonian media, comprehensive understanding of HIs in viscoelastic fluids is lacking. We develop a framework to quantify HIs in viscoelastic fluids with high spatiotemporal precision by trapping colloids and inducing translation-rotation hydrodynamic coupling. Using solutions of wormlike micelles (WLMs) as a case study, we discover that HIs are strongly time-dependent and depend on the structural memory generated in the viscoelastic fluid, in contrast to "instantaneous" HIs in viscous Newtonian fluids. We directly measure time-dependent HIs between a stationary probe and a driven particle during transient start-up, developing on the WLM relaxation timescale. Following the sudden cessation of the driven particle, we observe an intriguing flow reversal in the opposing direction, lasting for a time about ten times larger than the WLM relaxation time. We corroborate our observations with analytical microhydrodynamic theory, direct numerical solutions of a continuum model, and particle-based Stokesian dynamics simulations. We find that the structural recovery of the WLMs from a nonlinear strain can generate anisotropic and heterogeneous stresses that produce flow reversals and hydrodynamic attraction among colloids. Measured heterogeneities indicate a breakdown of standard continuum models for constitutive relations when the size of colloids is comparable to the length scales of the polymeric constituents and their entanglement lengths.</description>

      <title>Generalized invariants meet constitutive neural networks: A novel framework for hyperelastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12063v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The major challenge in determining a hyperelastic model for a given material is the choice of invariants and the selection how the strain energy function depends functionally on these invariants. Here we introduce a new data-driven framework that simultaneously discovers appropriate invariants and constitutive models for isotropic incompressible hyperelastic materials. Our approach identifies both the most suitable invariants in a class of generalized invariants and the corresponding strain energy function directly from experimental observations. Unlike previous methods that rely on fixed invariant choices or sequential fitting procedures, our method integrates the discovery process into a single neural network architecture. By looking at a continuous family of possible invariants, the model can flexibly adapt to different material behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using popular benchmark datasets for rubber and brain tissue. For rubber, the method recovers a stretch-dominated formulation consistent with classical models. For brain tissue, it identifies a formulation sensitive to small stretches, capturing the nonlinear shear response characteristic of soft biological matter. Compared to traditional and neural-network-based models, our framework provides improved predictive accuracy and interpretability across a wide range of deformation states. This unified strategy offers a robust tool for automated and physically meaningful model discovery in hyperelasticity.</description>

      <title>Dynamic-Kinetic Duality of Particulate and Multiphase Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12088v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of particulate and multiphase systems can transition from dynamic regimes, governed by classical transport equations with well-defined damping coefficients, to anomalously slow relaxation described by rate equations when the system is critically close to equilibrium. This regime crossover has been both theoretically predicted and experimentally observed in diverse multiphase systems relevant to numerous technological applications, including nanoparticle adhesion at interfaces and liquid imbibition under microscale confinement, and it is attributed to the presence of small nanoscale features of physical or chemical nature at liquid-solid interfaces. This article presents a theoretical framework to more accurately predict and control, advancing or delaying, the dynamic-to-kinetic regime crossover, and highlights strategies for harnessing this phenomenon to enhance or suppress different transport processes in confined multiphase systems.</description>

      <title>Steering chiral active Brownian motion via stochastic position-orientation resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guiding active motion is important for targeted delivery, sensing, and search tasks. Many active systems exhibit circular swimming, ubiquitous in chemical, physical, and biological systems, that biases motion and reduces transport efficiency. We show that stochastic position-orientation resetting can overcome these limitations in two-dimensional chiral active Brownian particles by interrupting circular motion, resulting in tunable dynamics. When resets are infrequent compared to chiral rotation, the steady-state mean-squared displacement varies non-monotonically with rotational diffusion. Steady state excess kurtosis and orientation autocorrelation yields spatiotemporal state diagram comprising three states: an activity-dominated chiral state, and two resetting-dominated states with and without chirality; in contrast, the achiral counterpart supports only the resetting-dominated state. Chirality thus enriches the dynamical landscape, enabling tunable transitions between transport modes absent in achiral systems. A simple reset protocol can thus transform chiral active dynamics and offer a practical strategy for optimizing search and transport in circle swimmers.</description>

      <title>Topological Dissipation as the Missing Link in Multiscale Polymer Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify topological dissipation -- momentum transport along the polymer backbone with Ising-type exponential decay ($\sim \exp(-\Delta n/n_\text{d})$) -- as the missing link connecting atomistic and mesoscale dynamics. Simulations of four polymers reveal that dynamical correlation length $n_\text{d} \approx n_\text{k}/3$ (Kuhn length $n_\text{k}$), enabling a coarse-grained framework that \emph{explicitly separates} topological (intrachain) and spatial (interchain) dissipation channels without temporal memory kernels. The approach quantitatively reproduces dynamics from segmental relaxation to chain diffusion, solving the long-standing memory preservation challenge in Markovian coarse-graining. Our results establish topology-mediated dissipation as a key mechanism for polymer dynamics.</description>

      <title>A collisional model of odd fluids: from Boltzmann equation to chiral hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the time-reversal and parity symmetries in a fluid are broken, transverse transport coefficients can arise in response to perturbations, an example being odd viscosity. We refer to these systems as odd fluids. While much progress has been made in the continuum theory of odd-viscous fluids, and non-collisional models for odd viscous fluids have been proposed, a classical microscopic description in which the transverse responses originate from collisions is lacking. In this paper, we show that a dilute granular gas of rough and inelastic particles driven by a constant torque is a minimal microscopic model of an odd fluid. By applying the methods of Boltzmann kinetic theory, we obtain a hydrodynamic description of the microscopic model. Then, using the method of adiabatic elimination, we numerically compute all the response coefficients of the model, explicitly showing that the model has many odd response terms. Our theory predicts that certain odd response coefficients can change sign even when the direction of the external torque is fixed. While we choose a particular case, the procedure we present can be applied to any collisional model. We also present a semi-quantitative method to determine the hydrodynamic variables of the theory by observing the eigenvalue spectrum of the linear collision operator.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-Based Heterogeneity Inference Reveals Non-Stationary Effects in Biohybrid Cell-Cargo Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variability of motility behavior in populations of microbiological agents is an ubiquitous phenomenon even in the case of genetically identical cells. Accordingly, passive objects introduced into such biological systems and driven by them will also exhibit heterogeneous motion patterns. Here, we study a biohybrid system of passive beads driven by active ameboid cells and use a likelihood approach to estimate the heterogeneity of the bead dynamics from their discretely sampled trajectories. We showcase how this approach can deal with information-scarce situations and provides natural uncertainty bounds for heterogeneity estimates. Using these advantages we particularly uncover that the heterogeneity in the system is time-dependent.</description>

      <title>Negative drag force on beating flagellar-shaped bodies in active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the drag force exerted by a suspension of light-induced active particles (APs) on a translating and beating idealized flagellum-shaped object realized through negative phototactic interactions with the APs. We observe both positive and negative drag forces, depending on the beating frequency and translational velocity, driven by the dynamic redistribution of APs in response to the object's motion. These findings are supported by numerical simulations and an analytical model, extendable to a range of slender geometries. Our results illustrate the complex interplay between geometric body changes and the density distribution in active baths, which may also be relevant for microrobotic applications.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Structural Characterization of Charged Polymers Involved in Moisture-Driven Direct Air Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels has led to urgent calls for effective carbon capture methods, with direct air capture (DAC) emerging as a promising solution. This study focuses on the structural characterization of commercially available alkaline anion-exchange membrane (AEM) polymers, Fumasep FAA-3 and IRA 900, for use in low-energy, moisture-driven DAC applications. A combination of X-ray diffraction, small and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to explore the structural features of these materials. X-ray scattering analysis revealed molecular ordering and large-scale structural organization in both materials, while humidity-induced changes highlighted the impact of moisture on structural properties. AFM surface analysis further indicated the presence of clustering, porosity, and swelling, which were corroborated by FIB-SEM and TEM imaging. These structural insights offer a deeper understanding of the behavior of AEM-DAC materials during CO2 capture and release, emphasizing the role of moisture in these processes. This work lays the foundation for the development of more energy-efficient DAC polymers, paving the way for improved CO2 capture technologies.</description>

      <title>Scaling Behaviors in Active Model B+ via the Functional Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scaling behaviors of the Active Model B+ using the functional renormalization group (FRG) approach, based on the nonequilibrium effective action formulated via the Martin-Siggia-Rose path-integral formalism. We derive the $\beta$ functions for all couplings of the system in generic $d$ dimensions, revealing regulator independence in various contributions to the RG flow at specific values for $d$. After identifying specific regions of the parameter space that define submodels closed under RG transformations, we determine all fixed points of potential physical relevance. We confirm the existence of a bicritical fixed point, which was conjectured within the perturbative momentum-shell RG method for being responsible for the transition from bulk phase separation to microphase separation in active systems. We argue that, within the FRG approach, global flows significantly differ from those obtained in its perturbative counterpart.</description>

      <title>On the Rheology of Two-Dimensional Dilute Emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The single droplet under shear is a foundational problem in fluid mechanics. In computational fluid dynamics, the two-dimensional (2D) formulation offers advantages in both computational efficiency and relevance, yet its theoretical treatment remains relatively underdeveloped. In this brief note, we present an analytical treatment of this problem, beginning with a derivation of the Lamb solution for 2D Stokes flows, which in turn is used to obtain the flow fields around a droplet in a purely extensional flow. Using these flow fields, expressions are obtained for the apparent viscosity, $\mu^*$, of a dilute emulsion as well as a small deformation theory. We show that $\mu^* = \mu( 1 + f(\lambda) \phi) + \mathcal{O}(\phi^2)$ with $f(\lambda) = (2\lambda + 1)/(\lambda + 1)$ where $\lambda$ is the ratio of the droplet viscosity to the matrix viscosity and $\phi$ is the area fraction covered by the suspended phase. Also the steady state value of the Taylor deformation parameter $D_T^\infty$, in the capillarity-dominated regime, obeys $D_T^\infty = g(\lambda)\,\text{Ca}$, where Ca is the capillary number and $g(\lambda) = 1$. This contrasts with the 3D case, where $g(\lambda)$ depends on $\lambda$. These results are then validated through direct numerical simulations across a wide range of viscosity ratios ($0.01 &lt; \lambda &lt; 100$). Our results provide a basic theoretical framework for interpreting 2D droplet simulations and provide clear benchmarks for computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Poisson-Nernst-Planck charging dynamics of an electric double layer capacitor: symmetric and asymmetric binary electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A parallel plate capacitor containing an electrolytic solution is the simplest model of a supercapacitor, or electric double layer capacitor. Using both analytical and numerical techniques, we solve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for such a system, describing the mean-field charging dynamics of the capacitor, when a constant potential difference is abruptly applied to its plates. Working at constant total number of ions, we focus on the physical processes involved in the relaxation and, whenever possible, give its functional shape and exact time constants. We first review and study the case of a symmetric binary electrolyte, where we assume the two ionic species to have the same charges and diffusivities. We then relax these assumptions and present results for a generic strong (i.e. fully dissociated) binary electrolyte. At low electrolyte concentration, the relaxation is simple to understand, as the dynamics of positive and negative ions appear decoupled. At higher electrolyte concentration, we distinguish several regimes. In the linear regime (low voltages), relaxation is multi-exponential, it starts by the build-up of the equilibrium charge profile and continues with neutral mass diffusion, and the relevant time scales feature both the average and the Nernst-Hartley diffusion coefficients. In the purely nonlinear regime (intermediate voltages), the initial relaxation is slowed down exponentially due to increased capacitance, while bulk effects become more and more evident. In the fully nonlinear regime (high voltages), the dynamics of charge and mass are completely entangled and, asymptotically, the relaxation is linear in time. We finally discuss non-ideal behavior in real capacitors and provide conditions for which mean-field is expected to hold.</description>

      <title>Digging through 2D densely-packed coarse granular media as a critical phenomenon</title>

Abstract: We create a mechanical digger able to move within 2D densely-packed granular media, in a manner intrinsically different from the existing biomimic diggers. The characteristics of our design include that the average grain size is about one tenth as large as the digger, and the area packing density {\phi} is about 90% of the jamming density {\phi}c. Unlike conventional autonomous diggers that move by fluidizing the surrounding granular media with a much finer grain size, our digger swiftly bypasses this mobility mechanism as coarse grains with interparticle friction are hard to be fluidized. To cope with high interparticle friction, the digger has a circular shape and singly captures granular particles near the front entrance of the recess formed by the center unit running across its body and then ejects the captured particles backwards. We validate this moving strategy in both experiments using a manual digger and the corresponding numerical simulations, and demonstrate that the moving efficiency can be enhanced by the judgement of the human operator but the effectiveness is not significantly influenced by the shape of granular particles. In addition, localized vibration is needed to degrade friction between interlocked irregular-shaped particles. Our numerical results show that the distribution of both moving distances and time intervals between consecutive ejections follow a power-law Further, we experimentally verify this finding by demonstrating that similar power-laws are observed from an automated digger which regularly randomizes its digging direction. Finding these spatio-temporal power laws indicates that digging within a densely-packed granular environment could be a critical phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Entropy-driven phase behaviour of all-DNA associative polymers</title>

Abstract: Associative polymers (APs) with reversible, specific interactions between ``sticker'' sites exhibit a phase behavior that depends on a delicate balance between distinct contributions controlling the binding. For highly-bonded systems, it is entropy that mostly determines if, on increasing concentration, the network forms progressively or \textit{via} a first-order transition. With the aim of introducing an experimentally-viable system tailored to test the subtle dependence of the phase behavior on the binding site topology, here we numerically investigate AP polymers made of DNA, where ``sticker'' sites made by short DNA sequences are interspersed in a flexible backbone of poly-T spacers. Due to their self-complementarity, each binding sequence can associate with another identical sticky sequence. We compare two architectures: one with a single sticker type, $(AA)_6$, and one with two distinct alternating types, $(AB)_6$. At low temperature, when most of the stickers are involved in a bond, the $(AA)_6$ system remains homogeneous, while the $(AB)_6$ system exhibits phase separation, driven primarily by entropic factors, mirroring predictions from simpler bead-spring models. Analysis of bond distributions and polymer conformations confirms that the predominantly entropic driving force behind this separation arises from the different topological constraints associated with intra- versus inter-molecular bonding. Our results establish DNA APs as a controllable, realistic platform for studying in the laboratory how the thermodynamics of associative polymer networks depends on the bonding site architecture in a clean and controlled way.</description>

      <title>Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of the flow rate--pressure drop relation of a viscoelastic Boger fluid in a deformable channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10926</link>

Abstract: We study the steady flow-induced deformation between an incompressible non-Newtonian fluid and a three-dimensional (3D) deformable channel. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive experimental--theoretical framework for such flows of constant-viscosity viscoelastic (i.e., Boger) fluids, which allows us to quantify the influence of the fluid's viscoelasticity on the flow rate--pressure drop ($q-\Delta p$) relation. For a flow-rate-controlled regime and weakly viscoelastic flow, we find excellent agreement between the theoretical prediction and experimental results, specifically providing an experimental demonstration of how both wall compliance and fluid viscoelasticity decrease the pressure drop. To definitively demonstrate the coupled effect of wall compliance and fluid viscoelasticity (change of cross-sectional area and curving of streamlines), we perform experiments in an equivalent rigid channel, showing that both the Boger fluid and a viscosity-matched Newtonian fluid have the same pressure drop. Thus, the experimentally verified theory for the $q-\Delta p$ relation of weakly viscoelastic flows of Boger fluids in compliant channels can now be used for the design of microfluidics and soft hydraulic systems operating with complex fluids.</description>
