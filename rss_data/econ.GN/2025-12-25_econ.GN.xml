      <title>The economy-wide rebound effect and U.S. business cycles: A time-varying exercise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy efficiency gains in production and consumption are undisputed economic and environmental goals. However, potential energy savings derived from efficiency innovations may have short-lasting effects due to increased demand for more affordable energy services. Measuring the size of this rebound effect is a critical tool for better assessing the reliability of energy-saving technological change for global warming mitigation. This paper estimates the size of the economy-wide rebound effect using time-varying Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models with stochastic volatility for U.S. business-cycle peak and trough periods. All models estimate a rebound effect close to 100%, with reductions in energy use lasting no longer than three years following energy efficiency innovations. The latter, therefore, are an insufficient tool for effectively changing historical energy use patterns.</description>

      <title>Price risk aversion vs payoff risk aversion: a gender comparison through a laboratory experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This paper explores gender differences in two distinct forms of risk aversion -- Payoff Risk Aversion (PaRA) and Price Risk Aversion (PrRA) -- in order to provide a more nuanced understanding of how men and women respond to different types of economic uncertainty.
  Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a laboratory experiment using Multiple-Choice-List (MCL) risk-elicitation tasks based on both Direct Utility Function (DUF) and Indirect Utility Function (IUF) frameworks. These tasks present stochastic payoffs and stochastic prices, respectively. The analysis uses statistical hypothesis testing to compare gender-specific responses across three experimental designs.
  Findings: The key results of the study indicate that women typically exhibit higher degrees of PaRA than men, which is a consistent finding with the mainstream literature. However, remarkably, the results from all the three indirect MCL designs show that women typically exhibit lower degrees of PrRA than men, and this result is robust across different MCL designs. The paper also introduces an 'irrationality gap' as the difference between PaRA and PrRA and explores the size of the irrationality gap within either gender group, finding it larger and statistically significant for men, while smaller and statistically insignificant for women.
  Originality/value: This study is the first to distinguish between PaRA and PrRA in a gender comparison, using experimentally validated methods. It provides new behavioral insights into the nature of gender-specific risk preferences and introduces the irrationality gap as a novel concept with implications for understanding financial decision-making and the design of gender-sensitive economic policies.</description>

      <title>Econometric Modeling of Input-Driven Output Risk through a Versatile CES Production Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional functional form of the Constant-Elasticity-of-Substitution (CES) production function is a general production function nesting a number of other forms of production functions. Examples of such functions include Leontief, Cobb-Douglas, and linear production functions. Nevertheless, the conventional form of the CES production specification is still restrictive in multiple aspects. One example is the fact that the marginal effect of increasing input use always has to be to increase the variability of output quantity by the conventional construction of this function. This paper proposes a generalized variant of the CES production function that allows for various input effects on the probability distribution of output. Failure to allow for this possible input-output risk structure is indeed one of the limitations of the conventional form of the CES production function. This limitation may result in false inferences about input-driven output risk. In light of this, the present paper proposes a solution to this problem. First, it is shown that the familiar CES formulation suffers from very restrictive structural assumptions regarding risk considerations, and that such restrictions may lead to biased and inefficient estimates of production quantity and production risk. Following the general theme of Just and Pope's approach, a CES-based production-function specification that overcomes this shortcoming of the original CES production function is introduced, and a three-stage Nonlinear Least-Squares (NLS) estimation procedure for the estimation of the proposed functional form is presented. To illustrate the proposed approaches in this paper, two empirical applications in irrigation and fertilizer response using the famous Hexem-Heady experimental dataset are provided. Finally, implications for modeling input-driven production risks are discussed.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Economic Productivity: Experimental Evidence in LLM-Assisted Consulting, Data Analyst, and Management Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives `Scaling Laws for Economic Impacts' -- empirical relationships between the training compute of Large Language Models (LLMs) and professional productivity. In a preregistered experiment, over 500 consultants, data analysts, and managers completed professional tasks using one of 13 LLMs. We find that each year of AI model progress reduced task time by 8%, with 56% of gains driven by increased compute and 44% by algorithmic progress. However, productivity gains were significantly larger for non-agentic analytical tasks compared to agentic workflows requiring tool use. These findings suggest continued model scaling could boost U.S. productivity by approximately 20% over the next decade.</description>

      <title>Does Private Equity Hurt or Improve Healthcare Value? New Evidence and Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What is the impact of private equity (PE) investment on healthcare value? Does PE investment hurt or improve healthcare value, and if so, can its effect be mitigated through the use of health information technologies (IT)? Given the significant investments by PE firms in the healthcare sector in recent years, these are important research questions. Stakeholders, including policy makers, care providers, and patients, need to understand their likely impact and whether PE ownership is aligned with their interests. Using a staggered difference-in-differences approach and data from US hospitals from 2008-2020, we observe that the overall value of healthcare delivered by hospitals declines after PE investment. However, our empirical evidence reveals that IT-enabled, health information sharing plays an important moderating role. Hospitals with stronger information-sharing capabilities exhibit greater cost efficiencies and improvements in care quality, leading to higher healthcare value after PE investment. Furthermore, we find that the type of health information sharing matters. Specifically, we observe that improvements in care quality are primarily driven by information sharing between hospitals and ambulatory care providers, instead of simply hospital-to-hospital sharing of patient health data. Our research also identifies the underlying mechanisms through which health information sharing improves care value by reducing hospital-acquired infections and readmission rates, thereby improving care quality, and enhancing labor productivity by reducing operating costs. Our results highlight the critical role of policies and common data standards needed to promote IT-enabled information sharing between healthcare providers, which, in turn, can align incentives of PE firms with the goals of value-based care.</description>
