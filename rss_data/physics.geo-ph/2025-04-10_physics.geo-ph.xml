      <title>Image registration of 2D optical thin sections in a 3D porous medium: Application to a Berea sandstone digital rock image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a systematic image registration approach to align 2D optical thin-section images within a 3D digital rock volume. Using template image matching with differential evolution optimization, we identify the most similar 2D plane in 3D. The method is validated on a synthetic porous medium, achieving exact registration, and applied to Berea sandstone, where it achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.990. With the registered images, we explore upscaling properties based on paired multimodal images, focusing on pore characteristics and effective elastic moduli. The thin-section image reveals 50 % more porosity and submicron pores than the registered CT plane. In addition, bulk and shear moduli from thin sections are 25 % and 30 % lower, respectively, than those derived from CT images. Beyond numerical comparisons, thin sections provide additional geological insights, including cementation, mineral phases, and weathering effects, which are not clear in CT images. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal image registration to improve computed rock properties in digital rock physics by integrating complementary imaging modalities.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Natural External Forcing on Ocean Heat Uptake Efficiency Since the 1980s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the temporal evolution of ocean heat uptake efficiency (OHUE) using observations and large ensemble model simulations. OHUE, defined as the ratio of the rate in ocean heat uptake to changes in global mean surface temperature anomalies, has exhibited significant variability over recent decades. We found a relatively low OHUE in the late 1980s, a peak around 2000, and a subsequent decline. A key finding is the significant influence of natural external forcing, mainly volcanic eruptions, which causes an abrupt decline in OHUE followed by a gradual recovery. The 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, a major volcanic event of the 20th century, had a lasting impact on OHUE. This study emphasizes the contribution of mid-latitudes to global OHUE changes. Our findings underscore the importance of considering natural external forcing in understanding climate dynamics and suggest conducting idealized experiments to quantify the potential effects of future volcanic eruptions on OHUE.</description>

      <title>Training the Next Generation of Seismologists: Delivering Research-Grade Software Education for Cloud and HPC Computing through Diverse Training Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of data volume and computing power, seismological research requires more advanced skills in data processing, numerical methods, and parallel computing. We present the experience of conducting training workshops over various forms of delivery to support the adoption of large-scale High-Performance Computing and Cloud computing to advance seismological research. The seismological foci were on earthquake source parameter estimation in catalogs, forward and adjoint wavefield simulations in 2 and 3 dimensions at local, regional, and global scales, earthquake dynamics, ambient noise seismology, and machine learning. This contribution describes the series of workshops that were delivered as part of research projects, the learning outcomes of the participants, and lessons learned by the instructors. Our curriculum was grounded on open and reproducible science, large-scale scientific computing and data mining, and computing infrastructure (access and usage) for HPC and the cloud. We also describe the types of teaching materials that have proven beneficial to the instruction and the sustainability of the program. We propose guidelines to deliver future workshops on these topics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Runcorn's theorem and crustal magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the era of NASA's Apollo missions, Keith S. Runcorn proposed an explanation of discrepancy between the Moon's negligible global magnetic field and magnetized samples of lunar regolith, based on identical vanishing of external magnetic field of a spherical shell, magnetized by an internal source which is no longer present. We revisit and generalize the Runcorn's result, showing that it is a consequence of a (weighted) orthogonality of gradients of harmonic functions on a spherical shell in arbitrary number of dimensions. Furthermore, we explore bounds on external magnetic field in the case when the idealized spherical shell is replaced with a more realistic geometric shape and when the thermoremanent magnetization susceptibility deviates from the spherical symmetry. Finally, we analyse a model of thermoremanent magnetization acquired by crustal inward cooling of a spherical astrophysical body and put some general bounds on the associated magnetic field.</description>

      <title>How to build transfer matrices, one wave at a time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to build the closed-form expression of transfer matrices for wave propagation in layered media. The key is to represent the propagation across the piece-wise constant medium as a superposition of a finite number of paths ($2^{N-1}$ paths for a medium with $N$ layers), each one of them contributing a certain phase change (corresponding to signed sums of the phase change in each individual layer) and amplitude change (corresponding to the pattern of transmission and/or reflection associated to each path). The outlined technique is combinatorial in nature: it begins with the linear governing equations in frequency domain, whose fundamental solution is known, then it enumerates the finite number of paths across the overall system, then computes their associated phase and amplitude change, and finally adds all the possible paths to find the final result. Beyond providing physical insight, this ''path-by-path'' construction can also circumvent the need for transfer matrix numerical multiplication in many practical applications, potentially enabling substantial computational savings.</description>
