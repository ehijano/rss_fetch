      <title>PPFlow: Target-aware Peptide Design with Torsional Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Therapeutic peptides have proven to have great pharmaceutical value and potential in recent decades. However, methods of AI-assisted peptide drug discovery are not fully explored. To fill the gap, we propose a target-aware peptide design method called \textsc{PPFlow}, based on conditional flow matching on torus manifolds, to model the internal geometries of torsion angles for the peptide structure design. Besides, we establish a protein-peptide binding dataset named PPBench2024 to fill the void of massive data for the task of structure-based peptide drug design and to allow the training of deep learning methods. Extensive experiments show that PPFlow reaches state-of-the-art performance in tasks of peptide drug generation and optimization in comparison with baseline models, and can be generalized to other tasks including docking and side-chain packing.</description>

      <title>The Mathematics of Chlorophyll Photoexcitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photosynthesis is a fundamental process for plants to produce energy and survive. It is a well known fact that the light reactions in photosynthesis are a significant part of the overall process, and are carried out by chlorophyll molecules. This paper outlines the quantum chemical and mathematical description concerning electronic state transitions that take place in chlorophyll molecules during photosynthesis. In particular, the electronic transition of chlorophylls is assumed as a diatomic rovibrational 0 --&gt; 0 transition, and is mathematically described accordingly. Then, the correlation of the Franck-Condon Principle in accordance to the photoexcitation of chlorophylls is delineated. Finally, existing research concerning the concepts laid out in this paper is discussed, and future implications of quantum chemical theory concerning chlorophyll photoexcitation is discussed.</description>

      <title>On Recovering Higher-order Interactions from Protein Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein language models leverage evolutionary information to perform state-of-the-art 3D structure and zero-shot variant prediction. Yet, extracting and explaining all the mutational interactions that govern model predictions remains difficult as it requires querying the entire amino acid space for $n$ sites using $20^n$ sequences, which is computationally expensive even for moderate values of $n$ (e.g., $n\sim10$). Although approaches to lower the sample complexity exist, they often limit the interpretability of the model to just single and pairwise interactions. Recently, computationally scalable algorithms relying on the assumption of sparsity in the Fourier domain have emerged to learn interactions from experimental data. However, extracting interactions from language models poses unique challenges: it's unclear if sparsity is always present or if it is the only metric needed to assess the utility of Fourier algorithms. Herein, we develop a framework to do a systematic Fourier analysis of the protein language model ESM2 applied on three proteins-green fluorescent protein (GFP), tumor protein P53 (TP53), and G domain B1 (GB1)-across various sites for 228 experiments. We demonstrate that ESM2 is dominated by three regions in the sparsity-ruggedness plane, two of which are better suited for sparse Fourier transforms. Validations on two sample proteins demonstrate recovery of all interactions with $R^2=0.72$ in the more sparse region and $R^2=0.66$ in the more dense region, using only 7 million out of $20^{10}\sim10^{13}$ ESM2 samples, reducing the computational time by a staggering factor of 15,000. All codes and data are available on our GitHub repository https://github.com/amirgroup-codes/InteractionRecovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expression for the higher temperature dependence of the mean squared displacement in proteins is obtained. The quantum multi-well model explains the dynamic transitions of the proteins and minimizes the amount of parameters to a single one leading to the few-state harmonic system at low-temperatures, and, thus, justifying the possibility of using proteins as atom traps to control qubits at a bit higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>ProLLM: Protein Chain-of-Thoughts Enhanced LLM for Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for understanding biological functions and diseases. Previous machine learning approaches to PPI prediction mainly focus on direct physical interactions, ignoring the broader context of nonphysical connections through intermediate proteins, thus limiting their effectiveness. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) provides a new opportunity for addressing this complex biological challenge. By transforming structured data into natural language prompts, we can map the relationships between proteins into texts. This approach allows LLMs to identify indirect connections between proteins, tracing the path from upstream to downstream. Therefore, we propose a novel framework ProLLM that employs an LLM tailored for PPI for the first time. Specifically, we propose Protein Chain of Thought (ProCoT), which replicates the biological mechanism of signaling pathways as natural language prompts. ProCoT considers a signaling pathway as a protein reasoning process, which starts from upstream proteins and passes through several intermediate proteins to transmit biological signals to downstream proteins. Thus, we can use ProCoT to predict the interaction between upstream proteins and downstream proteins. The training of ProLLM employs the ProCoT format, which enhances the model's understanding of complex biological problems. In addition to ProCoT, this paper also contributes to the exploration of embedding replacement of protein sites in natural language prompts, and instruction fine-tuning in protein knowledge datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of ProLLM through rigorous validation against benchmark datasets, showing significant improvement over existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and generalizability. The code is available at: https://github.com/MingyuJ666/ProLLM.</description>

      <title>Using GANs for De Novo Protein Design Targeting Microglial IL-3R$\alpha$ to Inhibit Alzheimer's Progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IL-3 is a hemopoietic growth factor that usually targets blood cell precursors; IL-3R is a cytokine receptor that binds to IL-3. However, IL-3 takes on a different role in the context of glial cells in the nervous system, where studies show that the protein IL-3 protects against Alzheimer's disease by activating microglia at their IL-3R receptors, causing the microglia to clear out the tangles caused by the build-up of misfolded Tau proteins. In this study, we seek to ascertain what role the secondary structure of IL-3 plays in its binding with the receptor. The motivation behind this study is to learn more about the mechanism and identify possible drugs that might be able to activate it, in hopes of inhibiting the spread of Alzheimer's Disease. From a preliminary analysis of complexes containing IL-3 and IL-3R, we hypothesized that the binding is largely due to the interactions of three alpha helix structures stretching towards the active site on the receptor. The original Il-3 protein serves as the control in this experiment; the other proteins being tested are generated through several types of computational de novo protein design, where machine learning allows for the production of entirely novel structures. The efficacy of the generated proteins is assessed through docking simulations with the IL-3R receptor, and the binding poses are also qualitatively examined to gain insight into the function of the binding. From the docking data and poses, the most successful proteins were those with similar secondary structure to IL-3.</description>

      <title>A unified cross-attention model for predicting antigen binding specificity to both HLA and TCR molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated promising clinical efficacy across various tumor types, yet the percentage of patients who benefit from them remains low. The binding affinity between antigens and HLA-I/TCR molecules plays a critical role in antigen presentation and T-cell activation. Some computational methods have been developed to predict antigen-HLA or antigen-TCR binding specificity, but they focus solely on one task at a time. In this paper, we propose UnifyImmun, a unified cross-attention transformer model designed to simultaneously predicts the binding of antigens to both HLA and TCR molecules, thereby providing more comprehensive evaluation of antigen immunogenicity. We devise a two-phase progressive training strategy that enables these two tasks to mutually reinforce each other, by compelling the encoders to extract more expressive features. To further enhance the model generalizability, we incorporate virtual adversarial training. Compared to over ten existing methods for predicting antigen-HLA and antigen-TCR binding, our method demonstrates better performance in both tasks. Notably, on a large-scale COVID-19 antigen-TCR binding test set, our method improves performance by at least 9% compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. The validation experiments on three clinical cohorts confirm that our approach effectively predicts immunotherapy response and clinical outcomes. Furthermore, the cross-attention scores reveal the amino acids sites critical for antigen binding to receptors. In essence, our approach marks a significant step towards comprehensive evaluation of antigen immunogenicity.</description>

      <title>PROflow: An iterative refinement model for PROTAC-induced structure prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are small molecules that trigger the breakdown of traditionally ``undruggable'' proteins by binding simultaneously to their targets and degradation-associated proteins. A key challenge in their rational design is understanding their structural basis of activity. Due to the lack of crystal structures (18 in the PDB), existing PROTAC docking methods have been forced to simplify the problem into a distance-constrained protein-protein docking task. To address the data issue, we develop a novel pseudo-data generation scheme that requires only binary protein-protein complexes. This new dataset enables PROflow, an iterative refinement model for PROTAC-induced structure prediction that models the full PROTAC flexibility during constrained protein-protein docking. PROflow outperforms the state-of-the-art across docking metrics and runtime. Its inference speed enables the large-scale screening of PROTAC designs, and computed properties of predicted structures achieve statistically significant correlations with published degradation activities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Human Genome Project has led to an exponential increase in data related to the sequence, structure, and function of biomolecules. Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary research field that primarily uses computational methods to analyze large amounts of biological macromolecule data. Its goal is to discover hidden biological patterns and related information. Furthermore, analysing additional relevant information can enhance the study of biological operating mechanisms. This paper discusses the fundamental concepts of RNA, RNA secondary structure, and its prediction.Subsequently, the application of machine learning technologies in predicting the structure of biological macromolecules is explored. This chapter describes the relevant knowledge of algorithms and computational complexity and presents a RNA tertiary structure prediction algorithm based on ResNet. To address the issue of the current scoring function's unsuitability for long RNA, a scoring model based on ResNet is proposed, and a structure prediction algorithm is designed. The chapter concludes by presenting some open and interesting challenges in the field of RNA tertiary structure prediction.</description>

      <title>Molecular Docking via Weighted Subgraph Isomorphism on Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular docking is an essential step in the drug discovery process involving the detection of three-dimensional poses of a ligand inside the active site of the protein. In this paper, we address the Molecular Docking search phase by formulating the problem in QUBO terms, suitable for an annealing approach. We propose a problem formulation as a weighted subgraph isomorphism between the ligand graph and the grid of the target protein pocket. In particular, we applied a graph representation to the ligand embedding all the geometrical properties of the molecule including its flexibility, and we created a weighted spatial grid to the 3D space region inside the pocket. Results and performance obtained with quantum annealers are compared with classical simulated annealing solvers.</description>

      <title>ProteinEngine: Empower LLM with Domain Knowledge for Protein Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their proficiency in tackling intricate tasks, particularly leveraging their capacities for zero-shot and in-context learning. However, their utility has been predominantly restricted to general tasks due to an absence of domain-specific knowledge. This constraint becomes particularly pertinent in the realm of protein engineering, where specialized expertise is required for tasks such as protein function prediction, protein evolution analysis, and protein design, with a level of specialization that existing LLMs cannot furnish. In response to this challenge, we introduce \textsc{ProteinEngine}, a human-centered platform aimed at amplifying the capabilities of LLMs in protein engineering by seamlessly integrating a comprehensive range of relevant tools, packages, and software via API calls. Uniquely, \textsc{ProteinEngine} assigns three distinct roles to LLMs, facilitating efficient task delegation, specialized task resolution, and effective communication of results. This design fosters high extensibility and promotes the smooth incorporation of new algorithms, models, and features for future development. Extensive user studies, involving participants from both the AI and protein engineering communities across academia and industry, consistently validate the superiority of \textsc{ProteinEngine} in augmenting the reliability and precision of deep learning in protein engineering tasks. Consequently, our findings highlight the potential of \textsc{ProteinEngine} to bride the disconnected tools for future research in the protein engineering domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing new molecules is an important task in the field of pharmaceuticals. Due to the vast design space of molecules, generating molecules conditioned on a specific sub-structure relevant to a particular function or therapeutic target is a crucial task in computer-aided drug design. In this paper, we present ControlMol, which adds sub-structure control to molecule generation with diffusion models. Unlike previous methods which view this task as inpainting or conditional generation, we adopt the idea of ControlNet into conditional molecule generation and make adaptive adjustments to a pre-trained diffusion model. We apply our method to both 2D and 3D molecule generation tasks. Conditioned on randomly partitioned sub-structure data, our method outperforms previous methods by generating more valid and diverse molecules. The method is easy to implement and can be quickly applied to a variety of pre-trained molecule generation models.</description>

      <title>Language Interaction Network for Clinical Trial Approval Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical trial outcome prediction seeks to estimate the likelihood that a clinical trial will successfully reach its intended endpoint. This process predominantly involves the development of machine learning models that utilize a variety of data sources such as descriptions of the clinical trials, characteristics of the drug molecules, and specific disease conditions being targeted. Accurate predictions of trial outcomes are crucial for optimizing trial planning and prioritizing investments in a drug portfolio. While previous research has largely concentrated on small-molecule drugs, there is a growing need to focus on biologics-a rapidly expanding category of therapeutic agents that often lack the well-defined molecular properties associated with traditional drugs. Additionally, applying conventional methods like graph neural networks to biologics data proves challenging due to their complex nature. To address these challenges, we introduce the Language Interaction Network (LINT), a novel approach that predicts trial outcomes using only the free-text descriptions of the trials. We have rigorously tested the effectiveness of LINT across three phases of clinical trials, where it achieved ROC-AUC scores of 0.770, 0.740, and 0.748 for phases I, II, and III, respectively, specifically concerning trials involving biologic interventions.</description>

      <title>Protein Representation Learning by Capturing Protein Sequence-Structure-Function Relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of protein representation learning is to extract knowledge from protein databases that can be applied to various protein-related downstream tasks. Although protein sequence, structure, and function are the three key modalities for a comprehensive understanding of proteins, existing methods for protein representation learning have utilized only one or two of these modalities due to the difficulty of capturing the asymmetric interrelationships between them. To account for this asymmetry, we introduce our novel asymmetric multi-modal masked autoencoder (AMMA). AMMA adopts (1) a unified multi-modal encoder to integrate all three modalities into a unified representation space and (2) asymmetric decoders to ensure that sequence latent features reflect structural and functional information. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed AMMA is highly effective in learning protein representations that exhibit well-aligned inter-modal relationships, which in turn makes it effective for various downstream protein-related tasks.</description>

      <title>DrugLLM: Open Large Language Model for Few-shot Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made great strides in areas such as language processing and computer vision. Despite the emergence of diverse techniques to improve few-shot learning capacity, current LLMs fall short in handling the languages in biology and chemistry. For example, they are struggling to capture the relationship between molecule structure and pharmacochemical properties. Consequently, the few-shot learning capacity of small-molecule drug modification remains impeded. In this work, we introduced DrugLLM, a LLM tailored for drug design. During the training process, we employed Group-based Molecular Representation (GMR) to represent molecules, arranging them in sequences that reflect modifications aimed at enhancing specific molecular properties. DrugLLM learns how to modify molecules in drug discovery by predicting the next molecule based on past modifications. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that DrugLLM can generate new molecules with expected properties based on limited examples, presenting a powerful few-shot molecule generation capacity.</description>

Abstract: How can we design proteins with desired functions? We are motivated by a chemical intuition that both geometric structure and biochemical properties are critical to a protein's function. In this paper, we propose SurfPro, a new method to generate functional proteins given a desired surface and its associated biochemical properties. SurfPro comprises a hierarchical encoder that progressively models the geometric shape and biochemical features of a protein surface, and an autoregressive decoder to produce an amino acid sequence. We evaluate SurfPro on a standard inverse folding benchmark CATH 4.2 and two functional protein design tasks: protein binder design and enzyme design. Our SurfPro consistently surpasses previous state-of-the-art inverse folding methods, achieving a recovery rate of 57.78% on CATH 4.2 and higher success rates in terms of protein-protein binding and enzyme-substrate interaction scores.</description>

      <title>Improving Targeted Molecule Generation through Language Model Fine-Tuning Via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing new drugs is laborious and costly, demanding extensive time investment. In this study, we introduce an innovative de-novo drug design strategy, which harnesses the capabilities of language models to devise targeted drugs for specific proteins. Employing a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we refine the model to acquire a policy for generating drugs tailored to protein targets. Our method integrates a composite reward function, combining considerations of drug-target interaction and molecular validity. Following RL fine-tuning, our approach demonstrates promising outcomes, yielding notable improvements in molecular validity, interaction efficacy, and critical chemical properties, achieving 65.37 for Quantitative Estimation of Drug-likeness (QED), 321.55 for Molecular Weight (MW), and 4.47 for Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient (logP), respectively. Furthermore, out of the generated drugs, only 0.041\% do not exhibit novelty.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of In vitro anti-inflammatory activity and Insilico pharmacokinetics and molecular docking study of Horsfieldia iryaghedhi</title>

Abstract: Phytochemicals are still a valuable source to develop clinically important drugs in treating chronic and acute diseases. Inflammation is a response to an injurious stimulus of the body and novel therapeutic agents are needed to alleviate the condition with minimum side effects. Matured and fully expanded fresh leaves and barks of H. iryaghedhi were collected, and the extractions were obtained cold maceration using 99.9% methanol and distilled water as solvents. A concentration series was then developed, and the anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated against Diclofenac sodium as the positive control, using the heat-induced egg albumin denaturation method. Further, selected phytochemicals were tested against COX-2 enzyme (PDB ID: 5IKR) using site-specific molecular docking with autodock vina and the binding energies and pharmacokinetic and toxicity parameters were evaluated. Results: The methanol and aqueous extracts have shown a moderate to strong concentration-dependent anti-inflammatory activity with reference to standard Diclofenac sodium and Methanol bark extract exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activity compared to other extracts . Further, Methanol and aqueous extracts showed a statistically significant correlation between concentration and percentage inhibition. The molecular docking results suggest that the phytochemicals available on the plant have possible COX-2 inhibitory activity and the compounds selected (Methyl 2,4- dihydroxy-6-methylbenzoate and N, N-Dimethyl-5-methoxy tryptamine) even got favourable toxicity and pharmacokinetic parameters confirming their drugability.</description>

      <title>De novo antibody design with SE(3) diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce IgDiff, an antibody variable domain diffusion model based on a general protein backbone diffusion framework which was extended to handle multiple chains. Assessing the designability and novelty of the structures generated with our model, we find that IgDiff produces highly designable antibodies that can contain novel binding regions. The backbone dihedral angles of sampled structures show good agreement with a reference antibody distribution. We verify these designed antibodies experimentally and find that all express with high yield. Finally, we compare our model with a state-of-the-art generative backbone diffusion model on a range of antibody design tasks, such as the design of the complementarity determining regions or the pairing of a light chain to an existing heavy chain, and show improved properties and designability.</description>

      <title>Identifying the minimal sets of distance restraints for FRET-assisted protein structural modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07983</link>

Abstract: Proteins naturally occur in crowded cellular environments and interact with other proteins, nucleic acids, and organelles. Since most previous experimental protein structure determination techniques require that proteins occur in idealized, non-physiological environments, the effects of realistic cellular environments on protein structure are largely unexplored. Recently, F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been shown to be an effective experimental method for investigating protein structure in vivo. Inter-residue distances measured in vivo can be incorporated as restraints in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to model protein structural dynamics in vivo. Since most FRET studies only obtain inter-residue separations for a small number of amino acid pairs, it is important to determine the minimum number of restraints in the MD simulations that are required to achieve a given root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from the experimental structural ensemble. Further, what is the optimal method for selecting these inter-residue restraints? Here, we implement several methods for selecting the most important FRET pairs and determine the number of pairs $N_{r}$ that are needed to induce conformational changes in proteins between two experimentally determined structures. We find that enforcing only a small fraction of restraints, $N_{r}/N \lesssim 0.08$, where $N$ is the number of amino acids, can induce the conformational changes. These results establish the efficacy of FRET-assisted MD simulations for atomic scale structural modeling of proteins in vivo.</description>

      <title>Pro-PRIME: A general Temperature-Guided Language model to engineer enhanced Stability and Activity in Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12682v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing protein mutants of both high stability and activity is a critical yet challenging task in protein engineering. Here, we introduce Pro-PRIME, a deep learning zero-shot model, which can suggest protein mutants of improved stability and activity without any prior experimental mutagenesis data. By leveraging temperature-guided language modelling, Pro-PRIME demonstrated superior predictive power compared to current state-of-the-art models on the public mutagenesis dataset over 33 proteins. Furthermore, we carried out wet experiments to test Pro-PRIME on five distinct proteins to engineer certain physicochemical properties, including thermal stability, rates of RNA polymerization and DNA cleavage, hydrolase activity, antigen-antibody binding affinity, or even the nonnatural properties, e.g., the ability to polymerize non-natural nucleic acid or resilience to extreme alkaline conditions. Surprisingly, about 40% AI-designed mutants show better performance than the one before mutation for all five proteins studied and for all properties targeted for engineering. Hence, Pro-PRIME demonstrates the general applicability in protein engineering.</description>
