      <title>Coronal rain formation in a two-fluid approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal rain, observed in 3D spine-fan magnetic configurations, results from thermal instability in the solar corona, where runaway in-situ cooling causes plasma to condense and drain along the magnetic lines. The reconnection of the magnetic field lines around the null point creates jets, seen as denser structures traveling along the field lines. As these dense regions evolve, thermal instability can set in and ultimately form coronal rain. In this paper we study the importance of partial ionization effects in the formation of coronal rain in the late evolution of 3D spine-fan magnetic reconnection in the solar corona. We use a two-fluid model consisting of neutral and charged particles coupled by collisions, where ionization recombination processes are taken into account. To trigger the thermal instability, we here investigate how magnetic reconnection generates flows that lead to the accumulation of higher-density structures along magnetic field lines. The dynamics associated with the spine-fan magnetic reconnection produces current sheets around the null point and flows along the field lines. Blobs similar to coronal rain start to appear after 400 seconds in the simulation domain which follow the field lines from the direction of the perturbed null point.
  The temperature drop is accompanied by recombination of charged particles. Recombination effects become important in coronal rain evolution when the temperature drops considerably in the condensed structures. The neutrals are slowed down by recombination, producing decoupling in velocity at the size of the blob, but inside the condensing structure, the neutrals can move faster across the field lines, creating small scale structures. This study presents a novel two-fluid approach to coronal rain, showing that incorporating two-fluid effects is essential for accurately capturing its dynamics.</description>

      <title>The striated solar photosphere observed at 0."03, resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Striated granular edges observed in the solar photosphere represent one of the smallest-scale phenomena on the Sun. They arise from the interaction of strongly coupled hydrodynamic, magnetic, and radiative properties of the plasma. In particular, modulations in the photospheric magnetic field strength cause variations in density and opacity along the line of sight, leading to their formation. Therefore, the striation patterns can be used as valuable diagnostics for studying the finest-scale structure of the photospheric magnetic field. The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope allows observations of the solar atmosphere with a spatial resolution of better than 0."03 with its current instrumentation. We analyze images acquired with the Visible Broadband Imager using the G-band channel to investigate the characteristics of fine-scale striations in the photosphere and compare them with state-of-the-art radiation-MHD simulations at similar spatial resolution. Both observed and synthetic images reveal photospheric striae with widths of approximately 20$-$50 km, suggesting that at least 4-meter class solar telescopes are necessary to resolve this ultrafine structure. Analysis of the numerical simulations confirms that the striation observed in the filtergrams is associated with spatial variations in photospheric magnetic flux concentrations, which cause shifts in the geometrical height where the emergent intensity forms. Some fine-scale striation in the synthetic images originate from magnetic field variations of approximately a hundred Gauss, resulting in a Wilson depressions as narrow as 10 km. This suggests that DKIST G-band images can trace footprints of magnetic field variations and Wilson depressions at a similar scale.</description>

      <title>Probing Abundance Variations among Multiple Stellar Populations in the Metal-Poor Globular Cluster NGC 2298 using Gemini-South/GHOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the abundances in metal-poor globular clusters is crucial for understanding the formation of the Galaxy and the nucleosynthesis processes in the early Universe. We observed 13 red giant stars from the metal-poor globular cluster NGC 2298 using the newly commissioned GHOST spectrograph at Gemini South. We derived stellar parameters and abundances for 36 species across 32 elements, including 16 neutron-capture elements. We find that the stars exhibit chemical anomalies among the light elements, allowing us to classify them into first-generation (8 stars) and second-generation (5 stars). We derive a mean cluster metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.98 +/- 0.10 with no significant variation among cluster members. Most alpha- and Fe-peak elements display low star-to-star abundance dispersion, with notable exceptions for Sc, Ni, and Zn for which the dispersions in Sc vary significantly between stars from different generations to 2\sigma levels. Similarly, among the neutron-capture elements, we observed considerable differences in dispersion for Sr and Eu among the first and second generation stars to 2 sigma levels. We also confirm an intrinsic scatter beyond observational uncertainties for several elements using a maximum likelihood approach among stars from different generations. Additionally, we note an increase in [Sr/Eu] and [Ba/Eu] with [Mg/Fe] in first-generation stars indicating correlations between the productions of light r-process and Mg. We find the universal r-process pattern, but with larger dispersions in the main r-process than the limited-r elements. These differences in abundance dispersion, among first- and second-generation stars in NGC 2298, suggest complex and inhomogeneous early chemical enrichment processes, driven by contributions from multiple nucleosynthetic events, including massive stars and rare r-process events.</description>

      <title>Extremely Low Mass Ratio Contact Binaries. II. The First Photometric and Spectroscopic Investigations of Six Systems with Orbital Periods Longer than 0.5 days</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photometric and spectroscopic studies of six contact binaries were performed for the first time. The orbital periods of all the six targets are longer than 0.5d, and we discovered that their mass ratios are smaller than 0.15. So, they are extremely low mass-ratio contact binaries. Only one target is a W-subtype contact binary (ASASSN-V J105032.88+420829.0), while the others are A-subtype contact binaries. From orbital period analysis, ASASSN-V J075442.44+555623.2 shows no orbital period change. Three of the six targets demonstrate a secular period increase, and two targets for a secular period decrease. We investigated the LAMOST spectra employing the spectral subtraction method. All six contact binaries show no chromospheric emission line, implying no chromospheric activity. Their absolute parameters, initial masses, ages, energy transfer parameters, and instability parameters were calculated. The bolometric luminosity ratios ($(L_2/L_1)_{bol}$), the energy transfer parameters ($\beta$), the contact degrees ($f$), and the mass ratios ($q$) were collected for a sample of 218 contact binaries and we analyzed and discussed some correlations. The results by analyzing the relation between $\beta$, $f$ and $q$ indicate that the energy transfer parameter between the two components of extremely low mass-ratio contact binaries is independent of the contact degree. And the predicted cutoff mass ratio was estimated as 0.021 by analyzing the relation between $f$ and $q$.</description>

      <title>Heartbeat Stars Recognition Based on Recurrent Neural Networks: Method and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the variety of their light curve morphologies, the vast majority of the known heartbeat stars (HBSs) have been discovered by manual inspection. Machine learning, which has already been successfully applied to the classification of variable stars based on light curves, offers another possibility for the automatic detection of HBSs. We propose a novel feature extraction approach for HBSs. First, the light curve is transformed into the frequency domain via Fourier transform, then the amplitudes of the first 100 harmonics are extracted, and finally these harmonics are normalised as feature vectors of the light curve. A training data set of synthetic light curves is constructed using ELLC, and their features are fed into recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for supervised learning, with the expected output being the eccentricity of these light curves. The performance of RNNs is evaluated using a test data set of synthetic light curves, achieving 95$\%$ accuracy. When applied to known HBSs from OGLE, Kepler, and TESS surveys, the networks achieve an average accuracy of 88$\%$. This method successfully identify four new HBSs within the eclipsing binary catalog of Kirk et al. The use of orbital harmonics as features for HBSs proves to be an effective approach that significantly reduces the computational cost of neural networks. RNNs show excellent performance in recognising this type of time series data. This method not only allows efficient identification of HBSs, but can also be extended to recognise other types of periodic variable stars.</description>

      <title>Formation of Al II lines and photospheric aluminium abundances in B-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminium abundances of B-type stars were spectroscopically determined in order to get information about the galactic gas composition at the time of their formation. For this purpose, two AlII lines at 6243 and 4663A were employed. The non-LTE effect of these AlII lines generally acts in the direction of weakening (i.e., profile becomes shallower) caused by a decrease of line opacity (due to overionization) along with an enhanced line source function (overexcitation), and this effect tends to become progressively larger with an increase in Teff as well as with a decrease in log g (surface gravity). Regarding the AlII 6243 line, while the non-LTE calculation qualitatively reproduces its overall behavior (e.g., transition from absorption to emission at early B-type), some Teff-dependent systematic trend remains unremoved in the non-LTE abundances of normal stars, which means that non-LTE corrections evaluated for this line are quantitatively insufficient. Meanwhile, for the case of the Al II 4663 line, which is more advantageous than the 6243 line in the sense that it is stronger without showing any emission, the resulting non-LTE abundances of ordinary B stars are almost constant at the solar abundance (A~6.5) over the wide Teff range (~10000-20000K), suggesting that the abundances derived from this line are successfully non-LTE-corrected and trustable. Therefore, according to the results from the AlII 4663 line, we may conclude that the Al abundance of the galactic gas in the recent past (several times ~10^7-10^8 yr ago) is almost consistent with the solar composition. As to the Al abundances of HgMn stars (Teff&lt;15000K), our analysis confirmed that this element is conspicuously deficient (by ~0.5-2 dex in comparison with the Sun) in the photosphere of these chemically peculiar stars, as already reported in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Zeeman-Doppler imaging of stellar magnetic fields: I. Analysis of tau Scorpii in the weak-field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) is used to study the surface magnetic field topology of stars, based on high-resolution spectropolarimetric time series observations. Multiple ZDI inversions have been conducted for the early B-type star tau Sco, which has been found to exhibit a weak but complex non-dipolar surface magnetic field. The classical ZDI framework suffers from a significant limitation in that it provides little to no reliable uncertainty quantification for the reconstructed magnetic field maps, with essentially all published results being confined to point estimates. To fill this gap, we propose a Bayesian framework for probabilistic ZDI. Here, the proposed framework is demonstrated on tau Sco in the weak-field limit. We propose three distinct statistical models, and use archival ESPaDOnS high-resolution Stokes V observations to carry out the probabilistic magnetic inversion in closed form. The surface magnetic field is parameterised by a high-dimensional spherical-harmonic expansion. By comparing three different prior distributions over the latent variables in the spherical-harmonic decomposition, our results showcase the ZDI sensitivity to various hyperparameters. The mean magnetic field maps are qualitatively similar to previously published point estimates, but analysis of the magnetic energy distribution indicates high uncertainty and higher energy content at low angular degrees l. Our results effectively demonstrate that, for stars in the weak-field regime, reliable uncertainty quantification of recovered magnetic field maps can be obtained in closed form with natural assumptions on the statistical model. Future work will explore extending this framework beyond the weak-field approximation and incorporating prior uncertainty over multiple stellar parameters in more complex magnetic inversion problems.</description>

      <title>Effect of interplanetary shock waves on turbulence parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed an extensive statistical investigation of how interplanetary fast forward shocks affect certain turbulence parameters, namely, the cross-helicity, $\sigma_c$, residual energy, $\sigma_r$, and magnetic helicity, $\sigma_m$. A total of 371 shocks detected by Wind at 1 au and seven shocks by Solar Orbiter at 0.3-0.5 au have been analysed. We explore how the aforementioned turbulence parameters and their variation across the shock depend on shock characteristics including the gas compression ratio, upstream plasma beta, velocity jump and shock angle. In the shock vicinity, fluctuations tend on average to show antisunward imbalance (measured as $\sigma_c&gt;0$ when rectified to the Parker spiral direction), a dominance of magnetic energy ($\sigma_r&lt;0$) and zero $\sigma_m$, all being typical solar wind properties . Antisunward imbalance and equipartition ($\sigma_r \sim0$) in the upstream is increasingly prevalent with increasing shock velocity jump and decreasing upstream beta and shock angle. Shocks with large velocity jumps and gas compression ratios have considerably more balanced ($\sigma_c\sim0$) and more magnetically dominated fluctuations downstream than upstream. From upstream to downstream, we also find that the occurrence of time periods fulfilling strict criteria for Alfv\'enic fluctuations (AFs) usually decreases, while those meeting the criteria for small-scale flux ropes (SFRs) increases. The occurrence of AF periods peaks for quasi-parallel shocks with large velocity jumps and small upstream beta. The occurrence of SFRs increases with increasing gas compression ratio and upstream beta. The shocks observed by Solar Orbiter below 0.5 au display similar distributions of turbulence parameters and upstream-to-downstream changes to those detected at 1 au. These results are relevant for understanding turbulence and charged-particle acceleration at collisionless shocks.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic investigations of a filament reconnecting with coronal loops during a two-ribbon solar flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard 2D model of eruption, the eruption of a magnetic flux rope is associated with magnetic reconnection occurring beneath it. However, in 3D, additional reconnection geometries are possible, in particular the AR-RF, where external reconnection involving the overlying arcades (A) and erupting flux rope (R) turns into another arcade and a flare loop (F). This process results in the drifting of the legs of the erupting flux rope. We investigated spectroscopic signatures of such AR-RF reconnection occurring in an erupting filament reconnecting with coronal arcades during a two-ribbon flare. The evolution of the erupting filament eruption is examined using observations by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). As the filament rises into the corona, it reconnects with the surrounding arcade of coronal loops with localized brightenings, resulting in the disappearance of the coronal loops and formation of a hot flux rope, showing slipping motion of its footpoints extending to the previous footpoints of the coronal loops (AR-RF reconnection) as predicted by the 3D extensions to the Standard solar flare model. These brightenings are accompanied by the presence of strong blue-shifts in both the IRIS Si IV and Mg II lines, upto about 200 km/s. The lines are also extremely wide, with non-thermal widths above 100 km/s. Furthermore, a strongly non-Gaussian profile of the most blue-shifted component is detected at the start of the AR-RF reconnection, indicating the presence of accelerated particles and MHD turbulence, and associated with the appearance of hot plasma in the AIA 94 A passband. For the first time, an observation has been reported in which the IRIS slit successfully captures AR-RF reconnection between a filament and overlying arcades, resulting in strong blue-shifts and very broad line profiles.</description>

      <title>Main-oval auroral emission from a T6 brown dwarf: observations, modeling, and astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a series of 5 GHz VLBA radio observations taken over 1-yr span, we present the detection of compact highly-polarized radio emission from the T6 brown dwarf WISE J112254.72+255022.2 compatible with electron cyclotron maser emission. Both the total and polarized lightcurves show variability in correspondence with a rotation period of 1.95+/-0.03 hr. Comparison with models indicates that the quasi-steady radio emission of this brown dwarf is produced in circumpolar auroral rings, with remarkable similarity to the main-oval auroras in Jupiter. We have detected a large 100% polarized flare in one of the VLBA epochs (2022.82) which may imply the existence of active longitudes in the auroral rings with a non-axisymmetric beaming cone radiation pattern, similar to the dusk/dawn asymmetries seen in the Jovian radio emissions. We also present a high-precision astrometric analysis of the sky motion of WISE J112254.72+255022.2, resulting in revised values of proper motion and parallax with an improvement in precision of one order of magnitude. The common kinematics of WISE J112254.72+255022.2 with its wide companion, the M-dwarf LHS 302, is confirmed with submilliarcsecond precision, suggesting that this brown dwarf may have formed by gravitational fragmentation of the outer part of a protostellar disc around LHS 302. The astrometric analysis imposes very tight bounds to the presence of low-mass companions around WISE J112254.72+255022.2, ruling out objects more massive than Saturn. Our results strengthen the analogy between radio emitting brown dwarfs and the magnetized planets of our solar system.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Suppression of Solar Surface Magnetic Flux Advection with Increasing Field Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main theories for heating of the solar corona is based on the idea that solar convection shuffles and tangles magnetic field lines to make many small-scale current sheets that, via reconnection, heat coronal loops. Tiwari et al 2017 present evidence that, besides depending on loop length and other factors, the brightness of a coronal loop depends on the field strength in the loop feet and the freedom of convection in the feet. While it is known that strong solar magnetic fields suppress convection, the decrease in the speed of horizontal advection of magnetic flux with increasing field strength has not been quantified before. We quantify that trend by analyzing 24hours of HMI SHARP vector magnetograms of each of six sunspot active regions and their surroundings. Using Fourier Local Correlation Tracking, we estimate the horizontal advection speed of the magnetic flux at each pixel in which the vertical component of the magnetic field strength (Bz) is well above (greater than or equal to 150 G) noise level. We find that the average horizontal advection speed of magnetic flux steadily decreases as Bz increases, from 110 pm 3 meters per sec for 150 G (in network and plage) to 10 pm 4 meters per sec for 2500 G (in sunspot umbra). The trend is well fit by a fourth degree polynomial. These results quantitatively confirm the expectation that magnetic flux advection is suppressed by increasing magnetic field strength. The presented quantitative relation should be useful for future MHD simulations of coronal heating.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Currie et al. simulated the detection of molecules in the atmospheres of temperate rocky exoplanets transiting nearby M-dwarf stars. They simulated detections via spectral cross-correlation applied to high resolution optical and near-IR transit spectroscopy using the ELTs. Currie et al. did not consider the effect of unocculted star spots, but we do that here for possible detections of molecular oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor. We find that confusion noise from unocculted star spots becomes significant for large programs that stack tens to hundreds of transits to detect these molecules. Noise from star spots increases with greater spot filling factors, and star spot temperature has less effect than filling factor. Nevertheless, molecular oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane could be detected in temperate rocky planets transiting nearby M-dwarfs without correcting for star spots. Water vapor detections are the most affected, with star spots contaminating the exoplanet signal as well as producing extra noise. Unocculted spots only affect transit spectroscopy when normalizing by dividing by the total flux from the star. We describe an alternate normalization method that minimizes star spot effects by deriving and implementing an unspotted proxy spectrum for the normalization. We show that the method works in principle using realistic levels of random observational noise. Alternate normalization would be broadly applicable to all types of transit spectroscopy, and we discuss challenges to applying it in practice. We also outline a comprehensive approach that has the potential to overcome those challenges.</description>

      <title>Sufficient and Necessary Conditions for Collective Neutrino Instability: Fast, Slow, and Mixed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instabilities in collective neutrino oscillations can lead to sizeable flavor conversion with vital astrophysical consequences. While it is now recognized that the initial phase space distributions of the different flavors determine the existence and character of instabilities, a rigorous instability condition for generic distributions -- that depend on both energy and emission angles -- is lacking. In this work we identify, analyze, and explain the conditions that are sufficient (and necessary) for a generic collective neutrino flavor instability.</description>

      <title>The Isaac Newton Telescope Monitoring Survey of Local Group Dwarf Galaxies. VII. Long-Period Variable Stars in the Nearest Starburst Dwarf Galaxy, IC 10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To identify long-period variable (LPV) stars in IC10 - the nearest starburst galaxy of the Local Group (LG) - we conducted an optical monitoring survey using the 2.5-m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) with the wide-field camera (WFC) in the i-band and V-band from 2015 to 2017. We created a photometric catalog for 53,579 stars within the area of CCD4 of WFC ($\sim$ 0.07 deg$^2$ corresponding to 13.5 kpc$^2$ at the distance of IC10), of which we classified 536 and 380 stars as long-period variable candidates (LPVs), mostly asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs) and red supergiants (RSGs), within CCD4 and two half-light radii of IC10, respectively. By comparing our output catalog to the catalogs from Pan-STARRS, Spitzer Space Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and carbon stars from the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope (CFHT) survey, we determined the success of our detection method. We recovered $\sim$ 73% of Spitzer's sources in our catalog and demonstrated that our survey successfully identified 43% of the variable stars found with Spitzer, and also retrieved 40% of the extremely dusty AGB stars among the Spitzer variables. In addition, we successfully identified $\sim$ 70% of HST variables in our catalog. Furthermore, we found all the confirmed LPVs that Gaia DR3 detected in IC10 among our identified LPVs. This paper is the first in a series on IC10, presenting the variable star survey methodology and the photometric catalog, available to the public through the Centre de Donn\'ees Astronomiques de Strasbourg.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a dataset of high resolution spectra of the Sun of many strongly polarized lines belonging to the second solar spectrum, i.e. the spectrum near the limb in linear polarization (scattering polarization). These solar spectra were obtained in full Stokes polarimetry (I, Q/I, U/I, V/I) in the quiet Sun at various distances from the limb, and at disk centre for comparison, with the ground based CNRS THEMIS telescope. Polarization rates Q/I up to 7% are obtained in CaI 4227 {\AA} line at $\mu$ = cos$\theta$ = 0, while 2% is reached in SrI 4607 {\AA} line and 1.4% in BaII 4554 {\AA}. The spectra shown here are freely available in FITS format to the research community.</description>

      <title>Swift/XRT monitoring of the orbital and superorbital modulations in 4U 1909+07</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on an observational campaign performed with Swift/XRT on the wind-fed supergiant X-ray binary 4U 1909+07 to investigate the nature of the orbital and superorbital modulation of its X-ray emission. A total of 137 XRT observations have been carried out, summing up to a total effective exposure time of 114 ks and covering a total of 66 orbital and 19 superorbital cycles of the source. The XRT data folded on the orbital period of the source confirmed and improved the previously reported variability in intensity and absorption column density, which can be ascribed to the neutron star accreting from the wind of its B supergiant companion across a fairly circular orbit. The XRT data folded on the superorbital period did not provide evidence of significant variations in either the absorption column density and/or the power-law photon index. This may be due to a significant weakening of the superorbital modulation during the times when the XRT observations were carried out, as confirmed by the BAT dynamic power spectrum. We discuss the implications of these findings within the corotating interaction region model proposed to interpret the superorbital variability in wind-fed supergiant X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>I-Love-Q Relations of Fermion-Boson Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of fermion-boson stars (FBSs), which can be viewed as neutron stars with a bosonic dark matter (DM) admixture. A challenge in studying the impact of DM on neutron stars is the absence of a universally accepted nuclear-matter equation of state (EOS), making it difficult to distinguish between the effects of DM and various EOS models. To address this issue, we extend the study of the I-Love-Q universal relations of neutron stars to FBSs with a nonrotating bosonic component by solving the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system. We study how DM parameters, such as the boson particle mass and self-interaction strength, would affect the structure of FBSs and explore the parameter space that leads to deviations from the I-Love-Q relations. The properties of FBSs and the level of deviations in general depend sensitively on the DM parameters. For boson particle mass within the range of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-10} \ \mathrm{eV})$, where the Compton wavelength is comparable to the Schwarzschild radius of a $1 M_\odot$ star, the deviation is up to about 5% level if the star contains a few percent of DM admixture. The deviation increases significantly with a higher amount of DM. We also find that the universal relations are still valid to within a 1% deviation level for boson particle mass $m_b \geq 26.8\times10^{-10} \ \mathrm{eV}$. This effectively sets an upper bound on the boson particle mass, beyond which it becomes not feasible to probe the properties of FBSs by investigating the I-Love-Q relation violations.</description>

      <title>Early and Extensive Ultraviolet Through Near Infrared Observations of the Intermediate-Luminosity Type Iax Supernovae 2024pxl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ultraviolet (UV) through near-infrared (NIR) photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby SN 2024pxl, the third Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in NGC 6384. SN 2024pxl is a Type Iax supernova (SN Iax) with an intermediate luminosity ($M_r = -16.99\pm0.32$ mag) and an average SN Iax light curve decline rate. SN 2024pxl was discovered $\sim$3 days after first light, and the rising light curve follows a single power law that is inconsistent with significant interaction with a companion star or circumstellar material. Our extensive NIR photometric coverage is comparable to that of the well-observed SNe Iax 2005hk and 2012Z, and we demonstrate that the $J-H$ colors of SNe Iax differ from normal SNe Ia and appear to be more homogeneous as a class. Spectroscopically, we report the earliest-ever NIR spectrum of a SN Iax as measured from maximum light ($t\approx-9$ days): a featureless continuum with similarities to a $\sim$9,000 K blackbody, and the line velocities are consistent with a mixed-ejecta structure, with C, Si, and Fe having similar velocities and velocity evolutions. We find a tentative correlation between the $H$-band break Co II velocity $\sim$20 days post-peak and absolute magnitude, with more luminous SNe Iax showing faster Co II velocities. Our observations suggest that SN 2024pxl resulted from the thermonuclear disruption of a CO white dwarf star that undergoes deflagration burning.</description>

      <title>Linear Thermal Instability of a Condensing Gas-Particle Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of a hot saturated gas coexisting with condensed particles in an optically thin medium. Such a situation may obtain downstream of a shock, at condensation fronts, or in vaporizing impacts. We show that the gas-particle mixture is subject to a thermal instability whereby a region of lower temperature and higher condensate density cools faster to condense faster. If the region of runaway condensation has a sound-crossing time shorter than its cooling time, then it accretes more mass, in gas and particles, from its higher pressure surroundings. Numerical integration of the linearized perturbation equations demonstrates that this radiation-condensation instability can create particle clumps and voids out of a secularly cooling gas. Provided radiation can escape to cool particle overdensities, thermal instability can help assemble chondrite parent bodies out of the vaporized debris of asteroid collisions, and form planetesimals generally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze 15 years of Fermi-LAT data and produce a detailed model of the Sun's inverse-Compton scattering emission (solar halo), which is powered by interactions between ambient cosmic-ray electrons and positrons with sunlight. By developing a novel analysis method to analyze moving sources, we robustly detect the solar halo at energies between 31.6 MeV and 100 GeV, and angular extensions up to 45$^\circ$ from the Sun, providing new insight into spatial regions where there are no direct measurements of the galactic cosmic-ray flux. The large statistical significance of our signal allows us to sub-divide the data and provide the first $\gamma$-ray probes into the time-variation and azimuthal asymmetry of the solar modulation potential, finding time-dependent changes in solar modulation both parallel and perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. Our results are consistent with (but with independent uncertainties from) local cosmic-ray measurements, unlocking new probes into both astrophysical and beyond-standard-model processes near the solar surface.</description>

      <title>Externally irradiated young stars in NGC 3603. A JWST NIRSpec catalogue of pre-main-sequence stars in a massive star formation region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NGC 3603 is the optically brightest massive star forming region (SFR) in the Milky Way, representing a small scale starburst region. Studying young stars in regions like this allows us to assess how star and planet formation proceeds in a dense clustered environment with high levels of UV radiation. JWST provides the sensitivity, unbroken wavelength coverage, and spatial resolution required to study individual pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in distant massive SFRs in detail for the first time. Using the Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) onboard the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec), multi-object spectroscopy was performed, yielding 100 stellar spectra. We fit the PMS spectra to derive their photospheric properties, extinction, and NIR veiling. From this, we determined the masses and ages of our sources by placing them on the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram (HRD). Their accretion rates were determined by converting the luminosity of hydrogen emission lines to an accretion luminosity. We have classified 42 as actively accreting. Our sources span a range of masses from 0.5 to 7 $M_{\odot}$. Twelve of these accreting sources have ages consistent with $\ge$ 10 Myrs, with four having ages of $\ge$ 15 Myrs. Their mass accretion rates span 5 orders of magnitude and are systematically higher for a given stellar age and mass than for a comparative sample taken from low-mass SFRs. We report an environmental relationship between $\dot{M}_{acc}$ and the density of ambient molecular gas as traced by nebular $H_2$ emission.</description>

      <title>Kinematic evidence of magnetospheric accretion for Herbig Ae stars with JWST NIRSpec</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen emission lines have been used to estimate the mass accretion rate of pre-main-sequence stars for over $25$ years, although the physical origin of these lines is still unclear. Magnetospheric accretion (MA) and magneto-centrifugal winds are the two most often invoked mechanisms. Using a combination of HST photometry and new JWST NIRSpec spectra in the range $1.66 - 3.2 \; \mu m$, we analysed the emission line spectra of five sources to attempt to reveal the physical origin of their hydrogen emission lines. These sources reside in NGC 3603, a Galactic massive star forming region. We performed fits of the SEDs of the five sources employing a Markov chain Monte Carlo exploration to estimate $T_{eff}$, $R_{*}$, $M_{*}$, and $A(V)$ for each source. We performed a kinematic analysis across three spectral series of hydrogen lines (Paschen, Brackett, and Pfund). We studied the full width at half maximum and optical depth of the lines in order to constrain the emission origin. We calculated the expected velocities from MA as well as gas in Keplerian orbit for our sources. All five sources have SEDs consistent with young intermediate-mass stars. We classified three of these sources as Herbig Ae type stars based on their $T_{eff}$. Hydrogen lines with high upper energy levels $n_{up}$ tend to be significantly broader than lines with a lower $n_{up}$. The optical depth of the emission lines is also highest for the high-velocity component of each line, and it becomes optically thin in the low-velocity component. Emission from magneto-centrifugal winds is not consistent with any of our observations. Two sources are consistent with emission from a Keplerian disc, or MA. The remaining three sources are only consistent with emission from MA. In the future, this approach can be applied to more statistically significant samples of Herbig AeBe spectra, including existing archival observations.</description>

      <title>SIEGE III: The formation of dense stellar clusters in sub-parsec resolution cosmological simulations with individual star feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Star clusters stand at the crossroads between galaxies and single stars. Resolving the formation of star clusters in cosmological simulations represents an ambitious and challenging goal, since modelling their internal properties requires very high resolution. This paper is the third of a series within the SImulating the Environment where Globular clusters Emerged (SIEGE) project, where we conduct zoom-in cosmological simulations with sub-parsec resolution that include the feedback of individual stars, aimed to model the formation of star clusters in high-redshift proto-galaxies. We investigate the role of three fundamental quantities in shaping the intrinsic properties of star clusters, i. e., i) pre-supernova stellar feedback (continuous or instantaneous ejection of mass and energy through stellar winds); ii) star formation efficiency, defined as the fraction of gas converted into stars per freefall time, for which we test 2 different values (epsi_ff=0.1 and 1), and iii) stellar initial mass function (IMF, standard vs top-heavy). All our simulations are run down to z=10.5, which is sufficient for investigating some structural properties of the emerging clumps and clusters. [Abridged] The prescription for a continuous, low-intensity feedback, along with the adoption of epsi_ff=1, produces star clusters with maximum stellar density values up to 10^4 M_sun pc^(-2), in good agreement with the surface density-size relation observed in local young star clusters (YSCs). Therefore, a realistic stellar wind description and a high star formation effiency are the key ingredients that allow us to achieve realistic star clusters characterised by properties comparable to those of local YSCs. In contrast, the other models produce too diffuse clusters, in particular the one with a top-heavy IMF.</description>

      <title>Difficulties of two exploding white dwarfs to account for type Ia supernovae with bimodal nebular emission profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a simple dynamical scheme to simulate the ejecta of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) scenarios with two exploding white dwarfs (WDs) and find that the velocity distribution of the ejecta has difficulties accounting for bimodal emission line profiles with a large separation between the two emission peaks. The essence of the dynamical code is in including the fact that the ejecta does not leave the system instantaneously. We find that the final separation velocity between the centers of masses of the two WDs' ejecta is ~80% of the pre-explosion WDs' orbital velocity, i.e., we find separation velocities of 4200-5400 km/s for two WDs of masses M1=M2=0.94 Mo. The lower separation velocities we find challenge scenarios with two exploding WDs to explain bimodal emission line profiles with observed velocity separations of up to ~7000 km/s. Only the mass in the ejecta of one WD with an explosion velocity lower than the separation velocity contributes to one peak of the bimodal profile; this is the inner ejecta. We find the inner ejecta to be only &lt;15% of the ejecta mass in energetic explosions. Less energetic explosions yield higher inner mass but lower separation velocities. We encourage searching for alternative explanations of bimodal line profiles.</description>

      <title>DAmodel: Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling of DA White Dwarfs for Spectrophotometric Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use hierarchical Bayesian modelling to calibrate a network of 32 all-sky faint DA white dwarf (DA WD) spectrophotometric standards ($16.5 &lt; V &lt; 19.5$) alongside three CALSPEC standards, from 912 \r{A} to 32 $\mu$m. The framework is the first of its kind to jointly infer photometric zeropoints and WD parameters (surface gravity $\log g$, effective temperature $T_{\text{eff}}$, extinction $A_V$, dust relation parameter $R_V$) by simultaneously modelling both photometric and spectroscopic data. We model panchromatic Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3) UVIS and IR photometry, HST/STIS UV spectroscopy and ground-based optical spectroscopy to sub-percent precision. Photometric residuals for the sample are the lowest yet yielding $&lt;0.004$ mag RMS on average from the UV to the NIR, achieved by jointly inferring time-dependent changes in system sensitivity and WFC3/IR count-rate nonlinearity. Our GPU-accelerated implementation enables efficient sampling via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, critical for exploring the high-dimensional posterior space. The hierarchical nature of the model enables population analysis of intrinsic WD and dust parameters. Inferred spectral energy distributions from this model will be essential for calibrating the James Webb Space Telescope as well as next-generation surveys, including Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Beyond monoculture: polydisperse moment methods for sub-stellar atmosphere cloud microphysics I. Examining properties of the exponential distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10309v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observational data provided by JWST instruments continue to challenge theories and models of cloud formation in sub-stellar atmospheres, requiring more sophisticated approaches in an effort to understand their spatial complexity. However, to date, most cloud microphysical models using the moment method for sub-stellar atmospheres have assumed a monodisperse size distribution, neglecting polydisperse properties. We aim to extend beyond the common assumption of a monodisperse size distribution and analyse cloud microphysical processes assuming an exponential distribution. We derive expressions for the zeroth and first moments of condensation/evaporation and collisional growth processes under the assumption of an exponential size distribution. We then compare the differences between monodisperse and exponential distribution microphysics using a simple one-dimensional (1D) column model applied to a Y-dwarf KCl cloud scenario. We find that adopting an exponential distribution modifies condensation/evaporation rates by a factor of $\approx$0.9 and collisional growth rates by factors of $&gt;$1.1 (Kn $\ll$ 1) and $\approx$1.37 (Kn $\gg$ 1) for Brownian coagulation and $\approx$0.85 for gravitational coalescence, compared to the monodisperse case. In our specific test cases, we find maximal relative differences of $&gt;$200\% in total number density and $&gt;$40\% in mean radius of the cloud particles between the monodisperse and exponential distributions. Our framework offer a simple way to take into account polydispersity with an assumed exponential size distribution for sub-stellar atmospheric cloud microphysics using a two-moment method. In follow up studies, we will examine more complex distributions, such as the log-normal and gamma distributions, that require more than two moments to characterise self-consistently.</description>

      <title>Exploring GRBs and supernovae connection: does a superluminous hypernova population exist?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of several gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that are temporally and spatially compatible with energetic supernovae (hypernovae) has established their common origin. In one case (GRB 111209A/SN 2011kl) the associated supernova was classified as superluminous (SN 2011kl). The exceptional duration of the observed gamma-ray prompt emission of GRB 111209A (about 7 hours) is widely considered key to unlocking the physics behind the still mysterious origin of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). We review the main observational and theoretical findings that may link some ultra-long GRBs to SLSNe. Specifically, we examine notable events, the role of progenitors and host galaxies in shaping these phenomena, and focus on the proposed models. While a magnetar central engine is a plausible mechanism for both luminous and long-duration GRBs, a conclusive answer remains elusive, as alternative explanations are still viable. Further observational and theoretical work is required to clarify progenitor pathways and explosion mechanisms, potentially extending the classical GRB-SN connection to rare superluminous hypernovae.</description>
