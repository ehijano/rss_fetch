      <title>Ray tracing simulations of bending magnet sources with SHADOW4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explain the algorithm employed in SHADOW4 to generate bending magnet sources. We provide an overview of the fundamental equations used to calculate the spectral and angular distributions of synchrotron emission from bending magnets. We outline the procedures for ray sampling. We present examples for intensity and polarization of the bending magnet at the old ESRF1 storage ring, and phase spaces for the bending magnet of the upcoming ALSU ring. Finally, we discuss the calculation of the effective source size and compare it with ray tracing.</description>

      <title>Linac_Gen: integrating machine learning and particle-in-cell methods for enhanced beam dynamics at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we introduce Linac_Gen, a tool developed at Fermilab, which combines machine learning algorithms with Particle-in-Cell methods to advance beam dynamics in linacs. Linac_Gen employs techniques such as Random Forest, Genetic Algorithms, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, achieving a tenfold increase in speed for phase-space matching in linacs over traditional methods through the use of genetic algorithms. Crucially, Linac_Gen's adept handling of 3D field maps elevates the precision and realism in simulating beam instabilities and resonances, marking a key advancement in the field. Benchmarked against established codes, Linac_Gen demonstrates not only improved efficiency and precision in beam dynamics studies but also in the design and optimization of linac systems, as evidenced in its application to Fermilab's PIP-II linac project. This work represents a notable advancement in accelerator physics, marrying ML with PIC methods to set new standards for efficiency and accuracy in accelerator design and research. Linac_Gen exemplifies a novel approach in accelerator technology, offering substantial improvements in both theoretical and practical aspects of beam dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dedicated beam position monitor pair for model-independent lattice characterization at NSLS-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports recent lattice characterization results obtained at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) storage ring, conducted without reliance on a lattice model. A pair of beam position monitors (BPMs) with bunch-by-bunch (B$\times$B) resolution, were recently installed in a section of the storage ring free of magnetic fields. The new BPM pair measured the beam, or bunch's transverse Poincar\'e map precisely after the beam was excited. Linear one-turn-matrices (OTM) were then derived, and from these, the 4-dimensional coupled Twiss parameters were extracted at the locations of the BPM pair. By normalizing beam oscillation amplitudes with the Twiss parameters, the global action-variables were obtained. These action-variables facilitated the measurement of the local Twiss parameters observed by other BPMs independent on lattice model. This method is general, and particularly useful in certain scenarios such as a round beam mode in a diffraction-limited light source ring. We applied it to assess both weakly and strongly coupled lattices at the NSLS-II ring. Through analysis of the strongly coupled lattice, the quadrupole tilt errors were estimated to be less than 400 \si{\mu}rad. Utilizing the BPMs' B$\times$B resolution, for the first time we observed the variations of the linear lattice along a long bunch-train.</description>

      <title>Experimental Observation of Motion of Ions in a Resonantly Driven Plasma Wakefield Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe for the first time an effect on the driver caused by the motion of ions in a plasma wakefield accelerator. The effect manifests itself as a beam tail, which only occurs when sufficient motion of ions suppresses wakefields. By changing the plasma ions (helium, argon, xenon) in the experiment, we show that the effect depends inversely on the ion mass, as predicted from theory and simulations. Wakefields are driven resonantly by multiple bunches, and simulation results indicate that the ponderomotive force causes the motion of ions. In this case, the effect is also expected to depend on the amplitude of the wakefields, as also observed by varying the bunch charge.</description>

      <title>Coupled Axial and Transverse Currents Method for Finite Element Modelling of Periodic Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the Coupled Axial and Transverse currents (I) (CATI) method, as an efficient and accurate finite element approach for modelling the electric and magnetic behavior of periodic composite superconducting conductors. The method consists of a pair of two-dimensional models coupled via circuit equations to account for the conductor geometrical periodicity. This allows to capture three-dimensional effects with two-dimensional models and leads to a significant reduction in computational time compared to conventional three-dimensional models. After presenting the method in detail, we verify it by comparison with reference finite element models, focussing on its application to twisted multifilamentary superconducting strands. In particular, we show that the CATI method captures the transition from uncoupled to coupled filaments, with accurate calculation of the interfilament coupling time constant. We then illustrate the capabilities of the method by generating a detailed loss map and magnetization curves of given strand types for a range of external transverse magnetic field excitations, with and without transport current.</description>
