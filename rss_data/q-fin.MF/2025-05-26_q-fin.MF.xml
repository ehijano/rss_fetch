      <title>Bulls vs Bears: a Trinomial Model of a Financial Asset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a variation of the well-known binomial model of asset prices. This variation incorporates a bound to short-selling, inspired by a model from Gunduz Caginalp[2]. We formalize this model and prove a formula for all the moments of the logarithmic returns. We also derive a formula for the case with infinitely many investors. As an application of the model, we show how to compute parameters in order to approximate given moments, enabling the modeling of skewness and excess kurtosis. Finally, we generalize the model and give the corresponding formula for the moments of the logarithmic returns, and the algorithm for fitting given moments.</description>

      <title>A deep solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first deep-learning solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs) and their fully-coupled forward-backward variants. The method trains a neural network to approximate the two solution fields in a single stage, avoiding the use of nested time-stepping cycles that limit classical algorithms. For the decoupled case we prove a non-asymptotic error bound composed of an a posteriori residual plus the familiar square root dependence on the time step. Numerical experiments confirm this rate and reveal two key properties: \emph{scalability}, in the sense that accuracy remains stable from low dimension up to 500 spatial variables while GPU batching keeps wall-clock time nearly constant; and \emph{generality}, since the same method handles coupled systems whose forward dynamics depend on the backward solution. These results open practical access to a family of high-dimensional, path-dependent problems in stochastic control and quantitative finance.</description>

      <title>Particle Systems with Local Interactions via Hitting Times and Cascades on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study particle systems interacting via hitting times on sparsely connected graphs, following the framework of Lacker, Ramanan and Wu (2023). We provide general robustness conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of physical solutions to the dynamics, and demonstrate their connections to the dynamic percolation theory. We then study the limiting behavior of the particle systems, establishing the continuous dependence of the joint law of the physical solution on the underlying graph structure with respect to local convergence and showing the convergence of the global empirical measure, which extends the general results by Lacker et al. to systems with singular interaction. The model proposed provides a general framework for analyzing systemic risks in large sparsely connected financial networks with a focus on local interactions, featuring instantaneous default cascades.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Risk Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for risk sharing that generalizes earlier models based on discrete agents and extends them to allow for sharing risk within a continuum of agents. Agents are represented by points of a measure space and have potentially heterogeneous risk preferences modeled by risk measures. The existence of risk minimizing allocations is proved when constrained to satisfy economically convincing conditions. In the unconstrained case, we derive the dual representation of the value function using a Strassen-type theorem for the weak-star topology. These results are illustrated by explicit formulas when risk preferences are within the family of entropic and expected shortfall risk measures.</description>
