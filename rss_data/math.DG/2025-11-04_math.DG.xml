      <title>Regularity of conformal structures on closed 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known in Riemannian geometry that the metric components have the best regularity in harmonic coordinates. These can be used to characterize the most regular element in the isometry class of a rough Riemannian metric. In this work, we study the conformal analogue problem on closed 3-manifolds: given a Riemannian metric $g$ of class $W^{2,q}$ with $q &gt; 3$, we characterize when a more regular representative exists in its conformal class. We highlight a deep link to the Yamabe problem for rough metrics and present some immediate applications to conformally flat, static and Einstein manifolds.</description>

      <title>How periodic surfaces bend without stretching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many compliant shell mechanisms are periodically corrugated or creased. Being thin, their preferred deformation modes are inextensional, i.e., isometric. Here, we report on a recent characterization of the isometric deformations of periodic surfaces. In a way reminiscent of Gauss theorem, the result builds a constraint that relates the ways in which the periodic surface stretches, effectively but isometrically, to the ways in which it bends and twists. Several examples and use cases are presented.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Embeddings of K\"alerian Symmetric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we investigate some properties of equivariant embeddings of a symmetric K\"ahlerian manifold. Motivated by a theorem of Cartan and Wallach on equivariant embeddings of symmetric spaces we characterize these embeddings in the special case of $\mathbb{CP}^n$. Further, we verify that if a equivariant embedding has parallel plurimean curvature then it is the extrinsically symmetric one.</description>

      <title>Stability of volume and area preserving mean curvature flow in asymptotic Schwarzschild space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stability of the volume preserving mean curvature flow (VPMCF) and area preserving mean curvature flow (APMCF) in the Schwarzschild space. We show that if the initial hypersurface is sufficiently close to a coordinate sphere, these flows exist globally in time and converge smoothly to a constant mean curvature (CMC) hypersurface, namely a coordinate sphere. For asymptotically Schwarzschild space, if the initial hypersurface has pinched curvature outside of some large compact set, we will similar method combined with the center manifold analysis to see that the flow still exists for long time and converges to CMC hypersurface exponentially fast. This in particular gives an existence result for a CMC hypersurface in asymptotically flat space.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional nonholonomic and vakonomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a collection of infinite-dimensional systems with nonholonomic constraints. In finite dimensions the two essentially different types of dynamics, nonholonomic or vakonomic ones, are known to be obtained by taking certain limits of holonomic systems with Rayleigh dissipation, as in [Koz83]. After visualizing this phenomenon for the classical example of a skate on an inclined plane, we discuss its higher-dimensional analogue, the kinematics of a car with $n$ trailers, as well as its limit as $n\to \infty$. We show that its infinite-dimensional version is a snake-like motion of the Chaplygin sleigh with a string, and it is subordinated to an infinite-dimensional Goursat distribution.
  Other examples of nonholonomic and vakonomic systems include subriemannian and Euler-Poincar\'e-Suslov systems on infinite-dimensional Lie groups, the Heisenberg chain, the general Camassa-Holm equation, infinite-dimensional geometry of a nonholonomic Moser theorem, parity-breaking nonholonomic fluids, and potential solutions to Burgers-type equations arising in optimal mass transport.</description>

      <title>Time Separation and Scattering Rigidity for Analytic Lorentzian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we prove the following three rigidity results: (i) in a real-analytic globally hyperbolic spacetime $(M,g)$ without boundary, the time separation function restricted to a thin exterior layer of a unknown compact subset $K \subset M$ determines $K$ up to an analytic isometry, assuming no lightlike cut points in $K$; (ii) in a real-analytic globally hyperbolic spacetime $(M,g)$ with timelike boundary, the boundary time separation function determines $M$ up to an analytic isometry, assuming no lightlike cut points near $M$ and lightlike geodesics are non-trapping; (iii) in a real-analytic Lorentzian manifold $(M,g)$ with timelike boundary, the interior and complete scattering relations near the light cone, each determines $M$ up to an analytic isometry, assuming that lightlike geodesics are non-trapping. We emphasize in all of these three cases we do not assume the convexity of the boundary of the subset or the manifold. Moreover, in (iii) we do not assume causality of the Lorentzian manifold, and allow the existence of cut points. Along the way, we also prove some boundary determination results, the connections between the interior and complete scattering relations, and the connections between the lens data and the scattering relation, for Riemannian manifolds and Lorentzian manifolds with boundaries.</description>

      <title>Minimal Degrees, Volume Growth, and Curvature Decay on Complete Kaehler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider noncompact complete Kaehler manifolds with nonnegative bisectional curvature. Our main results are: (1) Precise estimates among refined minimal degree of polynomial growth holomorphic functions and holomorphic volume forms, AVR (asymptotic volume ratio) and ASCD (average of scalar curvature decay) are established. (2) The Lyapunov asymptotic behavior of the Kaehler-Ricci flow can be described in terms of polynomial growth holomorphic functions. This provides a unifying perspective that bridges the two distinct proofs of Yau's uniformization conjecture. These resolve two conjectures made by Yang.</description>

Abstract: Algebraists asked whether or not an operator on the module of smooth sections of the tangent bundle over the commutative ring of smooth functions of a smooth (orientable) manifold (can be any piece of a compact or a complete manifold) can be characterized by two axioms. In this note we confirm this for any smooth manifold M under the assumption that H^1(M, R) = {0}.</description>

      <title>On the structure of almost Yamabe solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study structures of almost Yamabe solitons which are not necessarily gradient. First, we investigate conditions that both compact and noncompact almost Yamabe solitons become trivial solitons which means the given vector field is a Killing vector field. Second, we show that an almost Yamabe soliton whose vector field is closed admits a local warped product structure with a one-dimensional base. This result can be considered as a generalization of a result in \cite{c-s-z} and \cite{c-m-m}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the length of the shortest nontrivial geodesic loops on the Stiefel manifold endowed with any member of the one-parameter family of Riemannian metrics introduced by H\"uper et al. (2021). This family includes, in particular, the canonical and Euclidean metrics. By combining existing and new bounds on the sectional curvature, we determine the exact value of the injectivity radius of the Stiefel manifold under a wide range of members of the metric family.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the behavior of geodesics on cones over arbitrary $C^3$-smooth closed Riemannian manifolds.
  We show that the geodesic flow on such cones admits first integrals whose values uniquely determine almost all geodesics except for cone generatrices. This investigation is inspired by our results on billiards inside cones over manifolds where similar results hold true.</description>

      <title>Mixed Killing vector field and almost coK\"{a}hler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vector field $V$ on any (semi-)Riemannian manifold is said to be mixed Killing if for some nonzero smooth function $f$, it satisfies $L_VL_Vg=fL_Vg$, where $L_V$ is the Lie derivative along $V$. This class of vector fields, as a generalization of Killing vector fields, not only identify the isometries of the manifolds, but broadly also contain the class of homothety transformations. We prove an essential curvature identity along those fields on any (semi-)Riemannian manifold and thus generalize the Bochner's theorem for Killing vector fields in this setting. Later we study it in the framework of almost coK\"{a}hler structure and we prove that the Reeb vector field $\xi$ on an almost coK\"{a}hler manifold is mixed Killing if and only if the operator $h=0$. Moving further, we completely classify almost coK\"{a}hler manifolds with $\xi$ mixed Killing vector field in dimension 3. In particular, if $\xi$ on an $\eta$-Einstein almost coK\"{a}hler manifold is mixed Killing, then the manifold is of constant scalar curvature with $h=0$. Also we show that on any $(\kappa,\mu)$-almost coK\"{a}hler manifold, $\xi$ is mixed Killing if and only if the manifold is coK\"{a}hler. In the end we present few model examples in this context.</description>

      <title>Toric separable geometries and extremal K\"ahler metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the framework of (local) toric separable geometries, where separable geometries come in families, each uniquely determined by an underlying factorization structure. This unifying framework captures all known explicit Calabi-extremal toric K\"ahler metrics, previously constructed through diverse methods, as two distinct families corresponding to the simplest factorization structures: the product Segre and the Veronese factorization structure. Crucially, the moduli of typical factorization structures has a positive dimension, revealing an immensely rich and previously untapped landscape of toric separable geometries. The scalar curvature of toric separable geometries is computed explicitly, necessary conditions for the PDE governing extremality are derived, and new extremal metrics are obtained systematically. In particular, for a $2m$-dimensional toric separable geometry, solutions of the PDE are necessarily $m$-tuples of rational functions of one variable belonging to an at most $(m+2)$-dimensional real vector space and whose denominators are determined by the factorization structure. Toric separable geometries serve as a separation of variables technique and are well-suited for the analytic study of geometric PDEs.</description>

Abstract: In this follow-up article to Symplectification of Circular Arcs and Arc Splines, biarc geometry is examined from a purely geometric point of view. Two given points together with their associated tangent vectors in the plane are sufficient to define two directed, consecutive circular arcs. However, there remains one degree of freedom to determine the join point of both arcs. There are various approaches to this in the literature. A novel one is presented here.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Lefschetz fibrations with four-dimensional fibers from Seiberg--Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish constraints on the topology of smooth Lefschetz fibrations with $4$-dimensional fibers, by studying the family Bauer-Furuta invariant. To compute this invariant, we analyze the framed bordism class of 1-dimensional Seiberg--Witten moduli spaces using the local index theorem by Bismut--Freed. Using this, we deduce new obstructions to the smooth isotopy to the identity for compositions of Dehn twists on $(-2)$--spheres in closed $4$-manifolds. We obtain several applications: (1) We exhibit the first examples of closed simply-connected symplectic $4$-manifolds admitting Torelli symplectomorphisms which are smoothly non-trivial. In particular, their symplectic Torelli mapping class group is not generated by squared Dehn--Seidel twists on Lagrangian spheres -- providing a negative answer to a question of Donaldson. (2) We provide the first examples of irreducible closed $4$-manifolds (both symplectic and non-symplectic) that admit exotic diffeomorphisms given by Seifert-fibered Dehn twist.</description>

      <title>The Fourth Geometry I: Difference--Angle Geometry Beyond Euclid, Hyperbolic, and Elliptic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a new geometry based on the difference angle, defined as the difference of slopes of two lines, together with a system of axioms for angles. This framework provides a constructive approach to the fundamental question "What is an angle?", showing that an angular quantity can be defined independently of circles or rotations as a primary notion. Within this geometry we define difference-angle triangles, norms, bisectors, perpendiculars, and inner products. Distinctive features emerge that are absent in existing geometries: the triangle inequality degenerates to equality, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is zero, the Miquel point exists for parabolas, and numerous analogies with classical theorems in Euclidean geometry appear. These results position difference--angle geometry as a promising candidate for a fourth geometry beyond Euclidean, hyperbolic, and elliptic.</description>

      <title>Mixed superposition rules for Lie systems and compatible geometric structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed superposition rules are, in short, a method to describe the general solutions of a time-dependent system of first-order differential equations, a so-called Lie system, in terms of particular solutions of other ones. This article is concerned with the theory of mixed superposition rules and their connections with geometric structures. We provide methods to obtain mixed superposition rules for systems admitting an imprimitive finite-dimensional Lie algebra of vector fields or given by a semidirect sum. In particular, we develop a novel mixed coalgebra method for Lie systems that are Hamiltonian relative to a Dirac structure, which is quite general, although we restrict to symplectic and contact manifolds in applications. This provides us with practical methods to derive mixed superposition rules and extends the coalgebra method to a new field of application while solving minor technical issues of the known formalism. Throughout the paper, we apply our results to physical systems including Schr\"odinger Lie systems, Riccati systems, time-dependent Calogero-Moser systems with external forces, time-dependent harmonic oscillators, and time-dependent thermodynamical systems, where general solutions can be obtained from reduced system solutions. Our results are finally extended to Lie systems of partial differential equations and a new source of such PDE Lie systems, related to the determination of approximate solutions of PDEs, is provided. An example based on the Tzitz\'eica equation and a related system is given.</description>

      <title>Boundary estimates for a fully nonlinear Yamabe problem on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Dirichlet boundary value problem for fully nonlinear Yamabe equations on Riemannian manifolds with boundary. Assuming the existence of a subsolution, we derive \emph{a priori} boundary second derivative estimates and consequently obtain the existence of a smooth solution. Moreover, with respect to a family of equations interpolating the fully nonlinear Yamabe equation and the classical semi-linear Yamabe equation, our estimates remain uniform. Finally, an example of a $C^1$ solution which is smooth in the interior but not smooth at the boundary is also given.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a generalized Stokes operator on smooth bounded domains via layer-potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the invertibility of the relevant single and double layer potentials associated to some generalizations of the Stokes operator on bounded domains. In order to do that, we first develop an ``algebra tool kit'' to deal with limit and jump relations of layer operators. We do that first on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for operators acting on a distribution supported on $\{x_{n} = 0\}$ and then in general on (possibly non-compact manifolds). We use these results to study the limit and jump relations of the layer potential operators associated to our generalized Stokes operators. In turn, we then use these results to prove the Fredholm property of single and double layer potentials of the generalized Stokes operator and even their invertibility when the auxiliary potentials satisfy suitable non-vanishing conditions.</description>

Abstract: We first streamline the construction of the unique six-dimensional conformal gravity action found by L\"u, Pang and Pope, that admits Einstein metrics as solutions to the field equations. We then prove that there exists a unique eight-dimensional conformal gravity action that admits Einstein metrics as solutions to the field equations, and explicitly build the corresponding action. Finally, we relate these results to Branson's Q-curvature and the Fefferman-Graham obstruction tensor, to conclude that on every even-dimensional space there exists a unique -- up to boundary terms -- conformally-invariant gravity theory that is extremised by Einstein metrics.</description>

Abstract: On Boxing Day, 1838, Jacobi found a solution to the problem of geodesics on a triaxial ellipsoid, with the course of the geodesic and the distance along it given in terms of one-dimensional integrals. Here, a numerical implementation of this solution is described. This entails accurately evaluating the integrals and solving the resulting coupled system of equations. The inverse problem, finding the shortest path between two points on the ellipsoid, can then be solved using a similar method as for biaxial ellipsoids.</description>

      <title>On energy and its positivity in spacetimes with an expanding flat de Sitter background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The positive energy theorems are a fundamental pillar in mathematical general relativity. Originally proved by Schoen-Yau and later Witten, these theorems were established for asymptotically flat manifolds where the metric tends to the standard Euclidean metric and whose second fundamental form decays to zero at infinity. This ansatz on the metric and second fundamental form is motivated by the desire to model an isolated gravitational system with a Minkowski space background for the spacetime. However, actual astrophysical massive objects are not truly isolated but rather exist within an expanding cosmological universe, where the second fundamental form is umbilic. With this in mind, we seek a notion of energy for initial data sets with an umbilic second fundamental form. In this work, we present a definition of energy in such an expanding cosmological setting. Instead of Minkowski space, we take de Sitter space as the background spacetime, which, when written in flat-expanding coordinates, is foliated by umbilic hypersurfaces each isometric to Euclidean 3-space. This cosmological setting necessitates a quasi-local energy definition, as the presence of a cosmological horizon in de Sitter space obstructs a global one. We define energy in this quasi-local setting by adapting the Liu-Yau energy to our framework and establish positivity of this energy for certain bounded values of the cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>The Regularity of Critical Points to the Dirichlet Energy of the Mean Curvature in Dimension 4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that weak immersions of four dimensional manifolds in $\mathbb{R}^5$ which are critical points to the Dirichlet Energy of the Mean Curvature are analytic in any given local harmonic chart. This variational problem is a model case for the large family of scaling invariant Lagrangians, hence critical, of curvature energies in 4 dimensions depending on the first and the second fundamental form. Because of the criticality of this variational problem, the regularity result is obtained through an abundant use of methods from integrability by compensation theory such as interpolation spaces estimates.</description>

      <title>The weighted ambient metric for manifolds with density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence and uniqueness of a weighted analogue of the Fefferman-Graham ambient metric for manifolds with density. We then show that this ambient metric forms the natural geometric framework for the singular Ricci flow: given a singular gradient Ricci flow spacetime in the Kleiner-Lott sense, we construct a unique global ambient half-space from it. We also prove the converse, that every global ambient space contains a singular gradient Ricci flow spacetime, thereby completing the correspondence. Our main application is the construction of infinite families of fully non-linear analogues of Perelman's $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{W}$ functionals. We extend Perelman's monotonicity result to these two families of functionals under several conditions, including for shrinking solitons and Einstein manifolds. We do so by constructing a "Ricci flow vector field" in the ambient space, which may be of independent research interest. We also prove that the weighted GJMS operators associated with the weighted ambient metric are formally self-adjoint, and that the associated weighted renormalized volume coefficients are variational.</description>

      <title>Deformations of calibrated subbundles in noncompact manifolds of special holonomy via twisting by special sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study special Lagrangian submanifolds in the Calabi-Yau manifold $T^*S^n$ with the Stenzel metric, as well as calibrated submanifolds in the $\text{G}_2$-manifold $\Lambda^2_-(T^*X)$ $(X^4 = S^4, \mathbb{CP}^2)$ and the $\text{Spin}(7)$-manifold $\$_{\!-}(S^4)$, both equipped with the Bryant-Salamon metrics. We twist naturally defined calibrated subbundles by sections of the complementary bundles and derive conditions for the deformations to be calibrated. We find that twisting the conormal bundle $N^*L$ of $L^q \subset S^n$ by a $1$-form $\mu \in \Omega^1(L)$ does not provide any new examples because the Lagrangian condition requires $\mu$ to vanish. Furthermore, we prove that the twisted bundles in the $\text{G}_2$- and $\text{Spin}(7)$-manifolds are associative (coassociative) and Cayley, respectively, if the base is minimal (negative superminimal) and the section holomorphic (parallel). This demonstrates that the (co-)associative and Cayley subbundles allow deformations destroying the linear structure of the fiber, while the base space remains of the same type after twisting. While the results for the two spaces of exceptional holonomy are in line with the findings in Euclidean spaces established by Karigiannis and Leung (2012), the special Lagrangian bundle construction in $T^*S^n$ is much more rigid than in the case of $T^*\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>Do Riemannian Submersions Preserve Positive Intermediate Ricci Curvature?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pro and the third author showed that there are Riemannian submersions $\pi: M \to B$ with $M$ a compact manifold with positive Ricci curvature, whose base $B$, has Ricci curvatures with both signs. Thus, Riemannian submersions need not preserve positive Ricci curvature. In this note we establish the degree to which this result extends into the setting of positive intermediate Ricci curvature.
  It is an immediate consequence of the Gray--O'Neill Horizontal curvature equation that if $\pi: M\to B$ is a Riemannian submersion whose base is $b$-dimensional and $\mathrm{Ric}_{k}(M) &gt;0$ for any $k \in \{ 1,2,\cdots, b-1\}$, then $ \mathrm{Ric}_{k}(B)$ is also positive. Here we show that this observation is optimal in the following strong sense:
  For $k \geq \mathrm{dim}(B)$, let $\pi: (M,g_M) \to (B,g_B)$ be a Riemannian submersion from a complete Riemannian manifold with $\mathrm{Ric}_{k}(M) &gt;0$. We show how to perturb $g_M$ in the $C^1$-topology to produce a Riemannian submersion $\pi: (M,\tilde{g}_M) \to (B,\tilde{g}_B)$ whose total space has $\mathrm{Ric}_{k} &gt;0$, but whose base has Ricci curvature of both signs.
  In particular, this shows that Riemannian submersions that do not preserve positive Ricci curvature are dense in the $C^1$-topology among the complete metrics on $M$ with $\mathrm{Ric}&gt;0$ for which a given submersion $\pi: M\to B$ is Riemannian.</description>

      <title>On Geometry and Topology of Hessian Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01176v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a differentiable manifold $M$, a pair $(M, \nabla)$ is termed an affine manifold, if $\nabla$ is a flat and torsion-free connection on the tangent bundle $TM\rightarrow M$. A Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ is called a Hessian metric on $(M, \nabla)$, if $g$ can be expressed locally as the Hessian quadratic form $\nabla(df)$ of some smooth potential $f$. An affine manifold equipped with a Hessian metric is termed a Hessian manifold. We study the topology and geometry of Hessian manifolds.
  Key topological constraints are derived, including the vanishing of the Euler characteristic for any compact Hessian manifold and infinite torsion-freeness of its fundamental group. We demonstrate that compact Hessian manifolds with an abelian fundamental group are homeomorphic to the flat torus. The theory of flat line bundles is developed to introduce the Picard group and the canonical class, which are used to prove that a curved compact orientable Hessian manifold must be a mapping torus. Various curvature properties are then discussed. As an application, we prove that all compact Hessian-Einstein manifolds are flat.
  A Hessian manifold $((M, \nabla),g)$ is said to be of Koszul type, if there exists a $1$-form $\eta\in\Omega^1(M)$ such that $g=\nabla\eta$. We place emphasis on Hessian manifolds of Koszul type, establishing an equivalence between their existence and that of positive flat line bundles, space-like Lagrangian embeddings, and hyperbolic affine structures. A duality with radiant manifolds, analogous to the classical Legendre transformation, is explored. We also develop a Heisenberg principle on Hessian manifolds with Cheng-Yau metrics as its minimum uncertainty states, and then classify all complete Hessian surfaces and closed Hessian $3$-folds.</description>

      <title>A YTD correspondence for constant scalar curvature metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a compact K\"ahler manifold, to better understand Mabuchi's $K$ energy we introduce a family of $K^\beta$ energies, whose favorable properties are similar to those of the Ding energy from the Fano case. The construction uses Berman's transcendental quantization, and we show that the slope of the $K^\beta$ energies along test configurations can be computed using intersection theory. With these ingredients in place we provide a uniform Yau-Tian-Donaldson correspondence that characterizes the existence of a unique constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metric using test configurations. Combining our techniques with the non-Archimedean approach to $K$-stability pioneered by Boucksom--Jonsson, we show that the properness of the classical $K$ energy can be tested by checking its slope along a distinguished subclass of Chi Li-type models, called log discrepancy models, thus yielding another $G$-uniform Yau--Tian--Donaldson correspondence.</description>

      <title>Hilbert's fourth problem in the constant curvature setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hilbert's fourth problem seeks the classification of metric geometries where straight lines are shortest paths. Its regular case identifies the projectively flat Finsler manifolds. This broader framework breaks the equivalence between projective flatness and constant curvature that holds in the Riemannian setting, creating a more intricate classification problem.
  This paper resolves the long-standing question of how the local structure determines the global topology for such manifolds of constant flag curvature, where flag curvature is the natural generalization of Riemannian sectional curvature. We derive explicit distance formulas for all cases of constant flag curvature. For non-positive constant curvature, we establish a global classification of forward complete manifolds, a uniqueness theorem for forward complete metrics, and a characterization of maximal domains of metrics where exotic examples are constructed. For positive constant curvature, we prove a maximum diameter theorem and show the completion of such manifold is a sphere. A fundamental connection is revealed between Sobolev space nonlinearity and backward incompleteness. This work provides a complete characterization of the global geometry for the regular case of Hilbert's fourth problem with constant flag curvature.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz inextendibility of weak null singularities from curvature blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-inextendibility of weak null singularities without any symmetry assumptions. The proof introduces a new strategy to infer $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-inextendibility from the blow-up of curvature. The assumed blow-up is expected to be satisfied for weak null singularities in the interior of generic rotating black holes. Thus, we expect the result presented here to directly contribute to the resolution of the $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-formulation of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture in a neighbourhood of subextremal Kerr.</description>

      <title>Positivity of simplicial volume for closed nonpositively curved four-manifolds with nonzero Euler characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, by employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for Riemannian simplices due to Allendoerfer and Weil, we show that if a closed nonpositively curved $4$-manifold has nonzero Euler characteristic, then its simplicial volume is necessarily positive. This result partially resolves conjectures posed by Connell-Ruan-Wang and Gromov concerning the relationship between the simplicial volume and the Euler characteristic for four-dimensional manifolds. As an application, we show that if a closed nonpositively curved $4$-manifold has negative Ricci curvature, then its simplicial volume is positive, thereby confirming in dimension four another conjecture of Gromov on the positivity of simplicial volume.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first prove that given a Fuchsian representation $\rho_\circ: \pi_1S \ra {\rm PSL}(2,\R)$, where $S$ is a closed oriented surface of genus $\geq 2$, any hyperbolic cone-metric on $S$ with cone-angles $&gt;2\pi$ isometrically embeds as a future-convex bent Cauchy surface in a globally hyperbolic maximal Cauchy compact (GHMC) anti-de Sitter (2+1)-spacetime whose left representation is $\rho_\circ$. Second, we show that given any two such cone-metrics, there exists a GHMC anti-de Sitter (2+1)-spacetime in which the cone-metrics embed simultaneously, one as a future-convex bent Cauchy surface and one as a past-convex. Furthermore, in both cases we establish that such a spacetime and embeddings are unique provided that the cone-metrics are sufficiently small.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Noncommutative Carrollian Geometry via Lie-Rinehart Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carrollian manifolds offer an intrinsic geometric framework for the physics in the ultra-relativistic limit. The recently introduced Carrollian Lie algebroids are generalised to the setting of $\rho$-commutative geometry, (also known as almost commutative geometry), where the underlying algebras commute up to a numerical factor. Via $\rho$-Lie-Rinehart pairs, it is shown that the foundational tenets of Carrollian geometry have analogous statements in the almost commutative world. We explicitly build two toy examples: we equip the extended quantum plane and the noncommutative $2$-torus with Carrollian structures. This opens up the rigorous study of noncommutative Carrollian geometry via almost commutative geometry.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Geometric Deformations of Function Algebras on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for deforming the algebra of smooth functions on a compact Riemannian manifold based on spectral data rather than group actions or Poisson structures. The deformation is defined through spectral coefficients of the Laplacian and a weight function satisfying a fusion-type cocycle condition, producing a noncommutative product that depends intrinsically on Laplacian spectrum of the manifold. We develop the analytic and algebraic foundations of this construction, establishing associativity, continuity, and the existence of a group structure on admissible weights. We show that the construction is functorial with respect to spectrum-preserving maps of manifolds. This spectral-geometric deformation quantization approach provides a fully intrinsic analytic model of noncommutative geometry based solely on spectral data of the manifold.</description>
