      <title>Local presentability and monadicity of forgetful functors for operator algebraic categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work of Lindenhovius and Zamdzhiev, it was established that the category of complete operator spaces, with completely contractive linear maps as morphisms, is locally countably presentable. In this work, we extend their conclusion to the non-complete setting and prove that the categories of operator systems, (Archimedean) order unit spaces, and unital operator algebras are all locally countably presentable as well. This is established through an analysis of forgetful functors and the identification of Eilenberg-Moore categories. We provide a complete understanding of adjunction and monadicity for forgetful functors between these categories, together with the categories of $C^*$-algebras, Banach spaces, and normed spaces. In addition, for various subcategories of function-theoretic objects, we investigate completeness and local presentability through Kadison's duality theorem.</description>

      <title>A pair of monads in Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the article \cite{Sim}, H. Simmons describes two monads of interests arising from the dual adjunction between the category of topological spaces and that of (bounded) distributive lattices. These are the open prime filter monad and the ideal lattice monad. It is known that the ideal lattice monad induces the ideal frame comonad on the category of frames. We show that this ideal frame comonad can be paired with the open prime filter monad via the open set-spectrum adjunction. From this, we give a new proof of the equivalence between the category of stably compact spaces and that of stably compact frames on one hand, and that of compact Hausdorff spaces and compact regular frames on the other. We show, among other things, how the \v{C}ech-Stone compactification in Pointfree Topology and Pointset Topology relate each other in this particular context.</description>

      <title>Categorical Lyapunov Theory I: Stability of Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lyapunov's theorem provides a fundamental characterization of the stability of dynamical systems. This paper presents a categorical framework for Lyapunov theory, generalizing stability analysis with Lyapunov functions categorically. Core to our approach is the set of axioms underlying a setting for stability, which give the necessary ingredients for ``doing Lyapunov theory'' in a category of interest. With these minimal assumptions, we define the stability of equilibria, formulate Lyapunov morphisms, and demonstrate that the existence of Lyapunov morphisms is necessary and sufficient for establishing the stability of flows. To illustrate these constructions, we show how classical notions of stability, e.g., for continuous and discrete time dynamical systems, are captured by this categorical framework for Lyapunov theory. Finally, to demonstrate the extensibility of our framework, we illustrate how enriched categories, e.g., Lawvere metric spaces, yield settings for stability enabling one to ``do Lyapunov theory'' in enriched categories.</description>
